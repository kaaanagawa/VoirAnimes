00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.620
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.600
The first stage of the Royal Knights 
Selection Exam continues to heat up!

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.470
Asta and the others from B Team...

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.600
Magna and the others from C Team...

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.940
Finral and the others from E Team...

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.280
Langris and the others from G Team...

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.190
All these teams were victorious 
and made it into stage two.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.110
In the end, you'll never be more than 
a means of transportation, Brother.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.270
In our upcoming match, be careful not to 
get in the way of my spatial magic, okay?

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.470
I can't guarantee that you 
won't lose something.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.130
If that were to happen, 
Mother and Father aside,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.390
I'm sure she'd be sad.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.270
You're right.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.380
So to ensure that doesn't happen,
 I'm going to win!

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.050
Mage X

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.370
Aw, man... I finally said it.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.620
I'm going to win!

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.630
How insolent of you, Brother.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.640
I wasn't trying to make him angry, but...

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.260
We will now begin round five!

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.760
Finally!

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.770
Hurry it up already.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.770
I Team and J Team, come forth.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.480
Hello.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.770
I hope you take it easy on us.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.690
Likewise.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.180
Pleasure.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.780
We're going to do our best.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.760
Roland, Wainsley, Nix...

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.620
Nils, Ruben...

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.170
And "Times"? What a strange name.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.860
I believe it's just "X," Asta.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.710
X?!

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.550
What a strange name.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.980
I wonder if they entered anonymously.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.380
Um, pardon me...

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.550
Yes?

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.440
Who's this "X" that's on our team?

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.140
We can't seem to find them anywhere.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.220
Huh?

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.520
Hurry it up. If you can't find your other 
member soon, I'm going to disqualify you.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.670
Um... X! X!

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.320
If you're here, please come over immediately!

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.340
X!

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.070
Wh-Who the hell's that guy?!

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.300
I'm X!

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.680
The Captain of the Aqua Deer
Rill Boismortier

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.810
Hello! It's me, Rill Boismortier!

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.680
Are you all surprised?

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.470
The Captain of the Aqua Deer, Rill?!

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.810
Why, though?

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.330
The guy who uses paint 
and picture magic?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.620
Why's a captain participating?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.610
You can't be serious!

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.030
Huh? Wait... Were captains 
not supposed to enter?!

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.280
Not true! We're glad to have you!

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.040
Yes! I get to see Rill's cool magic again.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.790
Hurry up and start, if you're all here.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.530
There's no need to be afraid, everyone.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.840
This is your chance to defeat a captain 
and make a name for yourselves.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.350
True!

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.180
With the rules of this game, 
we actually have a fighting chance!

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.690
The Aqua Deer were dead 
last in the previous term,

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.150
so I'm here to rebuild our reputation!

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.810
I'm not going to be taken down so easily.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.400
What enthusiasm!

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.980
I am deeply moved, Young Master Rill!

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.070
A super-fast old guy just 
popped outta nowhere!

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.080
The Butler of the Boismortier Family
Walter

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.080
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask that you 
take good care of Master Rill today.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.700
You're always so dramatic.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.960
Oh, hey, Asta!

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.080
I look forward to today!

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.890
Yeah! Let's both do our best!

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.280
B-But he's a captain!

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.170
Are you two friends?

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.620
This old guy's scary!

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.790
You must be Master Rill's 
trustworthy friend, Master Asta.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.020
I've heard all about you.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.110
Where'd that come from?! 
That was super smooth!

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.330
Thank you for being good 
friends with Master Rill.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.620
I am Walter, Master Rill's butler.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.290
Please, do have some tea.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.750
Th-Thank you very much.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.920
Th-This is...

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.340
Asta?

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.380
It's so classy that I can't 
even understand the taste!

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.520
Moron.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.990
Just imagine... 
Master Rill having a friend.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.600
This would've been unfathomable before.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.230
Really? I guess I'm not that surprised.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.570
I do apologize. I've been moved to tears.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.000
Oh, come on, Walter!

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.730
Stop bringing up the past! It's embarrassing.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.050
Oh, I do beg your pardon.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.030
We're going to begin, finally!

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.030
All right! I'm going to paint 
the best picture ever!

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.290
What the heck does he mean by that?

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.420
Round five of stage one!

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.420
I Team: Rill, Nils, and Ruben 
versus J Team: Wainsley, Roland, and Nix.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.420
Roland

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.420
Nix

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.420
Wainsley

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.420
J Team

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.420
Nils   Rill   Ruben

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.420
I Team

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.120
The Captain of the Aqua Deer...

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.640
I wonder how powerful he is.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.430
Young master...

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.100
Begin!

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.660
U-Um... Captain Rill...

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.260
The match has started.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.290
Isn't the sky beautiful?

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.350
Huh?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.580
I wonder if I could get that 
color if I used lapis lazuli.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.810
Did you know? You can grind up 
precious stone and create blue paint.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.980
Right...

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.750
For the white clouds, I'll use whitewash.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.170
Oh, whitewash is paint made from seashells.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.350
Fighting under such a beautiful sky
 is the absolute best.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.100
All right, let's do this, you two!

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.600
Let's create a beautiful piece 
on this canvas known as the battlefield.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.880
Stay close!

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.860
Here we go!

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.280
C-Captain Rill...

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.380
He dashed off on his own, but...

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.710
I got captured!

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.970
Hey... What the heck are you doing, Rill?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.510
He's a captain... right?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.510
Someone save me!

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.970
He basically jumped right 
into the enemy's trap.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.720
Well, this looks like it's 
going to be over immediately.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.660
He easily fell for that trap spell.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.690
Is it really okay for us to defeat him? 
Isn't he the captain of the Aqua Deer?

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.120
No, a match is a match.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.610
We're going to give it our all and fight, 
no matter who the enemy might be!

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.790
Yes.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.990
You're right.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.770
Here we go!

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.090
Plant Reinforcement Magic: Magic Pollen!

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.260
Go!

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.950
Flame Magic:

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.260
Flame Spike!

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.760
Ice Magic: Icicle Bridge!

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.770
We're going to take down the 
Captain of the Aqua Deer!

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.830
Oh... What decisive and beautiful magic.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:00.700
The battlefield... 
This canvas really is great.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.450
I feel the urge to create, Walter!

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.790
4 Years Ago

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.130
It's happened again.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.710
I wonder how many times 
it's been just today.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.100
Ever since the young master from the House 
of Boismortier received his grimoire,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.650
he's shut himself up in his room 
and let his magic go berserk.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.900
He's always been a bit strange, but now,
it's as though he's possessed.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:35.910
On top of that, he has a tremendous amount 
of magic, so no one's been able to stop him.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.660
The master is quite troubled.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.950
How did he end up like this?

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.460
Madam, please stay strong.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:54.490
He won't listen to a word I say. 
He just keeps drawing and painting.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.350
That boy...

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.980
That boy is beyond human understanding.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.350
He's a monster!

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:10.980
No...

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.980
It's all wrong, wrong, 
wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.590
This isn't it.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.740
This isn't the picture that I want to draw.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.370
It has to be more... more...

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.300
Please don't draw anymore, Rill!

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.380
Why do you keep doing this?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.880
I should've... I should've...

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.300
never given birth to you!

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.890
You don't understand a thing about my art.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.840
You don't understand at all!

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.370
Young master, may I have 
a moment of your time?

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.070
Shut up, Walter! Go away!

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.430
Young master...

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.710
Stay back!

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.510
I can't draw or paint the way 
that I want. It's not fun!

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.840
It's boring!

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.930
I told you to stay back!

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.820
None of you understand my pain.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.570
Not you, not Mother... No one!

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.450
None of you understand m—

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:20.770
You finally see me, Young Master Rill.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.260
Walter...

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.250
Does your cheek hurt?

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.070
Huh?

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.290
When people are wounded, they feel pain.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.770
That's why they're scared of getting hurt.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.160
They're afraid of what they don't understand.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.080
They don't want to go near it.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.590
If you wish to be understood, 
then please try to understand others.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.010
You went through a lot of 
trouble over these pictures.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.590
You want others to see them, don't you?

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:58.300
That said, your talent is too great for 
such a small canvas, Young Master Rill.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.620
It's far too great.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.450
It will be difficult for the people 
around you to understand it.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.700
But that's what having such 
prodigious talent is like.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.770
There is a canvas on which you can display 
your magic to its fullest potential.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.210
Huh? What's that?

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.580
The Magic Knights.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.510
The Magic Knights?

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.270
Yes. Why not try to join?

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.380
With your talent, I'm sure 
you'll get in immediately.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:35.820
And there, you can draw 
upon an endless canvas!

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.140
You'll be able to draw 
the ultimate masterpiece.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.230
The ultimate masterpiece?

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.770
Yes.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.240
Okay, I will. I'll join the Magic Knights.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.370
I'm sorry, Walter. Are you okay?

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.290
Oh, 'tis nothing but a scratch.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.100
Are you sure you don't want to say goodbye?

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.560
Yup. I don't feel lonely.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.860
She's always smiling 
within my heart's canvas.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.070
Indeed.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.080
Okay, let's go to the royal capital!

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.120
To the Magic Knights Entrance Exam!

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.380
I'm sorry, Rill.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.060
Have a safe journey.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:03.150
You let your talent blossom 
after joining the Magic Knights

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.540
and became the youngest captain in history.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.730
You are the pride of the 
House of Boismortier.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.450
Yeah... This canvas is the best.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:20.070
I want to show Walter
the ultimate picture first.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.810
After all, Walter is the 
one who made me human.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.210
The young master's picture magic...
 Its ability...

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:35.720
Picture Magic: Twin Storms of Fire and Water!

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.970
...is to recreate every magical attribute!

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.320
He attacked them with the attributes 
they're weakest against at the same time!

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.580
The stronger the opponent, 
the greater his urge to create!

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.580
The young master's
imagination knows no bounds!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.340
Excellent work, young master!

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.180
What?

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.830
You guys were pretty good.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.930
But I haven't quite managed 
the ultimate painting yet.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.150
Hup! Thanks.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.070
Oh, it was nothing. 
You're amazing, Captain Rill.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.780
That was an intense attack.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.340
Sandstone Magic: Rock Storm!

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.510
The crystal has been destroyed.
 I Team wins!

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.350
Well done, well done.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.350
I guess that was all right.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.590
We somehow managed to make 
it through the first stage.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.330
Yeah... But what's he doing?

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.100
I could've gone a little crazier over there.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.980
But the cobalt blue really stands out here.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.870
I've still got a ways to go.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.380
Um... Could you concentrate on the match?

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.590
We're going to have to keep it together.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.070
He's rather irresponsible despite 
being a Grand Magic Knight,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.210
so he has those around him work hard.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.620
That's the young master's true talent!

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.010
What the hell is that?!

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.260
Next, we will begin round six of stage one.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.400
K Team and L Team, step forward.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.400
It's our turn.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.860
Let's go, Captain Rill.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.420
We have to get on with the 
next match, so please move!

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.230
Of course. We're terribly sorry.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.200
We'll move him right away.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.650
Huh?

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.750
Wait, what?

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.390
Let go! I need to look at it longer!

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.750
Come on!

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.500
Are you done? Are you done now?

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.340
Yeah! You're up next, Luck! 
I'll be cheering you on.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.520
Don't you dare lose.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.250
Yup, thanks!

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.350
It's finally our turn! I can't wait!

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.930
Luck Voltia...

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.600
This is a match that will decide 
who will be among the Royal Knights.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.110
You need to take this more seriously.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.530
I am the leader. Make sure you 
don't go running off on your own.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.080
Aw, don't be so serious. Let's have some fun!

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.900
Oh, shut up!

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.990
So these are my teammates.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.870
A crazy boy and a quiet, 
straitlaced four-eyes.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.490
This can't be good!

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.250
Honestly... Is this team going to be okay?

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.020
Welp, there's no point in worrying about it!

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.510
Let's give it our all!

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.780
What?

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.720
Who the heck are you?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.230
I'm your teammate.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:14.100
The Blue Rose Knights 4th Class Senior Magic Knight
Puli Angel

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.310
I'm Puli. Puli Angel.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.100
As my name and appearance suggest,
 I'm an angel!

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.840
Oh, I see. Nice to meet you.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.210
Let's hit 'em with our best performances!

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.360
Yeah!

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.800
Wh-What's with this chipper person?

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.850
This is just...

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.370
I have to remain the responsible one.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.340
You've got this, Klaus!

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.070
Please do your best. I know 
you can do it if you try.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.420
I won't consider you my senior if you lose.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.250
I see that you're as insolent as ever.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.590
Just sit back and watch my battle.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.320
Hey, let's come up with a plan.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.390
Indeed.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.390
The one we have to watch out 
for the most in this match

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.220
is their wind magic user, who's said to 
be the most mobile member of his squad.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:56.260
A 2nd Class Senior Magic Knight from 
the Silver Eagles, Rob Vitesse.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.110
And now, for the sixth round of stage one!

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:06.110
K Team: Puli, Klaus, and Luck 
versus L Team: Rob, Francis, and Winston.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:06.110

Klaus

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:06.110
Luck

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:06.110
K Team

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.540
And... begin!

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.350
Petit Clover

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.590
Petit Clover!

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.850
Wrong!

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.990
Wrong!

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.350
No...

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.360
It's all wrong, wrong, 
wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.010
This isn't it.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.370
This isn't the picture that I want to draw.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.700
It has to be more... more...

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.210
I want to draw something more beautiful.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.460
You have a problem with me?

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.890
Something beautiful...

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.720
He's beautiful—wait...

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.940
I want you to disappear so badly.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.090
Honestly, you can't be serious.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.940
I am the butler of the Captain of 
the Aqua Deer, Rill Boismortier.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.650
You've grown so much, young master.
