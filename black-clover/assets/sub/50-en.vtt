00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.080
Despair...

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.940
You've lost!

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.820
Asta mustered up everything he had 
and used it on this blow to Vetto.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.780
How do you like that, you bastard?!

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.850
But the battle wasn't over yet!

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.050
I'm taking you all down with me... No...

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.210
I'll blow this whole temple to smithereens!

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.880
And then...

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.300
Right, consider it brought.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.220
Hey, you dumbasses. You good?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.390
Captain Yami!

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.560
Accepting all the feelings of 
Asta and the other members,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.320
Yami dealt a fatal blow.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.690
It doesn't matter how strong your magic is!

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.580
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.710
Consider that my thanks for 
looking after my squad.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.920
See ya, Mister Despair.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.260
Stay there and watch for a while.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.640
You're going to be my main dish...

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.780
After I season you with despair, 
as you watch all of your friends die!

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.390
I dealt with you in the end.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.780
Hopefully, you can pass on now.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.030
Sorry, but I didn't despair at all, either.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.890
We're being led far away

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:40.200
Until we shatter the road 
between light and darkness

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.720
Yo Guess who's back

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.390
Everybody get down

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.390
Guess who's back

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.020
Hey step up step up!

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.650
End of the Battle,
End of Despair

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.260
I'm falling down because of a twist of fate

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.410
The harmony we had is in the past

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.950
Still left behind

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.420
The scent of you is stuck in my head

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.250
Can't shake it

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.550
Waiting just isn't enough anymore, Yai yah!

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.380
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.590
As I hold on to my wish

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.570
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.810
The roulette points to tomorrow

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.850
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.190
Let the light shine

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.140
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.240
In the dark maze

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.570
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.410
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.520
Until we seize the hope in front of us

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.700
Heave ho... Heave ho...

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.800
Hang in there! We're going to 
take you right to the hospital!

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.270
There...

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.560
Bah-ha... Bah-ha?

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.200
That monster's presence... vah-hanished?

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.620
Captain Yami!

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.790
Hey!

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.040
I-I didn't ask for your help.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.160
But I guess you saved us.
You should've shown up sooner.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.460
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.680
Oh, Captain! I've fallen 
for you all over again!

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.350
You're invincible! Absolutely amazing!

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.610
Now, drink up.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.380
Maybe later.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.860
I thought I was going to die... 
I saw my life flash before my eyes...

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.740
You were surprisingly useful for once.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.650
Yes, surprisingly!

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.170
Y-You were amazing, Captain!

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.290
I'm so embarrassed!

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.290
Who were you again?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.370
La! You were amazing!

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.750
Well, aren't you guys fluffy?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.870
Captain.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.850
We're done here, so can I go see Marie now?

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.380
Take the hint. You're supposed
to praise me right now.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.800
You're so awesome, Captain Yami!

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.880
It only took one hit!

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.090
You're just so...

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.140
You're annoying me!

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.060
Yeesh...

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.820
Gramps.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.700
Sir Yami Sukehiro... 
And members of the Black Bulls.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.620
Congratulations on defeating the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun team

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.660
and beating the game!

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.830
And...

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.320
Thank you from the bottom of my heart 
for saving our Underwater Temple!

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.630
Thank you! Thank you!

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.130
Please allow me, as the high priest,
to grant your wish!

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.250
Sure. So just as we promised,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.740
we'll be taking the magic stone that 
you have here at the Underwater Temple.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.270
Come on, hand it over.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.140
What's the magic stone?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.730
Huh?

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.150
Hey, Gramps, I thought you
 knew about the magic stone.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.650
You guys are after the 
magic stone, aren't you?

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.590
If you want it, why don't 
we play a little game?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.030
That's what you said, remember?

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.590
Uh... I just heard you guys talking 
about how you were looking

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.350
for something called a "magic stone."

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.320
It's a "magic stone," so I assume it's a stone...

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.810
What kind of stone is it? What does it do?

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.400
You old bastard...

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down! Calm down!

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.280
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.550
It's been so long!

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.060
I haven't felt this pain 
since Saussy Village!

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.500
Hey, Nero. I wondered 
where you'd gone off to.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.560
I guess you were looking 
for the magic stone for us!

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.810
Good job!

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.250
Ah, so that's the magic stone...

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.240
If that's all you want, 
sure, go ahead and take it.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.510
No need to hold back.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.800
Why would we hold back?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.200
All right, we'll be taking it.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.940
This concludes our mission.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.000
All of you...

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.630
Well done.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.540
Yes, sir!

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.050
The moment I relaxed, all my strength just...

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.070
Asta!

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.340
I'm all out of magic, too.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.420
Me, too.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.870
Same.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.870
Me, too.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.330
I'm starving...

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.930
Oh, this won't do!

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.740
Let's tend to your wounds and help
you recover your magic and stamina.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.960
To think that Vetto was actually defeated.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:10.170
I won't forgive them. I will never 
forgive those who make Licht sad.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.720
We must take back the magic stone...

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.910
so that we can fulfill our dream as
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.810
Damn it. I can't believe we have to 
wait for Finral's magic to recover

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.740
before we can go back to the surface.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.550
You're so friggin' useless.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.110
Again, I have seniority.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.640
So, Grey... It turns out 
you're a super cute girl.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.720
I-I'm so embarrassed! 
Please don't look at me!

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.380
If your eyes get any pervier, 
I'm going to sew them shut, Pervy Finral.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.230
What?!

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.040
And Grey, if you're that embarrassed,
you're never going to make it in the world.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.310
And you should be a little 
more humble, you witch floozy!

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.290
Oh? Are you embarrassed, virgin delinquent?

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.990
Who you callin' a delinquent?!

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.570
I can't wait to fight again.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.410
I'm so hungry, I can't even move.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.910
Why the hell is it that you're just hungry?!

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.330
I wonder if that's yummy...

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.460
What really matters here

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.710
is that we got our asses kicked, so I didn't 
get to look cool at all, damn it!

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.340
Nothing we can do about that. 
This was the full extent of our abilities.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.490
La? Is there a banquet?

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.180
Thank you, Black Bulls!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.810
You guys were amazing!

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.330
You're the saviors of the Underwater Temple!

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.240
You guys were so cool!

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.360
We, the absolute worst 
Magic Knights squad in history,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.460
are being thanked by people.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.950
Yeah, isn't it great?
I wanna get even stronger!

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.850
Then I'll get even stronger than you!

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.510
I want to see Marie more.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.800
I wish I wasn't so easily embarrassed.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.250
That girl's hot! That one's great, too!

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.230
Sounds like you're all better.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.940
Being thanked by others is pretty nice.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
I'm so sorry, Kahono.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.620
You're my friend, but I 
couldn't protect your voice.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.520
I'm so sorry.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.600
What are you talking about, Noelle?

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.300
Thank you for protecting my home.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.100
Huh?

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.830
Your magic was amazing!

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.640
It's because you helped 
me with my training.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.950
Yeah, I know. You'd better be grateful.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.940
Also!

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.700
I haven't given up on my dream.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.610
So that I can go sing up on the surface again...

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.620
I'll make sure this heals.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.790
So when I'm an idol someday,
you'd better come and hear me sing,

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.070
Noelle.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.090
Kahono...

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.510
Yeah! I'll definitely go, so you'd better 
save me the best seat in the house!

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.010
Promise!

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.880
I promise.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:07.030
Oh, you should probably get 
some rest. I'll come by again.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.030
Sure. Thanks for coming to see us.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.470
Okay, see you later.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.340
You were awake, Kiato? What's wrong?

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.060
You look goofier than usual.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.710
Such beautiful tears... 
And such a beautiful smile...

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.140
That must be the sea goddess 
everyone was talking about.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.700
I'm in love!

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.450
Okay... I'm going to get my leg healed up fast!

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.940
I have to dance the courtship dance for her!

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.760
You have to introduce me to her later!

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.110
Help me win her over, will ya?

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.340
All right! I'm starting to feel better!

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.760
I'm pretty sure Noelle's unavailable, though.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.750
Wh-Whoa!

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.760
We ended up getting the magic stone, 
but so much happened that we didn't expect.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.350
Hey! Where are you going?

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.390
Wait up! Stop wandering off like that!

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.310
Jeez... Don't blame me if you get lost.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.730
What?

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.350
What's up, kid?

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.840
Wow, you're amazing, Captain Yami!

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.090
You must've sensed my ki.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.450
I asked you what's up, didn't I?

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.140
Answer my question or I'll send you flying.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.260
What?!

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:56.430
W-Well... Since we're leaving this place 
tomorrow, I wanted go exploring a bit.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.350
So I was wandering here and there.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.640
Just full of energy, aren't you?

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.150
So did you find anything?

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.550
Yep! I found fossilized seashells, almost got
swallowed by a giant sea anemone,

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.170
and got attacked by this insane 
swarm of wharf roaches!

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.350
Gross!

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.490
And then...

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.290
I happened to find these pretty flowers.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.230
I can't forgive these guys.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.110
I don't know what it is,

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.070
but these guys must've had something 
they can't forgive, either.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.990
Something that makes them 
hate humans so much.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.620
Dreams? Bonds?

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.490
People like you have no right 
to talk about such things!

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.960
Now you've done it, human!

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:08.170
Don't think that you have hope just 
because you've banded together, humans!

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:13.210
There is no way that I would 
lose... against you humans!

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.170
I thought that maybe he was feeling 
more despair than anyone else.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.280
You're an idiot, aren't you?

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.440
Huh?

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:35.210
I asked if you were an idiot.
Answer the question or I'll send you flying.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.640
Huh?! Yes! I'm an idiot!

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.120
Idiots don't need to think so hard 
about stuff like that, you idiot.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.510
You just need to keep chasing your dream.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.350
My dream?

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.630
At least for now.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.000
I can't see! And I can't push it back up!

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.770
Captain Yami! Both of my arms are broken!

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.260
Hello? Captain Yami?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.270
Huh?

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.170
Captain Yami!

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.910
For now, I just need to 
keep chasing my dream, huh?

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.140
My dream, no, our dream is...

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.440
Yuno! Look, look!

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.950
I got my own grimoire!

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:33.130
It's insanely shabby, but I'm gonna take 
good care of it for the rest of my life!

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.430
There, there, there, there, there. 
There, there, there, there.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.060
I'll repay you for this someday.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.360
Asta...

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.480
Do you remember our promise?

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.530
So you're gonna become the Wizard King, too?

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.950
That means...

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.070
Yuno, you're...

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.370
Asta, you're...

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.750
...my rival!

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.630
You mean <i>you</i> remember it?

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.300
I thought you were just making fun of me.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.840
I have no interest in being 
too friendly with my rival.

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.050
But you're the one who gave me hope.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.820
Even if you're poor, an orphan...

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.600
or even us...

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:27.150
We can become greater than anyone 
else in this world. And to prove that...

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.360
To make Sister and everyone else happy...

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.370
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.880
Not yet.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.920
Not yet, not even close.
I still lack the strength.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.420
Yuno's still ahead of me!

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.860
The captain's right!

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.890
I just need to chase my dream right now!

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:05.410
I'm gonna hurry up and get my arms 
all healed, get even stronger,

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.770
and I'm definitely gonna 
become the Wizard King!

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.280
Thank you!

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.060
You really were amazing!

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.950
Thanks!

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.240
Munchy, munchy, nom...

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.320
How long are you guys gonna thank us?!

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.620
They sure have a lot of energy.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.350
Too much energy.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.580
What's wrong with that?

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.580
It's nice and merry.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.410
And there are so many cute girls!

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.960
Yum...

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.270
Eat as much as you'd like!

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.260
Well, see ya.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.760
Thanks for everything.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.680
Come back soon. We'll welcome
you with open arms.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.410
Come back, damn it! Capisce?

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.250
I didn't get to look cool at all...

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.010
Even though I'm the strongest 
at the Underwater Temple...

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.870
Charmy, how are the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun guys you caught doing?

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.000
They're yelling something.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.700
They won't be able to escape, 
so we should be fine.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.690
Hey, isn't that a ridiculously 
powerful binding spell?

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.700
Is it?

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.610
Kiato! Kahono!

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.340
Don't give up on your dreams!

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.920
I'm sure there's magic that 
can heal your leg and throat!

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.010
I'll do my best to fix both of my arms, too.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.430
I'll be dancing on this 
leg again in no time!

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.530
Asta, thank you.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.820
I won't give up, no matter what!

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.710
Okay. Let's go.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.950
Got it!

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.500
Good grief. I can finally go see Marie.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.860
Th-Thank you for everything!

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.350
See you!

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.000
Bye-bye!

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.360
See ya!

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.200
Thanks for the yummy meals!

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.490
See ya!

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.760
Come visit sometime!

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.350
Thank you!

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.350
4 AM in the morning

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.740
Why can't I sleep?

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.150
On such a bad day, whispering 
"Bye Bye Black Birds"

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.350
Won't make my anxiety go away

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.530
for hours, lately

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.160
I've been crying for hours Baby

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.120
I wish you were here

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.170
All those letters that you gave to me

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:05.590
Every time I read them again, the pain's gone

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:11.350
We're not alone, cause we're perfect as four

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:17.640
Even though we're far apart, 
we're connected, believing you

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.830
I always feel you next to me

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.700
closer to me and a "clover" for you

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.400
I wish you the best of luck

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:36.180
You know you're not alone, 
cause we're perfect as four

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:42.170
Even though we're far apart, 
we're connected, you live in me

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:48.300
I'll always be by your side

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.330
closer to me and a "clover" for you

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.820
I wish you the best of luck

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:03.270
Petit Clover

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.310
Petit Clover!

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.780
Bah-ha Forever!

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.780
Bah-ha Forever!

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:14.410
So I worked really hard saving all 
the Magic Knights on Raquey Beach.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.890
Surprisingly true

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.250
Bah-ha!

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.780
I even got a star from the Wizard King!

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.930
I just don't know what to do with myself.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:24.110
Amazingly, also true

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.590
I'm not even that amazing.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.070
This, of course, is also true

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.800
Captain Jack was moved to tears!

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.950
This is a lie

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.870
Bah-ha!

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.180
I think I may be a bit drunk...

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.290
on myself!

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.890
You better not let your guard down 
just because one mission's over!

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.440
The next one's coming right up!

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.820
What?! I have to stay behind at the base?!

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.810

Proof of Rightness

I have is my magic!
