00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.680
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.180
Well, this isn't good at all.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.520
You're going to make an old man get serious.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.710
Smoke Creation Magic: 
Prison of the Fallen King.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.610
You won't be able to get away anymore, kids.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.150
No matter who we're facing,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.160
we, the Black Bulls, will win!

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.080
I'm going to get serious now.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.200
What are you...

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.210
Wind Creation Magic: Swift White Hawk
and Wind Blade Shower.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.380
Simultaneous spell activation?!

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.260
It will be the Golden Dawn that 
reaches the treasure chamber first!

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.850
Take that!

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.660
I'm getting dizzy...

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.410
The smoke just keeps getting thicker.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.700
At this rate, we're going to suffocate.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.080
This isn't good. We have to 
hurry up and defeat that mage.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.430
I can pretty much tell 
where he is with my magic,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.410
but he'll probably dodge, even if I attack.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.340
Thinking back on our battle so far,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.270
he's able to travel at high 
speed within the smoke.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.770
And his ability to sense magic is high.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.010
If we're to land a hit on him,
we'll have to surprise him.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.820
But how do we do that without 
him noticing our magic?

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.290
Because I can sense your magic just fine.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.870
Whoa, there!

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.290
Wow, a barrage. Are you getting desperate?

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.210
That's not going to hit me

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.840
or get rid of the smoke.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.880
I think the difference in our 
experience levels is starting to show.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.350
After all, I've fought far 
more mages than you have.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.140
It went well.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.900
I guess teamwork really is important.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.810
I would always close my eyes

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.010
And cower at reality

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.770
I can't stand the idea

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.110
Of just making excuses to give up

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.230
Stand right there

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.320
I don't want to be near you

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.500
Any minute now

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.880
Just wait right there

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.880
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.200
Black and blue

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.990
I'll give up on giving up

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.410
And get the world on my side

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.760
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.090
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.400
And head where the light shines

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.230
I want to keep my promise

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.050
I'll deliver it to you

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.820
shape of love

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.500
Destroyer

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.870
Ow...

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.890
How could you do that to a 
defenseless old man like me?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.970
Man... It's definitely broken.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.060
Pretty sure he got some of my ribs, too.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.980
I won't be able to fight anymore.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.330
There sure are some oddballs 
in the Clover Kingdom.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.580
A boy with no magic 
who wields a giant sword...

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.610
I can safely say that even I've never met 
someone with no magic on the battlefield.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.470
If I'm going to end up a prisoner...

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:27.910
I'll di—

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.480
Or just run away.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.970
Hey!

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.410
Wait!

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.870
You're not getting away!

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.840
Smoke Creation Magic: Hustling Lazy Car.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.090
Caught up with you!

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.810
Aw...

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.060
Damn it! We lost him!

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.820
You two...

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.250
are way too fast.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.830
I wanted to finish him off,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.360
but I know we have more 
important things to do.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.250
We need to hurry to the treasure chamber.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.830
You really have the nerve to say that?

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.340
Oh, yeah! Let's get going!

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.290
What is this magic?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.100
It looks like there's someone 
even stronger here.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.640
Are you all okay?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.580
I guess the treasure chamber is 
the least of our worries right now.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.590
Ow...

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.950
Well, I'm pretty sure Mars 
will take care of the rest.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.990
I mean...

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.500
Diamond Kingdom Mage Warrior
<font size="30">Mars</c>

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.500
He's the Diamond Kingdom's 
secret weapon, after all.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.620
Such ominous magic...

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.800
Yuno's at full strength, 
and even he stands no chance...

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.110
Those stones embedded in his forehead...

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.810
I've heard of them before.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.470
There's a rumor that the Diamond 
Kingdom is raising mage warriors

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.210
with artificially amplified magic.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.210
They choose young children 
with powerful magical abilities,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.240
put them in fierce competition 
with each other,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.720
embed magical items that amplify 
their powers into their bodies...

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.600
And finally, they have them 
fight one another to the death.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.610
The last survivor of that death match...

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.270
is him?

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.890
No matter who the opponent is... 
Is this really acceptable?

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.140
What is happening here?

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.150
I'm a noble!

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.130
A member of the Golden Dawn!

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.530
I let my comrade get hurt so easily.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.130
I'm being protected by my 
subordinate, who's a peasant.

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:39.990
This...

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.240
This cannot be right!

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.630
Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.670
Klaus!

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.600
Wha—

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.320
A mineral clone?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.560
Klaus!

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.860
Your magic has no effect on me.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.430
It's no use.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.000
I told you, it's no use.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.050
It's no use.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.430
Let's stop this training,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.560
Asta.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.140
Not yet!

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.640
I'm not quitting until I hit you!

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.110
Oh, no!

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.560
Asta.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.910
Not...

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.910
Not yet!

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.910
Let's stop.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.910
No!

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.660
I'm never...

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.460
...going to give up!

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.580
Stop your useless attempts—

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.670
I won't!

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.930
Move.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.680
I won't move!

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.930
Give up.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.710
I won't give up!

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.200
Yuno!

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.890
Hey, pale guy.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.760
Hands off!

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.310
Yuno's my...

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.820
rival!

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.240
Yuno!

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.710
Hey, pale guy.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.750
Hands off!

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.190
Yuno's my...

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.700
rival!

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:33.270
Unbelievable... and I thought 
I finally repaid my debt to you.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.710
I finally catch up with you, and look at you!
What the hell are you doing, Yuno?! Damn it!

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.460
Who said you could get your ass kicked?

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.450
Why'd you get in my way?

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.550
I almost had him.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.970
Liar! You're all beat up!

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.060
You were about to die!

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.960
I was just about to unleash 
a ferocious counterattack.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.640
You're such a liar!

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.170
I was about to do it.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.610
You're always like this!

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.880
Did you come to get in my way?

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.410
What?!

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.750
You can go home now.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.410
Fine, then.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.910
Let's see who can take this guy down first!

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.480
Wh-What's going on?

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.760
We, the Golden Dawn, didn't stand a 
chance against his magic, and yet...

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.450
That peasant from the Black Bulls...

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.210
Oh, no!

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.200
Weak.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.150
He's...

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.630
The one who made trouble at 
the Entrance Exam by beating

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.520
his opponent far worse than necessary!

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.010
Luck the Cheery Berserker!

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.490
This was the other member of 
the Black Bulls that was here?

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.990
How could I end up being 
saved by the Black Bulls?!

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.900
Mimosa!

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.960
Well, this is embarrassing...

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:09.380
Just as you said, I'm a bit slow.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.700
Yes.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.240
You've always been like that.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.040
That's why...

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.770
I'm going to protect you.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.730
Noelle...

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.780
Are you the one who beat up the Golden Dawn?

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.530
What if I am?

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.660
The weak will perish,
 and only the strong will remain.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.510
That's all that matters.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.090
He summoned so many at once!

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:49.090
There is no reason for the weak 
to stand on the battlefield.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.090
I was born to break people like you.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.100
Oh, really?

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.250
Then go ahead...

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.520
and try to break me!

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.110
I intend to.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.290
He's so strong!

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.300
Aw, man...

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.750
I wanted to be the one to fight him!

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.810
Impossible...

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.870
How could a peasant that I can't feel 
a shred of mana from do all this?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.280
All you've been doing is whining.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.110
Negating magic...

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.540
That's Asta's power.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.540
Negating magic?

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.550
How can he have a power
so unfit for a peasant?!

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.800
So he just got lucky and 
ended up with this power.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.790
Just watch him, and you'll 
find out if it's just luck or not.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.890
Hey, come on! Are you 
finished already, you jerk?

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.810
Asta!

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.330
What...

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.020
are you?

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.590
I'm someone who was born without any magic!

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.800
He doesn't have any magic?!

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.170
So it really was just luck—

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.300
But even so, I'm going to 
become the Wizard King!

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.100
And I'm alive...

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.460
to prove that!

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.490
What is going on with his body? 
How much has he trained?!

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.110
The Wizard King? Does he truly...

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.820
Mars!

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.770
What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.000
I'm...

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.380
I'm just going to destroy everything!

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.630
Destroy everything?

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.480
The Wizard King protects everyone!

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.640
We were born to protect 
everyone in this country.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.890
Like hell I'm going to lose 
to someone like you!

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.230
You're in my way...

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.740
Begone, pebble!

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.490
I may be just a pebble,

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.990
but I'm...

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.330
a pebble that shatters diamonds!

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.260
See?

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.820
If you don't give up,
you'll get there eventually!

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:02.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.570
And push me forward

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.630
(I can't find a place to go)

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:12.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:18.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.650
(Break free yourself)

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:37.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:54.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.280
Petit Clover

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.580
Petit Clover!

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.790
Treasure Chamber

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.910
Treasure Chamber.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.700
Ooh! So this is the treasure chamber!

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.790
I wonder if there's any 
treasure worthy of me.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.300
Let's just randomly open 
stuff up and see what's inside!

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.410
Hey, no fair doing it all yourself!

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.300
Open sesame—

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.460
It's no treasure chamber.
It's an organ chamber.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.500
This isn't my fault.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.990
This old man's exhausted.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.360
I don't know how much more abuse 
I can take from home and work.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.550

Page 18
Memories of You

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.610
Leaving the rest to the young'uns 
is this old man's magic.
