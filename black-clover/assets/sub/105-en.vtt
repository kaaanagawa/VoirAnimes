00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.810
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.640
The Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout 
was heading toward the royal capital.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.430
All right, I guess I'll go have some fun.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.780
Luck had reincarnated as an elf and 
was possessed by a thirst for revenge.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.140
He landed in a town on 
the way to the royal capital

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.690
and ruthlessly attacked the humans there.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.280
Hey, now...

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.030
We came to this town because 
it was under attack, but...

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.740
What the hell's going on here,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.830
Luck?!

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.250
Magna and Vanessa rushed to the scene.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.640
Though they were bewildered
by Luck's changed personality,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.420
they still engaged him in battle.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.150
Flame Magic: Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.220
I don't know who the hell you are,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.690
but you don't know a damn 
thing about him or me!

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.400
That's why you have no chance of beating me!

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.730
If that's crystal clear, then hurry up 
and return that idiot to us!

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.530
But that just seemed to 
make him resist even more.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.410
The humans of the Clover Kingdom
 will be destroyed.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.910
That's what you deserve, and that's the 
fate we elves shall bring upon you!

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.040
Magna faced a life-or-death situation!

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.250
And then...

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.130
Like I'm ever...

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.850
going to shut up!

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.100
Who the hell are you?

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.740
We're Luck's friends!

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.680
Smiles, Tears

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.060
There he is.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.320
He's heading straight for me.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.860
I've got him!

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.160
My rage is stronger!

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.770
You're there!

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.710
They used that thread to throw off my timing?

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.420
Go!

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.510
Asta!

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.360
Our feelings are tougher than you!

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.890
All right!

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.110
I'll free you now!

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.340
You're the ones who are going to die, humans!

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.780
Give it up already, damn it!

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.710
We told you! We're not 
letting go, no matter what!

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.000
Don't...

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.800
Don't touch me!

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.180
Huh?

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.610
I thought I could just barely hear 
a voice until a moment ago...

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.110
Wake up, Luck!

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.740
If you don't like it, 
wake up and fight me already!

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.190
I'm never letting you go, 
so hurry up and come back!

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.910
Who is that? What's going on?

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.700
Luck...

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.000
Mom!

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.920
Come over here, Luck.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.920
You're not normal. 
You have to stay by my side.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.470
That's right... The only person 
who could ever love me is my mom.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.570
I live for my mom...

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.730
To make her smile.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.890
I'm going to unleash all my magic! 
Then all of you, this human,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.740
and I will all be done for!

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.850
Disappear! Disappear! Die, humans!

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.660
What the hell is this ki?!

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.910
Is this actually magic?

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.880
Something dark and black is welling up!

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.500
H-Hey, damn it!

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.180
It's just like him...

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.090
At this rate, Luck will become...

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.690
something besides an elf... something evil!

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.940
All of them...

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.950
Everyone precious to me...

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.990
You took them all from me!

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.330
Humans... I will make you pay!

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.120
I don't know what the 
heck you're talking about,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.830
but if we humans really 
are at fault, I'm sorry.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.080
I'm really sorry!

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.090
But for us... Luck is our precious friend!

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.430
So please... Don't take him from us!

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.800
Please!

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.340
Give him back to us!

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.690
And I'm pretty sure all those 
people who are important to you

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.400
wouldn't want you to be like this!

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.020
Luck!

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.410
Mom!

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.930
Luck!

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.690
Luck!

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.090
Luck!

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.380
These voices...

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.630
I'm sorry, Mom. I have to go.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.640
Despite what I am, I found
something important to me.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.150
Mom...

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.430
Thank you for everything.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.040
Starting today, you're one of the Black Bulls.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.930
Get as wild as you want, 
you crazy little shit.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.660
What's kickin', little chicken?

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.420
Aw, who's this little cutie? 
You can think of me as your big sis.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.270
It's a pleasure to meet you, my new friend.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.270
Try this. La? La?

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.920
This is my little sister Marie.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.600
Isn't she an angel? A goddess?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.110
I will allow you to revere her.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.430
I don't care what you think about me!

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:42.870
Think whatever you want! And I'm going 
to think of you as my... as our friend!

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.170
Ugh. Talk about a crazy senior.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.880
But I'm royalty, so I guess I'll forgive you.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.430
The ones who are going to fight in the 
finals aren't you and that Yuno guy!

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.650
It's going to be me and Luck!

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.270
I also...

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.600
I believe that this will become

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.780
a world where our peoples can 
live side by side as friends.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.790
We'll be able to understand each other.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:30.020
I also... wanted to become 
friends with humans like you.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.340
I...

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.950
I'm...

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:05.790
still one of the Black Bulls, right?

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.620
Of course you are, you dumbass.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.230
Magna! Vanessa! Asta!

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.940
Thank you!

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.950
Why?!

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.910
Why? He's obviously trying to hide his 
embarrassment, you virgin delinquent.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.120
Look at you, hugging him like that!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.250
You're such a man's man, Magna!

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.000
You dumb— That's not—
Don't make me clobber you guys!

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.170
Aw, look at you, all embarrassed.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.350
I'm not, damn it!

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.980
You should be more honest with yourself.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.930
Look who's talking!

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.950
But really, thanks, guys.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.930
But I...

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.470
sorta destroyed the town.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.480
That's not exactly anything new.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.810
Are all the people who live here okay?

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.820
I made sure to save them. Don't you worry.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.640
Oh, good. Thanks, Vanessa.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.890
I didn't even have the chance...

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.910
Stupid Magna.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.410
The hell did you just say?!

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.810
Explosive...

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.300
I'm outta magic...

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.560
Anyway, Asta!

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.560
By the way, Asta!

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.410
Yes?!

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.900
What the hell is that sword?!

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.590
Th-This?

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.590
It turned Luck back to normal, didn't it?

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.860
According to Yuno, it, uh, 
it takes magical effects...

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.700
Er, it basically sucks out the spell,

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.600
as if it was never cast, or something...

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.990
What the heck does that mean?

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.060
I'm not really sure, 
and it takes more than one hit,

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.220
but if I have a little bit of time, 
I can undo the reincarnation spell!

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.360
That's awesome!

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.370
But I realized this just a moment ago.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.630
Those elf guys weren't actually 
bad to begin with.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:10.870
Since he disappeared from Luck, though,
does that mean he died again?

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.380
But he was smiling in the end.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.860
That gentle person is who he really was.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.860
I think it's good that you freed him.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.390
The reincarnation spell 
is really scary and sad.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.590
I see... In that case, 
for both the humans and elves...

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.190
I need to save everyone else with this sword!

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:38.990
Yeah!

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.650
Huh? Everyone else?

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.450
A bunch of people who reincarnated as elves
are wreaking havoc all over the kingdom!

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.500
Huh?

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.650
What?! That's an emergency!

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.670
So those lights that went up into 
the sky were the reincarnation...

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.420
There were a lot in the royal capital!

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.780
That giant boulder thing was also 
heading toward the royal capital.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.250
We should go, too. We have to 
protect the Clover Kingdom!

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.830
Yes, but before that, 
we should head back to our base

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.420
and regroup with everyone else.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.220
Yeah!

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.610
Leave that to me!

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.240
My body remembers the feeling of the
mana when that elf kid was with me.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.200
I can get even stronger!

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.830
What?! Then I'm just gonna get even stronger!

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.780
Want me to train you next time, Magna?

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.890
Piss off, you dumbass!

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.220
We're almost back at the base.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:51.810
The base...

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.310
What the hell happened?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.220
Was it attacked by elves?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.810
Asta!

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.120
Wait... Oh, it's just you guys.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.110
The magical beasts that the captain keeps?

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.580
Thank goodness you're safe. 
Say, where are the others?

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.230
Over there?

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.260
Guys!

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.790
Guys!

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.160
Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble...

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.890
I'm so embarrassed!

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.170
They're okay! But they're 
not making any sense!

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.100
And... after... that...

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.010
Who the hell is that?

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.260
Guys! This is no time to 
be mumbling and stuttering!

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.900
A-Asta!

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.390
Luck! Vanessa! Magna!

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.870
I'm so glad you're safe, my dear friends!

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.150
Wow! What the heck happened here?

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.900
And who the hell are you?

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.570
Magna...

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.980
You know who I am?

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.030
Who the hell—

00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:01.670
If... you... get... too... close... 
your... magic... will... get...

00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:00.240
The hell is this?! The little bit of 
mana I have left is being sucked away?!

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.670
Is he an enemy?!

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.490
He's not an enemy, Magna!

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.420
Asta...

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.190
He's one of members who's 
been here the longest!

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.460
He has a weird disease that sucks 
away magic, and he's the owner

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.400
of the Black Bulls' base! It's Henry!

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.220
Huh?

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.270
Owner?

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.390
I don't have any magic, so I'm totally fine.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.860
He'd come visit me all the time.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.690
Though I seriously thought 
he was a ghost at first.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:32.950
Asta... is... such... a... good... boy.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.070
Wait, so you guys really 
didn't know about Henry?

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.450
I totally thought you knew him.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.720
Someone this weird was 
still hiding in our base?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.490
There isn't anyone else 
living there, is there?

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.090
So what the hell happened?

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.130
Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble...

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.490
Um... Um...

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.680
Well... you... see...

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.370
I have no idea what the 
hell any of you are saying!

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.430
Oh, no...

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.060
Gauche...

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.710
turned into an elf?!

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.650
I know this is a serious moment, 
but how could you even understand that?!

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:07.270
Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble...

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.450
I know, right?! But someone 
else is inside, so don't worry!

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.280
He doesn't actually hate you!

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.860
Um... Um...

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.980
Yeah! I think so, too!

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.750
The fact that Gauche didn't finish you 
off means his body's fighting back!

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.590
And... then...

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.570
Gauche headed toward the 
royal capital, didn't he?

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.340
How are you even communicating?!

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.660
We have to go save Gauche, too.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.800
But I'm out of magic...

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.900
You guys get some rest!

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.800
Asta and I will go!

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.980
Wait for us, Gauche!

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.400
What the heck is that sound?
It's literally shaking the ground.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.020
And this overwhelming amount of magic...

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.780
I won't forgive you... I won't forgive you...

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.580
Charmy!

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.540
Don't tell me...

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.540
Who was it?!

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.830
Don't tell me even Miz Charmy...

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.630
has turned into an elf!

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:14.730
Who the heck destroyed the vegetable 
garden I had behind the base?!

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.210
She's not an elf!

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.390
Thank goodness!

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.100
I put so much effort into that garden, la!

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.480
I watered it, gave it fertilizer, 
and put oh-so much love into it!

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.970
I wanted to find a bunch of yummy 
things and feed them to you guys,

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.950
so I rushed back even though 
I was starving, and then...

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.490
This is what I find!

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.760
That creepy sound was 
just her tummy rumbling?!

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.420
Sauce isn't enough to satisfy my hunger, la!

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.990
That was sauce?!

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.810
Are you the ones who wrecked my garden?!

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.130
Uh, er, no... It wasn't us.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.170
You've got the wrong people.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.460
Who did it, then?!

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.170
Um... I think it was the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun and some elves...

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.610
The Eye of the Midnight Sun?

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.180
Elves?

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.720
I'm gonna go kick their asses!

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.650
All of you, follow me!

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.500
Uh, er, I'm out of magic, so I can't...

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.940
I also barely have any left...

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.580
La? You're out of magic?

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.690
Yes...

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.580
Then I'll just have to do this!

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.200
Cotton Creation Magic...

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.480
Sheep Cook: Head Chef!

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.330
Why?!

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.450
All of you...

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.530
Get to work!

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.700
Why, though?!

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.000
Wait! We don't have time for this!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.960
We have to hurry to the royal capital!

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:33.890
Eat.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.460
Seriously, why?!

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.900
Eat!

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.590
Well, I guess I am a little hungry...

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.600
Th-Thanks!

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.140
Stare...

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.980
It's good! It's so good!

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.300
Nothing beats a meal with your best friends!

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.620
I-It's really good!

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:58.740
Th-This is...

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.740
I can feel my magic increasing!

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.210
The Head Chef's cooking increases your magic,
 depending on how much you eat!

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.430
There it is again! This super insane magic!

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.250
But well done, Charmy!

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.130
You're amazing, Miz Charmy!

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.630
Now we can all head to the royal capital!

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.100
Eat! Eat up! Chow it all down!

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.050
But make sure you savor the flavor!

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.070
Will this maybe give me magic, too?!

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.140
Zero still means zero! But eat up anyway!

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.410
I'm going to eat away my sorrows!

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.040
You should have some, too, Henry!

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.410
But... I'll... end... up... sucking... 
away... everyone's... magic.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.410
It's fine! We just have to eat more, then!

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.700
Look who's talking! My precious 
little bit of magic left...

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.410
It... tastes... so... good.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.330
Klaus and Rill turned into elves! 
And that fat guy from the Golden Dawn, too!

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.780
The captain said he was heading 
to the Golden Dawn's base!

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.220
I'm sure Mister Yami's fine!

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.720
I'm so blessed to be able to eat 
a meal with my bestest friends!

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.350
Finral's still in the hospital.
 Where's Noelle?

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.620
Heading to the royal capital 
with her brother with the bangs,

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.990
the Captain of the Silver Eagles!

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.350
We have to hurry after them!

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.650
They should be with another guy named Zora 
who's randomly with the Black Bulls!

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.380
What?! He's a Black Bull?!

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.070
Yeah!

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.280
Come on, Grey! Eat up!

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.360
I will!

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.860
This is getting really fun!

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.380
These are the Black Bulls I know.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.700
Good, good! Keep on chowing down!

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.880
And being among them is extra special.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.010
The hell is that?!

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.170
That's amazing!

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.090
That's the power of our new best friend!

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.910
Recombination Magic: The Raging 
Black Bull ~ Charging Style!

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.660
Whoa! That's awesome!

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.310
That's super badass!

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:01.320
Recombination Magic: 
The Raging Black Bull ~ Charging Style

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.320
Everyone... get... on.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.820
All right, let's do this!

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:12.160
We, the Black Bulls, are gonna 
save the Clover Kingdom!

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.620
Yeah!

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.960
Onward to the royal capital!

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.970
Go!

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:02.440
Petit Clover

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.790
Petit Clover!

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.940
Luck's Ra-Ri-Ru-Re-Ro

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.860
Luck's Ra-Ri-Ru-Re-Ro!

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.290
Luck (Rakku)!

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.950
Luck

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.950
Ahaha!

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.170
Whoo! Luck!

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.540
Rucksack (Ryukku)!

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.200
Rucksack

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.740
That's a bit forced!

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.200
Let's go on a picnic!

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.550
Look (Rukku)!

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:20.460
Look

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.760
What a pretty mountain!

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.050
Look, look! I said look, look!

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.460
Hello!

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.330
Legs

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.820
Recording (Rekku)!

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.330
Okay, smile!

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.870
Make us look good!

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.940
If you don't, I'm gonna feed 
you to my magic beasts!

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.430
You guys look great! Perfect!

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.180
Rock (Rokku)!

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.180
Rock

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.690
Rock 'n' roll!

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.750
Magna and the others saved me.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.560
Now it's my turn to save everyone... 
Everyone in this kingdom!

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.320

Page 106
 Path of Revenge, Path of Atonement

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.950
Okay, let's do this!
