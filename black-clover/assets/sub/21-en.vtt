WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.490
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.030
Hey, isn't this just messed up?

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.410
Why did I have to get kicked out?

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.420
I have more magical power than the royals do.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.330
Magic is everything in 
this world... isn't it?

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.880
This is a load of bull!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.090
Who are you talking to?

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.140
I'm just talking to myself.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.340
We're ready.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.610
Yeah... I'll show the Clover Kingdom's 
Magic Knights the true extent of my powers!

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.710
I would always close my eyes

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.050
And cower at reality

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.720
I can't stand the idea

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.100
Of just making excuses to give up

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.250
Stand right there

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.400
I don't want to be near you

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.540
Any minute now

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.900
Just wait right there

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.900
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.980
Black and blue

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.910
I'll give up on giving up

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.410
And get the world on my side

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.290
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.430
And head where the light shines

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.270
I want to keep my promise

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.810
I'll deliver it to you

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.360
shape of love

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.550
Capital Riot

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.580
There's no reason to run from these jerks.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.080
Asta?

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.840
Calling us peasants, rats, 
embarrassments, failures...

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.430
Who cares if you think we're worthy or not?!

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.180
Just you watch! I'm going to—

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.260
That's enough, you scoundrel.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.100
You shouldn't even be allowed to talk!

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.130
Silence!

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.900
I won't shut up!

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.620
He just...

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.200
Listen up, you bastards!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.200
I'm going to pile up merit,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.510
become the Wizard King,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.200
and shut you all up!

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.710
Leopold

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.710
Fuegoleon

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.210
Sol

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.210
Charlotte

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.720
Shiren

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.720
Alecdora

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.720
Hamon

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.220
Solid

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.220
Nozel

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.220
Nebra

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.660
You fool

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.860
A-Asta...

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.690
Not a chance.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.230
Become...

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.110
...the Wizard King?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.200
Don't make us laugh!

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.250
Water Binding Magic: Sea Serpent's Coils!

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.590
What?

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.760
Mist Binding Magic: Mist Spider's Threads.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.970
I knew it...

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.700
He's erasing the magic.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.450
He's no ordinary peasant.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.810
But...

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.950
If that's his attack range, 
there's no reason for concern.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.750
Sand Creation Magic: Sand-Armored Guard!

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.510
A-Asta!

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.140
I-I think that's enough.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.640
Keep your mouth shut.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.310
Y-Yes, sir.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.600
To act in such a way at a festive occasion
like the decoration ceremony...

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.320
You will surely be punished.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.010
Come on, now...

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.830
Why so soft, Golden Dawn?

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.130
Anyone that self-confident 
needs to be taught a lesson.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.340
That's...

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.920
So that they can never talk back again.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.630
Solid, please don't!

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.640
Holy Water Bullet!

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.350
Asta!

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.690
You're such an embarrassment.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.370
Apologize...

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.210
to Noelle!

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.720
Did you just make me kneel?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.720
You lowly peasant!

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.180
I'm not holding back anymore!

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.970
Solid, p-please, no more...

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.420
Nozel?

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.170
Solid, don't be so quick to use 
your magic on a mere peasant.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.470
B-But...

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.870
Silence.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.930
Do you plan to shame the Silva family?

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.050
What is this chill in the air?

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.830
It's a cold pressure that's 
different from Captain Yami's...

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.970
This is the Captain of the Silver Eagles?

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.630
A peasant that foolishly tried to
defy royalty... How shall I punish you?

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.170
Wh-What should I do?
At this rate, Asta will...

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.510
That's enough.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.430
You're getting so worked 
up over a little boy.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.810
You should be ashamed of yourself, Silvas.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.860
It's just as Mimosa said.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.530
You're quite amusing!

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.030
Huh?

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.340
All right, rejoice! I, Leopold Vermillion,
declare you my rival!

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.710
Huh?

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.090
What was your name? Casta?

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.100
Leopold, it's Asta. He's Asta.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.530
Asta, eh? That's a great name, my rival!

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.010
R-Rival?!

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.180
Come, now! Rejoice!

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.720
Rejoice.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.640
Y-Yay...

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.190
Vermillion...

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.070
Leopold and Fuegoleon are my cousins.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120
Silva Family

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120
Fuegoleon's

1st D.      1st Son

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120
2nd Son

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120
1st Son      1st D.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120
2nd D.      2nd Son      1st D.      1st Son

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120
Fuegoleon

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120
Leopold

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120
Mimosa

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:24.120

Vermillion Family

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:19.200
My father's older brother is 
Fuegoleon and Leopold's father.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.120
Also, my mother's older 
sister is Noelle's mother.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.490
Too many royals.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.370
Huh?

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.030
Um... Thanks, but my rival's actually 
Yuno, who's standing over there.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.230
No worries! One can never 
have too many rivals!

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.760
What the heck?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.940
Hey, Asta! You have a very nice body!

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.270
You are indeed qualified to be my rival!

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.620
All right! Let us arm wrestle.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.770
Why?!

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.010
Guys really are dumb, aren't they, Sis?

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.280
Mind your manners, Sol.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.000
My bad, Sis!

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.300
Call me "Captain," Sol.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.300
My bad, Sis!

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.620
Sol...

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.660
I know, Sis!

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.370
Sis!

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.890
Come at me!

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.420
Is now really the time for this?

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.080
Why are you holding back? Come!

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.130
What?!

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.380
Becoming Leopold's rival...
Asta truly is amazing!

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.100
My, aren't we all so very noisy today?

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.730
Looks like things have calmed down.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.230
A royal acknowledging a peasant as his rival?

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:44.340
Lord Julius allowed the boy to be here.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.640
He may be a peasant, but doesn't 
he deserve a little credit?

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.590
I never thought I'd hear such 
nonsense from a royal's mouth.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.810
It appears that the Vermillion 
family has gone soft.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.380
You're a disgrace to us all.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.010
What?

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.260
How am I, an eagle that soars the sky,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.270
supposed to give any credit to an 
insect that crawls on the ground?

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.070
Wh-What a tremendous clash of mana!

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.120
H-Holy crap...

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.540
You can feel it?

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.620
Even if I can't feel their mana,
I can tell... that this is amazing!

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.570
Shouldn't we stop them, Sis?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.950
This is foolish. Ignore the men 
and their boorish fighting.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.610
Also, call me "Captain."

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.600
Sure thing, Sis!

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.310
Call me—

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.300
Th-There's an emergency!

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.530
What's wrong?

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.320
Th-The capital!

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.670
The capital is under attack!

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.870
Destroy!

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.760
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy!

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.550
Wh-What's going on?

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.460
Destroy all the fools who 
can't understand my worth!

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.160
Such disgusting creatures. 
Where did they come from?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.210
You must not value your lives, if you're
invading the royal capital like this!

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.270
Wh-What are these things?

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.090
They keep coming toward us even 
when we shoot their limbs off!

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.350
Do not falter!

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.010
Protect the Clover Ki—

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.520
You won't be able to, you scum!

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.560
Get lost, scum! Scum! Scum!

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.110
What is this magic?

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.060
You're stronger than me, right? Right?!

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.330
Get out here, Magic Knights!

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.530
The Royal Capital is under attack?!

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.380
Stone Creation Magic: 
Stone Model of the World.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.650
It's... a three-dimensional 
model of the Noble Realm?

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.940
W-Wow!

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.100
Even the voices of the people at 
the scene and their magic levels...

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:19.040
Is he lacing the whole area with mana 
and simultaneously making it visible?

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.150
This is much more advanced than 
my Magic Flower Guidepost!

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.220
A force with this much magic appears 
in five places simultaneously,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.430
without us noticing...

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.570
A formidable spatial magic user must have 
made them materialize in an instant.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.080
Even then, the guard mages of 
the Noble Realm work in shifts,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.210
constantly keeping a magic barrier in place.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.420
It should be impossible to 
enter with spatial magic.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.390
Did they analyze the barrier's 
mechanism and break through it?

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.130
Or did one of the guard mages betray us?

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.720
Either way, they must 
be phenomenally skilled.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.220
How should we assign the 
members we currently have?

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.480
First, we need to guard the 
area around the castle.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.980
Wait, what the heck are we waiting for?!

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.170
I get it! There are people 
out there who need our help!

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.780
I'm gonna go!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.860
Asta!

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.450
Where do you plan to go?

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:16.950
We don't even know the full situation yet, 
and you can't sense magic at all!

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.040
I'm going to where it's noisiest!

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.160
Wha— D-Do you think you're 
an animal or something?!

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.410
Interesting!

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.690
Let's see what you've got!

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.410
Wait for me, Asta, my rival!

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.730
Guys really are dumb, aren't they, Sis?

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.030
Yes, they are.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.380
And call me "Captain."

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.540
Leo's still very much a child.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.060
I'll have to thoroughly retrain him later.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.570
I'm sure you'd rather not take orders 
from me, but listen well, Magic Knights!

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.710
I'll go after Leo and that Black Bulls boy,

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.820
and after I've joined them,
we'll head to the north district.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.780
You, Black Bulls girl, come with me.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.940
Silver Eagles, I ask that you 
head to the central district,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.360
where the magic is strongest.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.350
Very well.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.570
Blue Roses, head to the east district!

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.980
I'd rather not take orders from a man, 
but I suppose I don't have a choice.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.940
Here we go, Sis!

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.130
Call me "Captain."

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:20.050
Golden Dawn, split into two teams and head 
to the west and northwest districts!

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.390
We will protect the people of the Nobel Realm.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.760
Let us go.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.650
I guess we'll just have 
to save dessert for later.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.130
If we fail to protect the royal capital, 
we'll bring shame upon the Magic Knights!

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.900
Do not let the enemy escape, no matter what!

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.450
Right!

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.900
Munchy, munchy...

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.820
I managed to get in by following 
Asta and the others,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.070
but it looks like something 
awful is happening.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.330
This looks like a job for Charmy!

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.540
If I do good, I might get the chance 
to eat even better food!

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.190
I smell something delicious!

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.940
I have to fuel up before the battle!

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.530
Central District

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.590
Don't think you're going to get away with...

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.950
What? What do you want?

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.910
I'll give it to you, just—

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.550
East District

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.780
Mind your manners, Sol.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.020
My bad, Sis!

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.310
Call me "Captain."

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.840
Northwest District

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.930
Those who dare to bring chaos upon the 
kingdom shall perish before my magic!

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.240
These things keep getting 
up with half-assed attacks.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:41.950
In that case...

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.230
West District

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.820
I guess we should work off 
some calories before dessert.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.380
Fools who disturb the peace of the capital...
You shall be eliminated!

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:08.910
North District

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.040
Wh-What is this?

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.540
I've never seen them before. 
What country is that army from?

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.450
Where's Asta?

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.340
Little girl... Do you like the Clover Kingdom?

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.940
I-I love it!

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:47.050
So please... stop this.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.350
Well, I hate it!

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.980
So the town... the people...

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.400
And you, too, little girl...

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.190
I'll destroy you all!

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.380
Then I'll protect them!

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.570
And push me forward

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.660
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:04.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:09.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.680
(Break free yourself)

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:59.350
Petit Clover

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.310
Petit Clover!

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.860
Mr. Animal

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.580
Mr. Animal.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.940
I'm going to where it's noisiest!

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.030
Wha— D-Do you think you're 
an animal or something?!

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.070
An animal?

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.240
Woof, woof.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.070
A dog... My, how adorable.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.760
But a cat might be nice, too.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.210
Meow, meow.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.350
How delightful!

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:29.010
Oh, but maybe something 
even wilder, like a wolf...

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.220
All men are wolves.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.810
Oh, I just can't choose!

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.650
Not a chance...

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.650
What a creepy enemy! But there's 
no time to be creeped out.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.930
I will protect the citizens 
of the Clover Kingdom!
