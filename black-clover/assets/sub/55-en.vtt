WEBVTT

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.730
The Man Named Fanzell

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.940
Asta was gravely injured due to a curse 
placed on him by Vetto of the Third Eye.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.880
The other members of the Black Bulls 
headed out to find a cure for his arms.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.860
Noelle and Finral also visited a 
certain man to gain some clues.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.490
I'm coming in!

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.490
Oh, hey. I just got out of the bath—

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.990
The man that Noelle and Finral came 
to see is named Fanzell Kruger.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.880
Who is this man, and what's 
his relationship with Asta?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.310
To find out, we must look back
in time to five months ago.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.850
5 Months Ago

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.660
A Village Out in the Boonies, Hage

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.850
This story takes place just 
shortly before Asta and Yuno

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.040
departed for the royal capital to
take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.810
after receiving their grimoires.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.460
Asta was camping out in a forest 
near Hage, training with his sword.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.530
Wh-Whoa...

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.640
Is this what I'm supposed 
to do? I have no idea.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.920
I never learned how to use a sword.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.260
I have no idea how to stand or 
hold it. Am I practicing right?

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.960
O-Out of the way, boy! Look out!

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.100
Don't come this way!

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.060
Jump to the side!

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.000
Whoa...

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.120
Amazing. You managed to get 
rid of it with a single blow.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.960
I was trying to fish in the river,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.790
but apparently I was in that boar's territory.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.120
I-I see...

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.380
Fanzell Kruger

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.380
I'm Fanzell. I'm on a journey.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.030
Fanzell...

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.290
You can call me Zell.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.610
Oh, I'm Asta, from Hage Village!

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.360
Nice to meet you, Asta.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.160
By the way, is that yours?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.140
Yeah, why?

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.810
Man...

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.570
You're a lifesaver!

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.130
I haven't had a bite in two days.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.090
I couldn't catch any fish, either.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.330
Right...

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.970
It's so dry. It's like all the moisture 
is being sucked out of my mouth.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.940
More importantly, why are you naked?

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.590
I didn't want to get my clothes 
wet while I was fishing.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.350
So, what are these?

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.350
You're eating them without 
knowing what they are?!

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.100
They're Hage Village's famous tatoes!

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.750
Tatoes, eh?

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.510
You okay?

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.720
Jeez, here.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.970
Thanks...

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.940
Wait, what is this? It's really bitter.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.660
It's moguro leaf juice. It's supposed 
to increase your magical power!

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.650
I feel much better.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.930
I'd like to thank you. Why don't 
you come over to my house?

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.950
Your house?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.030
Well, I'm just staying there 
without permission, really.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.820
I had no idea a place like 
this existed in the woods.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.710
I just happened to find an empty house.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.090
Oh, one sec. I'll go put some clothes on.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.470
Ah, a sword that negates magic? 
I've never seen anything like that before.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.830
I'm gonna try to pass the Magic Knights 
Entrance Exam with this sword!

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.560
That's why I'm camping out 
in these woods to train!

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.850
I see.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.560
What are you doing here, old guy?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.030
Old guy? I'm only 28, you know...

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.360
What?! You're 28?!

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.990
You sure didn't age well!

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.550
Well, that aside...

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.820
I'm waiting for someone.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.620
This deep in the mountains?

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.860
A lot's happened.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.340
Huh...

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.190
By the way, Asta, you're camping out, right?

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.380
Why don't you stay here 
while you're training?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.950
Really? That'd help me out a lot, but...

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.180
You're not planning to 
steal my tatoes, are you?

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.110
You should treasure your encounters 
and connections with others.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.190
They might go away one day, but they're all 
experiences that build up in your heart.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.220
Not a chance... He's obviously suspicious.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.910
Find out more about him.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.720
Okay, I'll take you up on your offer, Zell!

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.000
Great. Now, let's decide who 
gets to chop up the firewood.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.080
What?!

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.090
Take that!

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.030
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.410
This isn't working.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.560
It's probably because you're not 
carrying enough weight on your knees.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.850
After you initially swing your sword,
you try to attack again,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.400
but it's not working well, right?

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.680
So you lose your balance.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.070
Y-Yeah...

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.810
Always make sure your toes are facing the 
same direction that your sword is pointing.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.450
Also, keep your right foot about 
half a step in front of your left.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.250
Give it a try.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.030
I did it!

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.270
I knew I could! Yeah!

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.270
Y-Yeah... You learned that pretty quick.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.130
Glad it worked.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.160
All right!

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.810
You're amazing, old guy!
 You know how to use a sword?

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.180
Well, it's not exactly 
a sword, but... One sec.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.050
Wind Creation Magic: 
Emperor of Slashing Winds.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.210
Awesome!

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.690
As you can see, my magic 
takes the shape of a sword.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.850
The Emperor of Slashing Winds,
 or "Slash" for short.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.270
You're even awesome at naming things!

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.540
So I have some experience
 with swords, too.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.610
Then please show me how to use a sword!

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.710
What?

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.590
Come on, just a little bit!

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.640
Please! Teach me!

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.780
Yeah, sure.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.450
Huh?

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.450
Sure.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.490
Y-You sure?

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.810
Yup.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.730
Th-Thanks.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.000
Yes! This is awesome!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.340
All right! Woohoo!

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.000
Awesome! Heck yeah!

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.310
There's just one thing I'd 
like you to promise me.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.510
Yay!

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.140
Asta, why do you want to become stronger?

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.140
To become the Wizard King!

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.120
I see. That's great.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.650
Excellent.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.570
You're not gonna laugh at me?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.920
Why would I laugh?

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.370
Like... say that it's impossible, or whatever.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.740
You'll never know if it's 
impossible if you don't try.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.320
Promise me...

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.330
that you won't use what I show you

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.120
for anything other than 
making your dream come true.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.580
Sure. What do I need to do?

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.800
Never wrongfully harm others 
or pick on the weak.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.630
As long as you don't use it for anything 
bad like that, I'll teach you.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.930
You don't even need to tell 
me not to do stuff like that.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.190
Then it's a promise.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.180
Yeah, I promise.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.160
Okay, let's do our best together.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.890
Yeah! I look forward to training with you!

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.980
A Few Days Later

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.160
You're following up too late 
with your left foot.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160
If you're going to attack consecutively, 
don't pause between each slash.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.870
Got it!

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.210
Great job, Asta.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.810
You're doing well with both 
attacking and defending.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.720
Your movements are improving.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.440
Since you're this strong,
 you should've been able to beat

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.100
that boar on your own no problem.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.780
I didn't have my sword or 
grimoire with me at the time.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.750
Besides, my swordsmanship 
isn't that impressive.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.360
You're just more skilled than you realize.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.900
I'm pretty sure you're 
just a good teacher, Zell.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.740
I used to do something like teaching.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.430
That explains it!

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.660
Though my students never took me seriously.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.860
I've taught over a hundred students,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.460
but you're so talented that you'd 
probably be in my top three.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.380
Top three?

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.540
Actually, maybe top two.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.000
Though the top one doesn't really use a sword 
like a sword, so that one wouldn't count...

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:10.770
But anyway, I think you'll do just fine, 
even if you join the Magic Knights.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.900
You really think so?

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.680
Then let's get right back to training!

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.250
Hey, come on. We're still eating here.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.080
A few more days passed, 
and then she arrived.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.210
Sorry I'm late, Instructor Fanzell.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.050
Who're you?

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.750
Mariella! Did you find anything out?

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.750
Mariella?

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.140
She's one of my students.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.280
Mariella

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.550
She's been helping me look for my fiancée.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.160
I see. Well, what are you waiting for?

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.310
Shouldn't you look for her yourself?

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.610
Actually... I can't do anything that'll 
bring too much attention to me.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.940
I'm Asta from Hage Village! This old guy's 
teaching me how to use my sword.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:04.780
Nice to meet ya!

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.800
I'll have you know he's no ordinary man.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.540
I know he looks old, but he seems even older.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.930
I don't know who you are, but he's not

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.600
Old...?

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.510
some random old guy that you can 
lightly address as "old guy."

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.790
I'm only 28...

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.790
I told you! I'm Asta from Hage Village!

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.430
That's what he is, so why 
can't I call him that?

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.680
It's a matter of recognition.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.830
There's a big difference in the amount 
of respect you would show him,

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.150
knowing just how ancient he is.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.730
I didn't hear an ounce of respect 
in how you addressed him.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.270
How the heck is "old guy" ever 
supposed to sound respectful?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.010
Uh, could you stop?

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.440
He's just a random old guy! That's all!

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.660
Everything you're saying is pretty hurtful, 
considering I'm sitting right here.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.620
No, you're saying it wrong.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.240
More importantly, where's Dominante?

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.680
Where's Domina?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.630
Actually, Miss Domina...

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.640
may have passed away.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.880
Dude...

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.940
Fanzell explained to Asta what 
kind of situation he was in.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:13.140
It turned out Fanzell and his fiancée 
Dominante belonged to the Diamond army.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.830
The two of them couldn't bear 
the army's cruel ways any longer

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.260
and tried to escape,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.510
but they were tracked down by 
some assassins and got separated.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.620
Fanzell was supported by his former student,
Mariella, who he let escape earlier,

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.740
and she was looking for Dominante.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.670
If Fanzell made any rash movements, 
the assassins would learn of it,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.970
so he had no choice but to 
hide in this house to keep

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.500
Dominante out of danger, 
just in case she was nearby.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.090
That's a lot to take in...

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.400
This is Miss Domina's wand.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.190
It was on the ground where you 
said the assassins attacked.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.330
I also found quite a bit of blood there.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.100
I see.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.350
Sorry, could you leave me alone for a while?

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.750
Pardon me, Instructor...

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.950
Please listen to what I have to say.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.810
Do you remember when you let me
 and the other students escape?

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:34.810
Yeah.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.310
Is everyone doing well?

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.060
You actually smiled for a moment.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.570
Well, you see, everyone else died.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.570
What?

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.290
Assassins sent by the Diamond Kingdom...

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.040
killed them all.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.210
What are you...

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.190
Sending the kingdom information

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.040
as well as eliminating any 
defectors is my job now.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:16.600
If I didn't cooperate, 
I'd be killed, just like the others.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.730
Oh, I won't kill you, though.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.510
I was told to bring you back alive.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.820
This place is completely surrounded, 
so you won't be able to escape.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.020
A certain mage warrior has 
entered his final stages.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.270
I'm sure they need your advice on

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.170
the final adjustments he'll 
need to function properly.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.890
That's where you truly belong.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.790
His name is Mars.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.300
The boy's name is Mars. Stop talking about 
him like he's just some kind of weapon!

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.250
Oh, sure. That really doesn't matter to me.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.810
You okay, old guy?

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.210
And what the hell, Mariella?

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.740
I thought you were grateful 
for all he did for you!

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.810
Of course I am.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:09.040
It's true that I was able to survive because 
of the fighting techniques he taught me,

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.770
so I still respect him greatly.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.410
That's why I warned you about 
your tone when you address him.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.830
Then why the heck are you doing this?

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.580
Because if that's all I ever worried about,
 I'd never be able to do my job.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.870
So could you please stay out of our way?

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.880
You don't want to die for some 
old man you don't know, do you?

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.030
I know him pretty damn well now!

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.290
No, Asta. Mariella's right.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.390
You should run.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:41.840
You promised me that you would use 
whatever I taught you for your dreams.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.060
It'd be wrong to use that here 
for some old guy you don't know.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.560
Hurry up and run!

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.010
I told you! I know you, old guy!

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:56.450
Don't worry. I can take care of these 
guys even if you're not around.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.200
But you've been stabbed!

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.790
I promise you I'll get out of this.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.430
You'd better keep that promise.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.290
Don't you dare die before I see you next!

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:10.570
Got it!

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.960
Sorry, Asta. You need to run.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.590
I...

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.300
Domina...

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.810
Wha—

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.540
Asta, it's okay.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.170
It doesn't matter what happens to me...

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.810
I've lost the will to live.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.170
There's no reason.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:53.170
Just leave me alone. I'm tired of all this.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.340
What the hell are you saying?!

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.650
Will to live? A reason to live?

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.090
Of course you're not supposed 
to automatically have that!

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.150
You're supposed to find 
those things for yourself!

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.650
If you understand, then get
 your ass up and join me!

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:35.260
Wind Creation Magic: Emperor of 
Slashing Winds—Winter Wind.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.260
Awesome!

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.560
That spells sends lots of 
Slashes flying out at once.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.560
I call it the Flying One.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.310
What an awesome name!

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.370
Sorry about that pathetic display.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.080
I'm all right now.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.160
Right!

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.530
Don't let your guard down.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.130
My guard's not down at all!

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.610
He negated my spell?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.290
What's wrong, old guy? You done already?

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.560
Only you can decide when you're truly done,

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.780
and you just taught me 
that now's not the time.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.560
I'm not gonna let these 
guys finish me like this.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.300
Let us retreat.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.490
I'll hold the rear.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.550
Please make sure to gather the injured.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.640
You're backing off, just like that?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.360
To make a surprise attack, you must 
have three times the enemy's strength.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.570
If you lose half your men, 
change your strategy.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.570
If you lose half of that, then retreat.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.070
That's what a certain someone taught me.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.390
This isn't the end.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.080
I'll hunt you down for the rest of your life.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.290
Bring it on. I'm done running.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.130
From all of you, as well as myself.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.750
I'm not going to be discouraged anymore.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:02.460
Domina is alive somewhere, I'm sure of it!

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.600
I'm going to search everywhere 
for her, so you'd better keep up!

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.770
You hear that, Mariella?

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.100
I hope you're ready to have to deal 
with his old man stench forever!

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.900
Could you shut up for a bit? 
You're gonna make an old man cry.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.240
Please do your best.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:24.910
Also, your tone has improved. 
Don't forget that.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.620
Are you really going to head out now?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.580
Yeah, I'm gonna look for 
Domina until I find her.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.150
And I'm going to try to make up for 
all the wrongs I did in the meantime.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.790
I haven't decided exactly how yet,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.040
but I need to at least spend 
the rest of my life trying.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.210
So I won't die that easily.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.020
Thanks to you, I've reevaluated my resolve.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.560
I see.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.900
Well, if we drag this out any longer, 
it'll just be harder to say goodbye.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.520
See ya, kid.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.450
Hey! Are you seriously leaving,
 just like that?

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.370
I am. Time flows differently 
for those who try

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.270
to actually get stuff done 
and those who don't.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.670
I've gotta save time whenever I can.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.500
Save time? Really?

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.870
You're also someone who 
gets stuff done, right?

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:30.310
Get going, Asta. You already have everything
 you need to get what you want done.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.310
Jeez. <i>Now</i> you act like a proper mentor?

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.060
See ya, old guy!

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.020
You'd better become the Wizard King, kid.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.850
Well... I guess I should 
get back to the village.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.040
Asta! This is your final lesson!
 Defeat this boar!

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.180
Do it yourself!

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.000
Also, why are you naked again?!

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.890
I don't have time to explain!

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.430
Hey! Don't come this way!

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.560
Domina, where are you, my love?

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.670
I believe that you're alive.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.110
Hey, miss! I'd like to ask you a 
question. Wait, don't run away!
