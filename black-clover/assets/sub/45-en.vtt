WEBVTT

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.680
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.420
Vetto, one of the leaders of 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.760
suddenly attacked the Underwater Temple.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.310
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.780
Beast Magic: Rhinoceros Armor.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.990
It didn't even faze him.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.120
That's not a bad spell, for a mouse.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.240
Let me give you a reward.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.990
Beast Magic: Bear Claw!

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.130
You insects aren't even 
allowed to hold on to hope.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.100
Dark Magic: Lightless Slash!

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.140
This is...

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.390
Hey, you dumbasses, listen up.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.350
Someone really dangerous 
just crashed the game.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.440
Here's the problem... Due to reasons, 
I can't go over there.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.850
Meaning you guys gotta 
do something about him.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.650
Listen up.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.210
All of you, surpass your limits,
right here, right now.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.990
Thus, the fate of the Underwater 
Temple was left in the hands

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.400
of Asta and the other Black Bulls.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.200
And...

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.250
We'll hit him with all the magic we've got!

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.380
Combo Magic: Flame Lightning 
Explosive Cannon!

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.890
Wh-What is this magical discharge?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.930
Even a combo spell that powerful 
couldn't scratch him.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.190
Magna, Luck... You were true men.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.940
You better stand strong, too,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.770
kid!

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.680
The Guy Who Doesn't Know When to Quit

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.830
In the end, you're nothing more than insects.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.930
I gave you the chance to fight back, 
and this was all you could do.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.380
Now, take this! The despair called death!

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.810
An anti-magic sword...

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.140
Good of you to come, boy.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.140
That guy's from the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.020
This is the perfect opportunity.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.520
I'll make you feel the pain
Licht felt many times over!

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.820
Just like those insects at my feet.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.240
They're not insects.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.360
They're my teammates!

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.960
And as their junior, I'll take on 
the duty of bringing you down!

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.850
I see. So this is what a slash from 
the anti-magic sword feels like.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.890
If you were to get a clean hit on me, 
I probably wouldn't stand a chance.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.550
It definitely had more of an effect than 
certain-kill spells from most mages.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.150
Then act like you're hurt, you bastard!

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.620
Just what are you guys planning to do 
by gathering those magic stones?

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.850
We know you're up to something!

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.760
I have no reason to tell you,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.820
a piece of no-magic trash unloved by mana.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.730
What?

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.710
Well? Come at me.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.070
You can join the rest of the insects.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.180
He even got Dad?

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.580
This guy's total magic power is 
on a completely different level.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.350
The magic that flows from him 
grants constant protection.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:09.180
I'll massacre everyone here, then take 
my time searching for the magic stone.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.350
I didn't forget about the ones outside.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.810
Hopefully the scum out on the frontier can 
keep me at least mildly entertained.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.490
People I love... My family, and those who 
are just like family to me, live here.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.010
I'll never let that happen!

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.530
Let's go, Kiato!

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.890
You got it, Asta!

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.670
He only grazed us, yet he's still so powerful!

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.350
He's reading our ki!

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.480
And he's so fast that there's almost 
no point in reading his ki.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.220
Kiato, I guess you weren't going 
all-out when you were fighting me.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.490
Apparently, neither were you. 
You have another sword!

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.900
How boring.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.820
Slow movements and weak attacks.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:18.330
I suppose I can't expect more from 
no-magic trash and hick scum.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.330
You sure know how to hurt a guy's 
feelings, you hairy gorilla.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.660
We'll show you what happens when 
trash and scum get serious!

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.470
That's it, Kiato! You can do it!

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.850
That bastard's still not fazed one bit.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.140
I can feel it all the way over here...

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.940
Magic that's terrifyingly powerful.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.240
Listen up.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.690
All of you, surpass your limits,
right here, right now.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.060
The captain actually 
sounded serious for once.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.080
I guess this isn't the 
time for me to be drunk.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.040
Crap! This is definitely not good.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.110
If I end up face-to-face with that guy,
I'm definitely going to die!

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:14.050
On the other hand, if I just hide somewhere,
Yami's going to kill me later.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.350
What the hell am I supposed to do?!

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.640
I'd like a bucket of that pudding, please...

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.940
A bucket...

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.820
Tch. I was about to wrap things 
up and go see Marie, but now...

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.370
Stop getting in the way 
of my flirting, damn it!

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.500
Sucks to be you.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.200
Now that you've run into me,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.170
the most powerful chain magic user 
in the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.490
you'll never get to see your Marie again.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.130
The hell did you just say?! Don't think 
you can get away with saying that!

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.680
Mirror Magic: Reflect R—

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:06.690
It's no use! My chains immediately 
detect attack magic and strike!

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.690
Chain Magic: Scorpio Chain!

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.690
Come on, now! If you're
 too slow, it'll sting ya!

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.700
You stupid small fry! You can 
dial back that confidence!

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.210
Mirror Magic: Real Double!

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:33.460
Ah, yes... My chain won't be able 
to keep up if there are two targets...

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.800
If I only had one, that is!

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.970
And then...

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.600
Reflect Refrain!

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.930
W-Wait!

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.510
Die.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.230
And I hope you die without
leaving a trace behind!

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.740
You had me sweating for a second.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.370
This bastard...

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.030
Chain Magic: Heavy Chain!

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.730
To pay you back, I'll squish you with these!

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.800
Tch...

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.600
Damn it!

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.730
There's no point in running, you coward.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.390
That bastard looks and sounds like 
a weakling, so I thought I'd be fine,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.170
but he's stupidly strong!

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.590
Now, where are you hiding?

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.470
As much as it pisses me off,

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.010
that bastard's magic is pretty 
solid for both attack and defense.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:10.560
The only chance I really have
is if he underestimates me.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.080
But...

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.190
He already saw my Real Double.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.180
How am I going to...

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.990
Hey, come on. Come out.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.120
I guess this is all I should've 
expected from the Black Bulls.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.340
What a worthless group of pathetic losers.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.340
Shut your mouth!

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.130
You stupid face!

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.050
There you are!

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.870
You thought you could 
use the same trick twice?

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.810
I-I'm scared! Save me!

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.560
How pathetic, you moron...

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.610
Die!

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.070
You're the moron.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.150
Wha— Another one?!

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.320
Mirror Magic: Large Reflect Ray!

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.070
I-Impossible... I already 
defeated your double...

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.710
Too bad for you. That's not my double.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.170
He fell for it! He fell 
for it! He fell for it!

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.000
That's right! I, Grey,
used transformation magic

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.700
in the middle of the battle 
to turn into Gauche!

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.200
That guy was pretty tough,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.810
but I never thought I'd run into 
you transformed into a crab.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.140
You better thank me!

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.250
Stop doing weird stuff in 
my form! I'll kill you!

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.360
Ow, ow, ow... Please stop...

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.540
I used up a lot of my magic, 
but there are more enemies.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.120
We're gonna find them and kill them.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.370
You got it!

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.710
Yeah, my bad... I twisted my ankle 
during that fight back there.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.010
You can't be serious!

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.420
Hurry up and transform into 
someone that's not me.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.880
I know. Transform into a crab. 
Then you'll have plenty of legs.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.270
Nope! I need magic to transform.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.210
I shouldn't be wasting it, right?

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.020
Hey, stop for a sec.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.030
I'm pretty sure it was somewhere 
around here that I saw...

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.780
There she is!

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.480
Ah, yes... the only way to eat cake 
properly is with your hands...

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.280
Domehead!

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.330
Why the hell is she sleeping?

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.450
Dunno. She was like that when I found her.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.140
Well, anyway, even that glutton can 
help us fight. Let's wake her up.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.790
I can't move!

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:49.880
Tch...

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.440
These vines are draining our magic.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.610
No! It's sucking away my strength!

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.010
Vine Trap Magic: Bind Vine.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.560
Two of the same face? One of you 
must be using transformation magic.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.670
You bastard!

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.380
A g-g-g-g-ghost!

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.930
Regardless, I was able 
to catch two this time.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:16.980
I'll make you as useless as 
this one with my vine magic.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.060
No! Stop!

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.000
Please stop!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.910
But you guys sure are easy.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.360
I just randomly set my trap 
magic in various spots

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.470
and waited until you morons fell into it.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:35.110
Now all I have to do is wait for your magic 
to drain, and then I get to torment you.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.350
Talk about easy.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.400
This isn't good. He got my grimoire, too.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.230
I can't activate my mirror!

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.770
Domehead must've been a decoy.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:51.060
Once you set your fork down,
the meal is over...

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.670
Hey! Damn it, Domehead, wake up!

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.110
That jerk, just snoozing away over there...

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.370
No! Please stop!

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.260
I don't want to die yet!

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.800
Even if I wanted to fight back, Grey 
can only use transformation magic.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.800
They're all useless!

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.970
I'm just going to have to do something 
before all my magic gets drained...

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.050
on my own!

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.810
We're supposed to be a team!

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.000
I protect you! You protect me!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.540
Then we'll be able to fight forever!

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.720
That's right.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.590
I was this close to ending up 
right back where I started!

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.590
Hey! Hey!

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.730
My magic! My magic!

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.500
It's getting sucked away!

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.970
Gauche! Hey! Do something!

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.120
Shut up!

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.690
Think. How should we fight?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.610
We've got a bastard who can only 
transform and can't fight,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.670
and a domeheaded glutton who's fast asleep.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.880
Well, aren't you a
yummy-looking cut of meat...

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.300
Hey, Grey!

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.060
Can't you...

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:57.110
Stop struggling. My vines have already 
sucked away most of your magic.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.810
It's impossible to defeat me.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.810
I've been wondering this 
ever since you showed up,

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.380
but aren't you a bit old
to be acting like this?

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.070
How rude! I'm only twenty!

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.880
There's no time to waste! Let's do this!

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.190
Okay, Gauche!

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:12.990
There!

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.070
What the heck is that?

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.950
Hey, Domehead!

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:25.230
Somebody's trying to steal your food!

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.430
Huh? But I'm a vegetarian...

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.890
Hey.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.210
Step away from that meat.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.500
H-How is her magic so immense?

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.230
There's... a beast?

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.590
I-I'll drain your magic, too!

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.830
I've set a trap over there, too!

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.170
Cotton Creation Magic:

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.740
Sleeping Sheep's...

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.870
One Hit!

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:58.870
One Hit

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.370
Two Hit!

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.370
Two Hit

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.620
Mega Hit

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.750
Mega Hit!

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.000
W-We're saved!

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.590
Meat! Meat! Meat!

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.600
This isn't meat!

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.030
Gauche! This isn't meat!

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.210
I hate to admit it, but her 
attack power is insane.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.280
Grey. You can do better, too, can't you?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.230
Huh?

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.190
I've seen other guys use transformation 
magic where they transform themselves,

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.170
but I've never seen anyone who can 
transform something else like you.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.290
I think you could probably 
use that a bit more.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.180
Right...

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.000
I used up more magic than I thought!

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.570
My transformation's coming undone!

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.930
Meat, meat, meat...

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.510
Huh? Grey's transformation's coming undone?

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.970
Come to think of it,
I've never seen Grey's true form!

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.010
What does he look like?

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.020
Isn't he that big guy?

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:14.530
Grey (True Form)

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.050
What?! Grey's a girl?!

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.620
I-I'm so embarrassed!

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.510
Please don't look!

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.980
I can't move an inch. All I can 
do is stare at Marie's picture.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.540
My angel will help me regain my strength.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.830
H-He really isn't looking at Grey.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.820
Oh, so that's what you look like.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.130
I-It's so humiliating to have 
people see me in my true form!

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.680
If I'm not transformed, I feel like 
I'll die from the humiliation! Save me!

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.960
Well, aren't you a cute young lady?

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.060
Oh? How old are you, hon? La?

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.760
I'm 24...

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.610
La! You're five years older than me?!

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.360
And I can't even deal with the fact that 
you're the same age as me, Domehead.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.660
What?! You're also nineteen?!

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.570
I have barely any magic left.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.640
How are things going over there,
 you hot-headed shrimp?

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.340
Go!

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.960
Did you get your hopes up?

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.320
These childish attacks won't work on me!

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.740
Not yet...

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:51.000
No-magic trash! Prancing around 
with weapons too good for you...

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.090
You don't have a shred of hope.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.660
Let me tell you why!

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.770
One...

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.230
You're weak against throwing and 
other long-distance attacks.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.010
Especially with objects that have no magic!

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.060
Two...

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.290
You're weak against those 
whose physical abilities

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.330
are magically reinforced 
to be greater than yours.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.110
So what?!

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.400
Three...

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.650
You don't know when to quit!

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.980
Boy... You actually think that 
as long as you don't give up,

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.960
it'll work out somehow, don't you?

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.670
That arrogance causes you to keep recklessly 
attacking opponents you can't defeat

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.680
and makes it easy to mortally wound you.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.500
The idea of trash like you holding 
the Demon-Slayer Sword and the

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.500
Demon-Dweller Sword makes me sick!

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.150
You're talking nonsense again.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.100
You never had any hope of winning.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.710
Now... scream! Despair!

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.500
Ib I gwabe up...

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.800
Fu curd I brotec?

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.160
Huh?

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.040
Looks like your animal hearing wasn't 
sharp enough to pick that up.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.840
He said, "If I gave up, who could I protect?"

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.270
Petit Clover

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.240
Petit Clover!

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.770
Magical Detective Charmy

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.110
Magical Detective Charmy!

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.530
Hello, I'm Magical Detective Charmy.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:13.110
A terrible crime has been committed. 
Someone has eaten my cake.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.940
To uphold my honor, I will 
capture this vile criminal!

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.200
You're the culprit.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.930
The criminal was bold 
enough to go into my room!

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.200
My bedroom!

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.380
You're the damn culprit.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.890
But the criminal made a grave mistake.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.020
Look at this handprint!

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.840
That's your handprint, isn't it?

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.010
The culprit is...

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.190
You, right?

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.770
It's me!

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.530
Duh.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.230
The ocean's such a lovely restaurant!

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:46.490
I need to hurry up and finish this mission 
so I can eat those fishies and clams!
