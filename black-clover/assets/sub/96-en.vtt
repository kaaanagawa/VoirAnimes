00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.780
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.890
Asta and the others who infiltrated 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun's base

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.430
continued to dominate the battle.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.190
Mereoleona tried to finish Raia off, but...

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.730
We can understand each other.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.480
I mean, we're basically the same as them.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.980
They're mad because something 
precious to them was hurt.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.100
A free kingdom

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.880
where everyone can acknowledge 
each other and smile...

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.190
That's the kind of kingdom I want to create

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.450
when I become the Wizard King.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.550
What a fool,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.370
blurting out something so overambitious 
without any hesitation...

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.880
He's actually serious about that.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.130
There used to be a guy who 
said the same thing.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.190
If all humans were like you two, then maybe...

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.650
But...

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.480
There's no stopping this now.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.780
And around the same time, Licht... 
no, Patry's true motive was revealed.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.540
Patry was once betrayed by the humans

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.620
and witnessed the massacre
of many of his elven friends.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.080
In order to bring back his friends, 
he had been acting as Licht this entire time.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.830
The humans betrayed someone precious 
to me. They betrayed all of us!

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.750
This time...

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.380
This time, we'll destroy the humans!

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.870
Humans, you shall serve as the
foundation of the resurrection.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270
What the...

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.940
This is...

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.790
The Black Bulls Captain
vs
the Crimson Wild Rose

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.750
I don't think I have the 
profile just right yet.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.630
This is insane!

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.500
We should have no problems 
defeating these insects!

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.260
Hey, so where's your boss?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.910
U-Uh...

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.260
Come on, tell me. I'm dying to paint right now.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.350
Master Licht is...

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.470
Huh, what? What, what, what?!

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.040
I didn't even do anything yet!

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.090
Wh-What in the world...

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.850
What's going on?

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.380
Wow, I wonder what's happening!

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.920
A Village Out in the Boonies: Hage

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.060
The demon's skull...

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.470
D-Don't worry. It'll be okay, kids.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.060
There's nothing to worry about.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.380
Even if something dangerous 
were to happen,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.780
the Clover Kingdom has the Magic Knights.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.280
Asta... Yuno...

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.780
Town in the Common Realm: Nean

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.880
It's nighttime, but it looks 
like the sun's about to rise.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.290
Earlier, there were swords of 
light coming from the sky.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.750
What in the world is 
going on in this kingdom?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.310
What... is... that?

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.290
Th-This seems different from 
the swords of light earlier.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.790
That light is like the light of our friendship.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.820
But I guess this isn't the 
time to talk about that.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.080
Is this another attack by 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.460
It disappeared... but our 
friendship will never fade.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.130
U-Um, Gauche?!

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.880
What?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.120
Um... Your body...

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.590
What about it?

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.470
It's... shining... really... bright.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.320
M-Marie?

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.830
Things keep happening one after 
another. What's going on?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.840
What the...

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.890
What is this light?

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.300
Luck?

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.150
H-Huh? Huh, wait, what?!

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.210
What the heck is going on with you now?!

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.930
You just started shining outta nowhere!

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.090
Once you're done with that,
you better explain what's going on!

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.330
Hey, are you listening?!

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.610
Too bad...

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.640
What is?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.140
The era of the humans has come to an end.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.150
Wh-What's the matter...

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.900
E-Everyone?

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.160
Yuno... Hamon... Klaus...

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.410
Do not talk to us.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.170
You are not one of us.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.920
Begone...

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.420
Begone...

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.430
Begone...

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.180
Begone...

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.680
Begone...

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.030
Begone, humans!

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.750
Now, the time for revenge has come!

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.740
That light just now... wasn't an attack.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.420
So what the hell was it?

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.140
I feel strong magic throughout the kingdom.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.680
This ki... Don't tell me...

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.760
Wh-What was that light?

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.990
Are you all right? What happened?

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.140
We must contact all the 
Magic Knights in the area.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.610
Wait, what are you doing?!

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.750
So you two finally showed up,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.210
but why the hell are you all 
shiny and attacking our comrades?

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.020
Marx! Old Man Owen!

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.930
Sorry, but we aren't the 
men you knew anymore.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.940
Long ago, we were destroyed by 
the humans of this kingdom.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.470
We are elves.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.770
Elves?

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.160
This time, we'll be destroying you.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.480
Just as you did to us, we will 
destroy every last one of you.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.290
Well, this sounds like it's 
going to be a pain in the ass.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.300
The guy did say that once they 
collected all the magic stones,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.500
they'd be reborn into their true 
forms and obtain enormous power.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.750
So the ones who were reborn aren't the 
guys in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.340
Don't worry. You'll be put out 
of your misery soon enough.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.680
Marx's magic...

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.620
If any of these hit me, I'll lose 
my memory of what just happened.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.600
And now the jerk's speed 
and range have skyrocketed.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.540
And Old Man Owen's healing 
magic also skyrocketed,

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:29.160
except now the healing's so powerful,
it'll bust a hole in my ass.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.000
I'll be finished if either one of 
them manages to hit me. Shit!

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.760
I don't know who that corpse is,
but is it precious to you?

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.520
It doesn't matter who they are. 
All humans are sinners and deserve to die.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.190
You bastard!

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.410
If it's that precious to you,

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.190
how about I rip it to shreds 
right in front of you?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.280
Don't you dare make those two 
say shit like that ever again.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.920
You're just going to be easier 
to hit if you leap right at us!

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.880
Memory Magic: Torment Canceller!

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.300
Dark Magic: Black Hole.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.880
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked...

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.800
Lightless Blade Storm!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.570
What?

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.770
This human's movements...

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.270
Dark Cloaked Lightless Blunt Slash!

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.170
You two can take a little nap.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.310
See, I swore to a man you both 
respected that I'd protect this country.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.370
For crying out loud...

00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:00.000
These two don't even use battle magic, 
and they were this much trouble?

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.510
Red roses?

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.070
My comrades...

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.020
It appears you let your guard down,
 considering you just woke up.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:21.900
Rest a while within my magic.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:32.040
Well, that's damn nice of you. 
It's not like you, though, Spiny Prickly Queen.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:37.180
I don't know who you are, but you 
seem quite skilled for a human.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.370
What's going on?

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.970
There are powerful spells 
going off everywhere!

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.170
Is it another attack on the royal capital?

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.510
Get the hell outta here, you dumbasses!

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.510
If you guys don't survive, 
I'll murder you!

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.870
I can't do much about the 
destruction to the town.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.910
As long as the citizens survive, 
the kingdom won't die.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.230
But if more of these things 
keep sprouting up everywhere,

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.380
we might just get wiped out.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.820
The scent from the roses is 
cloaking the Prickly Queen's magic.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.180
This isn't like her at all.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.640
But you see...

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.350
I was always really badass 
at playing hide-and-seek!

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.070
Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.020
You have impressive instincts for a human.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.430
That wasn't instinct. 
I distinctly felt your ki!

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.530
Ki?!

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.870
Three cheers for ki!

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.400
The way she moves and her ki 
are definitely Charlotte's,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.310
but her magic combat tactics are different.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.170
In addition to her normal 
midrange attacks,

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.510
she's using roses that scramble 
magic with their scent

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.290
and a variety of close-range attacks.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.130
On top of that, she's not 
leaving any openings now.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.890
Knocking her out with the blunt edge of 
my sword will be nearly impossible.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:21.170
I heard her roses turned blue when 
she got hit with that curse as a kid.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.170
The curse!

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.980
The curse upon the House 
of Roselei has activated!

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.910
Damn it!

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.560
What the hell's the big idea, you jerk?

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.070
You flung the pasta soup 
I was eating everywhere.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:15.010
On missions, you're as cool as a cucumber 
and always raring to go. So what gives?

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.410
I like tough girls.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.000
But it probably wouldn't hurt to ask
someone for help once in a while.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:34.260
Our Magic Knights Squads are full 
of strong people you can rely on.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.600
I don't really get it, but apparently 
the curse was broken back then.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.620
Yet, because of the curse,
her roses remained blue.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.440
But an elf's in there right now.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.110
Did turning into something that's not 
human kill off the lingering effects, too?

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.490
So this is what Charlotte Roselei's 
briar magic was supposed to be!

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.740
You used the power of the curse

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.810
to make yourself stronger 
through sheer grit...

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.880
And now some other woman's 
using your magic perfectly.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.300
That's pretty lame, Prickly Queen!

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.620
S-Sis!

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.470
You're...

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.470
Sis!

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.260
B-Back there...

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.250
When you attacked us...

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.890
That was...

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.080
That was some kind of mistake, right?

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.580
Sis!

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.350
Stop acting so familiar with me, human.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.840
I only have a younger brother. 
I have no younger sisters.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:52.960
Sis...

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.440
She's basically being controlled by 
some kind of spell. Don't worry about it.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.390
You're the Black Bulls' captain...

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.690
I'll deal with her.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.800
Huh?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.730
But you showed up at a good time.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.880
Hey, what is this?

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.730
Take this and get to someplace safe.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.690
I-I don't take any requests from men!

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.110
Damn it, now's not the time for that!

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.810
But...

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.630
There's a hero in there. 
Be extra careful with it.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.710
Hey!

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.620
I can't leave my sis with any guy!

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.870
Hey, you dumbass! Come back here!

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.850
How can I leave my sis and run off?

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.630
I'll bring Sis back to her senses!

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.250
Earth Magic: Divided—

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:47.500
Sis's magic is really dense here. 
It's preventing me from using my magic well.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.990
The Black Bulls' captain was 
doing all that in here?!

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.950
I can't even fight properly?

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.010
No!

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.820
I'm only alive now...

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.040
because Sis saved me!

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.540
I'll wake Sis up, even if it kills me!

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.330
Quit screwing around!

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.550
Our mission right now is 
to protect and to survive!

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.910
I understand how you feel.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:25.720
Then—

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.230
But you need to survive for 
her sake, too, you dumbass!

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.950
I won't let anyone near 
my Sis! Especially men!

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.110
Please take care of Sis.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.000
Save the Blue Rose Knights' captain!

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.750
Leave it to me! Now get outta here.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.400
You cannot run now.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.090
Who said I was gonna run?

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.510
Dark Magic: Black Hole!

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.380
Your subordinate is crying, you know.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.860
Why the hell are you letting 
them control you like this?

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.310
You're not that weak,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.680
Charlotte!

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.100
You have my respect. You are strong.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:26.410
That magic sure is insane. 
My Black Hole can't absorb all that.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.850
If she fires that off cleanly,

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:33.040
it'll blow away half this town, and we'll
 be dealing with a bunch of dead people.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.600
Tch! You've always had my respect.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.380
So... I'll use everything I've 
got to take you back alive!

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.100
Dark Magic...

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.100
Briar Magic...

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.560
Crimson Vine Spear!

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.270
Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.370
Luck? Ben?

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.670
Golden magic... How beautiful.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.670
Such menacing magic...

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.240
It's the same as Vetto and the others.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.750
Why is that magic coming from you two?

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.360
Petit Clover

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.350
Petit Clover!

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.910
Noelle, the Beautiful Little
 Royal Girl of the "Na" Column

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.390
Noelle, the Beautiful Little 
Royal Girl of the "Na" Column.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.390
Languish (naeru).

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.500
Languish
(Naeru)

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.500
Gloomy gloom... I have no energy.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.950
Stew (nieru).

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.750
Stew
(Nieru)

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.750
Hot, hot, hot! You're stewing me!

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.500
Sew
(Nueru)

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.290
Sew (nueru).

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.500
Yay, I sewed this really well. Ow!

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.010
Nails (neiru).

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.220
Nails
(Neiru)

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.220
I-Isn't this one a bit of a stretch?

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.500
Noelle (Noeru)!

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.620
Look at my grand appearance! 
But what else did you expect?

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.450
I'm royalty!

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.440
What the?! The Eye of the Midnight Sun
 guy started shining outta nowhere,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.050
and now he's super strong!

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.190
Wait... Rill?!

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.780
Why the heck are you attacking us?

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.110

 Overwhelming Disadvantage

What are we going to do, 
Captain Mereoleona?!
