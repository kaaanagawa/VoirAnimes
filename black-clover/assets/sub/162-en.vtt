WEBVTT

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.880
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.340
a devil.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.420
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.760
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.890
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.850
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.860
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.730
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.780
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.370
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.000
Zenon, one of the members of the 
Dark Triad from the Spade Kingdom,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.460
attacked the Golden Dawn's headquarters 
along with some of the Dark Disciples.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.170
What do you think you're doing...

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.090
to my comrades?!

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.680
Yuno let his rage explode after 
seeing his comrades injured,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.620
and he defeated the Dark Disciples.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.220
55%.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.920
It's not that you're weak.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.810
It's just that I'm far superior.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.600
It looked as though Yuno had died,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.290
but thanks to the spell Vangeance 
left behind, the Budding of Yggdrasil,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.910
he came back to life.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.180
The Great War Breaks Out

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.920
Humans are evil creatures.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.420
Rage,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.290
fear,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.750
hatred,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.670
revenge,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.470
and destruction...

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.930
The true nature of humans is evil.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.480
And we have grown bored of this world.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.520
Now, then...

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.190
I guess I should get going, as well.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.190
I can't wait to see what 
kind of human he is...

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.450
Arcane stage... Yami Sukehiro.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.410
This is awesome!

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.380
Aw, I wonder how Loropechika 
and her friends are doing.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.710
I hope they're super energetic!

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.210
They'd be even more fun to destroy then.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.970
So yummy...

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.140
The Heart Kingdom's food is so yummy.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.390
So cute... Charmy's so cute.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.380
Oh, dear. It looks like one troublemaker 
took a liking to another.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.440
Hey, Loropechika!

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.110
No more spoiling Charmy.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.990
She's about to burst.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.610
Don't you worry.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.740
Charmy's cute no matter what shape she's in.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.010
I will always be a glutton no matter 
what shape I'm in, and nothing more.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.770
I'm not exactly sure why she 
came to the Heart Kingdom.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.670
Honestly...

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.260
Our battle with the Spade Kingdom's 
going to happen any day now.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.780
I'm ready to go anytime.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.060
As am I!

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.810
We have conquered all of the towns 
along the Spade Kingdom's border,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.030
so we now have a foothold.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.270
But we must keep in step.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.230
That's also why Rill and Charlotte

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.900
have returned to the Clover 
Kingdom for a captains' meeting.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.830
But it's also difficult trying 
to hold in these raging emotions.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.830
Wanna fight me, then? I haven't 
gotten to fight you for real yet.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.840
Indeed, you're right!

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.920
While we're at it, let us include 
Asta and have a three-way battle!

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.550
Asta's not here, though.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.300
What?!

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.310
Training's calmed down for now, so he wanted 
to take some gifts back to our hideout.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.430
He went back home with Finral for now.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.310
It's better to relax 
before the battle begins.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.070
Why don't you all have 
something to eat, as well?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.070
This is all mine, by the way.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.620
The rest of you, please eat something else.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.970
Apparently every last 
morsel here is for Charmy.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.540
I told you to stop spoiling her!

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.970
Undine!

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.720
Yes.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.800
What's wrong, Loropechika?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.890
We're under attack.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.970
In total...

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.100
There are six in various locations 
throughout the kingdom.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.480
When did they...

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.270
They got through the Mana 
Zone barrier with ease.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.280
We've told all of the Spirit Guardians

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.820
the locations of the enemies 
through Undine's clones.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.950
They've gone to defend immediately.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:33.990
But...

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.330
All six have the devil's power, 
and they're all stage zero.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.520
Even the Spirit Guardians may 
have trouble against them.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.010
Depending on how this goes, 
I may need to ask for your help.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.260
Loropechika!

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.550
This extraordinary magic...

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.350
It belongs to the Dark Triad's Vanica,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.020
the devil-possessed who hosts Megicula.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.230
Megicula...

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.280
Nice!

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.300
Dark Disciple
Robero Ringert

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.620
From the looks of it, we've probably 
killed about a hundred of them.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.540
Lady Vanica, we should—

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.250
Not yet.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.960
The more filth we kill in this kingdom, 
the more serious Loropechika will get.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.970
That makes things way more fun!

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.930
As you wish, Lady Vanica...

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.720
Please... step on me more!

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.180
Gross.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.730
The neutral zone between the Clover 
Kingdom and the Spade Kingdom.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:55.570
The Black Bulls' hideout was placed 
here as a front line of defense.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.490
Hey, guys!

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.250
I've brought gifts!

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.130
Well, aren't you thoughtful 
after being gone for so long?

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.300
There are no good drinking 
snacks anywhere around here.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.920
W-W-Welcome home!

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.050
More importantly, I lack Marie essence.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.930
Yeah, I can't really do anything about that.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.810
Hey, the captains' meeting 
should be done soon.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.350
Guess I'd better go pick up Yami.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.690
Must be rough always going back and forth.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.190
Thanks for everything you do, Finral.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.200
Yeah, I'm freakin' exhausted.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.910
It's pretty far, so I'm gonna make a few 
stops along the way. It'll take a while.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.080
Roger!

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.540
See you guys later.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.580
How do you think Gordon's doing 
with his curse magic studies?

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.210
How the hell would I know?

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.670
I just know that I'm never 
going near that house again.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.850
This is hard.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.730
You can do it, son.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.560
I believe in you.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.070
Gordon, I've brought your dinner.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.110
This is...

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.450
This is the same sandwich you made 
me when we went on our first date!

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.210
This takes me back to the good old days.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.290
You were eighteen. I was seventeen.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.710
It was destiny.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.260
Tell me more about how 
you met, Mama, Papa.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.510
Of course.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.270
I'm just going to concentrate on my studies.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.900
Is Henry resting?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.650
Apparently, he's lacking mana.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.110
A good number of us aren't here 
because of training and such.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.860
And since Charmy's gone right now,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.580
we have no way of eating 
mana recovery food.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.080
Charmy's totally hooked on the 
food in the Heart Kingdom.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.250
I guess Charmy's just 
Charmy wherever she goes.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.250
By the way, where's Magna?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.130
Oh, Magna...

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.220
Just when I thought he was 
back from the Heart Kingdom,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.800
he went off somewhere with Zora.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.060
Maybe they get along since 
they both look so mean.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.930
Every...one...

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.930
Henry?

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.810
The hell?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.810
Did something happen?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.070
The hideout is... floating!

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.400
It looks like Yami Sukehiro 
isn't home right now.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:45.620
I guess I'll play with all of 
you while I await his return.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.910
An attack from the Spade Kingdom?!

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.830
He's the one making the hideout float?

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.080
By himself?

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.920
Rouge!

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.340
Oh?

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.100
Here... we... go!

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.140
Recombination Magic: The Raging Black Bull.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.230
Well, he looks threatening enough. 
Guess I don't need to hold back!

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.440
Large Reflect Refrain!

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.860
Mana Rocket Punch!

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.860
Insolence.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.120
Gravity Magic: Presence of the Demon King.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
What the hell kind of magic is that?!

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.750
The trees in the area are breaking in half!

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.500
If we didn't have Rouge, 
we'd end up like that, too.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.010
Ah, you're still in your original shapes 
despite being hit by my spell.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.260
Apparently, one of you has magic 
that can manipulate natural laws.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.100
To think there was another besides 
Yami Sukehiro at the arcane stage.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.770
Excellent.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.150
You're gonna have to deal with me!

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.530
Well, aren't you a lively one?

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.040
Let's see how much you're 
able to entertain me.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.730
Black Slash!

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.060
Gravity Magic: Presence of the Demon King.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.330
He negated my magic and then attacked.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.000
Not bad.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.590
Magic that interferes with natural laws...

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.600
I didn't expect it to be enough 
to overturn death.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.760
You must be that cat's owner.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.240
You two, get behind Rouge!

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.320
Fight me!

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.450
Asta!

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.200
His magic... Not only is it powerful,
but its range is too vast.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.710
On top of using magic that 
interferes with natural laws,

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.300
you are absolutely beautiful. 
Stunning, really.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.880
You are worthy of Dante of the Dark Triad.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.890
The Dark Triad? From the Spade Kingdom?!

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.770
So he's the one ruling 
over the Spade Kingdom?

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.190
You there. Be my woman.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.270
What?!

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.770
The hell? You can't be serious!

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.490
Oh, I am very serious.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.800
So you're the evil boss, huh?!

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.950
Well, that was quite the surprise.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.410
To think there was a devil-possessed 
in the Clover Kingdom, too.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.920
Black Divider!

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.710
Black Meteorite!

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.310
I can't hit him!

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.850
He dodged an anti-magic spell 
made to track mana... and so easily.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.480
What do we do?

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.360
If he's able to dodge,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.110
we just gotta keep attacking 
until he can't dodge anymore!

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.780
How nice of him to show up here for us.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.490
If we defeat him here, this whole 
pain-in-the-ass ordeal will be over.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.200
Asta!

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.880
Gauche!

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.920
Look... at me!

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.620
Mirror Magic: Mirror Brigade!

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.550
Mirror Meteorites!

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.890
Take this!

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.600
With that much anti-magic going
around, and all at super speed,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.360
he has no way to block or dodge them!

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.650
50%.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.660
That's impossible!

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.400
He warped space?!

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.450
What just...

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.710
Let us talk for a while.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:33.420
Though we have different ranks, 
we are both possessed by devils.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.030
I'm sure we can see eye to eye.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.060
We're nothing alike!

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.270
All those terrible things you're 
doing to your own people...

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.270
I'll never see eye to eye with you!

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.610
I have no idea what you're talking about,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.800
but if you're speaking ill of me, 
I will take it as a compliment.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.780
Animals have no malice.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.750
It is the supreme emotion 
that only humans have.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.630
I'm sure you're very 
familiar with it yourself.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.000
Rage, hatred,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.720
revenge, and destruction...

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.590
The power of malice.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.220
When you unleash those feelings of malice,

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.270
you are the most human.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:27.650
Evil is humanity's true form.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.610
You're wrong!

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.860
Even I have times when 
I'm filled with bad thoughts.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.490
Sometimes that even makes me more powerful!

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:45.710
But I have a strong heart that allows 
me to control that and use it for good!

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.990
That's what it means to be human!

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.960
It appears that you're a rather 
unique devil-possessed.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.000
As long as I'm here, I won't 
let any of my friends die!

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.250
Honestly...

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.730
You are my woman.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.560
That means you can't use 
that power for anyone else,

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.500
you bad little girl.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.240
60%.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.830
No... I trained and worked 
so hard to increase my mana,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.290
and it was all expended in an instant.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:39.430
This isn't good. I don't have enough mana
 to move the Black Bull... any longer...

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.810
I can't... move...

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.290
We're being pinned down from every direction!

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.030
I have to do something...

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.060
Gravity Magic: Evil God's Pressure Craft.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.040
You leave me no choice.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.330
I'll awaken your true feelings for you.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:13.630
Don't...

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.050
Stop...

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.080
Stop...

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.830
Stop!

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.560
Gauche!

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.860
My beloved... son...

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.870
Now that's what truly makes you...

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.460
human!

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.800
Asta's attack managed to erase that 
guy's magic in this whole area.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.250
Now, then... Let's see how you do.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:30.780
Attacks like that will never reach me.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:38.280
I wanted to chat a bit, but it appears 
you're too busy losing yourself.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.300
Who might that devil be,

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.630
Lucifero?

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:50.810
I do not know. If there are any high-ranking 
devils in this world right now,

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.640
it would probably be Zagred, 
who left the underworld.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.310
But it doesn't appear to be him.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.610
A makeshift power like 
being able to erase magic

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.070
is probably the work of a low-ranking 
nothing with only trifling mana.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.700
So that means he's no match for us,

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.700
the ones possessed by 
the highest-ranking devils...

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.910
The Dark Triad!

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.470
What in the world is this battle?!

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.150
Asta... Are his devil powers going berserk?

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.980
But right now, we have no 
choice but to rely on Asta.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.000
This isn't good. He won't last long.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.500
Nero, who can seal wounds, isn't here.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.610
Even if she was, this might be too...

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.010
Gauche...

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.130
Gauche...

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.590
I couldn't...

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.010
I couldn't do anything...

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:20.480
My transformation magic... 
is absolutely useless!

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.390
I'm impressed that you can still 
do all this in that state.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.320
I guess I'll finish you now.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.490
Goodness. You're still not giving up.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.280
Anything you do is futile.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.610
He managed to predict...

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.520
where I'd show up?

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.010
How dare you...

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.980
mark me?

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.870
Please don't die, Gauche!

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.980
After all, you're my...

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.770
Your what?

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.470
I-I'm so embarrassed!

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:51.220
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 163: 
"Dante VS The Captain of the Black Bulls."

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:54.070
Page 163


00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:51.940
What is he, now?

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.730
I'm so embarrassed!
