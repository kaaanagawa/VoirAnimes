00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.550
Controlling blood. That is my magic.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.880
Ever since I cast that spell on you,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.980
I've been able to manipulate 
your blood as I please.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.940
Now, for your first task...

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.780
I shall force you to kill everyone 
here with your own two hands.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.280
Kill every last one of them perfectly.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.950
Asta fell under the Queen of Witches' 
control and tried to kill his friends, but...

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.410
Please! Make him stop!

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.250
No.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.630
You cannot escape me.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.130
After all, you are my daughter. My family.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.130
I'm... part of your family?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.510
You're not my family!

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.060
The Black Bulls are!

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.820
A new spell activated, arising from 
Vanessa's strong love for her friends.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.400
The red thread... of fate.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.910
Puppet's Blood has come undone?

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.420
This magic only takes the side of myself 
and those I have a family bond with.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.800
You and I have no bond.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.030
I'm Home

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.100
You and I have no bond.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.320
Impossible...

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.320
Your Majesty, look! 
I made a doll out of thread!

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.950
My, it's so well-made.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.850
I want to make everyone smile with my magic!

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.710
I'm sure you'll be able to, Vanessa.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.250
I obsessed so much over obtaining perfection

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.330
that I forgot something important.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.230
There is a power you can obtain from 
your feelings </i>because<i> you're imperfect.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.100
The magic you could not
obtain under my care...

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.150
It came to you only because 
you were free and imperfect.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.530
Perfect.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.280
Do as you wish.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.540
You have utterly defeated me.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.260
Blood Recovery Magic:
Curse-Breaking Blood-Filled Cocoon.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.830
Ow!

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.180
My wounds have healed!

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.050
Huh?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.550
She fully healed all of us.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.560
The Queen of Witches really is insane.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.820
We... won?

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.950
You're amazing, Vanessa!

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.670
We won... We won because of your magic!

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.550
Whoo!

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.100
Thank goodness.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.930
I'm so glad you're okay!

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.440
Do you know how worried I was about you?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.930
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.890
I see you're naked, as usual.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.600
Huh? When did that happen?

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.250
It's been a while, you two.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.980
It's good to see you.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.490
Why, you little...

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.370
It's all thanks to you, Vanessa.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.120
No.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.630
It's thanks to all of you.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.130
It's because all of you were there for 
me that I was able to use that spell.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.260
Thank you.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.110
I guess so.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.650
Huh?

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.480
Woohoo! It doesn't hurt!

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.490
It doesn't hurt at all! Actually, 
I feel as light as a feather!

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.830
The moment he gets back on his feet...

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.890
Talk about energetic.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.160
Hey, Stupidsta! You're practically naked!

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.700
You're bringing that up now?!

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.100
Maybe he took after you, Master.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.080
What?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.370
But just look at me now, Noelle!

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.710
As soon as I was healed, I felt like 
my muscles were even more powerful!

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.960
Stupidsta!

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.210
This bird...

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.100
Thank goodness those violent 
people finally left.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.230
That's what they get for 
attacking the Witches' Forest!

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.730
The Eye of the Midnight Sun

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.130
was apparently looking for a 
magic stone that's in this forest.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.870
Do you know anything about that?

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.480
I would assume the magic 
stone you speak of is this.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.330
I have no need of it. You may have it.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.590
Huh? The magic stone?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.090
Whoa, thank you!

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.150
Holy crap! We got the 
magic stone just that easily!

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.140
Yami's gonna praise us for this!

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.220
Hey, it seemed like the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun wanted this.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.900
Do you have any idea why?

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.550
Actually, who the heck are they, anyway?

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.020
Do you know anything about them?

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.820
That magic stone is a magical item 
that heightens the wearer's powers,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.490
but only those of the elf tribe
 are truly able to use it.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.730
Elves?

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.410
The elves possessed great power.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:48.090
They lived in what is now called the 
Forsaken Realm several centuries ago.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.970
Each individual elf had an extraordinary 
amount of magical power.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.880
Many of them were equal to me.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.970
Several centuries? Lady, how old are you?

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.640
Your skin is way too flawless.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.030
But...

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:08.980
The humans outnumbered them, and when 
they fought them, the elves were annihilated.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.400
That Fana girl's third eye...

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.740
That is forbidden magic.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:22.370
But that girl wasn't the one who 
activated that spell. It was someone else.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.500
Ordinary humans are unable to 
meddle with forbidden magic.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.920
I-I'm so completely lost.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.050
Activating a forbidden spell

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:36.030
requires a tremendous amount of 
mana and some sort of sacrifice.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.070
The ancient demon was also 
a top-level forbidden spell

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.810
activated by the leader of the elf clan.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.780
That demon?

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:55.570
It could be that the Eye of the Midnight Sun
are descendants of the elves.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.570
It couldn't be.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.680
Are you telling me the evil 
monsters from the picture book

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.580
my nanny read to me as a
 child were actually elves?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.690
Holy crap! We're getting a 
ton of amazing new intel!

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.550
Reporting! I'm gonna 
become a reporting fiend!

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.790
And Asta, the two swords you bear...

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.690
They are the ruined remains of the 
magic swords used by the elves' leader.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.210
What does that mean?!

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.400
Asta's head exploded because he couldn't 
keep up with the conversation!

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.480
Get a hold of yourself, Stupidsta!

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.280
He can't! He's too dumb to 
handle any more of this!

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.950
If you continue to fight them, that mystery 
should also be resolved eventually.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.910
Yeah, he's done.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.870
So you're really going back 
to the Diamond Kingdom?

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.290
Yeah.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.530
The Queen of Witches sealed the effects 
of Puppet's Blood into this medicine.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.580
I'll pass it off as some longevity 
drug and give it to the king,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.800
and put an end to Morris's plans.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.810
And I'll remake the Diamond Kingdom
 into a peaceful nation.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.660
I decided that I'll help Mars out.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:18.490
That seems like the quickest way to get into 
the top ranks of the Diamond Kingdom.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.200
Uh, can we trust this guy?

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.780
I'll become someone you can approve of,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.580
and one day I'll come to 
visit you again, Teach.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.670
We'll keep Fana with us.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.500
Mars, Ladros, don't push yourselves too hard.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.140
Don't worry. We'll take good care of her.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.510
I'll do my best to make sure she doesn't 
have to see Master naked.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.260
Fana, I'm sorry. Please wait
 until I've changed the country.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.370
I swear that I'll make the Diamond Kingdom 
the sort of place you can return to.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.940
I'll wait as long as it takes!

00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:00.210
Once the Diamond Kingdom is peaceful, 
let's go see the world together!

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.530
Of course!

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.490
I'm so jealous!

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.480
Sister, one day, that'll be you and me.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.410
Asta...

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.810
You called me a friend.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.130
If you run into trouble, I'll come help 
you at any time, no matter where you are.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.970
That's what friends are for, right?

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.130
Yeah!

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.360
If you ever need any help, let me know!

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.600
I'll blast my way right 
into the Diamond Kingdom!

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.690
You are free.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.490
But this is still your birthplace.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.450
You may come to visit whenever you'd like.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.100
If I start at number two,
I'll be at the top in no time!

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.510
Hey, don't forget to support Mars!

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.770
Yeah, I know, I know!

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.800
You can't be trusted.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.390
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.290
Miz Vanessa!

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.860
Have you finished your goodbyes?

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.190
Let's get the heck out of this creepy forest.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.930
Aw, man... I didn't have a chance 
to get close to any of the witchies.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.570
Huh? Hey, don't laugh!

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.630
Thank you for healing Asta.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.590
See you again someday.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.840
Captain Yami! My arms are fixed!

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.840
We actually made it back alive!

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.840
Thanks to everyone, I'm healed!

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.130
It was nothing.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.520
Oh, cool.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.630
So why are you half-naked?

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.930
What?! That's it?!

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.230
Captain Yami! We found a magic stone!

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.390
For real?!

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.770
All right, kid. Here's your first mission 
since getting your arms fixed.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.280
Go get me some booze!

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.820
Huh?!

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.320
Fine! I'll go at maximum speed!

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.160
Wait, the others aren't back yet?

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.240
Huh? They probably dropped 
dead in a ditch somewhere.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.570
Seriously?

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.370
Come on. If you don't want 
to die too, get going.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.790
Yes, sir!

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.250
Captain.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.050
Yo. Welcome back.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.080
I'm home!

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.690
I bought you some!

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.590
That really was fast. Talk about creepy.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.860
So what's my next mission?!

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.140
Take a break.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.320
You're working too much. 
No more missions for a while.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.300
Also, put some damn clothes on.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:55.910
Yup.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.820
No way... If you take my missions 
away from me, what do I have left?!

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.880
Muscles.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.010
Oh, come on. You don't need to cry that much.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.340
Here, I brought you some clothes. 
Hurry up and put them on.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.260
We're home.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.840
Oh, you're finally back.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.600
That's Magna's voice!

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.370
That's right! Magna and Luck went to 
a dungeon to find a way to fix my arms.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.020
I've gotta thank them!

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.660
What the heck?! 
Something crazy happened to them!

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.770
Fallen angel who lost your wings... 
In order to see you smile again,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.250
we traveled to a dungeon.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.980
We were lost in the dark, drowning in despair,

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.650
and my heart came close 
to breaking many times...

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.880
But every time that happened, 
I would see a vision of you.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.400
You shook my soul. I killed my 
weaker self and continued fighting!

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.620
Did his personality completely change?!

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.500
The mana is calling me.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.180
You, too?!

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.400
We wandered the dungeon, disposed of 
our enemies, and I became more powerful.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.650
But there was just one important 
thing I couldn't find:

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.900
a spell to heal the wounds 
that torment you.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.760
Powerless and defeated, I had to go home.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.130
The mana is calling me.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.240
Oh, my arms are fixed!

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.460
What the hell? Well, 
good for you, you little punk!

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.610
Thanks!

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.170
Way to go, Asta! Now let's kill each other!

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.110
No!

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.380
We're back.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.660
Gauche...

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.950
That's right. Gauche and Gordon also went 
to the royal library to fix my arms.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.350
I've gotta thank them.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.480
What the heck?! They turned into nerds?!

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.000
I have awakened to the splendor of magic.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.650
Beautiful spell arrays are like paintings.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.000
Amazing, Master Gordon.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.610
Seriously, why did your 
personality change, too?!

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.290
Magic truly is the ultimate artistic masterpiece.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.290
And I still have no idea what you're saying!

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.820
But, but, we still haven't found a 
cure for your arms, Master Asta.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.840
No matter how long it takes,
we'll find a way to remove the curse.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.670
Please wait, please wait, 
please wait, I implore you!

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.170
Oh, my arms are fixed!

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.680
What was that, you little punk?! 
I said I'd fix them someday!

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.150
Go get yourself cursed again, damn it!

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.390
What?!

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.650
Your nose is bleeding, Gauche!

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.250
It's from rage, damn it!

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.610
Hey, it happened again.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.690
Shut up, you dumbass!

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.800
I know...

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.800
That your nose only bleeds

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.050
when you wish really hard for someone
 important to you to be happy.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.430
I realized that because this was the first time
 we'd ever been alone together for so long.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.690
This might be the way to cure Asta's arms!

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.750
Damn it, that won't work!

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.240
It always happens when you
 think about your little sister,

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.950
but your nose was secretly bleeding when
 you were thinking about Asta, too...

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.230
This is dumb. I'm going 
to stare at Marie now.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.960
You actually care about Asta

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.710
just as much as you care for your little sister.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.510
Just like your sister, yes, Asta is family.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.300
Which means that since I'm Asta's
best friend, I'm also your family...

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.470
I'm back...

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.370
Miz Charmy—

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.420
What the heck?!

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.420
Hi, it's me, Charmy.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.960
I got infested with magic mushroom parasites.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.880
Should you really be eating those?!

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.430
I can't transform properly! 
This is so embarrassing!

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.760
Should you really be embarrassed right now?!

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.140
Miz Charmy! Don't eat any more of those!

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.570
I-I can't stop...

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.690
You ate one, and three more sprouted up!

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.450
Here, try one.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.860
Heck no!

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.760
I picked lots of other yummy things, too.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.120
You risked your lives for that?!

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.900
But I'm sorry... We couldn't 
find a way to fix your arms.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.120
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.090
Huh? Huh?!

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.540
You're cured! How embarrassing!

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.590
There's really nothing 
embarrassing about that!

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.670
Well, it looks like we've got 
plenty of food and drink.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:28.310
I'm making muscle-for-brains 
over there take a break,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.810
so let's have some fun.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.730
Party time!

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.530
It's so nice to be able to eat with my hands!

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:44.480
Oh, since no one was around this morning, 
I didn't get to feed them yet.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.640
Hey, kid!

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.490
Yes, sir?

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.660
You guys must be starving. 
Don't worry, I've got plenty for you!

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.210
Of course this happens!

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.040
Oh, yeah. No one's done the laundry, either.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.080
Where am I supposed to hang all these?!

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.220
No one's cleaned the place, either.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.760
Hey, kid!

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.560
Yes, sir?

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:22.400
I'm out of toilet paper. Go get me some.
 And who told you to open the door?

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.350
My bad!

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.770
And on to the next!

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.530
The captain told him to rest,

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.170
but he's not getting a chance to rest at all.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.420
Well, I'm sure that's fine for Stupidsta.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.180
Yes... This is where I feel most at ease.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.520
To to mention—

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.570
You guys are the best!

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.280
The thing I found in the outside world

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.850
is my other family.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:42.340
Petit Clover

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.640
Petit Clover!

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.840
I Wonder Why

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.810
I Wonder Why.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.840
What's the matter, Asta?

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:54.030
I wonder why Fana doesn't get burned 
when Salamander is covered in flames.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.600
Probably because it's magic?

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.630
I wonder why your clothes don't get 
wet inside the Sea Dragon's Lair.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.110
Because it's magic.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:06.340
Why doesn't konbu seaweed 
flavor the ocean like dashi?

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.720
Leave any food questions 
to me, Professor Charmy!

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.870
The component that gives konbu dashi its 
flavor, glutamic acid, lies within its cells.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.550
Those cells have what's called 
"selective permeability,"

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.870
which gives it the ability 
to take in what's necessary

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.620
and get rid of everything it doesn't need.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.410
The glutamic acid that creates the dashi 
in konbu is necessary for its survival,

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.660
so it doesn't leave its cells while 
it's still alive within the ocean!

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.520
But once it dies and is dried, 
the cells break apart,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.890
causing the glutamic acid to come out,
 which turns into dashi.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.920
There's no way Stupidsta's 
going to understand any of that.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.890
The Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.930
They're definitely going to strike 
again so they can get the magic stone.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.810
Exactly what are they after?

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:51.460
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 66: "The Eye 
of the Midnight Sun's Secret."

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:54.000
Page 66
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun's Secret

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.730
Being a heavy drinker is my magic!
