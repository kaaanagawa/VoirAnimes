00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.610
As a plan to get a strategic upper 
hand against the Clover Kingdom,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.020
the Diamond Kingdom attacked 
the border town of Kiten.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.100
But the Golden Dawn arrived 
there before anyone else

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.400
and faced off with the Diamond army,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.280
quelling the situation.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.990
Wind Magic: Swift White Bow.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.370
I thought I saw a familiar little speck.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.870
What are you doing here, Asta?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.170
The fact that you're so beat up means...

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.830
You got stronger again, didn't you?

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.780
Huh?

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.680
I'm not losing to you, Asta.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.510
Look who's talking! You got 
crazy strong, too, you jerk!

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.890
I'm not gonna lose either, Yuno!

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.700
Behind the Mask

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.840
Your arm... Is it okay?

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.780
Yeah, I'm fine!

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.910
See? No problem at all!

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.420
I see. It looks like you're 
as reckless as ever.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.340
Y-Yuno's actually smiling?

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.930
I think you got a little taller 
since I last saw you, Yuno.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.560
What the heck? He always acts 
apathetic when he's with me!

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.310
Oh, yeah. I might've grown 
four or five centimeters.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.310
How do you keep getting taller so easily?!

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.310
Damn it! I'm not gonna lose!

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.600
I'm gonna get 20 centimeters taller 
by tomorrow and look down on you!

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.850
Not a chance.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.490
What are you doing, Yuno?!

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.420
Yuno, who the heck is this twerp?!

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.630
You're acting all apathetic again!

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.890
What the heck is that fussy, 
mysterious little critter?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.700
Is that the Sylph I've heard so much about?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.720
I've never seen Yuno make that face! 
Is this the power of the Sylph?!

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.470
Tell me! Who is this mummified shrimp?!

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.700
Hey, you're small, too!

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.610
He's a guy I used to live with.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.070
Y-Y-Y-You...

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.280
Y-You lived with him?

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.560
We would eat together, study together...

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.950
...sleep in the same bed together, 
and even bathe together.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.760
Slept in the same bed... and even bathed...?

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.590
Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky, sneaky...

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.260
U-Um...

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.080
It's been a while!

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.440
Um, thank you so much for 
saving my meal last time.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.770
Are you all better now?

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.610
Oh, you're the girl from back then...
From the Black Bulls.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.540
Please enjoy this after-battle snack!

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.450
Thanks.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.450
I'll even thrown in some extra dragees.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.050
Thanks.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.100
Now who's this insolent child?
She's clearly head over heels for Yuno.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.590
I'm Charmy. May I call you "Yuno"?

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.130
Sure.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.160
La!

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.290
This is good.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.590
La, la!

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.600
But my Sylph senses are telling me that 
she doesn't actually pose a threat.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.560
I'm sorry for pushing you 
down so suddenly back then.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.550
La...

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.280
Oh, don't worry about that! It's just 
something that did indeed happen!

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.450
P-Push... P-Pushed down?!

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.510
La?!

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.580
Why, you... You must've used some 
sneaky spell to seduce Yuno!

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.160
You snot-nosed little brat!

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.830
La? What's this creature?

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.170
Are you yummy?

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.680
Miz Charmy! She's a spirit!

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.420
Don't eat her!

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.760
What's with you people?!

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.930
Yuno belongs to me, dang it!

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.240
"Snot-nosed little brat"? 
I can't let that slide.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.910
I'm nineteen!

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.940
I'm older than Yuno and 
rather sophisticated, too!

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.440
My sexiness doesn't need 
any magical enhancement!

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.440
Sexy?! You're built like a grade-schooler, 
besides your giant forehead!

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.940
La?! Oh, you did <i>not</i> just go there!

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.240
You're also built like a grade-schooler 
and have a giant forehead!

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.300
What did you say?! I'll show you 
what happens when you cross a Sylph!

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.210
You insolent little brat!

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.260
I'll fry you up and eat you!

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.680
La!

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.820
Come back here, you little insect!

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.380
Calm down, Miz Charmy!

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.660
Bell, that's enough.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.230
Hup.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.120
Hey, looks like you're having fun.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.380
Let me join in.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.610
Finral.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.880
Who's that?

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.160
This is my senior from 
the Black Bulls, Finral.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.640
You guys haven't met before?

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.470
Nope.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.120
It's fine. Not like I'd catch the 
eye of an elite from the Golden—

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.120
What's this?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.790
Well, well... If it isn't my big brother.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.420
It's been so long! I never 
dreamed I'd run into you here.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.260
Langris...

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.590
Who's that?

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.400
What's the black sheep of our family,
 who can barely even fight,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.100
even doing on the battlefield?

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.150
Finral, who's that rude little twerp?!

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.520
He's my little brother.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.910
Huh?

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.690
That's the Vice Captain of the 
Golden Dawn, Langris Vaude.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.320
Golden Dawn Vice Captain
Langris Vaude

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.150
What? Vice captain?!

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.840
Are you still acting as the  
Black Bulls' pack mule, Finral?

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.690
It looks like I'll have to be the next head

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.540
of the Vaude family, 
since you're such a loser.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.620
Get over yourself!

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.790
Finral's awesome!

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.380
At the Underwater Temple,

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.770
it was only because I had Finral's help 
that we were able to defeat the enemy!

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.480
Wow! You mean you were actually 
useful for once in your life?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.890
More importantly, how can you talk to 
your big brother like that, you punk?!

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.520
How dare you address the Vice Captain 
of the Golden Dawn like that?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.520
Wh-What did you say?!

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.670
It's okay, Asta. He's only telling the truth.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.700
But...

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.820
It's fine.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.290
We've already cleaned up
 most of the enemies...

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.790
Or rather, our captain dealt 
with most of them himself.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.280
The Bulls aren't needed here anymore.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.670
And anyway...

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.460
When did the Black Bulls 
become a daycare center?

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.010
Looking after two children must be rough.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.850
Aren't you embarrassed at having 
to babysit those two rugrats?

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.490
Who're you calling a rugrat?!

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.810
I'll show you the charms of a mature woman!

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.810
I'm not a little kid, damn it!

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.820
Langris, you can insult me 
to your heart's content.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.360
Hmph.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.610
But... don't you dare insult the 
members of my Black Bulls!

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.910
Wow. Who knew you could look so scary?

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.890
You little brat...

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.510
On the honor of the Eight Shining Generals, 
I'm taking your head back home with me!

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.640
Oh, dear... You're still alive?

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.310
Not only that, but at this rate,

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.020
my spatial magic is going
 to hit those civilians.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.040
You can't lay a finger on me, Magic Knights!

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.200
Save us!

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.080
I don't have time to hesitate.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.530
Oh, well. They'll just have to be noble 
sacrifices for the sake of our country.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.920
Hold it!

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.350
How can you even think about 
abandoning our citizens?!

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.420
We're Magic Knights!

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.800
And if this goes on, we'll just 
end up with even more victims!

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.430
Shut up! I'm not gonna abandon anyone!

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.490
Finral! Miz Charmy!

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.360
Right!

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.200
Roger!

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.570
Just you watch, Yuno!

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.720
Let's see what you've got.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.020
What can you possibly do 
in the condition you're in?

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.330
Talk about a lively retreat...

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.400
Cotton Creation Magic: Fluffy Sheep Cushion!

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.340
Who the hell are you?! 
Stay out of this, brat!

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.670
Spatial magic?

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.290
Wh-What?! My magic disappeared!

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.410
What did you do, you brat?!

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.650
Looks like I owe you one, Yuno.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.870
Your fighting style's 
as insane as ever, Asta.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.370
Yuno's smiling again! Hmph!

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.910
Langris...

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.480
You're right. I can't beat you.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.710
But...

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.290
The Black Bulls will beat the Golden Dawn!

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.550
Yeah!

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:31.390
Man, your world tree magic 
is as impressive as ever.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.750
Exactly what are you trying to say?

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.600
I'm someone who believes his gut instincts.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.110
Vangeance...

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.700
Could you take off that mask?

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.400
Vangeance...

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.880
Could you take off that mask?

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.110
This isn't a face that most 
people would want to see.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.140
What? Are you, like, super ugly 
under there or something?

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.920
Don't worry. I promise I won't laugh.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.620
I know what this is, Yami.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:19.150
You suspect that I may be the leader of 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun, don't you?

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.930
Frankly, yeah.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:28.260
His light magic and your world 
tree magic are obviously different,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.450
but something's really bugging me.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.540
Their builds, their voices, and more 
than anything, their ki feels the same.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.840
But...

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.210
I think it's been about ten 
years since I first met you.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.670
Indeed.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:45.770
We met on the battlefield, and after that, 
we fought together from time to time.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.210
Then we became captains at the same time.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.930
Nozel's braid shook like 
crazy when that happened.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.580
It's not like we're best buds or anything,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.690
but we go back pretty far, don't we?

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.550
I feel something similar in you...

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.940
So just let me see your face, all right?

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:06.950
Very well.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.090
That's one hell of a scar. 
Did you get it on the battlefield?

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.800
No, I was born with it.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.600
They called me a cursed child.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.130
A cursed child?

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.760
Even magic couldn't fix this scar.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.530
It creeped out the people around me,
 and they came to fear me.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.360
I was the illegitimate 
child of a certain noble.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.270
I lived in the Forsaken Realm
 until I was eight.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:54.410
But following the loss of that noble's heir,
I was taken in as an aristocrat.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.870
Fortunately, I had great magical power,
and my world tree magic was viewed with awe.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.280
But even there, they loathed my face.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.380
In addition, my foster mother 
brutally abused me.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.400
It was a hellish childhood.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.430
You sure had it rough, didn't you?

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.540
But in the midst of all that,
I met Master Julius.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.400
He didn't care about my appearance.
All he saw was my power.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.960
Little boy, what kind of magic is that?

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.910
I-It's world tree magic, sir.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.870
World tree magic?! How sublime and majestic!

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.710
That's terrific!

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.420
Most of all... It's as though your 
kindness is trying to protect everything.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.970
What wonderful magic!

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.220
You should definitely join the Magic Knights!

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.010
Do you not want to?

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.250
N-No! I would love to...

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.480
I never even thought about 
joining the Magic Knights.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.820
But my face...

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.210
It's nothing to worry about.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.700
Huh?

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:22.710
It really is nothing to worry about, 
but if you <i>are</i> so worried about it...

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.540
In that case...

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.050
I'll give you this mask!

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.570
Master Julius, this is so... tacky.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.590
What?! But it's my best work!

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.870
I was happy.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.400
I wanted to pledge my 
grimoire to his service.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.900
This story sounds pretty familiar.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.690
The lines of his face also look like Licht's.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.410
But I can't sense the slightest 
trace of magic from his scar.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.690
He doesn't seem to be doing anything tricky 
with magic or showing me an illusion.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.290
And more than anything...

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.670
His ki tells me he's not lying.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.580
I guess this was just some odd coincidence.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.130
Sorry about that.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.250
No... I'm glad I was able to tell you 
and show you things as they really are.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.880
Thank you, Yami.

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.990
I see.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.210
Captain Vangeance! Captain Vangeance!

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.020
The Diamonds have begun to retreat.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.300
Understood. There's no need to 
pursue those who are fleeing.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.820
Could you concentrate on helping the injured?

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.230
Understood, sir.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.050
Shall we go, too? There are 
plenty of captives.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.130
It's going to be a pain 
transporting them all.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.120
Yeah.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.240
Oh, if we're transporting captives,
I brought some useful guys along.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.950
Let's work 'em to the bone.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.620
Within reason, of course.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.090
I wonder if a cute girl is talking about me.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.710
Looks like the fighting has calmed down, 
so why don't we meet up with Yami?

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:51.690
Good idea.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.890
La?! Already?

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.010
Well, see ya, Yuno.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.210
Yeah, see you, Asta. Don't eat
stuff you find lying on the ground.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.020
Like I'd do that! I mean, I used to, but...

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.480
Um, c-could I maybe ask for your address?

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.600
Stay away from Yuno, you thieving raccoon!

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.900
La! Scales!

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.160
Your scales are getting in my eyes!

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.780
La! No way!

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.770
I'm gonna fry you up!

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.200
Come back here!

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.200
Get away from me!

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.410
You little insect!

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.700
La?

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.200
La! I'm definitely going 
to fry you up next time!

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.330
I know it's too late to take it back now,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.710
but the worst squad just picked 
a fight with the best squad!

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.850
Does your stomach hurt, Finral?

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.880
I wanna hurry up and practice with my sword!

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.410
I wanted to talk with Yuno more!

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.190
I'm going to eat my sorrows away!

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.520
You guys are way too laid-back! I mean,
I'm the one who picked the fight, but...

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.720
Now, now. Here, eat this. Nomity noms.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.820
Hey, it's good.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.920
Honestly, what a vulgar bunch.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.050
You should be more careful about 
who you associate with, Yuno.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.170
Aren't you embarrassed to be seen with them?

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.480
Why?

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.790
I've never thought that, not even once.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.680
I'm proud of Asta, and he's my rival.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.770
Rival? That guy?

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.520
Rival in what? Are you guys 
competing for something?

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.440
Yeah...

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.290
By the way, Asta, was it okay to 
just leave so abruptly like that?

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.920
That handsome guy is your 
old friend, isn't he?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.950
It's fine!

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.720
We'll meet on some other battlefield, anyway.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.200
Because...

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.250
...we're both working to 
become the Wizard King!

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.600
The Wizard King?!

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.810
You really aren't embarrassed 
to say that at all, are you?!

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.020
Maybe you peasants don't
 even feel embarrassment.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.220
I'd expect no less from the great peasant 
who was chosen by the four-leaf grimoire!

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.140
What's your problem?! I won't 
allow you to make fun of Yuno—

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.370
There's no rule that says commoners 
can't become the Wizard King.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.550
Huh?

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.160
So first, I'll become the 
Captain of the Golden Dawn.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:25.110
I see. Meaning you're completely 
ignoring my existence as vice captain.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.630
Yuno, things are taken care of over here.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.520
All the wounded are taken care of, too.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.120
What in the world happened?

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.630
The Diamond forces have retreated,
and we've taken a number of captives.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.130
Kiten was successfully defended.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.910
Excellent work.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.010
Please see to the repair 
of the damaged buildings

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.860
and set up shelters immediately.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.180
Yes, sir.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.170
Now, then... I don't think that was

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.670
a serious attempt by the Diamonds 
to invade our kingdom.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.140
So what were they after?

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.030
I see... The Sylph, eh?

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.160
Offensive spatial magic...

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.660
Oh, and world tree magic 
that uses others' magic.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.240
I guess the rusty old generals of the 
previous era had their useful moments,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.830
but from here on out, this era belongs

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.550
to us Mage Warriors, the new generals!

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.170
Petit Clover

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.330
Petit Clover!

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.860
Together!

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.000
T-Together!

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.950
Is that the Sylph I've heard so much about?

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.170
I've never seen Yuno make that face!

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.740
Is this the power of the Sylph?!

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.580
He's a guy I used to live with.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.160
What?!

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.120
You can't be serious.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.480
You guys slept together?!

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.220
Asta, hey. You can't be serious...

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.630
You guys ate together?!

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.090
Go!

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.930
You can't be serious...

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.510
You guys bathed together?!

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.640
What's wrong with her?

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.930
No idea.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.800
Thank goodness.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.420
I didn't know what I was
 going to do if Vangeance

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.650
was actually Licht from
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.320
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 54: "Never Again."

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 54
Never Again

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.570
I know. I'll get him a hyottoko
mask from my homeland.
