WEBVTT

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.940
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.340
While the members of the 
Golden Dawn were stopping

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.360
the Diamond troops from invading Kiten,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.190
Yami asked Vangeance something that had 
been bothering him for a long time.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.730
Vangeance...

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.820
Could you take off that mask?

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.080
Yami, you suspect that I may be the leader of
the Eye of the Midnight Sun, don't you?

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.080
Very well.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.850
Sorry about that.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.190
As Asta and Yuno were reunited during 
this battle and renewed their ambitions...

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.190
We're both working to 
become the Wizard King!

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.610
...a new threat from the Diamond Kingdom 
was planning its next move.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.720
Never Again

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.570
Sounds like a lively bunch has arrived.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.170
Are you just not satisfied unless 
you're fighting something? Huh?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.130
My head! It's going to crack!

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.170
It's going to break!

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.360
Is that what's wrong with you?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.940
My body is moving on its own?!

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.990
Well, whatever. You fought 
despite how broken you are.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.990
Captain Yami, I can't! Please!

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.610
Spare me, please!

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.170
Have him take a look at you and your head.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.830
I think my head's being affected 
more now than it usually is!

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.830
Hey, Yami. Come on in.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.080
Who are you?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.790
This guy, who looks completely 
out of place in this tower,

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.900
is the kingdom's best quack doctor.
You might've gathered that from how he looks.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.020
That's so rude!

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.370
He managed to reattach one of my 
arms after it almost fell off before,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.500
so he's a great recovery mage.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.470
Have him check you out.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.980
I'm gonna get even more injured!

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.570
Are you all right?

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.480
Recovery Mage Who Works Directly Under the Wizard King
Owen

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.360
I'm Owen, a recovery mage who 
works directly under the Wizard King.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.480
Pleasure to meet you.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.240
I'm Asta! Thanks for seeing me!

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.670
I hear all about you when 
I go out drinking with Yami.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.110
Really?!

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.040
Yeah. I heard that you can nullify magic.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.750
Who knew such magic existed?

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.510
He works directly under the Wizard King?
Even I know what that means!

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.260
He must be an incredible quack doctor!

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.010
Welp, I've got something 
I gotta take care of.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.560
I've got a good feeling that
 I'm gonna win today.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.270
You're going gambling, aren't you?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.200
May Lady Luck be with you!

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.220
Jeez... Yami's younger than me, 
but he's much bolder. It's so irritating.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.620
He's not a bad guy, though.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.470
Yup!

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.310
Well, have a seat.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.530
Yes, sir.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.280
Now, then... Let's see.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.880
Water Recovery Magic: Qualle Operation.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.360
Wow, they got you good, didn't they?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.650
But don't you worry. My spell sees through 
the body of the person it envelops,

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.720
so I can get a clear look at the affected 
area and heal it with precision.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.330
Yami's amazing, but you've got 
some amazing muscles yourself.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.900
I work out!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.610
Now for some mana to promote healing...

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.570
Man, I finally got out of Kiten.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.830
Just how many captives 
did the Golden Dawn take?

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.790
Let's see, where's Asta...

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.710
Whoa, what the heck is that?!

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.620
Jellyfish... recovery magic?

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.920
Asta...

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.490
Oh, hey, Finral. Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.210
Oh, hey, Asta. No worries.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.360
Yami should show up any minute now.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.050
Hey!

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.890
Captain Yami, did you...

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.660
I was on fire today!

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.760
What's with the huge bag?

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.210
Huh? Forget it. Let's just go home.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.390
Hurry up with the spatial magic, Finral.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.600
Okay...

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.930
All right, listen up.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.700
I'm pretty sure some of you noticed,

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.160
but we've earned so many stars lately 
that we're actually out of the hole.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.540
This is all thanks to you 
dumbasses working hard.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.890
So eat all this meat!

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.300
Swoosh!

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.080
Swooshy, whooshy, whooshy, whoosh!

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.920
Meat! Here! There!

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.070
Everywhere! All of the meat!

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.890
So good!

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.450
Mister Yami's actually treating us!
 Today's a damn holiday!

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.770
I'm gonna eat a lifetime's worth of meat!

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.490
Marie, I'll only serve you the best meat.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.480
Here you go, Marie.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.160
I've cooked this meat to just above 
55 degrees Celsius, just high enough

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.320
to make sure you don't get food poisoning, 
but below 60 degrees Celsius,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.890
since that would make it tough.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.920
It's the best-cooked meat possible.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.920
This is his own personal opinion

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.010
Say, "Aah."

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.930
It's so good!

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.350
Magna, wanna kill each other 
over this hunk of meat?

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.300
Of course not, you idiot!

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.270
Aw, come on!

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.120
Is there anything more blissful 
than this? I can barely stand it.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.370
It's so hot! But so good!

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.040
P-Pwease dun mook at muh ben 
I'm meating! It's embarrassing!

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.680
You only eat barbecue with
 those who are special to you.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.630
Asta and I are special friends
 who share the same meat...

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.420
Asta, you can't eat with 
your arms like that, right?

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.090
Y-You're so helpless. I'll just 
have to feed you myself...

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.210
Woohoo! I can eat with my feet now!

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.840
I guess people can learn to do anything!

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.020
You filthy peasant!

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.480
All right, Finral! Show us a trick!

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.860
Huh? O-Oh, sure...

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.290
Secret Technique: Stop Hitting Yourself!

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.360
All right! You're next, Charmy!

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.070
Secret Technique: Instant Disappearing Meat!

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.700
La, la, la...

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.590
All you did was eat it instantly!

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.570
All right, Grey! You're next!

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.670
Do something!

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.640
I can't!

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.710
Shut up and do something!

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.680
S-Secret Technique: M****** ****xe!

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.420
You just turned into what 
you usually turn into!

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.870
Wow, everyone's so amazing.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.330
Everyone has their own special skill.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.580
I have something that
I've been secretly practicing.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.770
Do you mind if I show you guys?

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.780
Special Technique: Crackling Magna Typhoon!

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.950
Secret Technique: Meaty Sheepy Peacock!

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.490
Next, I'll work out!

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.490
That's not a special trick at all!

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.840
Man, I'm exhausted. 
I'm gonna call it a night!

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.380
Well, all right. Make sure 
you get plenty of rest!

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.250
Great work, everyone!

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.510
Isn't Asta acting a bit weird?

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.690
Yeah... I mean, when does he ever get tired?

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.690
Exactly. He just seems off today.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.280
Maybe I'll go cheer him up.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.660
Maybe if we try to kill 
each other, he'll feel better.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.950
He'll feel better if he eats 
some more meat, la!

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.250
I wonder if something happened.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.420
F-F-Forget I said anything!

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.270
Now that you mention it,
 the angle of his smile

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.980
seemed a little lower than usual...

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.260
Marie...

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.430
Guys, I have something to tell you.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.560
I overheard something when 
Asta was getting healed.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.250
The doctor said that Asta's arms

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.000
will never go back to normal.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.740
What?

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.030
What... are you saying?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.120
It looks like some kind of ancient 
curse has been placed upon them.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.580
On top of that, the bones are shattered.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:38.280
I'm very sorry, but I won't be able to 
heal you with the magic I have now.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.760
A curse, huh?

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.560
Impressive... You managed 
to draw me out, human.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.680
If that's what the best recovery 
mage in the Clover Kingdom said,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.940
then there's no doubt about it.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.440
No...

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.950
Just when I thought I'd 
found the ultimate partner...

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.120
This is way too harsh.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.960
The boy has no magic... and now 
he can't even use his only weapon?

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.500
La...

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.170
Unbelievable...

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.600
Asta...

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.650
You will never be able to 
swing your sword again.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.000
You will never be able to 
swing your sword again.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.510
Asta...

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.760
Like hell I'm gonna give up!

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.300
You just had to mess with 
me again, didn't you, fate?!

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.520
But you're just firing me 
up more, you bastard!

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.690
I'm gonna find a way to fix 
these arms, no matter what!

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:25.110
Or I'll find some kind of strength 
that lets me fight without my arms!

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.620
And you have no magic whatsoever.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.500
You must've been born that way.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.500
Then no matter how hard I try, 
I won't be able to use magic?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.880
Just give up on everything.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.630
You were born a loser!

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.050
I'm just going to give...

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.830
That one time was the very last time

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.680
I'm ever going to feel depressed!

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.490
Just you wait, you bastard!

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.450
Asta...

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.730
Now that that's settled, time to train!

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.990
Damn straight, kid.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.080
That's one hot-blooded guy, damn it!

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.450
Way to go, Asta.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.520
Yup!

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.300
I'm gonna share my snacks with him later, la.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.310
H-His optimism is absolutely amazing!

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.130
I believe in you.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.940
His courage is admirable,
 but I won't let him near Marie.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.790
Admirable courage, though.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.290
Just you wait, Yuno!

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.930
That's right. You can't give up, boy.

Magic from that country 
might be able to save you!

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.190
Good morning, everyone!

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.030
Huh?

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.300
There's usually someone in 
here making things lively...

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.740
Did something about the base change again?

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.820
Did everyone already head 
out somewhere for the day?

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.030
Hell if I know.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.210
Is everyone just slacking off?

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.400
They were partying 
pretty hard yesterday...

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.340
I sense someone's ki.
You can't hide from me!

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.420
That's Noelle and Finral.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.590
What're they up to?

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.430
Okay, we were able to send 
basically everyone off.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.030
I wish they'd all stop being so secretive.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.480
Asking me to send them places 
because something came up,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.670
or they suddenly remembered 
they had to be somewhere...

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.520
I know they're all sneaking away 
to try and find a cure for Asta.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.810
Huh?

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.790
Though I guess since they're not 
technically going on missions,

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.460
Yami might get mad at them.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.540
Not to mention, Asta would 
probably say something like,

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.370
"Forget about me! 
Please put any missions first!"

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.350
Well, this place looks pretty rough.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.450
You scared, Magna?

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.430
Like hell I am! I'm actually super excited!

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.840
Magna and Luck went to search some dungeon 
in a barren part of the Forsaken Realm.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.940
Just you wait, Asta!

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.970
Gauche and Gordon are researching 
hexes at the royal library.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.220
I want to hurry up and fix Asta's
arms so I can hold his hand.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.800
Our bond will get even stronger 
if I can heal his wounds.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.330
We'll be friends forever.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:19.700
Yes, BFFs...

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.680

I guess it might make Marie 
sad if he doesn't get better.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.660
Gauche is actually putting someone
else before his sister for once.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.810
I need to work harder.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.550
Charmy and Grey went to search for some 
unknown ingredients that work against curses.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.800
Grey

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.270

Who would've thought that the 
members of the worst, lowest,

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.350
and crudest squad would be 
working so hard for one newbie?

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.090
No kidding. Especially for 
such a dumb, reckless,

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.950
vulgar, no-magic peasant like him.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.420
You don't have to try so hard anymore,

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.380

wandered into the wrong place.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.130
What the heck is that peasant 
from the boonies saying?

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.130
You can't do a thing in this world.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.270
Even though he doesn't have any magic,

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.560
he just refuses to give up.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.880
Even though he doesn't have any magic,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.610
he's the first one into the battle,
and he fights harder than anyone else.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.860
And because he's like that,

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.140
Asta was able to give us 
the strength to fight.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:48.150
Now, it's our turn to help him fight!

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.340
I... wasn't blessed with any magic.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.610
That always frustrated me.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.360
But I sure was blessed 
with amazing friends...

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.260
Those dumbasses.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.950
If only they'd work this hard 
at their regular jobs.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.840
All right, Noelle!

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.700
Why don't we also go look for somewhere 
promising together— Crunch.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.540
Sorry, but there's somewhere 
I'd like you to take me.

You can go wherever you want on your own.

What? Where are you going?

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:04.520
I see! They might know 
something that we don't.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:05.890
Come to think of it...

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.390
Where the heck did Vanessa go?

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.810
She disappeared before anyone else.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.930
Maybe she has some kind of lead herself.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.440
I don't have any time to waste, either.
 Hurry up and take me.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:25.480
Maybe remember you're asking your senior 
for a favor... But, yeah, okay.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.670
Coming.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.670
Looks like he's home.
