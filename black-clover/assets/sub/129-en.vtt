WEBVTT

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.090
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.550
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.950
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.610
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.980
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.820
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.690
He continues to diligently 
aim for the top!

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.380
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.890
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.610
Asta and the others arrived

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.440
in the Heart Kingdom to learn 
more about the devil's curse,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.340
but Asta was taken away, and Noelle, Mimosa,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.940
and Finral were forced to fight 
the Spirit Guardian Gaja.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.460
Meanwhile, Asta, after being taken away,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.740
was forced into a fight with 
the Water Spirit, Undine.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.100
I'm Undine. I'm one of the four 
Great Spirits, and I'm contracted

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.030
to the Queen of the Heart Kingdom.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.250
Undine and Gaja...

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730
Asta and the others were 
forced to face one of

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.630
the four Great Spirits as well 
as a Spirit Guardian, but...

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.630
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.350
Sorry, but we can't just back down 
after you did all that showing off!

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.420
Pardon me! I'm coming in!

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.810
The Devil Megicula

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.580
A doll?

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.500
But I could've sworn I felt 
a person's ki in here.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.380
Uh...

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.860
Hey.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.340
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.340
This thick-pelted beaver just 
felt so good on my skin!

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.730
What the heck was that fo—

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.600
Glasses... My glasses....

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.860
Goodness... What are you doing, Loropechika?

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.700
I told you to hurry up and 
change out of your pajamas.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.230
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.780
Loropechika

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.910
So she's the queen of the Heart Kingdom?!

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.050
I might've been in trouble if 
my technique hadn't defended me.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.760
It appears that she was holding back.
 What a magnificent talent.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.430
Now, as for them...

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.980
He's way too fast!

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.980
I do apologize.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.990
I forced you into a fight in order 
to assess your magic stages.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.610
Huh?

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.980
Magic stages?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.890
The stage nine, eight, seven thing,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.160
where the smaller the number is,
the stronger you are?

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.420
Yes. Mages fight not with force of numbers, 
but with how powerful their magic is.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.190
There are cases where dozens may attack,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.990
and they would be no match for a single mage.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.930
That's why, in wars between magical nations,
 power is measured by magic stages.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.430
In other words, a kingdom's power 
is determined by how many mages

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.690
Stage Zero
Stage One
Stage Two
Stage Three
Stage Four
Stage Five
Stage Six
Stage Seven
Stage Eight
Stage Nine

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.690
it has that are near stage zero.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.570
And if you're dealing with a devil,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.320
no one lower than stage one will 
be able to keep up with it.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.650
A devil... That's right!

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.620
We came here because we detected 
a huge curse signal here that may be

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.790
the work of a devil!

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.420
Why do they know something that 
only a Spirit Guardian should know?

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.670
Do you know anything about devil curses?

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.710
You don't hold back, do you?

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.630
It's too bad for you, but no one's 
going to talk about them.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.820
Oh, that's me... I got cursed by a devil.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.520
If nothing is done, I'll die in about a year.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.680
Huh?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.770
Huh?!

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.770
Huh?!

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.990
Huh? Why did you tell them?! What?

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.540
Huh?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.190
Huh?

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.410
Huh?

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.980
Honestly... What am I going to do with you?

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.620
That side of you is adorable, too.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.470
That's right. The reason we brought 
you here and measured your magic stages

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.630
was so that we can defeat Megicula,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.750
the devil that cursed Loropechika.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.970
I'm sure this interests you, too.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.150
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom,
 please join us in—

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.760
What's wrong?!

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.360
I forgot to water the poplatatta trees!

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.770
D'oh!

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.410
I'm pretty sure we were in the 
middle of talking about something

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.050
really important just now!

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.530
Is it okay for the queen of 
a kingdom to act like that?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.860
Holy crap!

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.670
There you go. Have some water.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.020
I see the zozo squirrels 
are as lively as ever today.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.850
Hey now, Michely. Don't run too fast.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.440
Old man Kakalasa's cough seems 
to be better. That's great.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.030
Oh, the totohl fruits grew so splendidly!

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.280
She's watering whole forests at once!

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.900
She obtained information from all 
around the kingdom in an instant.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.660
And she's controlling the water everywhere.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.810
An all-encompassing benevolence

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.590
combined with delicacy that 
doesn't miss a single thing...

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.150
So this is the magic of 
the Heart Kingdom's queen.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.590
Now, now, Loropechika...

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.850
Go and get changed into 
some proper clothes already.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:41.350
The current queen has inherited the 
power of most of the previous queens.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.350
The guardian deity of the beautiful 
and peaceful Heart Kingdom...

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.910
The all-knowing priestess...

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.610
Someone who cannot be lost to a devil's curse.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.870
There is no one else like her!

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.060
See? You're beautiful when you 
actually clean yourself up.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.840
But it's so hard to move in this...

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.510
Why, though?!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.030
For crying out loud, Loropechika...

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.010
I get it! Her insane klutziness must 
be due to the devil's curse, too!

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.620
Oh, no. That's just me.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.370
What?!

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.360
Curse... The loathsome devil that 
cursed my beloved Loropechika...

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.740
Megicula is in that kingdom.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.110
Diamond Kingdom

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.570
We came to scout the Diamond 
Kingdom just in case, but...

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.750
This is...

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.010
He managed to defeat all those 
Diamond soldiers on his own...

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.070
Some of them were as strong as our captains,

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.390
yet he defeated them so easily.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.480
Don't you dare get any stupid ideas, Luck!

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.150
I hate to admit it, but I've 
never felt like this before.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.020
I actually...

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.330
don't want to fight him.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.080
Heart Kingdom   Royal Palace

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.080
The Queen's Chamber

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.120
Hey, guys!

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.390
Asta!

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.110
Hey!

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.630
Thank goodness you're okay.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.270
You get kidnapped way too often.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.380
Give it a rest already.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.880
The queen has arrived.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.130
She's so majestic and beautiful.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.190
And she possesses vast, immeasurable magic!

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.700
So this is the queen of the Heart Kingdom?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.550
She's so beautiful!

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.950
You are truly a goddess who 
has descended upon this land!

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.860
Damn it! You know better than that, Finral!

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.830
You! Are! Going! To! Change!

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.910
What the heck's going on with Finral?

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.710
Who knows?

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.490
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom,

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.790
please lend us your strength.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:25.850
Wait, why?!

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.580
Come on, Loropechika! 
You need to act like a queen!

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.740
Ow...

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.730
Oh, your nose is bleeding...
But you're so cute!

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.150
Wh-What was that?

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.320
I got some blood on my dress.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.950
Okay, okay, just a second...

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.420
This is why I said she shouldn't 
meet them in person.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.250
Why do you need our help?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:00.020
Doesn't the Heart Kingdom have many 
mages who are stage one or higher,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.800
including the Spirit Guardians?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.970
I mentioned earlier that everyone 
needs to be stage one or higher

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.930
to keep up in a fight with devils,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.820
but even if one was stage zero,

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.480
they would not be able to finish off a devil.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:19.650
The Spirit Guardians borrow some power 
from natural mana to use powerful magic,

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.490
but they still cannot defeat devils.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:27.250
Unlike us, the Clover Kingdom has 
created types of magic that are not natural,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.180
such as chain, steel, 
and the eccentric spatial magic,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.410
in exchange for giving up the 
divine protection of natural mana.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.770
Some of the irregulars who were born

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.800
in that environment have the 
power to defeat a devil.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.760
For example, the Wizard King who 
uses time magic, Julius Novachrono,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.460
or the Captain of the Black Bulls, 
Yami Sukehiro, who uses dark magic.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.270
Though it appears that Julius 
has lost most of his power...

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.000
She even knows about that?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.820
Just how much does she know?

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.660
And...

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.890
Asta and Nero.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.500
In terms of combat magic alone, 
Nero is about a stage six,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.170
but she has ancient sealing magic 
and has used forbidden magic.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.530
And Asta doesn't have any magic,

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.590
but he was able to obtain 
anti-magic because of that.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:26.850
People with inexplicable powers such 
as yours are known as arcane stages.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.720
Stage Zero

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.720
Arcane Stage

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.060
Arcane stage...

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.490
I'd like you to lend us your arcane 
powers to help defeat that devil.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.820
In exchange, I'll offer you any 
information that is available to me.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.470
We can't make decisions like that.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.410
I'll use a transmission magic item
 to ask Captain Yami!

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.410
I'm taking a dump right now!

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.270
What? You've got something 
really important to tell me?

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.270
Well, what I'm doing right 
now is really important, too.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.000
This might be the biggest dump in history.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.500
Call back later!

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.010
What?!

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.850
Pooping is indeed very important.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.010
She agreed with him?!

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.370
You mustn't use such vulgar words, Loropechika!

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.660
Um... I figured something 
like this may happen,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.030
so I borrowed a magic item that lets us 
connect with Marx's transmission magic.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.160
Good job, Mimosa!

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.530
Way to go, Mimosa!

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.280
All right, I'll go ahead and connect.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.280
Mimosa? Did something happen?

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.110
Wait, is that...

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.540
You must be the queen of the Heart Kingdom!
 What kind of magic do you use?!

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.680
Please don't just pop up 
like that, Master Julius!

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.890
You're small right now, remember?

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.110
People will find out.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.550
Well, yeah, you did just 
call me "Master Julius."

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.000
Don't worry. The queen already knew.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.800
Huh?!

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.300
And so, in order to defeat 
devils, we need to be...

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.650
at the arcane stage, or something.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.110
Of course, that's fine.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.070
You all might get something 
amazing out of this, too.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.020
To tell you the truth, 
I'd prefer to be over there myself.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.530
You absolutely may not!

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.450
It's settled, then. Thank goodness.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:15.160
But in your present states, 
all of you will be killed so easily.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.540
Wow, she's honest!

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.670
So the Spade devil is that strong?

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.050
Yes. Stronger than the devil
 you fought, I believe.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.780
Stronger than that guy?!

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.640
During that fight,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.200
we only managed to win because we had help

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.930
from incredible people like the first 
Wizard King and the leader of the elves.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.730
The scar Gaja has is the 
work of that devil, too.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.520
Him? The guy we barely 
stood a chance against?

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:52.000
That Spirit Guardian fellow fought 
me in the past. He's quite skilled.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.200
He fought you?!

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.710
A devil that can't be beaten by
 someone the Wizard King praises...

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.860
We don't stand a chance right now...

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.460
We have to get stronger.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.420
The devil Megicula is 
haunting the Spade Kingdom,

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.990
using its citizens to amass power...

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.050
in order to invade and 
conquer the Clover Kingdom,

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.610
the Heart Kingdom, and the Diamond Kingdom.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.700
As things stand, I will 
also die from this curse.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.990
I'd like to invade the Spade Kingdom
 before my power weakens.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.490
We have half a year.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.500
We'll need all the combat 
power we can get.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.500
Please gather those who stand 
a chance in a fight with a devil.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.760
I'd like you to get stronger and 
fight alongside us in six months.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.510
Right! We'd also appreciate...

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.020
...your help!

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.230
Master Julius, are you sure 
you're all right with this?

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.050
The Magic Knights are still exhausted 
from the battle against the elves.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.550
Though we have half a year,

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.020
if we fight alongside the Heart 
Kingdom to defeat a devil,

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.800
we may face even greater casualties.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.250
I'm sure you heard what our scouts said.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.730
With the Diamond Kingdom in its current state,

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.000
our only hope is to have the 
Magic Knights get stronger.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.010
I'm sure the Queen of the Heart 
Kingdom understands that, too.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.780
Master Julius...

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.700
Marx, gather all of the 
Magic Knights Squad Captains.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.010
Yes, sir.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.310
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.060
When's the captain gonna show up?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.440
We have a super important announcement!

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.940
Shut up, you stupid shrimp.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.660
If you don't quit yappin', the captain 
won't be able to finish his business.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.270
He's taking a dump again?!

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.200
I won.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.110
Wait, have you been in there ever since then?!

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.900
This isn't the end.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.690
As much as I want to celebrate my victory,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.210
the next battle is just around the corner.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.420
That's seriously enough about that.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.290
Right. Let's hear what the group that 
went to the Heart Kingdom has to say.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.430
Oh, right.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.260
Actually, I'm not sure where to begin.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.810
Me, me!

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:25.890
The one cursed by a devil there 
is the Heart Kingdom's queen!

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.910
And because of that curse, the queen 
only has about a year to live.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.180
The queen is the most powerful in the kingdom,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.250
and a mage chosen by one 
of the Four Great Spirits.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.490
If they lose someone like that, 
the Heart Kingdom will...

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.590
This goes without saying,
but keep this on the down-low.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.420
So, did you find anything out about this devil?

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.420
The devil's name is Megicula.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.380
And they're in the Spade Kingdom right now!

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.570
Spade?

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.140
Then maybe that explains what we saw.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.370
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:07.520
Apparently, they saw a Spade mage near 
the border of the Diamond Kingdom.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.600
A Spade?!

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.860
He was no ordinary mage.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.220
He managed to

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.450
single-handedly finish off hundreds 
of Diamond soldiers in an instant.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.090
And that cold, dark magic...

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.450
Everything would make sense 
if he's possessed by a devil.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:32.670
It's very possible that the guy 
we saw was Megicula himself.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.090
Th-Then the Diamond Kingdom...

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.910
They're pretty much done for. 
All because of that one guy.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.190
Mars...

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:52.370
It was clear just from being near him 
for a little while... We stood no chance.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.110
Even if we had acted, we would've faced 
the same fate as the Diamond soldiers.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.890
Yeah, as you guys are right now.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.420
If we can't defeat that devil,

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.790
both the Heart Kingdom and the 
Clover Kingdom are gonna be finished.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.580
In order to stop that...

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.120
We're gonna have to get stronger.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.290
The queen gave us six months.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.240
In six months, the Heart Kingdom 
will attack the Spade Kingdom.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.660
We Magic Knights of the Clover Kingdom

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.900
need to train as hard as we can for 
six months, get super strong,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.390
and defeat Megicula along 
with the Heart Kingdom!

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.950
Question.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.390
Sure thing, Zora!

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:34.630
So this devil's actually 
beatable if all we do is train?

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.260
We won't be able to keep up in a fight

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.800
against a devil unless we're 
all stage one or higher.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.830
For perspective, that would 
mean we'd all have to be

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.610
as strong as 1st Class Senior Magic Knights...

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.790
no, we need to be above that, 
or we don't stand a chance.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:53.460
So you're telling us to get to a 
vice captain's level in six months?!

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.340
You sure make it sound easy.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.690
And currently, the only ones who 
stand a chance against the devil

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.090
are the Wizard King, Yami, Asta, and Nero,

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.100
who all belong to a group 
called the arcane stage.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.890
Though I don't plan on giving up even 
if I'm told I don't stand a chance.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.860
Because Megicula is the 
one who killed my mother.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.000
Come on! Pull yourself together, Luck!

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.680
Lady Noe just said she wasn't gonna give up!

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.930
We're her seniors! We can't chicken out!

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:27.810
I wasn't being myself.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.960
I don't have time to be scared 
when our friend's life is at stake.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.210
Friend's life?

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.160
Of course, I'll do everything 
I can to become a stage one.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.010
In order to protect my bestest friend, Asta!

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.940
That's right! I need to do 
something about Megicula,

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.780
or I'm gonna be sentenced to death!

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.390
How could you forget that?

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.850
Guess we don't have a choice, then.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.400
True Magic Knights can't just 
let devils do whatever they want.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.580
I-I have no idea what I can do...

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.360
But I'll do my best!

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.850
I'm gonna use these six months 
to become even stronger

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.050
and defeat this loathsome curse!

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.450
So that I can become a man 
worthy of Miss Finnes, as well.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.340
After we defeat Megicula 
and our curse is broken,

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.190
I want to talk to Nozel again...

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.090
about Mother.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.780
Anyway, we just need to kick Megicula's ass!

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.930
Then I might be able to find 
out more about my devil, too!

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.120
For the sake of their futures and this world...

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.690
I can't let another devil 
have its way any longer.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.380
So that means for the next six months,

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.640
the Black Bulls are free 
to do whatever they want.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.190
You can go wherever you want. 
You can team up with whoever you want.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:48.250
You have one mission: to become stronger.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.590
We're dealing with a devil 
and the Spade Kingdom.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.470
You need to train like your life depends on it.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.880
If you don't, I'll kill you.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.590
I always tell you to do this in the moment,

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.960
so if you have six months, 
that should be plenty of time.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.960
Surpass your limits!

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.180
Right!

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.100
It's not just the Clover Kingdom.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.020
This is a life-or-death situation 
for the Heart Kingdom

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.980
and Diamond Kingdom, too.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.690
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 130:

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 130
The New Magic Knights Captain Conference

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.240
"The New Magic Knights Captain Conference."

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.070
We must become stronger in order to 
face that devil and the Spade Kingdom.
