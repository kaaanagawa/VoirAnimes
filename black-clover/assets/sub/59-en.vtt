00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.200
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.510
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.840
The party headed to the Witches' Forest

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.310
to break the curse that Vetto 
had placed on Asta's arms,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.890
and they found Vanessa in a wretched state.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.340
Miz Vanessa!

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.400
Vanessa!

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.370
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.280
I don't know who you think you are,
 but get your foot off of her right now!

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.610
You must be the brat 
Vanessa was talking about.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720
This foolish little thing

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.440
told me she'd become my slave and 
live out the rest of her days here

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.670
in exchange for healing your arms.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.670
Miz Vanessa...

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.590
In order to save Vanessa,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.670
the party began their battle with 
the Queen of Witches, and then...

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.920
They were much faster than I expected.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.250
New enemies arrived at the Witches' Forest.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.940
The Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.440
Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.150
Witnessing how powerful the enemy was,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.530
the Queen of Witches healed Asta's arms

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740
and let him protect the forest.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.250
This is great! They're completely better!

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.590
All right! Let's go, guys!

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.210
Yeah!

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.970
Because of the Queen of Witches's healing 
magic, Asta's arms were better than ever.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.890
His battle with Fana, who was
 filled with hatred, began.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.150
I'll kill you once and for all.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.070
Bring it on! I'll just keep throwing 
your attacks right back at you!

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.750
Flames of Hatred

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.920
I'll just keep throwing your 
attacks right back at you.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.370
Yeah.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.940
Over and over...

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.560
Come at me as much as you want!

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.000
I'll just keep throwing your attacks right 
back at you over and over and over and over!

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.850
Damn it, you bastard!

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.120
I guess he's built up a lot of stress

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.850
since he couldn't use his arms.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.810
I hate you...

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.150
This time we'll...

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.530
destroy you!

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.660
Here they come!

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.740
Flame Spirit Magic:

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.790
Salamander's Talon.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.710
Wha—

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.800
Seriously?!

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.480
It's so powerful!

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.610
So that's Salamander,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.970
said to have the highest attack 
power of the Four Great Spirits.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.910
We're up against a spirit that matches 
the military power of an entire nation...

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.670
Amazing!

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.170
Spirits are mana-based lifeforms.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.490
Asta's anti-magic sword can 
slash apart mana itself!

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.490
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.940
Man, that was scary! But it's so cool!

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.220
Man, you're so lucky! I want a Salamander!

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.220
Asta...

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.500
But that old guy, Vetto, was much 
faster and had better senses.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.370
We can do this!

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.230
...has a chance of winning this!

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.740
Honestly... Watching you makes 
being scared seem silly.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.840
Jeez... Why are these flames so powerful?

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.500
It's like throwing water on burning rocks.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.350
I'm basically just wasting mana.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.820
I hope Asta and the others are okay.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.490
Why did you hurt us?

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.540
I hate you.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.400
Okay, time for our counterattack!

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.660
Yeah! Yeah...

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.700
Hey, you! Let's sit down 
and talk this through.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.870
Wha—

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.170
What are you saying, Asta?!

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.290
She's not someone you can just talk to!

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.410
What's with all this hate business?

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.800
What exactly do you hate so much?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.140
Would you mind telling me why you 
hate the Clover Kingdom so much?

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.100
How are we supposed to understand 
each other when all we ever do is fight?

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.690
Are you ready to talk?

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.940
Shut up.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.900
What the heck are you doing?!

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.700
Finral!

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.660
You got it!

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.380
Your friend also really hated us.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.960
The ones you broke...

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.510
Our golden dreams and our bonds of blood!

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.890
Despair!

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.620
And... he was full of despair.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.890
Tell me why!

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.710
Can't we just understand each other?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.690
Licht, is that person human?

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.630
Yes. He's my friend.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.640
There's something strange about him.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.450
I believe that this will become

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.650
a world where our peoples can 
live side by side as friends.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.690
We'll be able to understand each other.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.400
Elves' mana is truly amazing.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.770
If we combine that with our techniques 
in creating magical items,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.690
we'll be able to make this place 
even more prosperous and safe.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.160
Let's do our best to live together.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.670
We wish you happiness!

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.830
The mana is giving us its blessing.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:04.890
I'm so happy that our child will be welcomed 
into this world with your blessings.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.310
This child is our future,

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.640
the one who'll bring the 
elves and humans together.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.930
The humans are attacking!

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.670
Hey, wake up!

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.490
My love...

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.370
Why... Why?!

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.720
Only that human knows where we live!

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.470
He... He must've betrayed us!

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.000
It can't be...

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.420
This can't be!

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.730
Who...

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.750
Who would believe you?!

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.770
This magic...

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:37.530
Can you handle all of my hatred?

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.280
She's got a third eye, too!

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.540
Th-That thing just got bigger?!

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.810
Asta!

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.020
Asta!

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.550
Not only did it get bigger, it's using 
magic with different attributes?

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.030
Come on, give us a break!

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.790
Let the flames of my 
hatred burn you to ashes!

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.880
Damn it! In that case...

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.210
I'll just have to bring out my special move!

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.910
She's no ordinary mage.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.420
I just got a great idea!

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.300
Now!

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.430
It's so hot!

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.070
The wave of hot air was 
enough to blow me away.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.150
I won't be able to get closer to her alone.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.450
Miz Vanessa, Finral, are you guys all right?

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.820
Somewhat. But...

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.660
Her insane amount of magic is 
creating a mana force field.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.460
I'm having a hard time manipulating space.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.580
The second I put my magic
thread out, it gets burned.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.260
That magic power is ridiculous.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.210
Is this the power of spirits?

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.640
It's like a god incarnate.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.560
Die!

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.980
Damn it!

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.760
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.750
What are you guys doing?!

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.250
Noelle!

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.010
I keep putting out the fires in 
the forest, but there's no end to it!

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.750
I guess I'll have to extinguish...

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.190
Wh-What the heck is that thing? It's scary!

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.050
L-Looks like I'll have to 
extinguish the source first!

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.010
Noelle uses water magic.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.560
And water can beat fire!

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.480
It's evaporating...

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.990
Fire Spirit Magic: Salamander's Talon!

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.930
Hang on tight!

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.140
Look out!

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.460
Thanks!

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.990
What the heck is that monster?

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.610
But... I'm the one who uses water magic,
so I have to do this.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.970
I can do this... I know I can do this!

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.570
I can do this, I can do this, I can do this!

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.850
You can't do it.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:44.280
You've been damaged goods 
ever since you were born.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.860
Of course you can't do it.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.790
The only way you managed 
to pull off the attack

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.240
at the Water Temple is because 
you let your rage take over.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.200
You're a failure.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.140
I really can't...

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.720
You're strong!

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.970
Noelle! You're strong!

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.830
You can do this!

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.860
I can't do anything about that flame!
 I'm counting on you!

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.810
Come on, come on, come on! 
You can do anything if you have the guts!

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.660
A-Asta!

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.310
He's so loud. My ears are ringing.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.620
You hear me, Noelle?!

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.660
You can figure anything out with guts!

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.410
Asta?! You're a bit too loud!

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.020
Hey, Finral! Why are you plugging your ears?

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.680
Feel this wonderful breeze!

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.680
You got this, Noelle?

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.760
Yes.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:57.610
Get a grip, Noelle. 
Just as Asta gave me courage...

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.680
You can do it!

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.230
You don't need to tell me! 
I'll do it, Stupidsta!

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.020
I'm going to give Asta courage, too!

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.250
Here we go!

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.570
It's going to fire.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.530
Right now, I'll probably only be 
able to use Sea Dragon's Roar once.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.040
I'll bet everything

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.870
on this one attack!

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.880
I'm not a failure anymore!

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.630
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.610
She dodged it?

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.120
Disappear.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.440
Noelle!

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.950
I'm not done yet!

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.300
We did it!

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.510
Wh-Whoa! That's our Noelle!

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.510
I'm saved...

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.520
I'll never forgive you.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.200
Did you see that, Asta? That's my true power!

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.230
Y-Yay, I did it!

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.070
Damn, that was awesome!

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.310
That's my comrade! All right!

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.240
Noelle's attack managed 
to subdue the salamander.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.860
Now's our only chance!

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.990
Next...

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.430
It's your turn!

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.430
It's my turn!

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.310
All right! Now it's finally time 
for my special move!

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:52.670
I won't let you...

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.430
Mineral Creation Magic: Harpe!

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.240
Huh?!

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.970
Why?! How is she able to use 
magic besides flame magic?!

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.350
That's so not fair!

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.020
This spell...

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.070
Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.090
And she can use recovery magic, too! Damn it!

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.140
And this spell, too...

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:27.710
I knew it!

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.750
Hey, lady!

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.290
You wouldn't happen to have a brother

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.800
with a really pale face 
and spiky hair, would you?

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.600
He's over on the other side 
of the forest right now!

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.070
What are you talking about, Asta?!

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.320
I don't know anyone like that!

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.700
If I have any siblings, they're Licht
 and the people of the village!

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.230
Know their grudge against you!

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.080
I'll massacre every last one of you!

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.970
I can't get through to her at all!

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.440
I'll just have to stop her with my 
special move before she recovers!

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.050
Hang on a sec, Asta! What's this 
special move you keep talking about?

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.850
Yeah, what is it?

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.750
Glad you asked!

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.370
You see, I'm gonna hold out 
both swords in front of me

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.530
and charge straight through 
the air at super speed!

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.880
I call it...

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.830
How could you possibly do that?!

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.490
Huh? I can't?!

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.530
Not without us, you can't!

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.790
You always come up with the craziest ideas.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.290
Let us help!

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.790
Asta... Remember what I said earlier?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.000
Your friends are there to help you win 
against a fate you can't defeat on your own!

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.180
That attack of yours...

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.140
will end up being incredibly powerful!

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:09.510
Here we go!

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.150
Too late!

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.330
I won't let you kill anyone!

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.380
Bull Thrust!

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.890
He did it!

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.920
All right!

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.810
My special move was a complete success!

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.590
No...

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.860
Licht...

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.430
Petit Clover

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.340
Petit Clover!

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.930
Over and Over

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.510
Over and Over!

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.730
Come at me as much as you want!

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.810
I'll just keep throwing your attacks right 
back at you over and over and over and over!

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.640
Come at me with all the narutos you want!

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.290
I'll just eat all the narutos you throw at me!

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.280
Come at me with all the natto you want!

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.970
I'm <i>natto</i> gonna let it get me down!

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.320
Ew! It's all over my swords!

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.410
I wouldn't want to be stabbed by those swords.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.890
Damn it, you stupid natto!

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.520
We did it, Asta! We defeated Salamander!

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.980

Page 60
 Defectors' Atonement

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.190
No, Charmy. "Atonement" isn't a kind of food.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.820
It's when you make up for 
something bad you did.
