00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.800
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.220
Licht and his comrades finally
 completed their reincarnation

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.100
and headed to the royal capital
 to commence their attack.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.110
Nozel, Noelle, Mimosa, Zora, Kirsch, En,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.280
and Mereoleona,
who was still knocked out,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.610
left the hideout and headed 
back toward the royal capital.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.410
Looks like some place is 
already being attacked.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.610
That's...

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.650
...Hage Village!

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.790
Sister!

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.160
Nash! No!

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.240
Asta and Yuno took a different route in 
order to save their home, Hage Village,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.420
from an attack by a Magic Knight 
who'd reincarnated as an elf.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.590
Asta... Yuno?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.560
Good job fighting...

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.470
...Nash!

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.390
Leave the rest to us!

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.140
Crescent Moon Sickle, Four Blades!

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.600
I can tell from his mana.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.360
The elf's soul inside him is in pain.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.310
It's like the elves are asking for help.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.110
Yuno!

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.500
Let's go, Asta!

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.080
At this rate, he's going to turn 
into something besides an elf.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.250
We have to set him free.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.920
He negated... the reincarnation spell?

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.740
With this sword... 
I'll be able to save everyone!

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.720
Lightning of Rage vs. Friends

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.850
What the hell is that giant 
boulder-looking thing?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.340
What is that?

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.250
What's going on?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.300
All right, I guess I'll go have some fun.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.450
The town...

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.050
It's being attacked?

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.320
We're heading into town, Vanessa!

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.450
Right.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.700
G-Get on your own damn broom!

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.770
This is no time to be bashful! Get going!

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.660
I-I'm not bashful!

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.920
Damn it... H-Hang on tight!

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.170
Full speed ahead, Crazy Cyclone!

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.930
Up ahead, I feel elven magic from 
both the north and the south.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.560
Since there are two places, it'd be 
better if we split up and helped them.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.190
Yuno!

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.100
Asta!

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.630
See you at the royal capital!

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.500
Hey, now...

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.420
We came to this town because 
it was under attack, but...

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.350
What the hell's going on here,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.720
Luck?!

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.620
Why, you little...

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.600
Luck!

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.290
Damn it... Luck!

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.660
What are you trying to do?!

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.370
Luck?

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.350
Oh, him...

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.690
I think he wanted to see someone.
Was it you two?

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.040
Too bad, though.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.550
Because of the reincarnation spell, 
this body belongs to me, Rufel, now.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.580
Reincarnation? Rufel?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.260
The hell are you babbling about?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.800
Forbidden magic?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.600
Huh?

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.850
It means someone else 
has taken over Luck's body!

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.860
Someone else?

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.460
Those Eye of the Midnight Sun guys?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.110
Probably.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.510
Luck and the other Royal Knights

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.210
headed to the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's hideout.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.120
Then was that flying boulder thing their...

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.580
It's their hideout.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.190
I guess the plan to eliminate them failed.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.190
Exactly! I guess you're 
not as dumb as you look.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.390
Oh, by the way, those Royal Knights 
or whatever were completely wiped out!

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.130
So basically, if you guys are 
also going to get in my way,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.930
you're gonna have to die, too!

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.530
Wait a sec...

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.930
I ended up attacking somewhere 
completely different?

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.030
Oh? Is this a spell to protect your friends?

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.460
That's pretty interesting.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.040
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.750
I'm gonna burn you to a crisp!

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.870
Explosive Scatter—

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.770
The red thread of fate...

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.720
Rouge is on the side of all the Black Bulls.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.690
So she'll protect Luck, even though 
his body is possessed right now.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.010
Shut down your damn cat's powers, Vanessa!

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.440
What are you talking about?

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.330
If Luck's attack had connected,
 you would've died instantly.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.870
Besides, if it really is the forbidden 
spell, Luck is just asleep, and...

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.370
That's why I'm trying to 
wake that fool back up!

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:12.090
Take this! Flame Magic: Explosive Scattershot!

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.910
Such a simple spell...

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.350
There's no way it'll hit me.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.600
They disappeared? 
But I still sense their mana.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.100
I call this "Explosive 
Annihilation Scattershot"!

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.820
He's fast!

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.160
There's no spell that can hit me.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.660
Which means you humans can't defeat me!

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.540
Shut up!

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.630
Now, then... Do you think 
you can dodge my attacks?!

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.080
Vanessa!

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.920
Honestly, all of you people 
are so overly enthusiastic!

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.970
I'll back you up!

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.710
I mean, if you actually 
manage to defeat Luck,

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.730
that might shock him enough to wake him up!

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.730
No one asked you!

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.070
Explosive Scatter...

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.260
Show him the results of 
all your training with me!

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.080
That's exactly what I plan 
on doing, you dumbass!

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.910
Eat this!

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.980
Again, that spell won't hit me.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.380
This is my newest Explosive Scattershot!

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.890
I call it "Time Bomb Explosive Scattershot"!

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.150
Doesn't matter if it hits you 
or not! It'll still explode!

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.280
Think you can tell which ones will explode?!

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.570
Your puny little spell isn't going to hit me!

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.590
At least try to amuse me a little more!

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.160
Whoa, there...

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.260
Throwing fireballs that 
don't disappear <i>or</i> explode?

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.000
Is this supposed to be a feint?

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.550
Or are you out of magic already?

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.260
If he's dodging by sensing where mana is,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.720
Magna can get behind him by mixing 
in some regular Scattershots!

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.720
I'll be able to hit him at this distance!

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.810
Too bad.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.520
I sensed your mana.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:40.740
I'm fully aware of your ability 
to sense mana and your speed.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.100
He made sure it would explode
right at this moment?

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.700
You don't know, do you?

00:10:54.350 --> 00:11:01.300
That I'm stupid enough to 
make myself explode, too!

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.270
If you were actually Luck, you'd probably
 figure that I'd do something so stupid!

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.650
I'm way more skilled than you when it comes to

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.240
resilience and being able to take a hit!

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.530
Flame Magic: Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.340
And then... Flame Bondage Formation.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.780
I know Luck really well.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.640
I don't know who the hell you are,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.130
but you don't know a damn 
thing about him or me!

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.400
That's why you have no chance of beating me!

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.110
If that's crystal clear, then hurry up 
and return that idiot to us!

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.620
You...

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.760
That's...

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.730
Who...

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.480
can't beat whom,

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.380
human?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:02.090
Why don't you explain just how 
you humans expect to defeat me?

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:08.550
Bring it on! I'll keep throwing 
these at you until Luck wakes up!

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.890
He disappeared?

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.520
Your attacks will never hit me again.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.730
He's moving so fast, I can't see him.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.660
Humans can't keep up with me!

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.130
He was already a monster, but now...

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.880
Where are you looking?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.010
And it's over!

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.390
Where are you looking?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.640
Huh?

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.640
Oh?

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:02.150
The power to control... the future? 
No, to control fate.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.940
But it appears you can't attack me.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.430
Not to mention, I'm pretty sure that 
power uses quite a bit of magic.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:16.070
The magic of elves, who are blessed 
by mana, or the magic of you humans...

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.620
Which do you think will last longer?!

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.950
Tired already?

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.030
I haven't even broken a sweat yet!

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.660
That ended much more quickly than I'd hoped.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.020
The humans of the Clover Kingdom
 will be destroyed.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.790
That's what you deserve, and that's the 
fate we elves shall bring upon you!

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.110
Shut... up...

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.620
Yeah...

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.060
I don't care if you're an elf or not.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.580
I'm not talking to you.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.120
I'm talking to that idiot...

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:53.390
So you can hurry up and get the 
hell out of that body, dumbass!

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.700
He's a mischievous little brat who's always 
being reckless and causing us trouble...

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.310
But Luck is my little brother!

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.640
Give him back right now!

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.740
You humans betray each 
other at the drop of a hat.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.150
Are you trying to tell me 
you actually have a bond?

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.810
Don't make me laugh!

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.270
Nothing you can do will break 
this reincarnation spell!

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.160
Especially not your flimsy little bond!

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.410
This human's soul has already been destroyed!

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.090
Is that so? In that case...

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.590
Why the hell are you crying?

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.550
Acting like someone you're not...

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.600
I know you're still in there, Luck!

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.690
While you were off messing around,

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.110
I was out training and got 
super strong, you dumbass!

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:52.200
If that pisses you off, then get the 
hell out here and fight me already!

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.860
Shut...

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:02.660
Luck, don't you dare think you 
can get rid of us that easily!

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.530
My red thread of fate is
 never going to let you go!

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.670
So hurry up and come back!

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.500
Shut up.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.800
Luck!

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.610
Shut up! Shut up!

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:15.930
Luck!

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.680
Shut up!

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.440
Shut up, human!

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.690
Luck!

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.210
Like I'm ever...

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.450
going to shut up!

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.200
Rouge used up the last of her magic...

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.210
to bring upon the fate that 
would bring Asta here!

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.950
Who the hell are you?

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.180
You know damn well who I am!

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.580
But I'll repeat myself as 
many times as it takes!

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.950
We're Luck's friends!

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.690
Asta...

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.020
Asta...

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:15.260
Friends, eh? You're all 
really getting on my nerves.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.320
You don't have a lick of magic, do you?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.540
I never thought anyone in this world
 could be so unloved by mana.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.170
And the first ones to ever acknowledge 
me and consider me one of their own

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.790
were the Black Bulls!

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.040
I won't let you take a single one of them!

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.010
It doesn't matter who or what you are.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.640
You'll never be able to see my movements!

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.600
You can die at the hands 
of your precious friend!

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.190
There's no way a human can 
keep up with this speed!

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.840
How are you able to keep up?

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.700
Your ki is filled with rage that
makes it super easy to read!

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.930
And this sword is sensitive

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.260
to really powerful magic, 
and will seek it wherever it goes!

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.560
You're so annoying!

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.250
Not bad.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.840
But...

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.540
Like you could actually surpass my rage!

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.480
He shouldn't be able to detect me, 
but his combat sense is insane!

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.780
Magna! Miz Vanessa!

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.930
I need you guys to back me up!

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.260
You got it!

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.850
You really think these attacks 
are going to hit me now?

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.560
And...

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.860
I've figured out how fast you are by now!

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.070
Asta!

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.580
My body can't hold out much longer...
 I need to make the next one count!

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.310
This is the end, human!

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.770
Since he's got no magic,
their plan is just to hide him?

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:41.970
In that case...

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.800
I'll spread out my mana

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.470
and detect the moment your 
sword makes my mana disappear.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.260
There he is.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.050
He's heading straight for me.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.060
I've got him!

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.610
My rage is stronger!

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.950
You're there!

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.510
There!

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.990
There!

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.370
Huh?

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.790
They used that thread to throw off my timing?

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.670
Go!

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.920
Asta!

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.970
Our feelings are tougher than you!

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.350
All right!

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.940
I'll free you now!

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.150
He's still got all this power left?

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.030
You're the ones who are going to die, humans!

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.830
Give it up already, damn it!

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.090
We told you! We're not 
letting go, no matter what!

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.290
Don't...

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.550
Don't touch me!

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.270
Luck, you're my precious little brother!

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.400
Hurry up and come back so you can tease Magna

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.700
and eat other people's puddings without asking!

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.570
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 105: "Smiles, Tears."

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 105
 Smiles, Tears

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.950
I won't let anything sever the 
bond that the Black Bulls have!
