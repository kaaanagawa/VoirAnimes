00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.760
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.730
And so, we're giving you your first mission.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.230
Our first mission...

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.530
...as Magic Knights.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.070
Wh-What is it?

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.580
It had better be something 
worthy of me as a royal.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.950
Yeah, you should be honored.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670
You'll be hunting wild boars
 in Saussy Village!

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.700
Wild...

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.740
...boars?

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.530
Boar!

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.030
What kind of lame mission is that?

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.370
What are you calling lame?!

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.080
I can beat a wild boar with my bare hands!

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.920
Don't you dare underestimate wild boars!

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.470
Are you going to go, or are you going to die?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.760
Which will it be?

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.870
We'll go!

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.700
Even if it's just hunting wild boars,
this is our first mission as Magic Knights.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.790
I'm so excited!

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.400
I'm supposed to get rid of wild boars?

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.970
What? You're still complaining?

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.540
I'm not complaining... It's just...

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.240
I was just wondering if I should go,
since I can't control my magical powers.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.980
Her name is...

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.750
Crazy Cyclone!

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.750
Crazy Cyclone

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.830
So cool!

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.960
I know, right?! Isn't she a beaut?

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.100
Yeah, she is!

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.250
Lame.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.180
A man never goes back on his word!

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.380
Here we go!

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.270
Fly!

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.450
Yahoo!

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.230
This is amazing, Magna! 
We're one with the wind!

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.420
And if you don't want to die, 
better squeeze up closer, Stupidsta!

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.610
Yes, sir!

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.610
So this is where the magic stone is located.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.660
We're going to find it.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.790
Yes, sir!

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.880
Be lost in the mist.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.320
Beasts

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.870
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.410
I know, yeah I know

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.790
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670
I dreamed it all my life

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.550
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.680
Don't care how much I fall

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.550
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.310
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.480
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.860
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.120
Someday I will write the next page

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.620
You are my hope

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.370
Like that page from someday

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.710
I was able to meet you

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.670
I call this a miracle

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.940
A wild boar's after me! It's huge!

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.570
Actually, is that even a wild boar?!

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.030
Isn't it using some magic of its own?!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.870
It's super fast!

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.550
Shouldn't we rescue him?

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.650
I'm taking a break.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.300
My magical powers are pretty much 
drained after flying you two this far.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.340
I'm sure he'll be fine. He's pretty tough.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.860
But...

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.320
If you're so worried, you go save him.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.210
I can do this.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.840
Why me?!

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.420
I've got you now!

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.830
I finally got 'im.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.740
Great job, Asta.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.050
But it ain't over yet.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.710
What a haul!

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.020
You're pretty amazing.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.930
Three or four wild boars ain't nothing.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.290
You've got some impressive brute strength.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.360
This should make Old Man Seihi happy. 
Let's have ourselves a wild boar party.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.360
This mayor of Saussy Village... 
Seihi? You know him?

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.040
Yeah. I've known him for a long time.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.970
I'm from Rayaka Village, 
which is just past here,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.500
but I used to be a bit of a 
handful when I was a kid.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.430
Used to be?

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.500
Like you aren't now?

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.200
I got a big head after I got my grimoire

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.480
and went into Saussy Village with 
the intent of taking over, too.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.760
And then...

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.430
Take that!

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.750
Hey, you little brat!
What do you think you're doing?!

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.990
You wanna get hurt, old man?

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.990
You're the one that's gonna get hurt!

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.490
Take that!

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.710
Time for your punishment!

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.670
That's dangerous!

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.010
And now...

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.970
Wh-What the hell are you doing?

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.480
Time for an ass whoopin'!

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.640
Hey! Damn it!

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.560
Since then, I've challenged 
that old man many times.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.450
Real men don't make trouble for others!

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.090
Take that!

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.210
Help the weak and humble the strong. 
That's what a true man does.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.000
Golden!

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.570
Real men don't make others worry about them.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.410
He whooped my ass every time.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.630
He must be strong.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.690
I found this out later, but Old Man Seihi

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.980
had enough magical power that he aspired 
to be a Magic Knight when he was younger.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.360
He's the one who suggested that I 
take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.570
Oh? Looks like you've improved a bit.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.120
W-Well, I'm getting the hang 
of using my grimoire.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.620
In that case, why don't you try 
taking the Magic Knights Entrance Exam?

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.850
Huh?

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.920
M-Me? Take the entrance exam?

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.510
You've got skill.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:55.140
There's... no way that'll happen. 
I'm a commoner from the boonies.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.940
Nothing's written in stone!

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.850
What does being from the boonies or being 
a commoner have to do with anything?

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.640
It's up to you to take hold of your own future.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.880
I'm sure you'll be able to fulfill 
the dream I couldn't.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.900
Old Man...

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.350
Be a man, Magna.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.430
So what do Magic Knights do, anyway?

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.990
You don't even know that?!

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.390
It's all because of him that 
I'm here right now.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:33.170
When I passed the Magic Knights Entrance Exam,
he was happier for me than anyone.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.870
He must be a nice person.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.140
Yeah.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.490
And he went to the royal capital...

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.490
well, to get rich quick so he could 
make some money for his village,

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.680
but I think he also came to see me.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.940
He did take me for every bit 
of change I had, though!

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.390
But he's the one who showed me 
what a real man should be.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.090
I wanted to be like him, the person 
I respect most after Mister Yami...

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.020
Magna?

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.610
The hell is that?!

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.130
The village...

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.430
It's covered in mist.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.660
Wow, the weather sucks in that town.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.100
You idiot! That's magic.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.680
What?!

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.660
Saussy Village

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.850
A magical mist?

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.700
Once we enter it, we probably 
won't be able to get anywhere.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.400
We'll lose our sense of direction and 
end up wandering around in the mist.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.370
Magic that can cover a whole village...

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.910
None of the villagers have magic this strong.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.610
Of course, this isn't Old 
Man Seihi's magic, either.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.130
What's going on?

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.500
Hey!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.420
Yes, sir?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.230
Cut through the mist with your sword.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.730
Sure thing!

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.580
Huh?

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.250
That's a dumb thing to say.
You can't cut through mist with a sword.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.010
You're the dumb one!

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.940
Since it's magic, you can cut 
through it with your sword!

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.110
Oh, yeah!

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.150
Good. Now, let's go.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.030
Right!

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.520
Take a right there.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.600
Got it!

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.280
Take a left there.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.250
Right!

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.170
You seem to know where you're going.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.230
Well, yeah. Left.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.130
Did you feel that?

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.800
Yes. Powerful magic.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.510
Straight ahead. Be careful.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.810
We should end up in the square.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.330
This is your execution.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.840
Explosive Scattershot!

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.100
The Magic Knights...

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.820
They've come to save us!

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.350
Magna, it's you!

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.990
Nick! What the heck's going on?

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.090
Old Man!

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.260
Hey! Wake up!

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.890
Old Man...

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.930
The mayor...

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.530
He tried to protect us.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.520
Grandpa, they came. The Magic Knights...

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.850
Your prayers were answered.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.100
A person can just die... so easily?

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.530
Are you the bastard who did this?!

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.110
How dare you put me behind schedule?

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.800
You'll all be executed in ten seconds.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.770
Crap! I'm short on magic!

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.270
Asta!

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.790
I won't forgive this!

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.840
How could you do something so cruel?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.550
Who the heck are you guys?!

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.520
They don't seem like spies 
from the Diamond Kingdom

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.460
or barbarians here to trash the village.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.270
Who are these guys?

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.110
I don't recall hearing anything 
about Magic Knights showing up.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.740
Could they be out on some unofficial mission?

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:57.120
And how did they get into the
village through our mist barrier?

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.490
The Black Bulls...

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:04.590
Crude heretics that don't fit in with 
the rest of the Magic Knights.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.130
Dealing with them would be a waste of time.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:09.880
Five minutes...

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.170
We'll get rid of the useless villagers 
that didn't know anything

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.930
and seek what we came here for.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.050
Don't ignore me!

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.540
Mist Magic: Whirlpool of Illusory Mist.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:29.030
You're a fool to think you could 
get near Lord Heath so easily.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.030
Damn you!

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.030
Be lost in the mist.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.030
No, I won't!

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:40.750
He cut through my ice magic earlier.
I don't know what kind of magic he uses...

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.910
But his sword negates magic.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.310
We shouldn't let him get too close.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.510
I'm asking you why you tried 
to kill all these villagers!

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.210
This world is split into several regions.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:08.480
Forsaken Realm

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:08.480
Common Realm

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:08.480
Noble Realm

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:08.480
Diamond
Kingdom

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:08.480
Heart
Kingdom

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:08.480
Saussy

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:08.480
Rayaka

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.270
The Noble Realm where royalty lives,
the Common Realm where the commoners live,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.480
Spade Kingdom

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.480
and the Forsaken Realm.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.910
Huh?

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.240
This village, Saussy, is located 
in the Forsaken Realm.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.250
Most of those who inhabit 
the Forsaken Realm are

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:21.250
an inferior race that can only use 
enough magic to complete daily tasks.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.710
They're basically mindless beasts.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.420
I was only trying to get 
rid of the mindless beasts

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.760
that might steal more of my precious time.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.320
Beasts?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.380
The three of you

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.770
also had enough magical power to 
join the Magic Knights, did you not?

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.910
You're only trying to save them 
because it's your mission.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.050
But in truth, they look like lowly 
beasts to you, do they not?

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.230
Living in the upper realms must be nice.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.410
I'm sure they're living a life of luxury.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.460
If you're so jealous,
you should just go there.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.670
It's not that easy.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.920
Why not?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.860
Only those who possess strong magical 
powers can live in the realms above us.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.670
There's prejudice against 
those who lack magical powers.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.000
Even though we're all human.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.260
Huh... Then after I join the Magic 
Knights and become the Wizard King,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.140
I'll get rid of those prejudices and 
make our village flourish even more!

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.200
Thank you, Asta.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.530
If the likes of you could manage that, 
we wouldn't be struggling.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.780
What did you say, you brat?!
 I'm older than you!

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.540
You couldn't even join the Magic Knights, 
let alone become the Wizard King.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.350
You don't even have any magical powers.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.650
Hey!

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.380
Those people you called beasts

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.370
are lives I have to protect!

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.550
I see. So the filthy beasts 
are that valuable to you.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.190
I'll send those icicles right back at y—

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.150
Th-This is...

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.190
Ice and Mist Compound Magic:
Endless Ice Cage.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.940
Do you think you can 
protect those beasts now?

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.580
I'm not very partial to the term "gradually,"

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.790
but this seems like it'll 
be the most effective.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.430
Asta!

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.980
Dissolve.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.230
Not only can you negate magic,
you can repel it, as well.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.730
But that is not enough to defeat me.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.580
The blades of ice will 
come one after another.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.030
Now, just try and protect them.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.710
Damn you!

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:09.460
It's going to take everything Asta 
and I have to protect the villagers.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.760
Not to mention, my powers 
are reaching their limit.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.960
And they have four guys who are 
at least Magic Knight level.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.220
And that guy's still hiding his true powers!

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.030
This turned out to be one hell 
of a first mission for those two!

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.220
This isn't good!

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:32.820
But if I cut and run now, I'm not a real man!

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.170
It just so happens I'm a lowly 
commoner myself! I'll protect you!

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.550
Magna!

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.240
I wonder how long you'll last.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.250
To think one of you can't 
even control her powers...

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.750
I guess the Black Bulls were 
truly desperate for members.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.880
These frail little beasts who can't 
even protect themselves...

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.890
If you abandon them,
I'll let you live, Magic Knights.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.140
Like hell I'll abandon them!

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:12.390
A real man doesn't abandon anybody!

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.710
I'm... royalty.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.320
I have more magical power 
than anyone else here.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.230
Step back, Lady Noe!

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.990
And yet I'm just holding them back!

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.890
There's no reason for me to be here.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.460
If you abandon them, I'll let you live...

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.520
That's right. I'm royalty.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.500
I'm not supposed to die 
in a village like this.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.010
I should just run—

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.010
Miss Magic Knight...

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.270
Save us!

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.520
This little girl is asking for help.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.420
I'm going to protect them!

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.530
A new spell?

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.080
There's no way...

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.710
I can run now!

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.310
I'll protect them! I'm royalty,

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.900
and a member of the Black Bulls!

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:56.890
No one can escape from here

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:03.640
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:11.600
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:18.600
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.480
I've thought many times

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.150
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:32.820
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:39.620
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:46.880
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.760
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.770
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.290
Petit Clover

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.890
Petit Clover!

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.830
Separation and Reunion

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.830
Boar, boar, boar... boar, boar, boar.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.670
Boar, boar, boar, boar...

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.420
I'm sorry
I destroyed the fields!

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.980
Oh, all right. Just don't do it again!

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:27.650
I won't!

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.150
Boar! Boar!

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.180
Boar!

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.180
Take care!

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.490
Check out
Black Clover
next week, too!

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.180
Boar!

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.020
That's awesome, Noelle!

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.270
A path will always open,
as long as you don't give up!

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.110
We're going to protect everyone,
 no matter what!
