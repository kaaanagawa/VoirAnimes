00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.770
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.780
Yami's tales of his younger years taught Asta

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.950
that you'll always find a path 
as long as you don't give up,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.890
and Asta's competitive spirit was 
ignited in his rivalry with Yuno.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.680
All right! I'm gonna catch 
up to Yuno and surpass him!

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.650
And then...

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.380
The hell?

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.980
I dunno who the hell you are,
 but stop that racket!

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.720
Don't you know that this is the 
home of the Black Bulls,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.700
the Magic Knights Squad that Mister Yami—

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.580
Th-The heck?!

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.900
Y-You're Lady Sisgoleon!

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.990
Formation of the Royal Knights

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.260
Mereoleona Vermillion

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.530
What? Are you serious?

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.450
What the hell is the Captain of 
the Crimson Lion Kings doing here?

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.350
Yeah!

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.350
Yeah! What are you doing here,
 Captain Sisgoleon?!

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.900
It's Mereoleona!

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.530
What the hell is all that racket?

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.630
I can't even take a dump in pea—

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.110
It's an emergency! A wild beast 
has invaded the premises!

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.490
Everyone, leave the base immediately!

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.170
Any of you that don't make 
it out, just play dead!

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.250
Don't look her in the eye! She'll eat you!

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.810
Just shut up and accept this, you fool.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.830
Um... Is this some hellish drink 
that'll set my throat ablaze

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.010
and make me spit fire after a single sip?

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.010
It's to thank you for visiting Fuegoleon.
Do you wanna die for real?

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.030
You don't need to thank me.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.990
At any rate, this drink can't be for humans 
if someone as violent as you likes it.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.150
I don't want it.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.700
Okay, I'm going to kill you.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.650
You're not supposed to kill 
the person you're thanking.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.670
I'll kill you with gratitude.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.400
Your eyes are way too serious...

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360
I dislike jokes.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.550
You don't want it, Captain? 
Then can I have it?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.700
Oh, I see. You just came to see Captain Yami.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.010
I totally thought you were gonna 
take me someplace awful aga—

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.850
While I'm at it, I might 
as well take you lot, too.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.500
What do you mean by that?! 
Where are you taking us?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.720
Hell? Is it hell?!

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.020
No! Wh-Why are you taking me, too?!

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.020
Are there strong people where we're going?

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.990
Are you leaving already? But I made tea...

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.450
H-Hey! Your squad members 
are being kidnapped!

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.520
Do something!

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.990
Well, if that means you're leaving, have at it.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.850
What?!

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.360
We're sacrifices! What the heck 
did we do to deserve this?!

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.700
Looks like you guys shoulda 
been better people!

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.130
Especially you, Luck! Serves you damn right!

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.180
They all passed the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.940
What?!

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.190
W-We passed?!

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.770
We made it into the Royal Knights?!

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.770
I couldn't win the tournament,
but Yuno didn't leave me behind, either!

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.900
We can both still strive to become the 
Wizard King and fight on the same stage!

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.030
Heck yeah!

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.710
I did it!

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.720
I passed! I passed!

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.880
That means I get to stay with Asta—

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.870
N-Not that I actually care about that!

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.830
I-I mean, I'm happy that Asta passed,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.260
but that's just because he's in 
the same squad as me! Yeah!

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.170
That's all it is!

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.740
Noelle, it'll be great working 
together as fellow Royal Knights!

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.110
H-Hmph.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.430
Don't go barging in on your own again 
and cause trouble for everyone else.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.440
Yeah! I've been training even harder, 
so you don't have to worry about that!

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.770
Did you even hear what I said?! 
I said <i>don't</i> go barging into places!

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.520
By the way, I believe there's 
one other Black Bull who passed.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.780
Huh? One more?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.900
R-Really? Maybe I'm the 
one you're looking for.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.140
Hey, right here!

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.280
I don't see him, though.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.950
Hello?! I'm right here!

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.960
Right here! Magna Swing!

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.180
It's not you.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.290
It doesn't matter. 
A summons has been sent to them.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.290
Guess I didn't make it after all.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.910
Magna...

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.060
Too bad for you, Magna.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.890
I'm gonna become even stronger 
in the Royal Knights,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.940
so I might get too strong for you.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.350
H-Hey, what are you—

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.290
You've got some nerve, you little shit!

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.810
I'll keep getting back up no 
matter how many times I fall!

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.150
You'd better not crap your pants when you 
come back and I'm way stronger than you!

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.220
All right, training time! 
Vanessa, spar with me!

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.710
What? But I'm about to enjoy this.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.740
I wanna get stronger! I have to!

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.070
Oh, fine. I guess I'll just have my 
fun later, you virgin delinquent.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.500
Who are you calling a delinquent?!

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.510
You'd better be ready, Luck! 
So... come back safely.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.260
Yeah!

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.800
The same goes for you two.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.130
Yeah!

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.300
But of course.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.620
We'll be cheering you on.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.680
I'm loving the looks on their faces.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.710
Go kick some ass.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.440
Venue for the Royal Knights' Swearing-In Ceremony
The Tower of Hope

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.290
From the Silver Eagles, Nils Ragus.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.110
Yes, ma'am!

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.200
The Vice Captain of the Coral Peacocks,
 Kirsch Vermillion.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.700
Vice Captain of the Coral Peacocks, 1st Class Senior Magic Knight
Kirsch Vermillion

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.700
My name always sounds so beautiful.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.870
From the Blue Rose Knights, Puli Angel.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.630
Member of the Blue Rose Knights, 4th Class Senior Magic Knight
Puli Angel

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.630
I'm here! Did you all miss me?

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.200
From the Green Praying Mantises, En Ringard.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.150
Member of the Green Praying Mantises, 4th Class Senior Magic Knight
En Ringard

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.760
Hell yeah! Let's do this!

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.640
Yeah...

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.160
Captain of the Aqua Deer
Rill Boismortier

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.120
From the Aqua Deer, Captain Rill 
Boismortier and Fragil Tormenta.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.900
Member of the Aqua Deer Squad, 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Fragil Tormenta

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.980
Hi. I'm Rill, the Magic Knights Squad captain 
who couldn't even win the tournament.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.150
Captain, please get a hold of yourself!

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:54.870
From the Golden Dawn, Hamon Caseus, 
Klaus Lunettes, Mimosa Vermillion, and Yuno!

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.070
Yes, ma'am!

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.500
Member of the Golden Dawn, 2nd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Hamon Caseus

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.500
More candidates were chosen 
from our squad than any other.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.750
Member of the Golden Dawn, 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Klaus Lunettes

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.750
This is what we call Golden Dawn 
quality and Golden Dawn pride.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.520
Member of the Golden Dawn, 5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Yuno

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:10.360
Of course Yuno was chosen! 
He was the MVP of the Selection Exam!

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.260
Bell

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.260
Hey, are you listening?

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.760
From the Black Bulls, 
Luck Voltia, Noelle Silva, and Asta.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.260
Yes, ma'am!

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.310
How you like that, Yuno?! 
I didn't get left behind!

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.520
I'll keep getting back up, 
no matter how many times I fall!

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.300
And you'll fall again.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.700
You do nothing but fall.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.730
Yeah, whenever I get a chance..

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.590
Wait! What the hell, man?!

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.740
I'm just stating the truth.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.600
Yeah, and the part where I keep 
getting back up is true, too!

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.240
Guess he accepted the falling part.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.500
Member of the Golden Dawn, 5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Mimosa Vermillion

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.500
I'm so happy that I get to 
work with you again, Asta.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.420
Likewise!

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.700
I'm late in introducing myself,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.000
but I'm Mereoleona Vermillion, 
and I've been appointed

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.840
the Captain of the Royal Knights!

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.030
What?! Lady Sisgoleon's the 
Captain of the Royal Knights?!

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.600
Wait, why's no one else surprised?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.150
I figured that'd be the case.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.980
She just did roll call, and she's 
the one who came to get us.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.310
Got a problem with me?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.570
Absolutely not!

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:18.370

1st Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Ruben Shagger

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.430
Not only is she leading our 
Crimson Lion Kings Squad,

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.730
Lady Mereoleona's also royalty!
 Who could be more fit?

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.370
Yes.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.040
I would've preferred

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.460
that our captain of the Golden Dawn, 
Captain Vangeance, be chosen,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.750
but he's busy leading the troops guarding 
the royal capital, so this'll have to do.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.780
If any of you have any objections, 
don't hold back! State them now!

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.650
I also won't hold back in crushing you!

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.270
You can't be serious.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:40.300
Listen up! You sixteen survived 
the brutal Selection Exam

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.140
and were chosen to become Royal Knights.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.620
If there are no objections,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.580
from this day until we annihilate 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.650
your lives will be in my hands!

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.070
Yes, ma'am!

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.650
Hm? One, two, three...

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.550
One of you is missing.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.700
Is he disrespecting me by being late?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.160
My bad! Guess I'm late.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.170
So you <i>are</i> disrespecting me.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.960
I wanted to see how strong you were,
since my life's going to be in your hands.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.180
Pleasure to work with you.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.020
You're—

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.270
Wait!

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.450
Wh-Why the heck are you wearing that robe?!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.280
Hey! Why the heck are you 
wearing a Black Bulls robe?!

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.660
You dumbass. It's because I'm a member 
of the Black Bulls, obviously.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.590
What?!

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.430
You're one of the Black Bulls?!

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.920
Hey! Explain yourself!

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.750
It's a bittersweet memory from years ago.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:05.010
I was kicking the asses of some 
Magic Knights due to reasons.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.660
Magic Knights?! You can't do that!

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.570
Ow!

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.810
Shut up. I said I had reasons, you little shit.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.160
Anyway, while I was doing that, 
I ran into this terrible monster,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.780
and he ended up kicking my ass instead.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.990
Y-You bastard...

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.530
This is...

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.540
You're pretty fun, so you can have that.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.750
You can toss it if you don't want it, though.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.100
Quit messing with me, you crazy Magic Knight!

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.860
Like I'd ever wear—

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.840
You shouldn't just hand these out like candy!

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.090
See? You do understand.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.290
Anyway, you can just put it 
on whenever you feel like it.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.470
So, yeah, that's what happened.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.400
Yami scouted me, and I got into the 
Magic Knights through the back door.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.490
What the heck, Xerx?! That's not fair!

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.780
Also got in through
 the back door

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.780
Do you have any idea what 
I went through to get in?!

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.240
Also, I'm not Xerx.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.810
The name's Zora Ideale, 
you shitty little junior shrimp.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.000
What?! What the heck is a Zora?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.370
Is that your real name?!

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.810
I just told you it was, you stupid shrimp.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.630
Why the heck did you lie?!

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.140
You know what they say.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.640
If you want to fool your enemies, 
you need to fool your friends first.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.330
What enemies?! And wait, 
are you my senior, then?!

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.640
Damn straight. Show me some respect.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.140
Heck no! And you need to 
apologize for a lot of things!

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.420
What was your name again? Zura?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.490
It's Zora.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.060
I don't know what the heck is going on!

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.690
You're so noisy, you shitty little shrimp.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.690
Ah, what the hell?

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.860
I'll start working toward it now. Not a 
super mage, but a true Magic Knight.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.750
Here you go. Have another rainbow stink bug.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.150
It's a raging stench!

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.270
Actually, it smells kinda okay 
once you get used to it...

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.770
It absolutely does not!

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.830
You're right! It reeks like no other!

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.680
Hey, you should fight me, too!

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.410
How long are you gonna keep yapping, 
you impudent little fools?!

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.770
We're sorry!

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.090
Huh? Where'd everyone else go?

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.790
They went to change into their 
Royal Knights robes ages ago, you fools!

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.830
R-Royal Knights robes, you say?!

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.530
What in the world is that 
super-cool-sounding thing?!

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.810
They were created for our fight against

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.880
the Eye of the Midnight Sun, 
with high resistance to magic attacks!

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.330
Hurry up and go change!

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.790
Hey, look!

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.480
Well? Well?

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.260
Isn't he just the handsomest?

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.210
I think I fell in love all over again!

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.300
Who knew a day would come when 
we'd be wearing the same robes?

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.770
But we're not on the same level.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.430
I'm the one who'll become the Wizard King.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.020
Nope, it's me!

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.710
You can't be serious.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.150
All right, it looks like 
you've all finished changing.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.590
So beautiful. Why do I look 
so good in everything?

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.030
Brother, you're so narcissistic 
that it's making me ill.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.160
This is so exhilarating.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.530
It fits so nicely, even on us heftier folks.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.420
Whoo! I'm so pumped!

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.500
I-I guess it's not bad.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.050
Um...

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.150
Why's mine so short?!

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.050
What's with that robe?!

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.150
Asta, why are you joking around?

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.760
I'm not! This is how it 
looked when I put it on!

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.400
Guess the half-baked twit 
also gets just half a robe.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.570
We ran out of fabric because we 
got a few additional members.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.740
Additional members?

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:54.490
They didn't take the exam, but they 
are essential to making this plan work.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.500
Mage Attendant to the Wizard King
Cob Portaport

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.500
1st Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Shiren Tium

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.750
Shiren Tium and Cob Portaport.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.710
Shiren's stone creation magic can 
create models of the enemy's base

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.250
and measure the magic 
levels of the mages there.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.010
Cob has very convenient spatial magic.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:15.010
He has been added because Finral Roulacase 
is still recovering from his injuries.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.020
And one more...

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:22.020
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.020
Nozel Silva! He will be joining us, too.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.480
Nozel...

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.120
The Captain of the Silver Eagles?

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.750
We couldn't ask for better!

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.990
Unbelievable! I get to 
fight alongside my captain!

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.050
I figured you'd decline. 
What brought this on?

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:44.000
I don't want to hear anything from you. 
I'm only here because the king ordered it.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:49.260
You lot, along with these three,
 are the Royal Knights!

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.360
What?! Hey, Nozel!

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.710
Why did you just show up 
like it's no big deal?!

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.730
You didn't even take the exam!
 That's not fair!

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:03.190
What I want to know is, why did <i>you</i> bother 
taking the exam when you're a captain?

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.270
What?! I could've joined 
without even taking the exam?!

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:13.300
King of the Clover Kingdom
Augustus Kira Clover XIII

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.870
The Eye of the Midnight Sun
 is a fearsome enemy!

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.410
The aid of a Magic Knights Squad captain,
particularly a royal one, will be essential!

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.010
Nothing beats royalty! 
It's all about us royals!

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.370
Hey, it's the king.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.080
Hello, Your Majesty, 
King Augustus Kira Clover XIII.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.660
She's so fierce.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.160
I can't remember the last time 
anyone used my full name.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.490
Listen well, men! Don't do 
anything to bring shame upon—

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.070
I think you all know this, but we have 
no use for anything other than victory!

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.440
The Eye of the Midnight Sun is

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.980
a terrorist organization that 
threatens the Clover Kingdom!

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.020
If we don't take care of them ourselves, 
there will never be peace in our land!

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.990
You all worked together when 
they attacked the royal capital

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.650
and were successful in eliminating them,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.530
but there were still severe consequences.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.160
My foolish younger brother Fuegoleon 
fell at the enemy's hands,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.290
and he has still not awakened.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.500
What we learned from the agents 
we captured is that their leader

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.840
is a mage with a four leaf
 clover grimoire, Licht.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.800
We learned that they have an upper 
echelon called the Third Eye...

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.270
And that, for reasons unknown,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.040
they are collecting magic 
stones in order to be

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.030
reborn in their true forms 
and obtain great power.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.810
There are only three magic stones left.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.290
We were able to obtain two of 
them before they got to them.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:36.110
We were also able to defeat Vetto,
the Third Eye's user of beast magic,

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.700
as well as Fana, who commanded Salamander.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:44.160
The remaining member of the Third Eye
 is a user of copy magic, Raia.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:51.260
There's no doubt that Raia and Licht will 
be our strongest opponents in this battle!

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.420
We are going to be attacking 
their stronghold,

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.010
so our enemy will do everything 
they can to stop us.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.560
Some of us may fall,

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.100
but we will be victorious!

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.850
We are going to give our all in this battle!

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.460
Any fools who fail to do so will be

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.610
taken out by me before we even 
get to the enemy's stronghold!

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.010
Are you ready?!

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.360
Yes!

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.490
Your Majesty, King Augustus Kira Clover XIII!

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.160
Wh-Why are you yelling at me?!

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.960
Please continue what you were saying earlier.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.170
You're ordering me to continue the conversation 
when you already said everything?!

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.670
There's absolutely nothing else left to say!

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.720
Well, do good work out there. That is all.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.690
Really?!

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.420
That's it?

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.380
Oh, yeah. Where is the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's hideout, anyway?

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.540
A good question, even though 
he's an infuriating little peasant.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.920
Well—

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.340
The Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.160
is located in...

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:07.330
Strong Magic Region "Gravito Stones"
Floating Dungeon

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:06.180
a floating dungeon within the strong 
magic region known as Gravito Stones!

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.970
Guess I'm pretty late.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.440
Heya.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.950
I see you look as moronic as ever.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:29.090
Don't be like that. 
Let's have a drink sometime, Miss.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.140
I decline.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.680
He is pretty weak.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.150
Oh, there they are.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.630
Hey there, Raia.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.990
Jeez, you're late!

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.610
Are you too lazy to even wake up nowadays?

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.870
You're the worst.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.240
Oh, shut up.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:53.000
Jeez, Patry. Hogging the 
spot next to Licht again?

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.630
After tomorrow's ceremony, 
he's going to belong to someone else,

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.910
so you should probably cut the cord soon.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.490
Shut up. I can do what I want.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.910
What, you little brat?!

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.280
It's fine. Even if I marry Licht, 
he still belongs to everyone.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.020
The human princess sure is nice.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.270
That kindness is going to 
cause you trouble someday.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:18.110
Anyway, that space is gonna 
be gone sooner or later.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.570
Stop picking on him. Patry knows that.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.660
So, Licht, how does it feel, knowing you're
 going to be a father in a few months?

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.240
I can feel the mana blessing us.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.260
I'm very happy our child will come into 
this world welcomed by everyone.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.300
This child is our future.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.220
It'll bridge the gap between elves and humans.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.840
Congratulations, Licht and Tetia!

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.220
Congratulations!

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.920
Talk about a fleeting dream...

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.700
I guess the awakening must be near.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:37.540
Petit Clover

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.770
Petit Clover!

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.040
All Kinds of Robes
Part 1

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.040
All Kinds of Robes, Part 1.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.230
R-Royal police robes, you say?!

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.670
What in the world is that 
super-cool-sounding thing?!

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.580
They're robes made to 
excel in investigations!

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.430
Hurry up and go change!

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.680
Halt

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.680
