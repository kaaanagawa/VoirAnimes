00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.740
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.680
Making the impossible possible is 
what happens here in the Glamour World.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.370
Vanessa and the others were pulled 
into the world of fantasy

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.600
and faced off with Dorothy, 
who had reincarnated as an elf, but...

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.230
Combo Spell: Flame Lightning 
Exploding Cannon!

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.740
They all worked together to defeat 
Dorothy and escape Glamour World.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.080
Combo Spell: Reflect Iris.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.450
I can't...

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.580
...move!

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.590
Now you can just die, completely helpless.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.450
Meanwhile, Asta and the other
 Black Bulls were fighting

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.010
Gauche and Marie, who had 
reincarnated as elves,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.470
and found themselves in danger!

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.340
The rest is...

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.720
...up... to... you.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.780
Not yet, Henry!

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.770
Live!

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.740
I don't want to die.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.690
I want to continue living with my friends.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.820
Let's continue living together!

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.160
I don't want to lose a 
single one of my friends!

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.240
That goes for you, too...

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.750
Gauche!

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880
I need you to return those 
bodies to Gauche and Marie.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.380
Asta managed to expel the 
elves from Gauche and Marie,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.420
and was successful in 
returning them to normal.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.410
Thanks... you jerks.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.430
All right! The Black Bulls are all here!

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.560
Once we're all recovered, 
we're gonna go after Captain Yami!

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.420
Yeah!

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.690
Storming the Shadow Palace

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.330
So that must be the Shadow Palace...

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.970
You know what that is?

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.180
Indeed.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.450
Spatial magic from ancient times...

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.960
To think it actually existed.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.530
They say that you can find extremely 
powerful ancient magic items

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.800
and treasures inside.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.020
So exactly what are we supposed to do?

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.060
Yes, I wonder...

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.400
All right! Eat up, everyone! La!

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.770
Captain Yami and Captain Mantis
 already went in,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.150
but it seems like there 
are some powerful enemies,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.500
so we're gonna recover our 
mana and then go help!

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.460
Here, Marie. Say, "Aah..."

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.460
Oh, stop it, Big Brother.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.880
No need to be shy, my goddess!

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.290
"Aah..."

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.220
I told you, I don't want to.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.160
Come on, Gauche. No need to be shy.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.470
"Aah..."

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.810
My beautiful magic is recovering beautifully.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.970
All the pain in my entire body is gone!

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.960
Thanks, Mimosa!

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.870
It was nothing, Asta.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.990
Now I can fight in my black form again!

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.800
Go on. Eat up, Mimosa.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.370
Thank you.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.210
Honestly, all you ever do is get hurt.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.860
You overdid it again, didn't you?

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.550
I swear, you're hopeless without me.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.570
I mean, you're hopeless anyway! 
D-Don't get the wrong idea!

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.730
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.640
Asta, your body's pretty unique, 
so make sure you take good care of it.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.570
Hey! Aren't those Asta's clothes?

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.410
Yeah, so?

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.650
Oh, yeah. Her clothes were all 
tattered, so I let her borrow mine.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.390
H-How does that even happen?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.260
More importantly, why's a girl from the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun with us, anyway?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.740
It's bugging you <i>now</i>?

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.280
I was promised that I can do whatever 
I want with his body after this battle.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.420
Huh?!

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.650
Huh?!

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.290
Wh-Whatever you want?!

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.400
I didn't say "whatever you want"!

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.500
But you did! I promise I'll use anesthesia!

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.300
H-H-Hey!

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.420
Wh-What are you doing?! 
Are you stupid, Stupidsta?!

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.270
Wait, me?!

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.500
A-A-Anyway, you're in the way of me 
healing him, so please step away!

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.860
What? But you're already done healing.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.700
Stupidsta... you stupidhead!

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.910
Hey, Lady Noe, quit fooling around 
and eat to recover your mana.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.120
You shut your mouth.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.660
Hey, I have seniority here!

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.710
And? I'm royalty.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.090
But I'm your senior!

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.670
What's up?

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.150
They're coming.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.720
Two elves.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.670
Too slow!

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.600
Die!

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.580
About time you woke up, you fool!

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.830
I apologize for the trouble 
I've caused you, my sister.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.120
Fu... Me...

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.460
Captain Fuegoleon! Captain Mereoleona!

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.260
Captain Fuegoleon! I'm so 
relieved that you're awake!

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.750
Wait, and you've got Salamander, too?!

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.260
Former Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Fuegoleon Vermillion

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.260
Ah, Asta. It appears you've 
gotten stronger during my slumber.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.850
Heck yeah! I'm totally ripped!

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.630
Lady Mereoleona,

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.360
The New Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Mereoleona Vermillion

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.170
I heard you were supposed to be 
resting for at least one more day!

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.360
Who cares? I'm fine.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.850
What?!

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.860
She seriously is a monster.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.120
So it appears the Vermillions have 
finally returned to the battlefield.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.390
Lord Nozel is amazing!

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.790
It's hard to believe he just recovered.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.790
Sorry to keep you waiting, Nozel.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.550
Hmph. Hopefully this doesn't 
affect your performance.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.800
So you've been chosen by Salamander. 
Trying to outdo me again, I see.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.760
Uh... Wha?!

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.100
Hey, that hole!

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.520
Is it me, or is it getting smaller?!

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.650
Oh, no... We have to hurry!

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.570
When we put the final magic stone 
in its pedestal inside the palace,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.030
the elves' reincarnation 
will be complete!

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.560
In exchange, the souls of the 
humans who owned these bodies

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.580
will be sent to the underworld!

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.390
...is what he said!

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.000
How dare you...

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.450
You humans!

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.010
The Golden Dawn's Senior Magic Knights...

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.930
Really? Right now?

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.010
There are no limits to my beauty,

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.030
but apparently, that was the 
end of my beautiful magic.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.670
There's no time.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.230
But with these numbers...

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.170
Captains, please head to the Shadow Palace!

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.390
We, the Black Bulls, will take care of them!

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.830
As long as Charmy and I are here, we won't die!

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.620
Leave it to us, la!

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.410
Asta, you go, too!

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.960
They'll probably need that sword of yours!

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.290
Roger!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.630
I wish you luck, everyone!

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.870
Yeah!

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:40.140
There are still a lot of people taken over 
by elves over here, so hurry back!

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.310
Yes, sir!

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.500
I-I'll go, too—

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.020
They'll also need a wizard 
with recovery magic.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.030
Go with them, Mimosa.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.570
My beauty and I shall beautifully 
support everyone here.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.710
Right!

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.400
I'll be able to protect Asta. 
For once, good job, Big Brother.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.010
I-I—

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.170
Noelle!

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.810
Solid?!

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.250
You go, too!

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.370
Huh?

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.630
I'll admit it... You're definitely 
stronger than me right now.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.670
But I'm going to surpass you someday!

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.330
Because I'm your older brother!

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.180
So go, and make sure you come back!

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.280
Your pride as a royal...

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.650
As a part of the Silva family is at stake!

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:36.150
Indeed. I'll come back, no matter what, Solid!

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.170
All right, here we go!

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.660
Don't fall behind!

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.910
Come.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.150
We won't let you!

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.630
We won't let you get in their way!

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.430
Here we go!

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.390
To the Shadow Palace!

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.110
Where the heck are we?!

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.670
What's going on here?!

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.710
Is this... an obstacle to anyone 
who tries to infiltrate the palace?

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.160
We're surrounded by strange mana.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.430
I can't control my magic!

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.440
The Shadow Palace...

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.720
I hear it's the boundary 
between this world and the next.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.320
Wait... Are we going to die?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.420
D-Don't be stupid, Stupidsta!

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.560
That's not funny!

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.980
I won't die!

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.860
Mimo—

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.250
I-I... I'm so sorry, Asta!

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.250
I-I'll heal you right away!

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.780
Plant Recovery Magic: 
Princess-Healing Flower Robe.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.230
So we're inside the Shadow Palace now?

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.430
Where did everyone else go?

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.730
Heck yeah! I'm fully healed again!

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.490
Thanks, Mimosa!

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.070
First, I'll use Magic Flower Guidepost 
to determine the layout of the palace.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.320
Man, you're so amazing, Mimosa!

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.070
This is...

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.330
There are a number of big spaces, 
and I feel an elf's mana in each.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:57.170
We're in one of the paths 
that connect those chambers.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.350
It appears our comrades have 
been scattered to other locations.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.580
They'll have to defeat 
the enemies waiting there

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.090
before we can all regroup.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.940
This is not good.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.450
We're up against the Apostles of Sephira,

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.350
who all possess more magic than
 a Magic Knights Squad captain.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.660
I feel the most powerful magic 
in the uppermost chamber!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.400
That must be him!

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.900
All right! Everyone's just gonna have to 
take care of the enemy waiting for them,

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.070
and we'll regroup at the top,
where the boss is!

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.910
Right!

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.160
The central chamber is right above us.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:34.960
Let us proceed.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.160
Yeah!

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.840
I dunno who we're up against,

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.170
but Mimosa and I are just gonna have to win!

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.100
Don't tell me...

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.730
These pictures...

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.360
Welcome!

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.550
We've met before!

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.620
Rill!

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.820
Jeez, I keep telling you 
that my name is Lira.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.360
Well, whatever.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.090
I'm gonna have you guys practice with me 
until the last magic stone arrives, 'kay?

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.960
Just wait! I'll wake you up right now!

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.970
But I'm already awake.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.180
Isn't picture magic fun?

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.020
It took a little while to get used to,

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.780
but I can draw more things than 
I could with my old scribble magic.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.980
We're going to draw a new world...

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:50.070
On a pure white canvas, 
after we've erased all you humans!

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.580
Yeah, I guess it's not 
gonna be so easy after all!

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.820
Why...

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.860
Why am I alone?!

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.840
Where did everyone go?!

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.360
Well, if you're that lonely, 
I'll play with you.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.850
It might not be for very long, though.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.520
Fana? Wh-What are you doing here?

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.830
I wonder if you're mistaking 
me for someone else.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.820
I may be Fana, but I'm not the Fana you know.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.070
So I guess you're the one I get to fight.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.240
You've got interesting mana, for human royalty.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.930
Watch your mouth. I guess I'll have 
to teach you some manners, brat.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:47.590
Though my body is young, I'm not a 
beast that can be tamed by a mere human.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:54.410
I heard that you became a captain... 
Yet we meet to fight in such circumstances.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.600
How regrettable.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.700
The kingdom's ultimate shield, Lord Kaiser!

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:06.860
There's no need to hold back. 
After all, I don't know you.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.640
Indeed, I shall not hold back,
 as that would be rude.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.870
Lord Kaiser is both capable and virtuous.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.050
He doesn't like being in the spotlight,

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.220
but I assume he took on the role of Captain

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.380
of the Purple Orcas for 
the sake of his subordinates.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.320
His wife was very worried about him.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.050
Lord Kaiser is an excellent Magic Knight.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.370
He has people awaiting his return.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.310
You will be returning him to us!

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.690
Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath!

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.070
That is an incredibly powerful spell,

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.320
though it shall not reach me.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.490
Lord Kaiser's vortex magic...

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.580
He uses his own magic to deflect 
and disperse his opponents' spells.

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.220
Now, in combination with the elf's magic,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.870
it's enough for him to withstand spirit magic.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.190
Magic attacks won't work against him.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.050
The vortex is not used only
for defense, but also for attacks.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.470
Despite my Mana Skin, 
I'm sustaining this much damage...

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.290
On top of that, he's washing my magic away!

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.650
Not good.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.010
I burned you to a crisp, but you
 still came charging at me!

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:07.270
Such incredible speed, reflexes... and power!

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.460
Not bad, you little brat!

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.330
Right back at you!

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.940
I never knew there was a 
human as capable as you!

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.200
I haven't had this much fun 
fighting with a brat one-on-one

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.290
since that one time,

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.710
with that super-serious fool.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.090
He detects magic automatically 
and blocks it.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.710
I have no way of hitting 
him with my attacks.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.370
This unfair strength advantage he has...

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.760
It reminds me of my sister.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.580
Ever since she was little, she was
 audacious and full of spirit.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.380
I idolized her amazing strength.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.590
But I also eventually got irritated 
with her overly carefree attitude.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.050
I found you!

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.380
You won't get away this time!

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.290
Sister, it's time for our 
training lessons with Theresa.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.060
Sister!

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.340
Just let her be, Fueggy.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.470
Mereo will be able to get stronger on her own.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:18.300
Theresa Rapual

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.300
That's just the kind of genius she is.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.410
Looking back on it now, I must've 
been jealous of my sister.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.270
Please wait!

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.440
You're not going to join 
the Crimson Lion Kings?

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.520
Correct.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.370
But why?

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.390
As strong as you are, you'd become 
an incredibly powerful Magic Knight!

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.030
You could even become the Wizard King!

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.740
Tomorrow,

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.290
after I receive my grimoire, I'm going 
to go explore the strong magic regions.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.740
Like I have time to waste doing boring 
guard duties or dealing with wimpy criminals.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.690
How stupid.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.050
Stupid?

00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.930
Sister...

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.850
Would you spar a round with me?

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.850
Right here, right now.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.880
So you're actually going 
to go all-out today?

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.580
What a hardnose.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.780
This huge fight between the eldest son

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.200
and eldest daughter of the Vermillion family...

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:28.500
would eventually be known as 
"The Tuesday of Blood and Flames."

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.980
Back then, that fool was on fire!

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.840
You're probably the most 
powerful human in this kingdom!

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.800
I'm sure if I defeat you, the other 
humans won't stand a chance.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.100
Be...

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.170
...gone!

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.600
Be...

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.360
...gone!

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.150
No.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.290
She's unorthodox, carefree, and doesn't
 let anything hold her down.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.500
She's crazy, but her blinding 
strength is feared by all,

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.270
and she opened up a path for herself!

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.650
He's overbearing, stupidly serious, 
and much too responsible.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.910
His refined and extraordinary 
strength is respected by all,

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.510
and they follow his lead.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.300
She...

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:29.890
He...

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.140
...is worthy of being the strongest!

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.770
Reignition...

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.390
...Times Two!

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:40.790
He used Salamander as a decoy 
and erased his own magic,

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.400
slipped through my vortex detection, 
and got right in close to me!

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.290
She used sheer willpower 
to get through my attacks

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.410
and loaded the magic she 
saved up for her next attack!

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.160
As my sister's younger brother...

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.040
As that fool's older sister...

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.540
I must...

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.960
...be strong!

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.530
Hey, hey, it's Fana.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.690
Hm? Fana from the Diamond Kingdom?

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.150
I'm Fana and she's Fana, 
but we're not the same Fana.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.610
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 114: "The Final Invaders."

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 114
 The Final Invaders

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.310
She's her own Fana, just like I'm my own Fana.
