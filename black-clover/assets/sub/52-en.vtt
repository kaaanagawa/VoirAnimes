WEBVTT

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.010
Yami, Asta, Charmy, and Finral 
came to report to the Wizard King

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.270
after their battle at the Underwater Temple.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.220
And then...

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.980
I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.120
The border town of Kiten, which has a history 
of skirmishes with the Diamond Kingdom,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.150
is under attack by a 
Diamond Kingdom squad.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.410
Wh-What's with that massive horde of people?!

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.640
Three of the Eight Shining Generals.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.040
What are the Eight Shining Generals?

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.870
The eight strongest from the Diamond Kingdom.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.250
They're similar to the Magic Knights 
Captains of the Clover Kingdom.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.970
The first ones to arrive at Kiten 
in their time of need were...

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.800
That's—

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.480
The Clover Kingdom's most
powerful Magic Knights Squad.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.900
The Golden Dawn!

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.830
Yami and the others headed 
to Kiten as reinforcements.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.820
Just you wait, Yuno!

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.160
Let's make them regret barging into 
our country with their muddy boots.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.720
Whoever's Strongest Wins

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.860
Man, you girls sure are cute!

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.220
I know a meadow where there are 
flowers as beautiful as you two.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.940
Say, why don't we take a little 
trip there with my spatial magic?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.650
What's the matter? You look like you 
just saw something really scary.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.150
They're going to murder us!

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.020
Hey! What's the big idea?!

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.100
Relax, la.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.250
Shut up! Hurry up and get 
us to the town called Kiten!

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.500
Huh? But I thought we were off today...

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.730
You don't get any time off.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.380
You can have all the time off 
you want once you're dead.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.790
What?!

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.000
Let's do this, Finral!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.720
Hurry up with the portal 
already, you bastard.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.990
C'mon, let's see how far you can jump.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.010
Are you mugging me now?!

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.410
We're counting on you, Finral!

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.220
Why are you so raring to go?!

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.320
My meal-saving prince!

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.030
What are you even talking about?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.580
Let's go!

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.600
Huh, what?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.600
Hurry it up!

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.110
Okay, fine! Here we go!

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.810
It's the Golden Dawn!

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.470
So you're the advance guard 
for the Golden Dawn?

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.970
Not bad for a little brat!

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.380
Goodness.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.080
Such a wretched form for a Shining General.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.590
How unsightly.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.630
Lagus!

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.760
I can't bear to watch. I'll lend you a hand.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.040
No one asked for your help!

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.020
He's mine!

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.370
It appears that the people 
have great faith in him.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.730
Lagus! Listen to me when I'm talking to you!

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.650
In that case, let's see if you can protect 
yourself as well as your people!

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.690
Arrows... Bell.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.410
Yup! Leave it to me!

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.290
Wind Magic: Swift White Bow.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.260
What?!

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.510
Impossible!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.790
He easily deflected my fastest 
lightning-coated arrows

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.640
and even broke through my barrier?

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.090
"See if you can actually protect them"?

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.230
That's my line.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.440
Wh-Who are you?

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.350
Let's see if <i>you</i> can protect 
yourself and your comrades.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.800
Yeah! Yeah!

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.290
Yuno and I are one, right?

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.460
Hey, why are you ignoring me?
At least say something!

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.860
"Something."

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.090
Really?! Quit messing with me, you smart-ass!

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.400
Want my help now, Lagus?

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.230
How dare he make me look like a fool?

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.210
He's mine! Stay out of my way, Brocks!

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.980
He's mine! You stay out of my way!

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.380
He's mine!

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.370
Mine!

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.380
Mine!

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.930
Mine!

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.880
What are you talking about?!

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.130
Yuno's mine!

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.740
Not a chance.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.120
Good grief.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.270
The kid I encountered in the 
dungeon has gotten a lot stronger.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.720
Man, it's not fair how fast kids grow.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.360
Way to make an old man feel older.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.050
My girls are growing up fast, too.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.960
When they were younger,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.730
they always said they wanted 
to marry me when they grew up.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.890
But now they won't even take baths with me.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.850
And they don't want my underwear
washed with their clothes...

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.670
A-Adjutant General Lotus?

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.660
And they say my breath smells like onions...

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.620
Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.200
There's no end to them!

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.210
All these people...

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.240
They're all so weak!

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.740
His magic keeps clinging to us,
making our spells not work properly!

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.040
There.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.660
Slime Creation Magic: Mucusnail!

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.670
This spell drastically weakens 
the magic of anyone it catches.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.930
You'll never be able to get out of there.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:20.770
I just love watching powerless 
weaklings writhe in agony.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.650
Wow, that looks like a
tough spell to deal with.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.910
Though, I mean, it's pretty 
useless against me.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.010
What was that spell?

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.080
Spatial magic?

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.930
Yikes... The one thing about this spell
is that it sort of destroys anything.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.720
Oh, well. I guess someone will 
just have to rebuild it.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.970
Let's see... That guy's definitely 
the leader of the Golden Dawn.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.360
I wonder why he's just 
standing there. How creepy.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.370
He's got his grimoire open, so I 
think he's using magic, but...

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.630
All I see is what looks 
like tree roots spreading.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.150
A spell to grow a huge tree?

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.630
That sounds nice and peaceful.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.670
But there's no one who could summon a spell 
big enough to protect this whole city.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.330
He's using other people's magic?

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.670
Why do I always notice stuff like this?

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.940
Calling the three generals! 
This is Adjutant General Lotus.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.240
The enemy general,
the captain of the Golden Dawn,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.860
Mine!

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.370
seems to be activating a 
large-scale magic attack.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.040
Mine!

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.110
Mine!

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.650
Mine!

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.120
At the very least,
the range will include all of Kiten.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.120
Mine!

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.850
I repeat! The captain of the Golden Dawn 
is activating a large-scale magic attack.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.850
And they're definitely not listening.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.880
What should I do? Run?

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.810
The time is at hand.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.080
The great tree shall now bloom!

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.760
What the heck is this insane magic?

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.050
World Tree Magic: Great Mistilteinn Tree.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.450
All for the Clover Kingdom's prosperity.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.820
So this is Kiten.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.010
Wait, whoa! What the heck is this giant tree?!

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.230
Trees like that grow around here?

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.680
Do you think there's giant fruit up there?!

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.910
Okay, that's enough out of you idiots.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.820
This is probably Captain Shiny's spell.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.990
Wait, what?! This is a spell?

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.770
Maybe they didn't need us after all.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.420
Really? Let's go back, then! Please?

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.680
Nah. I'm gonna go check and 
see how the battle's going.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.300
I'm assuming Captain Shiny's up top.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.850
I'm gonna head up there. You three help 
the townspeople, and try not to die.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:53.690
Leave it to us!

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.360
Hey! Y-Yami!

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.990
First, I'm gonna get me 
a piece of that fruit.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.240
Asta's hurt, and Charmy's... drooling.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.790
Yeah... I'm nervous.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.610
Good grief.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.420
Apparently, there was an incredible 
amount of magic on that battlefield.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.930
I suspect this cleaned up most of it, though.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.970
We've suffered a huge loss!
Our army's basically wiped out!

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.230
Our army... has basically been wiped out?

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.730
Curse you!

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.630
You know what they say 
about people who get greedy.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.740
How unsightly.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.210
My arms might be useless,
but I've still got my legs!

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.750
Everyone! Please come this way to escape!

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.460
Please get on this, la.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.470
Are you hurt? Please, come this way.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.450
Thank you.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.880
It is our duty as Magic Knights to 
save the citizens of the kingdom.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.080
If you're not busy,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.600
why don't we... get some tea later?

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.840
Whoops. If I look down, my tears will...

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.160
La?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.040
Someone's going head-to-head with 
one of the Diamond guys in the sky.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.160
Yuno!

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.410
My meal-saving prince!

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.590
Go! Go! My lovely prince!

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.030
You can do it, you can 
do it, my lovely prince!

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.130
La!

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.130
This young man is so strong...

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.090
Inconceivable! I'm one of 
the Eight Shining Generals!

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.350
You shall fall before my beautiful magic!

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.100
Beautiful?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.270
Beauty doesn't matter in battle.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.810
Whoever's strongest wins.
That's all there is to it.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.060
So beautiful...

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.690
He defeated him with a single blow!

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.530
Such a refreshing breeze...

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.190
I thought I saw a familiar little speck.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.160
What are you doing here, Asta?

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.400
That guy joined the Magic Knights 
the same time Asta did.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:28.020
Not to mention you're all torn up, 
scrambling around, and soaked with sweat...

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:29.780
Talk about ugly.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.140
He worked his way up into 
the Golden Dawn's elite?

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.010
Of course he'd make fun of the Black Bulls.
All that and he's handsome, too.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.790
He's probably super popular.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.120
The fact that you're so beat up means...

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.290
You got stronger again, didn't you?

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.200
Huh?

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.310
I'm not losing to you, Asta.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.260
Yuno's... smiling?

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.000
La...

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.450
I-I could eat a hundred bowls 
of rice along with that smile.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.610
Look who's talking! You got 
crazy strong, too, you jerk!

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.230
I'm not gonna lose either, Yuno!

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.850
He's an elite in the Golden Dawn,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.870
has super powerful magic, 
and is super handsome...

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.060
Yet he's competing with Asta,

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.150
a member of the Black Bulls, 
who's a meathead with zero magic!

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.640
They must be great rivals.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.170
Are you all right, Yuno?

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.340
Are you hurt at all?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.630
Asta!

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.130
Asta!

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.070
What happened to your arms?!

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.320
Are they gravely hurt?! Are you all right?!

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.590
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.750
Not that I was worried or anything.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.830
You got hurt because you let your guard down!

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.010
Pay more attention!

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.710
R-Right...

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.430
I'll heal you immediately 
with my recovery magic.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.070
I'm fine. Go ahead and 
heal all the citizens.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.360
Oh, my goodness! I shouldn't 
have been so forward!

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.420
I'm so sorry!

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.080
That's right! We don't have 
time to deal with you!

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.470
Let's go, Mimosa.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.530
Right.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.210
Yuno, you stay near Asta.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.210
I'm sure you can't fight 
with your arms like that.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.590
But I'm not trying to spoil you or anything!

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.330
You can go now.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.610
Please take care, Asta!

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.570
Bye-bye! Ow...

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.620
I finally found you.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.170
You must be the captain of the Golden Dawn.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.840
I had completely underestimated you.
Who knew you'd have such tremendous magic?

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.200
You've got impressive magic yourself.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.060
There's no reason to perish in vain.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.820
Take your comrades and leave this land.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.480
What?

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:14.790
Diamond soldiers never retreat!

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:20.570
Red Clay Magic: 
Brilliant Armor Heavy Artillery!

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.900
What's that weak little spell supposed to do?

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.130
Let me guess... You must 
be out of magic already.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.190
Victory is mine!

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.610
World Tree Magic: Mistilteinn Seed.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.140
You should be honored.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.140
Your magic has nourished the Clover Kingdom.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.240
A Diamond ambush? He must've been 
hiding with his magic concealed.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.620
Yami!

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.580
'Scuse me... Shiny Oddball Masked Dude.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.390
Ouch.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.130
I thought that if I could manage

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.490
to bag the Golden Captain,
I could turn things around, but...

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.540
To think the guy I fought 
back then would show up.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.570
And he's even stronger now to boot.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.710
Please stop leaving this 
old guy so far behind.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.960
Looks like you owe me one, Vangeance.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.020
You saved me, Yami.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.770
Ki, was it? How astounding.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.710
Hey, old Diamond dude that I don't know.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.560
Wanna surrender?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.540
Wait, really? You don't remember me?

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.080
Look. Right here.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.000
I've got no interest in 
your filthy-looking chest.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.330
Don't make me cut you down.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.850
D'oh...

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.840
So, what's it gonna be?

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.590
This is definitely bad news...

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.890
But now's the time to show you guys 
what a true Diamond looks like, and...

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.380
Retreat!

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.140
Didn't hesitate one bit. I like that.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.660
Well, then...

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.330
Now that we're alone in a 
spot with such a great view,

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.780
why don't we have a little chat, Vangeance?

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.660
Man, your world tree magic 
is as impressive as ever.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.700
Please. It's possible thanks 
to the enemies' magic.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.890
Right... Your magic <i>is</i> world tree magic.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.940
It is.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.580
Exactly what are you trying to say, Yami?

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.890
I'm someone who believes his gut instincts.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.980
Vangeance...

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:10.120
Could you take off that mask?

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.340
Petit Clover

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.790
Petit Clover!

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.850
Charmy's Seven Transformations

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.130
Charmy's Seven Transformations!

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.560
To all you Charmy Pappitson fans throughout 
the world, no... the universe.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.100
This is the moment you've been waiting for.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.570
Today, we'll be answering all your requests 
to see all those cute Charmy moments!

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.110
I've been waiting for this!

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.170
Transformation one... Wandering Charmy.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.160
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.380
Transformation two...

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.870
Deet de-deet de-deet de-deet and go!

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.870
Festival

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.210
Happi Coat Charmy.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.110
Transformation three...

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.370
Happy Birthday Charmy.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.000
La!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.290
Transformation four...

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.180
Lightning God Charmy.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.240
La!

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.510
Transformation five...

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.430
Alien Charmy!

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.260
La, la, la, la, la, la...

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.050
And last but not least, transformation six...

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.280
Merlion Charmy!

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:38.280
La, la, la, la, la, la...

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.870
Amazing!

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.570
So there aren't seven transformations?

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.390
Did you see, Asta, how unbelievably 
strong I've become?

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.860
I'm never going to lose to you... 
not in strength, looks, or height!
