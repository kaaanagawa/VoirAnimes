WEBVTT

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.850
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.330
a devil.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.370
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.740
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.780
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.880
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.760
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.680
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.780
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.300
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.140
We will defeat you!

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.690
The fate of the world is in our hands.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.120
Valkyrie Armor ~ Mermaid Form!

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.740
Loropechika and Noelle used the strategy 
they came up with to fight Vanica.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.740
And...

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.270
Nice! Okay, here I go! I'm gonna do it!

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.460
I'm going to give it my all!

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.000
70%!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Noelle!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.140
That's what we were waiting for!

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.380
Nero!

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.140
I'm going to seal that devil's 
power you're so proud of!

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.190
Mana Method: Sealing Magic ~ Eternal Prison!

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.530
I won't let scum like you take 
the world or Loropechika!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.800
We did it!

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.720
I did it. I sealed away Vanica's 
mana and the devil's power.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.500
Now Megicula's powers should 
stop working upon this kingdom.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.000
Loropechika's curse should be lifted.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.500
No...

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.240
You are clearly weaker than us,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.510
and yet you were able to produce 
such unpredictable magic.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.520
You truly are interesting.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.380
This ominous mana... Oh, no!

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.280
Loropechika!

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.200
Captain: Yami Sukehiro

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
What's going on?

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.440
You really shouldn't look away!

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.900
Here we go! Take that!

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.990
Let's see how you do against this!

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.560
You must have thought of many 
things in order to defeat us.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.680
A little bit more, and you would have 
successfully sealed away my powers.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.690
You're truly splendid... All of you.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.060
It makes me...

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.350
want to toy with you even more.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.100
Megicula...

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.200
How? Nero should have been 
successful in sealing you away.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.200
Curse-Warding Magic: Decaying World.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.720
It weakens spell arrays that affect me.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.530
It was already activated at 70%.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.390
It even managed to weaken the sealing 
magic used by an arcane-stage mage.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.470
That was an excellent experiment.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.530
Hey, Megicula! Don't get in my way!

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.970
I'm trying to have fun here!

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.340
Loro...pechika...

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.090
This is the first time I've 
ever cursed a Water Spirit.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.740
This was also an excellent experiment.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.240
So this is what happens when I curse one.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.700
Un...dine...

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.750
Peeka...boo!

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.450
Oh, you're just adorable!

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.090
It's time to study.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.280
Let's take the day off today.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.910
What? Can we?

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.100
Of course.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.490
Taking a day off never hurt anyone.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.020
We can just do our best again tomorrow.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.850
Okay!

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.940
She was always by my side.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.180
You're doing wonderfully, Loropechika.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.370
Really? You think my magic is okay?

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.620
It's perfect! Have more 
confidence in yourself.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.650
And she always consoled me.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.970
Such a beautiful kingdom.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.380
Yes. This is our kingdom.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.780
Protecting this kingdom... 
Do you think I can do it?

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.820
Of course you can, Loropechika.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.410
She was always the closest to me.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.650
Undi—

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:21.250
Oh, pardon me. Your curse must have 
activated because I moved closer to you.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.870
You probably can't move 
due to the excruciating pain.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.920
And now you can't use your water spirit.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.010
This is the end.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.760
Hey, hold on, my widdle Loropechika!

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.710
Things were just getting good!

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.260
You've still got some 
spunk in you, don't you?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.770
Undine...

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.520
Yeah, she's done.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.530
You can die now.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.280
Loropechika...

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.530
You two...

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.670
That's enough!

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.880
No one cares about you anymore!

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.130
You're no big deal without 
Loropechika's magic, are you?

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.250
See?

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.920
So slow.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.260
Noelle!

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.440
You're trying to get in Lady Vanica's way?
 What a bad little girl.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.920
You just need to stay 
put and let me lick you.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.240
There's too much of a power difference.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.840
I'm just not in the mood anymore.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.750
Not yet.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.750
None of that matters!

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.970
This little girl...

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.020
There's no way that what you're doing...

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.260
should ever be...

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.590
forgiven!

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.520
Aw, too bad!

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.860
That was a good last push, but your 
little attack has no effect on—

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.270
I won't let you...

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.020
kill Loropechika!

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.250
Point-Blank Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.400
Red Beast!

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.930
See? It's no use. Your attack 
doesn't do anything to m—

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.580
Huh?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.830
This is...

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.630
What was your name again?

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.010
Noelle Silva.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.140
I'm royalty from the Clover Kingdom...

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.810
and one of the Magic Knights 
from the Black Bulls!

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.790
You managed to injure my body again.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.860
Absolutely magnificent!

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.210
But I rather hate this unsightly magic.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:02.310
Very well, then. I'll show it 
just to you, Yami Sukehiro.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.970
The true powers of a human 
who hosts a devil!

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.230
Bring it on. I guess I'll show you, too...

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.070
The true powers

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.240
of an ordinary human!

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.500
We were keeping watch until we 
could attack the Spade Kingdom.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.500
So how did things end up like this?

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.750
Should I try to go back up Yami?

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.700
Or should I go get some other 
Magic Knights Squad captains?

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.410
No, I can't...

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.720
If I move now,

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.220
he'll kill me instantly!

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.820
Devil Power: 80%.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.620
So 80% is what you call getting serious?

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.750
Where's all that mana coming from? Damn it!

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.760
Well, Mostly-Black-Line-Faced Man?

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.750
We devil-possessed share powers 
with the devils in the underworld.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.000
Since these exchanges take place 
between our world and the underworld,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.930
Underworld

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.680
we cannot unleash 100% of our powers unless 
we open the door to the underworld.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.510
This World

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.270
Though I'm not certain about 
the devil-possessed over there.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.280
Gravity Magic: Gravity Singularity.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.300
As long as you're alive, 
we'll have everything we need.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.530
I guess I can tear off one 
of your legs, at least.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.050
Hey, come on, now. That would've 
been way more than my leg!

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.310
Dark Cloaked...

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.140
Dimension Slash!

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.820
He managed to warp my Dimension Slash!

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.360
This gravity's way more powerful 
than what he's been using.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.300
If I hit him with Black Moon, 
they might cancel each other out.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.450
But as long as he's generating his gravity,
 I can't afford to lose Black Moon!

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.570
I'll just have to get behind him by keeping

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.320
my Mana Zone condensed 
and my senses razor-sharp!

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.780
No, wait a sec!

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.860
There's no point in cutting him
down if he'll regenerate!

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.620
I need a more powerful, precise attack.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.980
I'll concentrate on one point.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.530
You were quite enjoyable, Yami Sukehiro...

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.250
For a human, at least.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.000
Ya...

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.580
Yami!

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.060
Captain!

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.200
Now, then...

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.010
Next up...

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.060
Right here, right now...

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.150
I'm going to surpass my limits!

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.610
I'd be a pretty lousy captain...

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.510
if I couldn't do that in front of my squad!

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.750
I'll take that condensed Mana Zone...

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.080
and condense it even further,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.890
concentrating it to a single point!

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.980
Excellent, Yami Sukehiro!

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.380
But you cannot defeat me!

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.930
Dark Magic:

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.160
Death Thrust!

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.540
Wha...t?

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.110
I was going for a thrust, 
but ended up with a cannon.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.620
Holy crap... Captain Yami really is amazing!

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:40.870
My bad. I mean, you basically 
looked like a target.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.170
Impossible.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.180
There should be no human who can 
fight me when I'm at my best.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.210
No, but there is one. Right here.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.900
That's why I'm in this pathetic state now.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.140
How truly annoying.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.870
Thank you, Yami Sukehiro.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.760
He couldn't be... Not from that state...

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.400
He's regenerating?

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.480
My innate magic is body magic.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.880
The devil's power explosively 
boosts my ability to regenerate.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:27.670
I cannot die, age... or deteriorate!

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.670
But I'd rather not use my 
body magic if I can avoid it.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.680
I detest how ugly it is when 
I regenerate or transform...

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.140
Because it means that I'm being pushed.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.940
Hey, come on, dude...

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.440
This guy's not human anymore.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.940
But at the same time, it's oh so gratifying!

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.060
Death Thrust!

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.200
You truly are magnificent, Yami Sukehiro!

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.550
Your instincts and techniques 
in combat surpass my own.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.710
I am deeply jealous.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.830
But you see, I don't die!

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:15.470
That one overwhelming power is enough to 
make it impossible for you to defeat me!

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.670
The world is unequal and unfair!

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.220
There are phenomena that are 
totally out of your control!

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.230
Just like me!

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.550
It doesn't matter if the talented 
or those who have trained

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:35.490
manage to miraculously point their blade 
at my throat through trial and error.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.620
In the end, I just have to crush 
them completely, and I will win!

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.750
And that is supreme ecstasy!

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.010
Captain!

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.470
Captain Yami!

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.480
I can't get close enough to him!

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.400
If I get too far away, he starts 
chucking rocks at me from all directions.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.230
This bastard...

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:30.250
Captain Yami is fighting after 
surpassing his limits, and here I am...

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:36.150
Stand! Move, my stupid body!

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.140
Damn it... Damn it!

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.420
Captain Yami...

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.430
Damn it!

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.190
Yeah... I can't win this on my own.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:40.070
This dude won't die. He's insane, 
creepy, and he has, like, infinite mana.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.960
Hey.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.950
I can't win this one without you...

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.540
Asta!

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.290
I'll kill you, brat.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.920
Hey, brat. Were you watching that?

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.260
Hey, brat.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.940
Why are you wimping out, you dumbass?

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.480
I don't give guys jobs they can't do.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.330
Do something about him in your own way.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.610
Well done, brat!

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.500
What? Are you worried about me?

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.810
You're thousands... No, a million 
years too early for that!

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:27.560
Right!

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.960
Excellent!

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.710
Entertain me even more!

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.220
You'd better keep up, Asta.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.220
Right, Captain Yami!

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.580
Petit Clover

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.890
Petit Clover!

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.080
I Wanna Lick

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.400
I Wanna Lick.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.730
I wanna lick... I wanna lick...

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.840
I wanna lick!

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.270
And I'd rather not be licked.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.000
Will this do?

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.640
This is so sweet and yummy and worth licking!

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.890
Then how about this?

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.650
This is cold, sweet, and 
has a mild yet rich flavor.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.110
This is high up on the "wanna lick" chart.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.110
Now we can put an end to 
this pointless fighting.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.290
But something seems to be missing.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.200
Leave that to me!

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.150
This is what you were missing, right?

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:30.200
Oh, you know me so well. 
Please, step on me harder.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:37.240
Impressive, Noelle. I knew what he was 
asking for, but I could never go that far.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.410
Here we go, Asta!

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.890
We're starting our counterattack!

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.790
Right, Captain Yami!

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:49.070
I'm going to surpass my 
limits and give it my all!

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.330
