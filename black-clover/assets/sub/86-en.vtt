00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.880
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.600
When he was younger, 
Yami was on a journey to train,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.510
when the head of a little village asked him 
to protect it some magical bandits.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.230
He ended up battling the bandits,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.520
and during that battle...

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.480
Yami, was it?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.400
I'm counting on you to watch my back.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.700
Yami encountered Vangeance,
who was nearby on another mission.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.810
First, I'm going to become a 
Magic Knights Squad captain...

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.530
Looks like the challenge is on. 
Let's see who can do it first.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.040
And all kinds of stuff happened after that.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.130
A few years later, 
Julius became the Wizard King,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.620
and both the golden weird mask guy and I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.420
The Wizard King's Attendant
Marx Francois

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.870
were appointed Vice Captains
 of the Gray Deer.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.680
Vice Captain of the Gray Deer
William Vangeance

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.680
Vice Captain of the Gray Deer
Yami Sukehiro

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.580
Then, one day...

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.430
28th Wizard King
Julius Novachrono

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.300
Hey! Thanks for coming.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.430
Welcome!

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.150
You don't have to be so formal with us.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.690
I agree.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.200
I heard you did amazing work exploring 
that dungeon the other day.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.940
It was nothing.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.160
I heard you saved all the 
knights who were caught

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.020
by the trap spell with your magic.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.720
I wish I could've seen that magic!

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.290
Oh, I'll give you the stars for 
that next time. Don't worry.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.150
I'm honored. Thank you very much.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.670
I heard you were absolutely fierce in 
the defensive battle at Kuka Village.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.180
I heard you split the giant soldier that the 
enemy created using rock magic in two.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.260
Yeah, that was nothing...

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.590
Actually, it was everything! 
You're going to give me some stars, too, right?

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.670
Of course! I'm sure your 
captain is very proud.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.820
Sir, it's about time.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.730
Oh, right. Sorry to have you 
stop by when you're so busy.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.410
There's a job that I'd like 
you two to take on.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.540
Bandits?

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.940
Yeah, they're causing trouble all over.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.040
Would you two catch them for me?

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.640
Of course, sir.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.000
The Magic Knights live to serve and 
protect the people of the Clover Kingdom.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.790
We will happily accept this mission.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.590
But...

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.560
Why are you just asking the two of us?

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.470
Well, it's possible that

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.980
someone from the Magic Knights 
is aiding the bandits.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.110
Well, can't say I'm surprised.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.130
I don't think they're ordinary bandits.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.880
They're very organized and even 
have some ancient magic items.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.160
Pretty powerful ones, at that.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.630
It may be that someone is providing them

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.660
with magic items that we found in dungeons.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.350
I see. So that's why you want us.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.770
If all the Magic Knights were assigned 
to this, evidence may be destroyed,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.790
and the guilty party may disappear.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.170
That's why we've been assigned 
to this secret mission.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.680
Exactly.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.190
Say, Julius. What are you going to 
do if one of us is that traitor?

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.690
We might just let the bandits escape.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.410
Well, that would be a problem.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.490
But I think I know you 
two pretty well by now.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.700
I've known you both since before 
you even joined the Magic Knights.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.210
That's why I trust you.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.300
But if you two end up betraying me, 
I guess there's not much I can do.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.080
You always were a cunning old dude.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.410
Well, I'll be counting on both of you.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.960
Yes, sir.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.970
I've marked the towns and villages that 
have been attacked by the bandits.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.570
I see... So they're showing up
 in unexpected places.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.720
Must be so people won't figure 
out where they'll show up next.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.970
I've sent messages to the Magic Knights 
in these areas to be on their guard,

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.920
but that information 
might've also been leaked.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.110
The bandits keep appearing in places 
that aren't heavily guarded.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.110
Heart Kingdom

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.460
We're gonna have to figure out 
where they'll pop up next,

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.630
but that'll be tough to do.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.350
No, it's actually quite simple.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.480
Huh?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.160
First, we can rule out any place 
that's already been attacked.

Spade Kingdom

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:41.460
Diamond
 Kingdom

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.180
The next likely targets will probably be 
somewhere a treasure's been found lately,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.760
or somewhere near a harvest.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.460
A bountiful one, specifically.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.300
Even then, that's more than 
ten or twenty places.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.310
We can probably rule out places that 
are near the sites of attacks, too.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.210
They'll probably assume that such places 
will be on alert and harder to attack.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.330
Even then...

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.250
You think the two of us can't 
cover so many locations, right?

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.130
I know. That's why...

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.940

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.940
Here, and here...

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.290
And this village. 
Could you send out Magic Knights

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.050
to these locations to be on 
high alert for these bandits?

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.950
Why, though? If someone's leaking,
 there'd be no point—

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.050
I see!

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.420
You want to take advantage of the fact 
that someone is leaking information.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.810
Yes. They'll probably avoid places that 
are being guarded by the Magic Knights.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.900
They'll prioritize places that 
aren't being guarded by the Knights.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.240
I-I knew that, duh...

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.790
I was just testing you.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.270
Which means the places they're 
probably going to go after

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.780
will be the town of Aymaia or Zocodany Village.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.980
Heart

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.010
Yami and Vangeance

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.740
How are things looking over there, Yami?

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.050
Nothing suspicious so far.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.750
Zocodany Village

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.820
It appears that an ancient magic item

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.750
was found in a cave near 
Zocodany Village recently.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.780
That item is being regarded

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.260
as the village's treasure and is on 
display at the village elder's home.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.550
Only a handful of Magic Knights 
would know about that at this point.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.740
It's too early for the bandits 
to show up for that treasure.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.110
So if they show up in 
search of that treasure,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.020
it'll be clear that there's 
a traitor within our ranks.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.030
Yeah. How are thing looking in Aymaia?

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.280
Nothing suspicious here, either.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.580
They just finished harvesting, and they're 
preparing for their harvest festival.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.790
The Town of Aymaia

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.540
Apparently, their harvest 
was very good this year.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.480
I'm sure the bandits would 
love to get their hands on it.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.160
Just to remind you...

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.790
No matter where the bandits show up,
 don't handle them alone.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.570
We'll wait until we contact the other
 and they arrive to fight.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.410
Got it?

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.800
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.630
You better not go back on that just so 
you can get all the stars for yourself.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.690
I won't.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.310
I'll contact you again if I see anything.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.900
Jeez...

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.740
They actually showed up.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.660
Hey, they're here, masked weirdo.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.120
You hear me? Hey!

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.260
What the hell is going on? 
This thing was working fine earlier.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.400
This ki...

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.380
Are they blocking the flow of mana?

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:59.270
Looks like they're somehow 
able to block comms.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.890
Guess they aren't ordinary bandits after all.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.400
Must be a traitor from the Magic Knights... 
I'm gonna have to hunt them down.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.090
Looks like there are thirty... 
no, more than that.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.400
There are probably at least fifty.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.350
No matter where the bandits show up,
 don't handle them alone.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.660
We'll wait until we contact the other...

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.660
Well, I can't get a hold of you, 
so what the hell am I supposed to do?

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.710
I'm just gonna have to go on my own!

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.780
I'll cut them down before 
they get to the village.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.920
Dark Cloaked...

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.220
Black Blade!

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.730
An enemy attack! Scatter!

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.270
Who the hell are you?!

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.190
A Magic Knight?

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.430
You've got some nerve, facing us alone!

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.820
You're gonna regret that!

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.580
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.470
That should take care 
of about half of them...

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.370
Are you the boss?

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.010
I think I've seen you before.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.950
You don't look like a Magic Knight, though.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.070
You're the guy from that one time.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.530
What one time?

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:40.650
A few years ago, you got in the way of 
us plundering that crummy little village.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.240
Guess I get to repay you for 
that sooner than I thought.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.080
A few years ago?

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.090
Hey! You're the dude from that one time!

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.800
I see now...

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.270
Putting the guy's horrible 
fashion sense aside,

00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:00.110
his magic powers aren't too impressive, 
but that staff is bad news.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.050
Was that a treasure someone 
found in a dungeon?

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.420
Don't think I'm the same as before!

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.390
Hey, who gave you that staff?

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.190
If you want to know, 
you'll have to defeat me first!

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.210
Take this!

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.750
Damn you guys for wasting my time.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.000
Now, then...

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:39.060
Let's have you spill who 
the hell gave you this staff.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.260
Five... four... three...

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.260
W-Wait! I'll tell you!

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.350
Th-The truth is...

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.270
Stay in your home!

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.770
Not another step, Magic Knight!

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.470
If you move, this old bat is gonna get it!

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.740
I'm gonna pay you back a millionfold!

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.490
How? You think your buddies 
stand a chance against me?

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.790
No, they probably don't.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.820
But...

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.130
Wha—

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.660
This magic—

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.220
It's a type of earth magic spell,
 Witch Hunter Claws,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.250
you see.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.860
Likewise,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.600
that's a binding spell 
called Sheep Horn Snag.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.470
I've seen you guys before.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.370
You're Goht from the Crimson Lion Kings
 and Mohl from the Silver Eagles.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.360
Silver Eagles Squad Member
Mohl

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.360
Crimson Lion Kings Squad Member
Goht

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.360
Guess we actually had two 
traitors instead of one.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.470
So you were the ones giving these bandits

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.990
magic items and information,
 and having them attack the villages.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.790
There's no use in struggling. 
No man can break through that.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.590
You guys are a disgrace to the Magic Knights!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:07.970
You're the foreigner named Yami Sukehiro 
that the Wizard King picked up, aren't you?

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.020
I thought the Wizard King was up to 
something. So this is what it was.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.690
Which means that the 
Wizard King's order to protect

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.370
the villages in the area was a diversion

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.100
to pinpoint where we'd attack next.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.780
I guess we completely fell for it.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:32.270
Lord Goht and Lord Mohl,
 you're amazing for figuring out their plan!

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.850
You go hurry up and find their treasure.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.950
Y-Y-Yes, sir.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.860
Uh, it was at the village elder's house,
 right? Hey, take me there.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.350
O-Okay...

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.690
You men, follow me!

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.580
Yes, sir!

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:50.260
The Magic Knights exist to serve and 
protect the people of the Clover Kingdom!

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.600
Yet you bastards...

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.250
We'll tell the Wizard King

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.940
that we found you after you'd 
been defeated by the bandits.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.990
Don't think I'll go down that easily!

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.850
I'll pay you back a millionfold!

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.330
Oh, my. Only a weakling would 
say something like that.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.570
Goodbye now.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.370
How long do you think he can hold out?

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.330
Just give it up already.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.240
Like I'd give up that easily!

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.660
Not yet... I'm not done yet!

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.300
I think you're just about at your limit.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.460
Who the hell cares about limits?

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:33.310
I'll just surpass them! Right here, right now!

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.280
Dracaena Formation.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.940
Are you all right?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.100
Took you long enough!

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.830
I'll have you know that I hurried over.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.970
When I wasn't able to get a hold of you,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.720
I figured the bandits had 
appeared in Zocodany.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.970
Looks like I owe you one.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.630
And I'm gonna pay it back quick, masked weirdo.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.640
They're the ones behind all this.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.350
Goht and Mohl... I see.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.410
William Vangeance...

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.710
I guess you were following the 
Wizard King's orders, too.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.150
We'll just have to defeat you 
along with Yami Sukehiro.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.590
You bastard!

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.170
Attack of the Horn!

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.840
Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.870
I told you I'd pay you back 
a billionfold, didn't I?

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.190
Please go easy on me.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.970
Not bad.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:19.040
Let's negotiate. Why not join us?

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.120
Join you?

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.670
Yes, it'll be quite fun.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.740
That sounds tempting... But I'll pass.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.550
I swore my loyalty to the 
Wizard King, after all.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.700
I see. That's unfortunate.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.390
Looks like I already paid you back.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.910
It truly is unfortunate

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.730
that there were traitors 
among the Magic Knights.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.790
Now, all that's left is...

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.000
Yeah.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.340
I don't know who the hell 
that is, but take him down!

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.620
I wasn't planning on interfering,

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.790
but I think I'm allowed 
to have a <i>little</i> fun.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.690
The hell?

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.360
Well done.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:38.120
You were able to capture the traitors 
as well as all of the bandits.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.370
I mean... the bandits' boss was 
out cold at the top of the tree.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.370
I guess weirder things have happened.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.950
Again, excellent work.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:49.920
By the way...

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.300
Yami, Vangeance...

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.150
Considering everything you've done so far,

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.300
I'm appointing both of you 
as captains of new squads.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.330
You're making us...

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.560
...captains of new squads?

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:07.810
Will you accept my offer?

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.590
I guess the competition to see who can 
become squad captain first ended in a draw.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.360
Yes, but our true competition 
still lies ahead.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.310
Yeah.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:20.850
I won't lose.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.830
Neither will I.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:27.080
I believe in both of you. Yami, 
what kind of squad will you create?

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.170
What kind of squad? Let's see...

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:36.000
A squad where status, bloodlines, 
and social standing don't matter.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.340
I'll round up some outsiders and hooligans, 
and create a place where they can belong.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.170
Just like you did for me.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.350
Sure. That sounds great!

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.150
I'll call them... Let's see...

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.450
I'll gather up a bunch of guys who all 
have their own color, mix them all up,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.870
and once their colors all mix together...

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.810
Black. The Black Hooligans?

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.660
Nah, let's go with bulls.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.370
Okay, I'll call them the Black Bulls!

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.350
The Black Bulls...

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.760
That sounds perfect for you.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.710
And you?

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.610
I will create the Golden Dawn.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.710
The Golden...?

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.130
Yes. Creating the ultimate squad is 
my way of repaying you, Lord Julius.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:19.740
As the name suggests,

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.730
I will make a squad that will bring 
a golden dawn to this world.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.510
Even though the night is dark,

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.630
I will prove that the light will always shine,
 and a golden dawn will come one day.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.900
How cheesy can you be?

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.710
That sounds wonderful, too.
I look forward to it.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:42.860
Starting today, you are the Captain of the 
Golden Dawn. Congratulations, William.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.660
Thank you, sir.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.500
And starting today, you are the Captain of 
the Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.920
Congratulations, Yami.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.050
Looking forward to working with you, Goldie.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.550
So there you have it.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.740
Right...

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.180
What'd you think?

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.620
Um... I guess you went through a lot.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.230
So, what were you trying to say?

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.180
Even if you stumble, 
even if you think you might lose,

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.310
you'll be fine as long as you don't give up!

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.220
Don't ever give up in any situation!

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.570
Surpass your limits!

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.610
Then a path will always open up for you!

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.660
Quit being so depressed just because 
you lost to your rival once!

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.830
Even if you lose 99 times, you just 
have to win the next time!

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.290
I-I see... You should've just 
said that in the first pla—

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.460
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.050
Captain! You're going to crush my skull!

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.730
But Captain Yami's right!

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.510
There's no point in being depressed!

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.900
All right! I'm gonna catch 
up to Yuno and surpass him!

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.680
Come to think of it,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.440
shouldn't we be getting the results from 
the Royal Knights Selection Exam soon?

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.940
O-Oh, yeah... I-I can't wait!

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.130
Come on, messenger owls!

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.580
The hell? That's no messenger owl.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.630
I dunno who the hell you are,
 but stop that racket!

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.210
Don't you know that this is the 
home of the Black Bulls,

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.380
the Magic Knights Squad that Mister Yami—

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.380
Th-The heck?!

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.890
Y-You're Lady Sisgoleon!

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:03.440
Petit Clover

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.550
Petit Clover!

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.940
Golden Weird Mask Guy!

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.810
Golden Weird Mask Guy!

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.260
Say, Golden Weird Mask Guy.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.400
I'd rather you didn't call me that.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.200
Then...

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.130
Baldie Weird Mask Guy.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.580
I'd rather you didn't call me that, either.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.550
Baldie Long Drawers Mask Guy!

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.830
Please stop.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.300
Baldie Long Drawers Belly Warmer Mask Guy!

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.210
This doesn't even make sense anymore.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.220
Baldie Long Drawers Belly Warmer 
Tiny Mustache Mask Guy!

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.590
How long is this going to go on?

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.960
Baldie Long Drawers Belly 
Warmer Tiny Mustache...

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.700
who wears his shirt and 
socks backwards... Mask Guy?

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.700
No, really. How long?

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.340
How about Birthday Suit Mask Guy?

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.940
It's finally time to find out the results 
of the Royal Knights Selection Exam!

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.730
I know for damn sure that I was chosen!

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.440
Who are you calling worried?!

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.110
