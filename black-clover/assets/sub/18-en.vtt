00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.670
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.850
Hey, come on! Are you 
finished already, you jerk?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.450
Asta!

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.760
What...

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.370
are you?

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.140
I'm someone who was born without any magic!

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.580
But even so, I'm going to 
become the Wizard King!

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.400
And I'm alive...

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.850
to prove that!

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.240
Mars!

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.050
What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.370
I'm...

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.750
I'm just going to destroy everything!

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.000
Destroy everything?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.850
The Wizard King protects everyone!

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.010
We were born to protect 
everyone in this country.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.260
Like hell I'm going to lose 
to someone like you!

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.770
You're in my way...

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.810
Begone, pebble!

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.560
I may be just a pebble,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.060
but I'm...

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.990
a pebble that shatters diamonds!

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.810
I would always close my eyes

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.010
And cower at reality

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.770
I can't stand the idea

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.170
Of just making excuses to give up

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.090
Stand right there

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.400
I don't want to be near you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.570
Any minute now

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.930
Just wait right there

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.930
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.090
Black and blue

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.990
I'll give up on giving up

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.150
And get the world on my side

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.820
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.150
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.460
And head where the light shines

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.290
I want to keep my promise

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.840
I'll deliver it to you

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.820
shape of love

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.560
Memories of You

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.030
That should do it.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.480
Is this actually going 
to keep him restrained?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.590
Of course it is!

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.790
My magic is not so weak that it'd 
be broken by someone who's injured.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.220
Look! We've taken his grimoire, too.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.790
Don't get so pissy.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.720
Want some medicinal herbs?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.600
I don't want your leftovers!

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.550
What about you, Yuno?

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.350
Not a chance.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.840
I'm glad that you're all safe.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.930
Should you be moving around now?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.300
It's fine. I feel much better.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.880
It's all because you protected me, Noelle.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.440
I-I didn't protect you.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.370
You're just so helpless that 
I couldn't leave you alone.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.990
Right. Thank you very much.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.330
M-More importantly, Asta, 
do something about your clothes!

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.840
Well, what am I supposed to do?

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.280
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.660
Why are you the one turning red?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.110
I'm not turning red!

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.840
Actually...

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.640
My robe's ripped to shreds...

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.340
Magna's gonna kill me.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.850
Vanessa will fix it for you when we get back.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.840
Well, that's good, I guess.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.810
To think that we'd be saved 
by the Black Bulls...

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.910
We were the first ones to arrive, 
therefore we win this competition,

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.710
but I will allow you three to enter 
the treasure chamber, also.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.880
Why do you always sound 
so arrogant, four-eyes?

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.490
Well, thank you very much, you jerk!

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.510
You're very welcome!
 Watch how you speak to me!

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.470
Well, excuse me, Lord Four-Eyes!

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.240
Who are you calling "Lord Four-Eyes"?!

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.210
Hmph! I don't have time to argue with you!

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.310
Well, excuse me, Lord Four-Eyes!

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.520
Shut your mouth!

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.650
They sure like wasting each other's time.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.180
Keep it up and I'll break 
those glasses of yours!

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.840
That's just cruelty!

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.650
I wouldn't say that, Lord Four-Eyes!

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.660
That's enough!

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.490
Let us head to the treasure chamber!

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.780
Yeah!

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.880
It'll be the Clover Kingdom's Magic Knights
who get to the treasure chamber!

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.830
You're so annoying!

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.280
You're the one who's annoying!

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.180
How do you get in?

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.070
There must be some code to 
open this door somewhere.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.750
You can do it! Think harder, four-eyes!

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.930
Shut up! Stop calling me that!

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.040
My name is Klaus!

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.260
It appears this door is made with magic,
so just cut through it.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.120
Like, swoosh.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.800
All right!

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.720
There's no way you can open it.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.640
Yes!

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.390
That's awesome!

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.250
It's a mountain of treasure!

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.620
Hey! Be careful!

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.830
Heya, Asta.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.550
Luck popped out!

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.270
It's beautiful.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.790
I wonder what you use this for.
I haven't the slightest idea.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.440
All of you! Stop touching 
things without permission!

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.280
They might be magical items 
worthy of being national treasures!

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.670
A little bit won't hurt, crabbypants.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.040
Who are you calling "crabbypants"?!

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.530
Then we'll just go back to "four-eyes."

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.890
Stop calling me that!

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.250
Then "glasses man."

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.290
You bastard!

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.030
See? You <i>are</i> a crabbypants!

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.050
You think that makes you clever or something?!

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.820
What are these symbols?
I've never seen them before.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.430
The symbols...

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.740
What was that just now?

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.970
No idea.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.150
Don't go around touching things.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.850
Put that back.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.130
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.160
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Stop! 
You're gonna tear it out, Nero!

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.990
Hey!

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.390
What about it?

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.960
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.640
But this is a rather rare, 
strange grimoire.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.850
It's as though it's stitched together.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.720
Well...

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.480
We have a four-leaf clover,

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.740
and a grimoire so filthy
you can't even read it.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.310
I have three oddities on my hands.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.820
Isn't there anything interesting here?

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.240
This power...

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.500
Everyone, run!

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.730
I-Impossible!

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.910
My restraining magic... 
And in so little time...

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.490
How could he have revived?!

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.490
Th-That's...

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.240
Flame recovery magic? That's impossible!

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.250
Everyone should have only 
one magical attribute!

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:39.030
Mages have mana from the four classical 
elements: fire, wind, water, and earth.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:52.060
Fire

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:52.060
Wind

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:52.060
Water

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:52.060
Earth

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.320
Fire is strong against wind, 
and weak against water.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.680
There are compatibilities 
between each element.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.140
Mages can only use magic 
from their own mana or

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.930
from a single attribute derived from it.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.110
He's breaking all of those laws to have 
two different kinds of magic!

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.640
Not to mention, he was clearly 
a user of offensive magic,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.480
but now he's using recovery magic!

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.790
That's inconceivable!

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.880
Are these the results of the 
Diamond Kingdom's experiments?!

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.620
I'm sure you'll become a great warrior, Mars.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.460
I'm sorry, Mars.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.310
I have no other choice.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.390
Please die.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.660
I'll put that fire out!

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.230
Noelle!

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.740
Noelle!

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.910
Noelle!

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.800
You bastard!

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.510
How dare you do that to my friend?!

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.070
I know your abilities now.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.210
If that blade is able to cut 
through various magics,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.630
then what about magic that's 
faster than your blade?

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.570
So fast!

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.530
How dare you do that to my friend?!

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.140
Mars!

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.110
The strong will survive, 
and the weak will die.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.840
Noelle!

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.360
The strong will survive...

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.250
Noelle!

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.380
Hey, you idiot! Get a hold of yourself!

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.630
The Dream-Healing Flower 
Cradle won't be fast enough!

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.770
Plant Recovery Magic: 
Princess-Healing Flower Robe!

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.980
Noelle...

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.610
This is the strongest 
spell I can use right now.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.870
Please don't die,

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.290
Noelle!

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.420
Ow...

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.170
What are you doing, Mimosa?

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.580
Honestly, you're so slow.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.930
Here.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.430
Thanks, Noelle.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.940
That's amazing, Mimosa!

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.000
Who knew you'd be able to use 
recovery magic that's this powerful?

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.540
With your royal magic, you may become 
a healer who can heal any injury.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.760
This is exciting.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.960
On the other hand...

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:48.960
There's the House of Silva's second daughter,
who can't even control her powers.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.300
I hear she's training every day.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:56.460
Who knew someone like that 
would be born into royalty?

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:01.240
I guess we Vermillions are the true royalty.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.650
I might've just given up 
if I were in her shoes...

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.510
Royals mock hard work.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.230
It's something only those who 
aren't born into power do,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.420
not something that royalty does.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.060
But...

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.900
I admire you for the hard work you do.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.840
The strong will survive, 
and the weak will die.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.920
The strong will survive, 
and the weak will die.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.430
If only I could use my grimoire...

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.970
My sword...

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.690
Noelle... Mimosa...

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.370
With my big, heavy sword, I won't
be able to beat his magic's speed.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.520
He changed the way he fights,
and the magic he uses while doing it.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.000
What am I supposed to...

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.960
Nero?

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.940
Please die.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.200
The strong will survive...

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.200
and the weak...

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.640
Mimosa!

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.410
What is that sword?

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.310
This sword will work.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.890
Your opponent...

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.230
is me!

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.620
How's that?

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.120
Disappear!

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.890
Even if I can cut through his attack magic, 
as long as he has that recovery magic,

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.860
I won't be able to finish him off!

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.770
What should I do?

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.890
What are you doing, Stupidsta?

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.770
Noelle!

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.790
Noelle...

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.860
You're the first peasant...

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.070
that I, a royal, ever acknowledged.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.490
Hurry up and

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.950
defeat that guy, Asta!

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.640
Yeah, leave it to me.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.140
I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.910
Move. I'm going to make that girl, 
that weakling, disappear!

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.050
Like hell I'll let that happen!

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.120
I don't have any magic,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.150
but I've got...

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.340
my friends!

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.660
This is nothing!

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.420
Wh-What just happened? He's not 
supposed to have any magic!

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.330
A water magic attack?

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.180
He borrowed Noelle's powers?

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.260
What in the world is that sword?

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.410
I don't really get it, but I did it!

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.290
I messed up...

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:17.650
Asta...

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.730
Asta!

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.570
And push me forward

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.610
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:59.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:05.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.640
(Break free yourself)

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:41.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.270
Petit Clover

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.930
Petit Clover!

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.770
Resilient

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.610
Resilient.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.780
Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.280
Isn't it hot in there?

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.540
It is.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.540
Isn't it heavy?

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.750
It is.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.050
And...

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.100
My face itches, but I can't scratch it!

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.650
The strong will survive, 
and the weak will die.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:47.020
Pebbles on the side of the road,
disperse in the wind.

Destruction and Salvation

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.700
My magic destroys all.
