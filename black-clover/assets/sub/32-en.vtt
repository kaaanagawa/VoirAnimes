00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.690
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.180
These children have had their 
magic sucked out of them.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.480
If left like this, they may never 
be able to use magic again.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.310
How could you do something so cruel?

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.230
I guess I'll just have to take 
care of this peon myself.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.070
I won't...

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.910
forgive you!

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.840
Three-Leaf Sprouts

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.070
Black Bulls' Base

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.030
Bah... ha!

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.520
Jeez... The Black Bulls are supposed 
to be the closest to Nean.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.980
So why aren't they responding?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.140
Bah-ha?

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.650
But the Black Bulls are a 
group of misfits, aren't they?

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.190
Bah-ha...

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.940
G-Good evening...

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.370
I'm here to ask for backup.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.680
Bah... ha?

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.930
Right. I should go.
I-I'm not scared or anything,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.810
but what else can I do if no one's here?

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.980
Actually, it looks like I scared 
off the Black Bulls, bah-ha!

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.570
Instead,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.610
I guess I'll just go ask at the garden of 
beautiful women, the Blue Rose Knights.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.100
So why am I wasting any more time... here?

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.750
The moon's beautiful, isn't it?

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.110
Bah-ha!

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.260
I'm Gordon,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.380
I'm Gordon, but you can call me Don.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.640
Wait...

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.390
Stop! I'm no one suspicious!

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.890
You're Sekke Bronzazza from

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.190
You're Sekke Bronzazza from the Green Praying Mantises, right?

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.310
You're Sekke Bronzazza from the Green Praying Mantises, right? Let's be friends.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.900
Y-Yikes...

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.360
I haven't seen you since the Magic Knights' Entrance Exam...

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.360
That look... He's going to kill me!

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.490
Would you like to join me for tea?

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.200
S-Stop! Stay back!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.420
Bah-ha...

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.300
Bah-ha!

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.540
Another freak just showed up!

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.960
Shut up!

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.490
Damn it. And I was sleeping so well...

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.430
"Bah-ha, bah-ha, ha-bah, ha-bah..."

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.660
Do you have any idea what time it is?

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.580
The Black Bulls' captain?

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.680
Huh?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.860
Bah-ha...

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.060
I apologize for coming by so late. I've come
to ask the Black Bulls for backup—

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.000
Who the hell are you?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.070
Huh? Are you here about my tab at the pub?

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.130
Ha-bah?! N-No! I'm from the Magic Knights—

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.390
I haven't been to any Magic Knights' pub.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.130
But the town of Nean is—

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.160
I just paid off my tab in Nean!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.540
Bah-ha?! Let's just drop 
the tabs for a second...

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.920
You're telling me to pay them again?!

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.210
What?!

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.420
Would you like some sugar in your tea?

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.490
What the hell is wrong with this squad?!

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.560
I knew I should've asked 
the Blue Rose Knights!

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.820
Bah-ha!

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.090
Neige! Don't just stand there! Do something!

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.580
Go!

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.530
You just don't give up.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.800
Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.740
Done already?

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.580
Then die, you wussy loser.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.270
No... S-Stay back!

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.280
Snow Binding Spell: Snow Lime Rock!

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.030
I-I did it!

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.550
Brother...

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.660
That's not good. His mirror's been sealed.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.400
Gauche! I'll save you!

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.580
Save me? Stop trying to act cool 
in front of Marie, damn it!

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.120
What?!

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.260
You fool! This is no time to act tough!

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.420
Shut up! I'll take care of 
him myself! We will, that is.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.510
Neige, behind you!

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.730
Why... is there another one?

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.210
Mirror Magic: Real Double!

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.740
Real Double is a spell that summons my 
other self from within the mirror world.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.950
I'd already activated the 
spell before you caught me.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.750
Th-That's awesome! You're amazing, Gauche!

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.870
That young criminal...

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.750
He made snow fall over a wide area. 
He has a tremendous amount of magic.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.960
But Gauche has magic equal 
to his, and most importantly,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.080
he's excellent at fighting with magic.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.730
He's strong, after all.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.260
Though his glare and personality 
are the absolute worst.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.270
What's Neige doing?! He's so useless!

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.370
Damn it... My body won't move. 
There has to be some way...

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.990
I know... If I use that—

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.660
Why did you do something so awful?!

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.910
Stealing other people's magic...

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.910
How would you feel if 
someone did that to you?!

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.490
Like I care, you moron!

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.760
It doesn't matter to me if someone 
else dies or loses their magic!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.140
You bastard!

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.220
Stop!

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.630
This isn't enough pain to 
make up for what you did!

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.020
You're gonna pay for this, starting now!

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.910
That's right. This scum isn't even 
worth striking with your fist.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.690
More importantly, we have to 
do something about those kids.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.790
Hey, tell us how to give 
them their magic back!

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.620
At least let me go! Then I'll tell—

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.790
Don't mess with me!

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.620
He's rotten to the bone.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.940
Asta, first, undo the spell 
that's on the children.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.930
As for you, don't try anything funny.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.450
Like I could right now...

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.530
Mud Magic: Mud Men.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.940
Where am I?

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.110
Mama? Papa?

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.020
My feet hurt!

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.370
Sister!

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.290
There, there. Come here, all of you.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.020
Asta!

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.870
Luca! Everything's going to be okay.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.590
Hurry up and treat
Marie's wounds, you old hag.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.300
You don't have to tell me to 
do it, you sister complex punk.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.500
Flame Recovery Magic: Sacred Healing Light.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.380
It's so warm!

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.900
Hey, you brats in the middle.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.170
Make some room for Marie! 
That way she'll get better faster.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.870
Oh, stop it, Brother!

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.370
Bless you, Marie. You're as kind as an angel.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.540
Angels belong in the middle!

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.410
The magic will work just the 
same wherever she stands.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.490
Marie, want some dried tatoes?
You'll feel better!

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.780
Marie's not going to eat your weird food!

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.390
Hey! It's what Hage is famous for!

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.150
Asta, you grew up at the 
church in Hage, didn't you?

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.470
Huh? How did you know that?

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.730
Sister Lily came to our church to train once.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.690
She told me about you then.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.170
Heavens me! You know Sister Lily?

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.600
She was a fine young woman.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.310
Isn't she?!

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.300
Wait, so Sister was talking 
about me? What did she say?!

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.910
That you were a small and noisy child.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.370
But she also said this...

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.630
After I finish this, all I 
have left are the windows.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.670
Hey, you're not going to last if you 
work this hard from day one.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.760
This is nothing at all. I know someone 
who works even harder than this.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.430
He can't use magic at all,

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.900
but he says he's going to be the Wizard King 
someday and trains every single day.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.600
The Wizard King? If he 
doesn't have any magic,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.770
he probably won't even be 
able to join the Magic Knights.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.530
Yes, you're right. But still, he always 
says, "Not yet! I'm not done yet!"

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.270
He works really hard.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.700
Which is why... Not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.540
She said you were a hard 
worker with a strong heart

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.490
who wouldn't give up in the face of adversity, 
and that she was very proud of you.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.860
Looks like all of your hard work paid off.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.340
But I've still got a long way to go!

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.820
I'm going to become the 
Wizard King, no matter what!

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.930
I'm not so sure about that.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.390
I will not give up!

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:57.070
Sister, I'm never, never, never, never, 
ever going to give up on you, either!

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.820
Marie told me that you 
were the one who hit her.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.750
The only way to atone for that is death.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.960
Stop that, Gauche!

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.620
Brother! I'm okay!

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.770
My injuries are all healed now, so let him go!

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.130
No, I can't.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.130
I will eliminate anyone who might hurt Marie 
now, before they have the chance!

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.930
Asking them how to return the 
children's magic is more important.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.680
You two. Why did you do this?

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.320
These children are the 
future of this kingdom.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.690
They're the three-leaf sprouts 
that grace this nation!

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.950
I just wanted friends...

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.830
It hurts... What should I do, Baro?

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.610
Stop your whining,
you useless little brat!

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:57.660
It hurts, damn it! Why is
this happening to me?!

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.220
It's her. It's all her fault. She tricked me.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.840
I thought it was a good way to make money!

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.790
Hurry up and get back here, you moron!

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.100
Wow!

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:12.820
That's...

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.680
There she is.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.960
Took you long enough, for someone
who travels with spatial magic!

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.340
They got in the way of our 
magic collecting! Help us!

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:26.050
Jeez, you're so whiny. But you 
get a pat on the back this time.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.090
Asta!

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.220
She's from the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.970
I'm so happy we get to see 
each other again so soon!

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.410
It's that crazy lady!

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.440
What? There was an incident in Nean?

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.570
You should've mentioned 
that earlier, you dumbass!

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.480
But I've been saying that from the start!

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.690
Quit making excuses!

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.140
What?!

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.730
You're asking me for reinforcements, but...

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:05.800
Nean, huh... I've always wanted to go
there once. But now's not the time for that.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.830
I dunno what's going through 
these guys' heads,

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.240
and I sure can't be bothered,
so I don't know what to tell you.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.870
My friend's in trouble. I want to 
save him with my curse magic...

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.240
Are these guys really Magic Knights?!

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.750
Everyone, stay calm. 
Please get inside the church.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.610
Marco...

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.880
Luca...

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.010
I-It's okay. They'll be home soon.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.620
Despite how they look, Asta and
Gauche are Magic Knights.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.060
And we'll be getting reinforcements 
from headquarters soon.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.890
Wow!

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:32.950
Really?

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.100
I think I'll make some dinner 
while we wait. Help me out.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.390
Okay!

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.860
Reinforcements </i>are<i> coming, right?

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.820
Hey...

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.820
I came here because you called me 
with the magic transmission item,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.970
but you haven't gathered that much magic yet.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.500
It's all their fault!

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.080
Well, it's not like I care.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.890
All of you stay right here. You hear me?

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.220
The Eye of the Midnight Sun... The terrorist 
group that attacked the capital?

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.740
That's them!

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.760
So basically, you're the one who 
put Marie through all this.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:11.890
I'll kill you!

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.730
Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.230
Could you not interrupt our moving reunion?

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.690
While I'm at it, maybe I'll dissect you all!

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.420
What is that ominous magic?

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.610
Be careful, Gauche, Granny!

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.870
I heard she blocked the 
Silver captain's attack, too!

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.980
Here I come!

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.370
Incoming!

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.730
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.210
Anti-magic is no problem 
at all if it can't hit me!

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.640
Impudent pest!

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.340
Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.280
She deflected all of it!

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.260
That's some fine magic,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.590
but it gets refracted inside Salaman, 
so there's really no point.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.980
Things might be a bit different 
if you have something stronger!

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.930
Gauche!

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.810
Here you go, Asta!

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.040
This is nothing!

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.310
Gotcha!

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.430
I can't move...

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.920
You look just like a normal human.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.540
I want to know all about you!

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:50.880
Rawr!

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.070
Ow! That hurt! And you're scary!

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.950
Well, your blood's normal.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.290
Next, I'm just going to take your pinky nail.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.860
Stop it!

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.630
Flame Magic: Brilliant Flame Cross!

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.570
Aw. You melted my little Salaman.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.020
That's enough of that!
I won't let you have this boy!

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.310
Hey, don't get in the way.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.390
Th-That's amazing...

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.610
Thanks, Granny! You're super strong!

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.220
I may be old, but I'm a former Magic Knight!

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.940
I'm Theresa the Crimson She-Leopard!

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.620
Former Magic Knight

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.620
Theresa the Crimson She-Leopard

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.480
Huh?!

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.590
She's suddenly all pumped up?!

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.510
Wait... Former Magic Knight?!

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.230
Crimson... Then do you 
know Captain Fuegoleon?

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.570
Oh, Fueggy? Sure.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.080
"Fueggy"?!

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.880
When I served at the palace, 
I was his tutor.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.380
Fueggy, your mana's getting unsteady.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.680
Y-Yes, ma'am!

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.660
Your enemies won't wait for you in battle.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.390
Concentrate! And remain calm at all times!

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.790
Yes, ma'am!

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:11.170
He was such a snot-nosed brat, 
but he grew up quite well.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.650
I seriously can't picture that.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.740
But Granny, Captain Fuegoleon was...

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.070
By them.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.280
Yeah, I know.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.550
We'll catch this one, no matter what.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.930
Do something about this, you old hag!

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.570
What are you doing over there,
you sister complex failure?

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.880
You stupid old hag...

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.130
Three against one, huh?

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.520
That doesn't look so good.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.380
Hey, you.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:45.110
I'll back you up with my mud magic. 
Just fix my body so I can move.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.900
You can do that, right?

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.180
Well... There is a way, but are you sure?

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.480
Of course I am! Anything's fine, just do it!

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.300
Okay, I'll do it, then. But are you sure?

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.250
Yeah!

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.820
Are you really sure?

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.090
I told you, I'm sure!
Just shut up and do it!

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.200
Hey! What are you two whispering about?!

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.330
H-Hurry up and heal me! 
And give me some money!

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.370
Then I'll help you out.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.920
Yeah, right. Once I'm freed and paid, 
I'm getting the hell outta here!

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.840
Okay. In that case... Hup!

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.470
What is she...

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.630
Baro?!

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.780
What the heck?!

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.630
What is that?! His magic is swelling!

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.410
Whoopsie! Looks like I messed up a little.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.400
He can move now, and his magic's recharged,

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.570
but looks like his personality 
wandered off somewhere.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.010
Protect the children, Gauche! Asta!

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.020
Right!

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.250
Let's go, Marie.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.890
B-Brother?

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.360
Go? But what about everyone else?

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.670
It doesn't matter! It's too dangerous 
for you to be around that monster!

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.650
What?!

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:46.690
That fool.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.230
I'm going to take you home 
for sure this time, Asta!

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.370
Brother...

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.340
Petit Clover

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.770
Petit Clover!

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.840
Go! Go! Gordon!

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.180
Go! Go! Gordon!

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.200
Go! Go! Gordon!

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.260
Bah-ha! I managed to ask for 
backup, so I'm going home!

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.430
Bah-ha!

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.870
But the Black Bulls' base 
is like a maze... Bah-ha?

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.900
Wh-What the heck?!

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.150
Why are you following me?! Bah-ha!

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.180
What's this room?!

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.160
It's the captain's beast room

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.910
This is the bathroom

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.370
Bah-ha!

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.550
I should be safe here...

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.710
The water's great

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.570
Bah-ha-ha?!

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.800
Bah-ha! I'm going to be killed!

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.050
Where's the exit?!

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.930
I just want to lead you to the exit...

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.940
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the cutest—
No, you don't even need to answer!

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.730
It's Marie! I don't need 
a mirror to tell me that!

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.450
