00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.700
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.770
Asta and the others finally 
arrived at the Underwater Temple.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.060
But once they got there...

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.800
You guys are after the 
magic stone, aren't you?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.250
If you want it, why don't 
we play a little game?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.650
...a mysterious old man called the high priest

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.480
and nine temple mages were waiting for them!

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.900
The high priest told Asta and the other 
Black Bulls, who were separated,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.530
that if they wanted the magic stone, they
must battle the temple mages, nine-on-nine.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.850
Victory goes to the first team 
to wipe out the other team,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.530
or whichever team has the 
most members left in the end.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.390
Yay! This is awesome!

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.710
A blood-soaked battle! I'm super pumped!

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.480
Nine?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.010
There should be ten of us...
We're missing one.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.100
That's so easy to understand!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.430
All right! Bring it on!

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.490
That's funny...

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.680
I can't seem to sense any magic from you.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.980
Guess I picked a loser.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.130
Wanna find out if I'm 
actually a loser or not?

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.640
Temple Battle Royale

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.490
Now, then, why don't we watch from here?

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.880
I've got plenty of food and drink!

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.350
Hey, you old geezer,
don't leave me out of the game!

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.640
I got all pumped up, but now I'm sad.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.640
You're a bit too strong.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.230
All the people outside, as well as myself,
are very excited for this game.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.480
It'd be no fun if it were to end quickly.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.560
Looks like you really do get it, gramps.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.540
You've got good taste.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.310
I do, don't I?

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.420
Ooh, it looks like a few 
match-ups have already begun.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.960
All right. If any of mine lose, I'll kill 'em.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.240
So cold... Damn that geezer.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.380
He's gonna pay for this!

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.100
Hilarious!

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.840
You're at a total disadvantage with 
fire magic in a place like this.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.550
Looks like I win.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.060
I'd rather not pick on 
frail-looking guys like you.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.190
Are you gonna fight me?

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.850
I know you guys.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.120
You're the Black Bulls, aren't you?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.530
You're the weakest of the Magic Knights.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.030
Marie's waiting for me.
Hurry up and come at me, damn it.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.080
Just so you know, it's pretty pointless 
for you to wave around that rusty sword.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.090
My mollusk magic can 
parry any kind of attack.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.840
I see...

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.200
Isn't this exciting?

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.310
Oh, by the way, what are your knights' ranks?

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.780
They're all junior magic knights.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.560
I'm surprised you even know 
about that, living down here.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.610
According to your ranking system,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.010
my temple mages would be more
powerful than intermediate knights!

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.490
Those juniors don't stand a chance!

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.000
What? Really?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.660
Well, that's not good...

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.900
Unless those idiots are actually 
stronger than usual for their titles.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.000
Wh-Wh-Wh-What?!

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.520
Don't think I'm gonna get discouraged 
just because I'm surrounded by water.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.970
I'm gonna serve all of you up like grilled fish!

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.510
He must've been one of the weaker ones.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.220
So... I wonder where 
all the strong ones are?

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.500
Good grief.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.190
I need to finish this nonsense quick
so I can go back to doting on Marie.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.930
This... isn't right...

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.150
My mollusk magic should be able to 
deflect any kind of physical attack.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.980
My sword is anti-magic! That junk won't work!

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.620
What?

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.430
Next, next!

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.820
Good job, you idiots! 
Beat the crap out of them!

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.130
Those fools let down their guard!

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.070
Hey, gramps, I forgot! We should 
bet on which team is gonna win!

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.100
I bet 10,000 yuls on the Bulls!

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.010
Grr... The battle's just begun!

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.930
They won't be able to defeat the 
remaining priests so easily!

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.520
Especially the Three Great Priests, 
who are on par with senior knights.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.490
Badump, badump...

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.990
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak...

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.670
Whew... Man, that was close.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.450
There's no way I could fight 
a guy who looks that strong.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.190
I've been trying to get to the places I 
marked outside, but I can't for some reason.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.460
That means I can only use my spatial 
magic to get to places I can see.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.370
Oh, I forgot to mention this,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.530
but you won't be able to leave my 
playground until the game's over.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.670
Whoa! Are you watching me, gramps?!

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.290
Hey, Finral, why the hell are you hiding? 
Hurry up and fight, or I'll kill you!

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.520
Huh? Yami?!

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.590
Wait, are you with the old guy?

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.740
We're enjoying some food and drinks 
while we watch you guys fight.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.400
What?! Come on, make him 
stop this violent game!

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.150
What? It's fun to watch 
because it's so violent.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.920
That's right!

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.490
When did you two hit it off so well?!

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.690
It's definitely no fun if 
you're not gonna fight.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.170
Don't let that coward get away.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.370
There we go! Nuisance spell activated.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.210
Game Magic: Monster Toy.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.630
Scary!

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.640
How entertaining! I should use more of these!

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.890
Hey, you old geezer...

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.360
Let's do this one next. 
This'll probably kill them!

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.750
Are you sure you're actually on their side?

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.230
Nice drawing, though.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.780
Now, then... Let's see how 
the others are holding up.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.560
That bastard Grey turned into a crab, 
and I don't know where he went,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.040
so I'll just have to kill him later.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.860
Oh? Is Charmy battling?

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.490
S-Such destructive force...

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.800
Th-The Underwater Temple is amazing.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.010
And so is its seafood!

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.350
S-So good! Munchy, munchy...

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.160
This is the best I've ever had!

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.810
So this is the Underwater Temple's seafood!

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.810
I wish my meal-saving prince 
could have some, too!

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:33.070
Okay! This entire ecosystem is mine!

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.820
I'm going to eat absolutely everything!

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.500
That one there... What exactly is she doing?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.080
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! What a huge haul!

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.880
Found you!

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.420
La?

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.970
My, what a cute little target. I almost 
feel bad that I'm going to defeat you.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.250
So you're finally here.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.750
But right now, I'm overflowing 
with undersea mana.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.670
If you want me to chew you up 
the way I chewed up those fish,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.990
bring it on!

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.280
Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.710
I feel so nice...

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.650
Why, yes, I can still eat more...

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.130
One down!

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.410
Just so you know, sleeping counts as a K.O.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.780
How do you like the power 
of one of my Great Priests?

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.440
She's not getting any food for a week.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.380
Now, then...

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.980
I wonder if I'll see those two next.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.630
All right! My clothes are finally dry!

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.030
Let's see... Who am I gonna fight next?

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.700
Hey, Luck. I guess you're still alive.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.370
Yup! I defeated one of 
the enemy guys already.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.750
I headed this way because I felt a 
strong presence over here, but...

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.250
Looks like I was right...

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.590
All right... let's decide who 
gets a piece of 'em fir—

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.090
Hey! No fair, Luck! You bastard!

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.430
Ya snooze, ya lose, Magna!

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.400
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.610
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Shield.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.830
It's tough! My lighting should work 
pretty well against water, though.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.550
Well, well, aren't you lively?

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.630
What the heck are these things?!

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.100
This ki... Someone's there.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.960
Come on, Grandpa. Do you really have 
to hit us with your nuisance spells, too?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.650
Well, whatever. That was a good warm-up.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.690
Hup!

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.860
He took out something that huge?
Who the heck is he?

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.560
Hey, there!

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.450
You're Asta, right?

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.900
Huh? Yeah, that's right...

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.470
I've heard about you! You use a strange 
sword that cancels out magic, right?

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.630
Uh, yes... Wait, who'd you hear that from?!

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.630
Never mind that! Check out this dance!

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.280
The hell?! He just started dancing!

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.280
But it's a really cool dance!

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.610
Do you think they'd like this 
dance up on the surface, too?

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.990
Heck yeah!

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.410
The name's Kiato!

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.360
My dream's to become a dancer who 
captivates the whole kingdom!

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.410
He just started talking about his dream?!

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.040
Although people from the Underwater Temple
can go to the kingdom's beaches,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.740
we can't go to the capital. 
It's against the rules.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.430
But if we win this fight, Grandpa said...

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.120
Oh, the high priest is my grandpa.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.360
Anyway, he said we could use the high
 priest's authority to go up to the surface!

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.520
I'm gonna make a name for myself 
and become a super famous dancer!

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.810
He just told me all about this huge dream!

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.330
Hey, wait a sec...

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.940
This all seems pretty familiar.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.560
So listen...

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.540
I'm gonna take you down 
for the sake of my dream!

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.820
He's fast!

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.290
I have my own dream, too!

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.380
Huh?

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.070
I wanna become the strongest man 
who protects the Clover Kingdom,

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.970
the Wizard King!

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.530
So for that dream...

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.970
I'm gonna take you down!

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.770
I like it!

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.310
Then let's bet our dreams on 
a head-to-head showdown!

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.730
Bring it on!

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:27.830
Wh-What am I going to do? I haven't 
learned a single attack spell yet.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.650
Hey, there! I finally found you!

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.750
Sh-Shoot! I'm in trouble!

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.330
Y-You want to take on 
a royal such as myself?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.540
You've got some guts! This is your 
chance to run away if you want!

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.920
First off, I'm glad you 
could make it, Noelle!

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.340
H-How do you know my name?

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.890
Oh, right. I guess you can't 
tell with this thing on my face.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.350
Huh?

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.090
Kahono!

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.210
I've been waiting for you, Noelle!

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.790
Kahono... I had no idea you were 
from the Underwater Temple.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.000
Why did you help me learn magic?

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.050
I was actually looking for people who 
wanted to come to the Underwater Temple

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.050
while I practiced singing on that beach.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.640
You see, when we have guests, Grandpa...
I mean, the high priest, always holds games.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.160
If I win, I'll be able to go to the surface

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.890
and make my dream to 
become an idol come true!

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.600
Your dream? Then you used me?!

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.940
Huh? No.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.870
It's true that I wanted to help you, 
since you were working so hard,

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.100
and it's also true that I wanted 
to become friends with you.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.240
But from now on, we'll fight fair and 
square as opponents in this game!

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.830
No! We're supposed to be friends!

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.950
Yup!

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.800
Friends are people who can clash over 
things that are precious to them,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.340
but keep smiling together even then!

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.840
Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.210
What is this spell?

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.010
I-It's going to make me...

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.770
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.310
Now you're ready to fight?

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.030
Song Magic: Destructive Beat!

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.640
Come on, now, Noelle!

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.660
You'll never win if you just keep defending!

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.660
What do you think you're doing?!

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.660
She only let off some magic 
energy, but look at that force!

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.820
Amazing!

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.380
Huh? What're you doing, Noelle?

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.020
An attack like that won't 
have any effect on me.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.760
Aim straight! That sucked!

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.010
Shut up!

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:00.570
I still can't control my magic 
when I'm attacking, you idiot!

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.350
That's not it. You're already 
controlling your magic, Noelle.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.310
Huh?

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.860
You're subconsciously trying 
not to attack people.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.940
You must not want to hurt anyone.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.070
But are you sure you're okay with that?

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.580
Why did you come here, Noelle?

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.830
Didn't you come here to 
make something come true?

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.170
If you don't fight for it and win it,

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.840
you'll never get what you want!

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.590
I... want to be useful to everyone!

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.350
Fine!

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.530
This guy's really strong!

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.320
And what's with his moves?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:00.120
It's like his mind's gone somewhere else.
 It's really hard to read his ki!

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.090
I think he's even throwing off my senses.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.460
Is this his magic?

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.170
It's just like I thought.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.930
If you're going up against a real sword,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.970
your anti-magic sword is nothing 
more than a lump of iron!

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.970
And if I add in my dance magic,
you won't be able to follow my moves!

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.480
How do you like my grandson? Isn't he strong?

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.300
Yeah, the kid definitely 
knows how to handle a sword.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.230
But...

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.820
Come on, now! Just surrender already, Asta!

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.200
This isn't good! I'm about to lose!

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.580
He really is like water. 
There's no way to catch him...

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.880
Wait, maybe brute strength 
isn't the way to go here!

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.820
I probably shouldn't try to capture water,
since it has no distinct shape!

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.450
Anyway, I need to calm down.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.340
That's it!

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.910
I will also become like water!

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.860
Monkeying around won't get you anywhere!

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.250
Don't sell a monkey short!

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.770
I can't use magic!

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.060
And that's why...

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.560
I'll recreate magic with my body!

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.690
Pretty sure there are limits 
when you can't use magic!

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.010
What?

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.570
In that case...

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.540
I'll use this chance...

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.120
to go beyond my limits!

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.660
Jeez... Just how athletic is this kid?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.750
My idiot's ability to pick 
things up quick is even greater!

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:43.340
What a rude man... Trying to set up a sneaky 
trap for a defenseless woman like me.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.640
You can't really complain if you 
fall for a trap yourself, can you?

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:56.040
Seriously? Vanessa's usually drunk and 
useless before she gets warmed up.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.070
We're in top shape today.
 I should've bet more, damn it.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.480
These guys aren't junior mages at all!

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.640
But man, that lady's got some nice boobies.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.410
Hey, old man. Could you get 
that magic stone ready?

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.970
A really dangerous lot called the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun is after that stone.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.670
It'd be in your best interests 
to just hand it over to us.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.780
The best part of a game 
is turning the tables.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.770
You can't get lamer than bluffing, old man.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.740
I'm not bluffing!

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.550
If my son and grandkids get serious, 
we'll turn things around in an instant!

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:35.320
My son is the strongest mage 
of the Underwater Temple!

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.150
Uh-oh... I think you're getting tired, Magna.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.570
You can take a little break.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.500
I couldn't feel better, you idiot.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.490
You butt out, Luck.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:53.580
Sorry to drag you into 
my dad's game like this.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.170
Dad? You're that geezer's son?

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.510
He's strong... His magic 
is as deep as the sea.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.820
No doubt about it... He's definitely 
the strongest one here.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.690
You two should come at me at once.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.020
I'd rather not hurt you 
any more than I need to.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.770
At the very least, I'll end 
all this in an instant.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.230
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.420
You ain't ending anyone, you bastard!

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.140
I'm not done having fun yet!

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.520
Huh?

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.870
Wh-What was that?

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.920
Wh-Wh-What the heck's going on?!

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.350
Looks like you're having fun.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.390
Why don't you let us join in?

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.410
Petit Clover

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.560
Petit Clover!

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.870
Why Don't You Let Us Join In?

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.870
Why Don't You Let Us Join In?

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.540
Looks like you're having fun.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.800
Why don't you let us join in?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.420
Munchy, munchy...

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.550
La?

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.350
I-I must've come to the wrong place.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.100
Munchy, munchy... Have a bite.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.230
Have a bite, 'kay?

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:07.110
Well, if you insist, I guess I'll... join in.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.920
I'll let you join in...

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.410
After you stir that pot.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.910
Those who will not work do not get to munchy!

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.890
Stir, stir, stir...

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.890
Put your back into it!
It's not all about strength!

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.650
I see... This is quite deep.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:31.060
And so, Vetto realized his dream to become 
a chef and gave up on the magic stone.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.980
Then everyone lived happily ever after!

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.020
That probably won't happen, huh?

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.860
Of course not!

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.390
To make the Eye of the Midnight Sun's
dream come true,

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.540
I, Vetto of the Third Eye, 
shall obtain the magic stone!

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.940
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 44: "The Pointlessly 
Direct Fireball and the Wild Lightning."

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 44
 The Pointlessly Direct Fireball and the Wild Lightning

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.820
My beast magic shall destroy everything!
