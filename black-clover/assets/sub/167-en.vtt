WEBVTT

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.830
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.290
a devil.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.380
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.710
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.720
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.890
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.740
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.050
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.720
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.390
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.470
Oh, I just had a great idea.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.800
Hey, Megicula, let's not kill her after all.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.320
Oh? And why is that?

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.330
I thought it would be better to truly
 kill the wisdom of the Heart Kingdom.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.700
Oh, who cares about that?

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.080
Let's take her to the Spade Kingdom.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.840
I just remembered.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.150
I fought some chick in armor 
just like you, my widdle Noelle.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.340
If I remember correctly... Ah! 
She was my widdle Acier!

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.390
Oh, that was so much fun!

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.410
Back when I fought her,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.830
she got super strong after 
I took a child hostage.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.530
If I take her hostage,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.620
you'll get even stronger, too, 
won't you, my widdle Noelle?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.370
Not that I really understand, but she's 
your precious little friend, right?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680
Right?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.880
No one's going to complain 
if I keep her, right?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.640
Honestly... You never cease 
to fascinate me, Vanica.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.710
Well, I guess we're done here.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.400
Loropechika! Noelle!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.650
Lady Vanica, are we going back 
to the Spade Kingdom already?

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.160
Could you wait just a moment?

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.680
Just a little more and I'll have her—

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.160
Don't talk to me. You're gross.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.350
Actually, I don't need any of you anymore.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.740
Huh?

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.420
Curse-Warding Magic: Exploding Life.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.470
His mana is expanding.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.740
Lady... Vanica...

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.310
What... are you...

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.130
It's a curse bomb!

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.980
You know that devil power 
I gave you Dark Disciples?

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.090
It's going to go all kaboom now!

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.570
What?!

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.080
Wait... Lady Vanica...

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.960
Lady Vanica, you wouldn't...

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.210
Please wait, Lady Va—

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.750
This whole area's gonna go kablooey,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.490
but I'm sure you can 
survive that, Widdle Noelle!

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.100
Well, I'll be waiting in 
the Spade Kingdom for you!

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.100
Get stronger, okay?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.610
My wid-dle No-elle!

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.540
Vanica!

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.210
Black Oath

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.210
The key here is definitely Asta's anti-magic.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.710
We have to somehow hit that 
guy with Asta's sword.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.880
Damn it! I'm definitely holding him back!

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.470
I'm only hanging in there
because of Captain Yami!

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.230
My six months of training isn't nearly
enough to stand against him.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.850
More... Entertain me more!

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:08.740
This is all just feeding my pleasure!

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.130
If I don't try to use all of the 
unknown powers that are inside me...

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.440
Hey, you're watching, aren't you... my devil?!

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.860
Welcome.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.160
Who the hell are you?!

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.660
Well, that's cold.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.810
I'm the one who's been the closest 
to you this whole time.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.170
I remember now.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.570
We've met like this before, 
though you seem a bit different now.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.080
Kill...

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.260
Kill... I'll kill them! They will pay...

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.570
Kill...

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.830
I felt your rage earlier.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.830
I'm not sure why, but you want to 
defeat that guy, too, don't you?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.830
I should've had a real heart-to-heart
 with you much sooner.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.350
I'd like to do that now.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.070
So please... lend me your powers!

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.090
Please!

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.100
Very well...

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.860
I'll give you some of my true power.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.880
But as things stand right now, it won't work.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.300
I'll need something equal in return.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.360
Something in return?

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.370
I'll be taking a part of your body!

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.640
You're making a deal with a devil.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.500
Are you sure you still want this?

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.350
Even if I become a devil... 
No matter what I have to do...

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.290
I have to surpass my limits.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.760
I can't win this one without you...

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.190
Asta!

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:09.090
Those words mean that much to me.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.150
If I can't get through this, there's no
 way I can become the Wizard King!

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.190
You're funny, kid.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.700
Join my squad.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.620
And then, someday,

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.150
become the Wizard King.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.830
I will become the Wizard King.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.080
But before that...

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.800
I want to be someone who can live up to 
Captain Yami's hopes and expectations!

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.520
Very well. I'll give it to you.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.810
Gravity Magic: Gravity Singularity!

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.330
This is everything...

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.090
that I've got right now!

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.600
Fifty seconds.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:32.050
That right arm is no longer the same as when 
I was just dribbling some power into you.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.610
It is power itself.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.690
Your body won't last more than fifty seconds.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.160
That's plenty!

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.400
Excellent, boy!

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.500
The way he's fighting... He's definitely 
on guard when Asta attacks.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.600
Is there anti-magic coming 
from his right hand?

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.670
If Asta can get a clean hit in on Dante...

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.170
We can win!

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.920
Kick-ass job, Asta!

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.930
Then I guess I need to...

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.930
work a bit harder, too!

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.060
You, too, Captain Yami!

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.720
What's that going to do now?!

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.550
Excellent, you two.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.240
More... More!

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.430
Asta...

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.810
Yami!

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.140
Entertain me...

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.140
Entertain me even more!

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.120
Both of them are

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.140
moving at insane speeds...

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.150
But it's like they're totally in sync.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.190
Time Until Asta's Devil Powers Run Out

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.940
Despite everything going on, 
they look like they're having fun.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.420
8 Seconds Remaining

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.180
Even so...

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.570
Even so, in the end...

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.160
I will crush everything...

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.820
and win!

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.330
Demon-Dweller!

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.890
Demon-Destroyer!

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.680
You're mine!

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.850
3 Seconds Remaining

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.110
I am...

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.180
immortal!

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.650
This is the end!

We win!

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.220
Well done, Asta, you crazy son of a bitch.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.730
Thanks.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.480
You guys!

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.920
That was amazing!

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.980
Yeah, you guys are just... You're amazing!

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.100
Thanks.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.490
Damn straight.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.250
Did... you... win?

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.140
I... What...

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.530
Gauche...

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.130
Gauche!

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.890
Th-Th-Th... Thank goodness!

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.080
Uh, Grey...

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:21.880
Huh?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.660
I-I-I-I'm so sorry!

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.270
Why are you apologizing?

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.730
Well, well... What's going on with those two?

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.160
What's the matter, Yami?

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:43.910
He may be dying, but we need to restrain him.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.410
Oh, good point!

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.890
Talk about a gigantic pain in the ass.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.670
You hardcore psycho stalker freak.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.740
Well, we captured the enemy's 
top devil-possessed.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.930
Guess it's happily ever aft—

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.190
Man, I'm beat.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.390
I can't wait to just dive into my bed.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.380
Ya...

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.330
Yami!

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.340
I screwed up... I can't move!

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.090
Who... is that?!

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.460
That's... the Captain of the Golden Dawn!

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:48.110
The thing that connects this 
world with the underworld is...

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.590
a magic channel called the Tree of Qliphoth.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.820
And to create that Tree of Qliphoth,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.250
we need dark magic and world 
tree magic at the arcane stage.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.900
I was concerned about the magic 
fluctuation and came to check.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.880
All life is within the palms of our hands.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.680
You said all that, yet lost? How pathetic.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.580
A spatial magic user?

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.650
You bastard!

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.340
I'm still affected from the 
fight with my last opponent.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.910
I'm glad I got him early.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.280
I'd like to take this one, too, but time's up.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.420
You're not going anywhere!

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.360
Don't let him leave!

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.640
The world will end!

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.840
Captain!

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:19.360
Please...

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.860
Devil!

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.360
You can claim more of my body if you want!

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.470
I need to borrow your powers again!

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.770
No.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.320
Your body can't move anymore.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:43.640
Right now, it wouldn't be 
able to handle another deal.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:45.950
It can't...

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.390
handle another deal?

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.960
That's because...

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.720
you're weak.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.870
Finral, please!

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:58.880
Rouge!

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.990
If we can just...

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.150
touch the captain, even a little!

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:56.080
Captain Yami!

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.070
We have achieved our goals.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.740
N-No... Yami...

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.280
What are we supposed to do now?

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.450
