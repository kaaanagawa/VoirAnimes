00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.100
Working together with his friends, 
Asta continued his battle with Vetto.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.930
But...

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.740
Vetto was able to overcome 
those attacks, too.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.140
Not bad for insects!

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.940
If even one of you makes the 
smallest mistake, you'll die instantly!

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.100
In this life-or-death situation,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.540
Asta continued to swing his sword,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.880
believing in his friends 
and in their victory.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.900
Then...

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.290
It's not just them.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.500
Guess we got here in time.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.380
Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.650
Cotton Creation Magic:

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.380
Sleeping Sheep's...

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630
One Hit

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.630
One Hit!

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.590
Two Hit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.060
Two Hit!

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.690
Mega Hit!

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.970
Mega Hit!!

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.100
What's going on?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.350
It's my transformation magic!

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.210
You pesky insects! Despair already!

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.710
Despair?

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.980
We don't have time for that!

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.920
We're being led far away

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.710
Until we shatter the road 
between light and darkness

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.710
Yo Guess who's back

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.370
Everybody get down

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.380
Guess who's back

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.010
Hey step up step up!

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.640
Beyond Limits

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.290
I'm falling down because of a twist of fate

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.440
The harmony we had is in the past

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.950
Still left behind

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.450
The scent of you is stuck in my head

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.240
Can't shake it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.540
Waiting just isn't enough anymore, Yai yah!

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.410
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.590
As I hold on to my wish

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.600
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.800
The roulette points to tomorrow

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.880
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.180
Let the light shine

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.170
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.570
In the dark maze

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.600
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.400
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.860
Until we seize the hope in front of us

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.450
We...

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.500
We did it!

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.340
Yes!

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.890
Finally...

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.810
We won!

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.600
Is that what you thought?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.480
Did you think your puny strengths 
combined would actually work against me?

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.860
Well? Did you?

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.120
I let you hit me on purpose, in a non-vital 
spot, so I could steal your weapon!

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.120
N-No...

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:57.380
I know that once you lose all hope,
the most unmistakable despair is created!

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.890
Fall into the darkness of despair!

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.180
Asta!

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.610
Kid!

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.860
That's right! That's the way I wanted
to hear you humans scream!

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.360
Now, fall fully into despair!

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.050
Despair! Despair! Despair!

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.210
Despair! Despair! Despair!

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.870
Despair! Despair!

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.740
Despair! Despair!

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.810
Despair! Despair! Despair!

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.310
Despair!

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.910
As...ta...

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.020
How do you like that, insect?!
I'd like to see you try to stand again now!

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.690
...yet...

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.060
Not yet!

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.940
Not yet...

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.320
I'm not...

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.280
giving up yet!

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.830
Asta... You're so...

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.830
He's right. We're not...

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.480
...giving up yet!

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.940
Curse you!

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.650
Vanessa!

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.600
You're not getting away!

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.970
How'd you like that, you despair freak?!

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.570
That's the last of our magic!

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.440
La!

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.740
We'll never give up.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.750
We'll never lose

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.080
to someone like you!

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.800
Asta, are you all right?!

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.540
He's different from us.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.820
He was born without magic into this 
world where magic is everything.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:25.820
But... Perhaps the gods of fate didn't 
give him magic </i>because<i> he's like this.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.720
He's someone who's going to make 
it to the top in this world.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.450
We need to let him fight and guide him!

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.950
Little boy, I'll support your broken arm!

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.330
Thanks, Miss Vanessa!

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.710
Now I... can still fight!

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.710
We're doing this again, Finral!

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.090
Right!

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.720
I'm going to do this! No matter 
how many times it takes!

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.390
I still have one sword left!

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.610
Why?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.610
Why won't you despair?

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.120
I told you! I don't have time for that!

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.120
There's someone I can't lose to!

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:25.880
You and despair... are in 
the way of our promise!

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.910
Silence! You insects can be swatted away!

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.390
I've already seen through your movements—

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.180
My eyes can't keep up with his movements.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.160
Because the Demon-Dweller Sword
is still embedded in me,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.960
the magic I was using to increase 
my physical abilities has weakened!

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.030
I thought that I had stolen his weapon.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.030
But are you saying it was my 
weapon that was actually stolen?!

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.540
There is no way that I would
lose... against you humans!

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.790
You haven't won against anyone!

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.300
Did any of them actually give up before you?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.210
No one has despaired!

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.990
Shut your mouth!

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.970
Asta!

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.230
My magic... But...

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.670
This time I'll end you for good—

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.250
Not yet...

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.300
Not yet...

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.010
I'm not giving up yet!

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.170
He's the same as me... No...

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.610
He's no beast.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:15.290
The three leaves of the clover
represent faith, hope, and love.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.450
Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.410
Within a fifth leaf...

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:31.300
He's... a demon who devours even despair.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.510
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.430
I know, yeah I know

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:44.570
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.140
I dreamed it all my life

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.650
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.460
Don't care how much I fall

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.780
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:02.330
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:07.690
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.840
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.510
Despair...

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.130
Someday I will write the next page

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:21.180
You've lost!

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.800
You are my hope

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.390
Like that page from someday

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.890
I was able to meet you

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.070
I call this a miracle

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.740
His magic disappeared.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.460
Th-There's no question this time!

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.800
We won!

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.040
How do you like that, you bastard?!

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.680
Asta!

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.680
Little boy!

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.600
Well done! I'm so proud of you!

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.480
I knew you could win, little boy!

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.190
You're so amazing, la!

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.650
Thank goodness you didn't despair!

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.660
Damn... That shrimp is full of guts.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.330
Guys...

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.150
That hurts! I'm injured all over, remember?!

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.790
Oh... Sorry.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.290
He did it! He defeated that beast!

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.300
What was the power that
came from the kid earlier?

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.570
That kid's amazing!

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.400
I thought we were done for!

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.450
Thank you, Magic Knights!

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.730
Thank you so much!

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.980
Miss Vanessa, how are their wounds?

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.410
They're deep, but none of 
them are life-threatening.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.410
Finral, do you think you can transport 
them with your spatial magic?

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.850
I'm exhausted. I think it'll take a 
little longer for my magic to recover.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.490
You're so useless, you coward.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.200
Useless?! I have seniority, damn it!

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.660
I hope Kiato and Kahono will be 
able to dance and sing again.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.880
Jeez. Do you really have time 
to worry about other people?

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.460
Look at how beat up you are. 
And to think you actually believed in us.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.680
There's something seriously 
wrong with you, Asta.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.390
Yeah. You never know when that 
coward Finral will run away.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.720
Yup, yup...

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:35.060
Hey, that's mean. Though it's true 
that I did want to run away.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.570
But when I saw Asta,
my body moved on its own.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.440
Little boy, because you didn't give up...

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.750
Because you believed in us,
we were able to win.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.660
Thank you.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.910
What are you talking about?

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.630
You're my seniors, who Captain Yami 
accepted into the Black Bulls.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.790
Of course I believe in you!

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.960
You sure know how to make a girl smile.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.920
Stop making your seniors cry.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.630
You've got some great seniors, la.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.590
I'd expect nothing less from the 
juniors that Captain Yami accepted.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.000
Well, I'm pretty sure he's the 
only one who'd ever accept

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.600
someone who has no magic.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.430
Hey, I'm one of your juniors too, you know.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.390
Noelle! I heard you did great, too!

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.940
You learned some insane
new attack spell, right?

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.010
That's right! The Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.530
It was seriously amazing!

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.290
Y-Yeah! You'd better compliment me more!

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.770
And she's cute to boot!

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.620
This royal's basically a celebrity!

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.710
Y-Yeah! That has nothing to do with the 
battle, but keep the compliments coming!

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.650
And just once more...

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.340
D-D-Don't get any weird ideas!

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.430
I wasn't even thinking!

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.430
Oh, sorry.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:56.150
All right! Let's have a drink 
to celebrate our victory!

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.140
Now's not the time to drink!

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.930
We need to figure out a way to tie up 
that guy and haul him outta here.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.290
He has an eyeball in his forehead and 
said something about my sword...

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.150
But most of all, he's one of the 
leaders of the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.410
There's a lot we have to ask him!

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.670
Vetto... Vetto...

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.170
Stop crying, Vetto.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.670
Those damn humans...
hurting this tiny little bird...

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.100
I can't forgive them.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.960
I chased them away. Let's go 
home and tend to its wounds.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.940
I'm sorry that you always 
have to save me, Licht.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.630
What are you talking about? 
We're friends, aren't we?

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.440
I'll always save you.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.690
We're just like this bird.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.190
Because it can fly,
like we can use special magic,

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.440
they envy and want to hurt us.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.420
But I believe that one day, we and the humans
will be able to understand each other.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.690
Licht... I'm sure if you 
say so, it'll come true.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.920
Hope, eh?

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.470
It's a very sweet notion.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.850
To me, Licht was... yes, 
he was hope personified.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.980
But the ones who stole 
that hope away from me...

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.480
were you humans!

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.070
This magic...

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.240
You're kidding, right?

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.860
I'm taking you all down with me... No...

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.910
I'll blow this whole temple to smithereens!

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.250
Th-That's...

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.790
That bastard!

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.920
Even they won't be able to stop that.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.160
Let me the hell out of here!

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.070
It's no use.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.280
It's the same as last time!

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.370
Even the captains could barely stop it!

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.070
It's the same as him... 
No, this magic's even stronger!

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.300
Don't tell me he's planning to self-destruct!

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.620
My threads are being erased... 
It's growing even bigger!

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.250
I can't get any closer like this!

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.680
Guys, we're not going to be 
doing anything different!

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.330
We'll just kick his ass again!

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.700
No, no, no, that's not—

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.120
What the heck am I saying?

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.400
I almost gave up again!

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.260
We've come this far! I'm not 
giving up until the end!

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.240
Well said, Finral!

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.260
If you figure this out, 
I'll go on a date with you.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.980
Seriously?! I'll do it!

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.480
There must be something we can still do!

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.690
I won't forgive anyone who gets 
in the way of my seeing Marie!

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.360
I'm going to defeat him and eat seafood 
I haven't even discovered yet!

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.570
I'm scared, but I'll do my best!

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.580
All right! Bring it on!

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.080
Right, consider it brought.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.340
Hey, you dumbasses. You good?

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.880
Captain Yami!

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.730
Yami! You finally came!

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.470
B-But I thought you were trapped...

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.640
As you can see, I broke through 
the spatial magic and got out.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.820
Though I might've been
a bit forceful about it.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.030
F-Forceful?

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.950
Couldn't you have done that a bit sooner?

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.790
Shut it! I have my reasons!

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.410
If I'm not wanted here,
I can go home, you know.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.700
What?!

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.750
He's sulking!

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.290
Kiato! Kahono!

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:57.300
All because I wanted to 
play this stupid game...

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:02.310
Gio... I'm sorry to drag you into 
this old fool's mess, too.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:08.310
B-But to think this man 
could use magic like that...

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.310
He's truly a monster.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:15.360
I was right not to let him
participate in the game.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.120
Looks like we don't have much time,
so let's get this over with.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.970
All right! Now that Captain Yami's here,

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.000
we've basically got a whole 
cavalry... no, a whole army!

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.870
Let's beat the snot outta that guy!

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.970
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.970
What? Who do you think you're talking to?

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.570
Did your head swell because you 
thought you took the enemy down?

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.940
Ow, ow, ow... What do you mean?!

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.900
I'm saying that I can take him on my own.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.110
You guys risked your lives fighting him.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.270
I'm the captain, so I've gotta go all-out.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.770
Finral...

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.150
Vanessa...

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.570
Noelle...

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.820
Gauche...

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.110
Charmy...

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.110
La!

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.280
Who are you again?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.160
I'm Grey!

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.950
And Magna and Luck...

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.950
You guys did good.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.180
Yami complimented me!

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.170
I'll be nice and take care of the cleanup.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.170
Or rather, I'm taking all the glory.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.180
Seriously... You guys did well.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.060
The reason I was able to surpass my limits...

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.560
is because of all of you, you dumbasses!

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:40.650
Getting trapped and pushed 
against a wall was worth it.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.400
This spell reminds me a bit of
a certain stretched-out weirdo,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.950
and that bothers me, but still...

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.560
It's no use...

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.710
You humans shall taste despair... Despair!

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.630
Shut up with the despair this, despair
that already, you three-eyed goon!

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.270
It doesn't matter how strong your magic is!

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.950
This spell cuts through dimensions!

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.030
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.620
Consider that my thanks for 
looking after my squad.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.870
See ya, Mister Despair.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.380
4 AM in the morning

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.740
Why can't I sleep?

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.350
On such a bad day, whispering 
"Bye Bye Black Birds"

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:52.350
Won't make my anxiety go away

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.870
for hours, lately

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.390
I've been crying for hours Baby

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.950
I wish you were here

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.490
All those letters that you gave to me

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:15.370
Every time I read them again, the pain's gone

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:21.490
We're not alone, cause we're perfect as four

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:27.510
Even though we're far apart, 
we're connected, believing you

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:33.640
I always feel you next to me

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.730
closer to me and a "clover" for you

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.400
I wish you the best of luck

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:45.990
You know you're not alone, 
cause we're perfect as four

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:52.200
Even though we're far apart, 
we're connected, you live in me

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:58.440
I'll always be by your side

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.130
closer to me and a "clover" for you

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.820
I wish you the best of luck

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.760

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.760
Petit Clover!

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.770
Captain of the Black Bulls

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:23.780
The Professional
The Way of the Toilet

00:22:22.840 --> 00:23:25.860
The Professional
The Way of the Toilet

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.240
Yami Sukehiro.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.150
As the captain who leads 
the rest of the Black Bulls,

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.080
he does most of his thinking on the toilet.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.540
Our investigative team 
asked him one question.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.560
Why the toilet...?

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.050
Why else? It's because the toilet is there.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.090
But let me just say one thing.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.940
Before going in, you need to 
make sure there's toilet paper.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.300
Those who enter a bathroom
 without toilet paper

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.010
are like birds who've had
 their wings torn off.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.120
They'll never be able to 
fly out to the blue sky

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.810
that lies beyond the bathroom ever again.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:04.390
By the way, the one in charge of the toilet
paper here is the brat, but he always forgets.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:10.310
I've seen hell many times because of him, 
but I showed him an even worse hell.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.310
Captain Yami! I'm going to fall!

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.880
After that, his remarks about the 
toilet continued for hours.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.830
But there was one thing we wanted to ask 
him before we finished this interview.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.860
How long are you going to stay on the toilet...?

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.800
Hey! Hey! Captain Yami!

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.960
How long are you going to stay in there?!

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.840
Shut up! I can't come out because 
you didn't restock the toilet paper!

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.600
Let me out of here, damn it!

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:44.770
Damn it... I can't just fool around 
after you guys worked so hard.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:49.530

End of the Battle, End of Despair

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.700
See ya, Mister Despair.
That's important, so I said it twice!
