00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.200
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.510
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.470
He's turned the tables.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.480
Since he can use that sword, I thought 
he might be their descendant, but...

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.580
Show me who you really are!

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.790
Not in the Slightest

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Huh?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.210
What is this place?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.680
Wait, does this mean...

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.240
that I di—

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.130
Hey... No way.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.480
I haven't married Sister yet.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.230
And besides...

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.000
Damn...

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.290
it...

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.370
Heya.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.200
Welcome.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.790
Who the hell are you?!

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.800
Well, that's cold.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.790
I've been the one closest 
to you this whole time.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.130
Nope! I definitely don't know anyone like you!

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.780
Well, whatever.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.140
Regardless, this is a chance for 
me to obtain a physical body.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.900
So I'll be taking yours.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.590
Hey! What's the big idea?!

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.530
Oh, come on. It's not a bad deal.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.820
You wanna win, right?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.700
Against that human.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.700
I can make that happen for you.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.700
Shut up! I'm gonna defeat 
him with my own strength!

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.460
Quit yappin' and let me take 
over your consciousness!

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.250
All you've got to do is pass out.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.010
A little dwarf like you 
has no chance of winning.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.010
Don't you dare underestimate dwarfs!

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.540
Thanks for looking down on me from 
all the way up there, you big lug!

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.310
Because of that, I can look 
up as I run to the top!

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.530
There are places that you just can't climb.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.610
Come on, just give up.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.660
You can't do a thing in this world. 
Just give up on everything.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.500
You were born a loser!

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.470
Give... up?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.220
That one time was the very last time

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.870
I'm ever going to feel depressed!

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.290
Never giving up...

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.050
is my magic!

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.050
What the?

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.800
He got back up instantly...

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.750
The three leaves of the clover
 represent faith, hope, and love.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.810
Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.820
Within a fifth leaf...

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.320
resides a demon.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.160
This... doesn't feel like magic?

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.930
Asta?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.580
What happened to you?

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.480
That's quite the transformation.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.580
But what exactly are you going to do with it?!

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.350
You're not getting away!

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.200
Well, it looks like you're a bit faster now,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.550
but let's see how long you can keep that up!

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.410
Did you really think I'd fall 
for the same thing twice?!

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.930
This isn't a slight change.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.030
Where's all this strength coming from?!

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.750
Damn you!

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.160
Now you won't be able to dodge anymore.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.920
Huh?

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.840
Whoa, there!

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.900
What is this?

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.230
It feels like I'm in a cold lake.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.110
It feels cool...

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.470
My mind is unbelievably clear.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.040
And I can feel...

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.620
the power overflowing!

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.970
I thought he'd lose consciousness, 
but it seems he was able to control it.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.410
Anti-magic energy flows constantly 
through the Demon-Dweller Sword,

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.590
draining the wielder's magic.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.860
As such, no one should be able to wield it.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.530
But since you are magicless,
that power flows through you.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.820
You've been unconsciously emitting 
and shutting off that power.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.840
Using the power of my blood,
which I transfused during your treatment,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.220
I accelerated the flow of power
and removed the limits on its output.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.420
The anti-magic power will 
now become a raging torrent,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.010
and you will become its vessel.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.430
What... the hell?

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.980
I assumed that you might be one of their kin,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.940
but apparently I was wrong.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.690
What is this feeling?

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.700
A sudden mutation kept 
mana from dwelling in you.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.700
You're merely defective.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.250
But because of that,
you are able to wield that sword.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.770
What the hell are you?

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.550
You aren't special. Not in the slightest.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.970
But that's exactly what makes you special.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.300
Get out of my sight!

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.320
In your presence, all magic is meaningless.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.320
So finish him.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.830
Damn it!

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.210
Why?!

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.390
My magic's supposed to be invincible now!

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.500
Stay back!

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.090
Get away from me! Stay away!

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.590
It's no use.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.180
The flood of anti-magic homes in on mana.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.850
A black shooting star...
climbing into the sky?

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.830
Shit!

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.490
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! <i>Shit</i>!

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.470
Why?!

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.000
I got this far by kicking everyone else down!

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.250
Why are you...

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.750
You might've kicked people down,

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.050
but everyone that helped boost me up

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.280
makes me strong!

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.180
Black Meteorite!

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.550
All the magic in my body is gone.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.050
This can't happen to me... Not here...

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.640
I guess maybe... this really is my limit.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.150
Lad...ros...

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.410
Asta...

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.290
He's so powerful...

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.470
The way he fought didn't 
seem like Asta at all.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.650
And the way he looks...

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.200
It's almost as if...

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.390
Kill me. I'm ready.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.730
Like hell I'd kill you!

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.900
Right now, I'm gonna go rescue
all the people you hurt!

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.400
Hurry up and heal so you can come help me!

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.660
Then you can apologize to them all!

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.160
You're all wrinkly and bloody now, but I'm 
not letting you off the hook, you jerk!

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.650
What the hell?! Are you okay?

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.390
Yeah... I can't beat that.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.370
I feel much better now.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.970
Uh, did your personality just change?

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:27.280
Well, the mage stones broke, 
so my head feels a bit lighter.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.570
Good grief...

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.350
You sure you're okay?

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.200
I guess it's guys like you 
that climb to the top.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.660
You sure you didn't go crazy?

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.960
If I'd been with you...

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:47.710
We might've been able to help 
each other get stronger, too.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.930
Asta, thank you.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.280
Hey, did you fall asleep?

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.840
Hey, come on! Are you listening to me?

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.860
I guess I was worried for nothing.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.720
He's still himself.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.730
I'm back to normal.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.400
What was that black stuff, anyway?

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.490
And I feel like I fought 
something in my dream.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.180
But it felt like I was able to use some 
mysterious power, and that was super exciting!

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.630
I wanna master it!

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.420
I wonder if this is what it feels 
like when everyone else uses magic.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.620
I hurt all over!

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.830
I'm bleeding so much!

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.720
Oh, crap! I'm dying!

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.450
Someone save me!

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.520
What do you want?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.450
Sorry...

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.100
No one's okay at all!

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.200
Hey, you two! You guys can 
use recovery magic, right?!

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.360
Do something—Wait, 
are you guys even alive?!

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.950
Oh, good! You're alive!

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.060
But you're totally not waking up!

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.500
Sorry, Mars. Am I too heavy?

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.520
No... You're actually kind 
of warm, and it feels nice.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.200
You've seriously changed, dude!

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.890
Oh, Mars...

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.870
You're ignoring me?!

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.340
Damn it! I'm gonna have 
to carry you all with me!

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.090
I'll make as many trips as 
I need to make! Bring it!

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.590
There's no need for that.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.280
The Queen of Witches!

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.660
The Queen...

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.650
We took down the Eye of the Midnight Sun 
and the guys from the Diamond Kingdom!

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.170
That means I paid you back 
for fixing my arms!

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.190
I didn't even need to go into battle.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.550
It was far from perfect, 
but well done nonetheless.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.470
Nah, it was nothing!

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.020
Oh, hey, so...

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.730
While we're at it...

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.370
Do you think maybe you 
could heal everyone here?

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.610
Ah...

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.650
That won't be necessary.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.260
What... is thi—

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.390
Noelle!

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:58.600
Blood Creation Magic:
 Fresh Blood Execution Ground.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.990
I'm sure Master and the others are fine.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.250
You're right.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.460
Such an ominous magical power...

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.880
You just showed up outta nowhere, 
and now what the hell are you do—

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.110
Controlling blood. That is my magic.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.260
Ever since I cast that spell on you,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.340
I've been able to manipulate 
your blood as I please.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.620
I am a queen.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.870
Why would I bother granting 
a wish for the likes of you?

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.690
You are the one who will bend to my will.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.640
Blood Magic: Puppet's Blood.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.020
Asta!

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.270
That being said, I can't have you die on me.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.530
I shall heal you, at least.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.030
Blood Recovery Magic: 
Curse-Breaking Blood-Filled Cocoon.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.710
Stay with me, and you can
 rampage all you like.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.440
She's using one high-level 
spell after another!

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.600
It's bone-chilling. This is somehow even 
more terrifying than the spirits' magic!

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.840
So this is the Queen of Witches!

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.110
If I cannot hold the anti-magic 
sword in my own hand,

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.530
I just need to control someone who can.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.490
I've observed how you use it.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:10.630
From now on, you'll spend your life 
in my employ, working as my blade.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.010
Th...

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.430
This can't be...

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.170
The Queen was after the anti-magic 
sword this whole time?!

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.360
Now, for your first task...

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.960
I shall force you to kill everyone 
here with your own two hands.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.760
Kill every last one of them perfectly.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.870
No... way...

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.770
So the Queen of Witches was after 
Asta's anti-magic all along.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.110
This magic... I didn't get this 
old just for show, y'know!

Vanessa! What's that magic of yours?!
