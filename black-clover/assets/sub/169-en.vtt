WEBVTT

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.810
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.310
a devil.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.360
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.710
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.720
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.930
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.800
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.720
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.750
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.300
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.520
After a fierce battle, 
Yami and Asta defeated Dante.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.860
We win!

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.220
But then Zenon attacked, and Yami was 
taken away along with Vangeance.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.360
Captain Yami!

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.040
That night, Asta tried to escape the 
infirmary tower in order to rescue Yami,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.050
and he ran into...

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.510
The Vice Captain of the Black Bulls, Nacht.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.680
If you so desire, I'll show you 
how to use the devil's powers.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.340
Asta arrived with Nacht to an emergency 
Magic Knight Squad Captains' meeting.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980
Who are you?

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.490
He's a vice captain... with the Black Bulls.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.930
He's been acting as a spy 
in the Spade Kingdom,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.740
though I didn't know that 
he was devil-possessed.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.850
Back in the Spade Kingdom, the ritual 
of the advent of Qliphoth was underway.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.920
Once the ritual was complete, this world 
would be connected with the underworld,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.800
and Yami and Vangeance would 
lose their lives as sacrifices.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.350
In three days, the first of seven gates
 to the underworld will open.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.010
They must fight the Dark Triad
 before that can happen.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.870
Then we should also ask the 
Heart Kingdom for help.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.600
Actually, I haven't been able to 
get a hold of them since yesterday.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.360
Meanwhile, it looked as if

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.760
Vanica had destroyed the Heart 
Kingdom with her magic, but...

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.490
You're...

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.210
The Devil-Binding Ritual

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.560
You're...

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.110
The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.350
and the elves from the Third Eye...

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.040
Everyone!

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.840
Where are we?

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.580
This is Elysia.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.590
It's a secluded area in a strong magic region 
located deep within the Heart Kingdom.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.640
This place is overflowing with 
incredibly dense mana.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.040
So they're awake.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.170
Who are these children?

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.330
They are the descendants of 
Princess Tetia of the Clover Kingdom and Licht.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.280
Huh?!

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.030
Back then...

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.840
Lady Tetia...

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.470
She's still alive.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.890
This mana... One of the twins she 
was carrying has also survived!

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.970
I immediately sealed Lady Tetia's wounds

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.850
and rushed to Prince Lumiere's side.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.400
After that...

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.270
When I woke up in the form of a bird,

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.430
many years had passed,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.060
and I had no idea what became of Lady Tetia.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.800
But she survived.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.190
Her life was saved!

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.940
Children born of an elf and a human...

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.570
Prince Lumiere... 
The lives you had hoped for...

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.450
The new world you wished for...
 is right here!

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.370
This is the new village of the elves.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.410
Once we found out about this place,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.950
I felt as though I understood why 
we stayed behind in this era.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.470
Why did you save us?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.020
Because Dryad, the guardian deity of Elysia,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.230
sent a divine revelation telling us to save you.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.240
Dryad?

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.600
After receiving the divine revelation, 
we rushed to the Heart Kingdom,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.910
but we didn't make it in time.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.460
But...

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.300
All of you had somehow used your own 
powers to survive those explosions.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.640
Thanks to you, the citizens of 
the Heart Kingdom were safe.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.580
It's amazing that you weren't annihilated 
when faced with such powerful enemies.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.730
You must've gotten even stronger 
over these past few months.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.060
That's not enough.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.060
I couldn't protect them. 
I couldn't defeat them.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.330
Even though we'd trained for 
months and gotten stronger!

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.830
Now that Loropechika's been kidnapped, 
there's no guarantee she'll remain safe!

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.790
We have to...

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.760
We have to get stronger right now!

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.710
Stronger!

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.880
You're all stronger than we are, aren't you?!

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.260
Tell me how you got so strong!

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.120
Wow... Is that really how you ask 
someone for a favor, Little Miss Royalty?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.090
Do you truly believe you can 
defeat an enemy that you

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.360
couldn't defeat after months of training

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.280
just by training a little more?

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.030
I know it won't be that easy.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.030
But...

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.580
It's even harder to give 
up on becoming stronger!

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.380
Right, you guys?!

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.790
Yes!

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.290
I see.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.130
Jeez! I see you're all 
still a pain in the ass.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.430
Then you will be able to become stronger

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.610
by using the elves' esoteric art,
ultimate magic!

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.850
I'm worried.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.020
I hope Charmy and the others are okay.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.200
Gaja!

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.770
I see... So that's what happened.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.760
We're going to attack the Spade Kingdom 
three days from now, early in the morning.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.130
What will you do?

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.450
We shall fight with you.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.720
All of the Spirit Guardians are safe.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.760
On the honor of the Heart Kingdom,
we will reclaim our queen.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.400
Lady Noelle and the others are also 
getting ready to reenter the battle.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.650
But it will be up to them if 
they can make it in time.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.280
I see. Thank you for contacting us.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.200
I will save you, no matter what.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.400
I will not let him die.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.880
Wait for me, Yami!

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.600
Thank goodness Charmy, 
the other Magic Knights,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.820
and the Spirit Guardians seem to be safe.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.570
I guess Noelle and the others are training!

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.650
I want to train as soon as possible, too!

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.890
Vice Captain!

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.940
H-Huh?

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.610
Vice Captain?

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.890
In three days, we will gather 
the Magic Knights' elite

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.720
and attack the Spade Kingdom.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.200
You're... the Vice Captain 
of the Black Bulls?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.820
Why are you here now?

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.770
Why have you never shown up even once before?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.440
Because I hate the Black Bulls.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.560
I'll do whatever it takes as long as 
I get to operate as a Magic Knight.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.860
It's honestly quite convenient being 
a vice captain. I can do what I want.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.670
I despise people who 
can't do things properly.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.520
The Black Bulls are known as "the squad 
of good-for-nothings with more damage

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.140
than exploits to their name," right?

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.140
It sounds like you were involved 
in the battle six months ago,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.960
but that doesn't exactly erase 
all of your past failures.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.100
The vulgar witch who drinks all the time.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.310
The spatial mage who's so careless with 
women that it interfered with his missions.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.520
The former convict who's a ruined noble.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.030
There's also... Though I don't 
see them here right now,

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.100
the obviously evil-looking 
delinquent peasant,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.260
and the obviously evil-looking, 
belligerent, mask-wearing peasant.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.530
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.210
Though it's clear that 
good-for-nothing assembled you all.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.390
Th-They're all good people!

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.090
P-Please don't just judge 
them by how they look!

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.630
Well, if you don't want to be judged 
by how you look, don't look like that.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.010
When evil-looking people

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.610
or those who have committed evil deeds 
in the past suddenly do something good,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.020
that twist makes them more likable.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.110
And I absolutely hate that.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:24.760
The greatest people are those 
who are good from the start.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.710
In the end, you're nothing more than 
good-for-nothings that Yami gathered.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.890
If you still want to save 
that worthless man's life...

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.880
Get stronger in the next two days.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.890
Hey, I've been wondering. What is this magic?

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.810
It's shadow magic.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.810
I, and whatever I'm touching, 
can move from one shadow to another.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.110
So it's like spatial magic. 
That's super convenient!

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.100
We're here.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.460
What's this place?

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.540
Whose house is this?

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.550
This house belongs to a certain noble.
 A former noble, that is.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.460
We're here.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.470
Here? But there isn't anything...

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.020
Shadow Magic: Dark Garden Invitation.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.690
Now where are we?

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:04.040
For the next two days, I'll teach you all 
I know about using the magic of devils.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.050
And as a result, you'll grow exponentially.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.060
So we're training, then? Heck yeah!

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.790
Currently, you aren't using the 
devil's powers to the fullest extent.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.080
You're just using the power 
that trickles down from the devil.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.940
We are about to perform 
a devil-binding ritual.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.450
You'll make a contract with a devil 
and formally make its power your own.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.570
It's a forbidden ceremony that puts 
a devil's powers at your command.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.830
A devil-binding ritual...

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.830
This ritual will allow you to 
draw out the devil's powers.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.320
This ritual requires a connection to a devil.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:48.290
Usually, you'd use a relic connected 
to the devil, like I have.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.840
This will temporarily allow you 
to summon the devil to our world.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.550
But you're a different story.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.520
Your arm, your grimoire...

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:03.070
Your existence itself has a 
deep connection to the devil.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.320
Got it! So what do I have to do?

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.320
Summon.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.330
What...

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.950
The devil...

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.260
My right arm!

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.840
To think you'd let me out yourself.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.100
Fight the devil... and win.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.320
Use your powers to make 
the devil submit to you.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.570
That's the moment the devil's 
powers will become yours.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.360
It's been a while since I've 
come to the physical world.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.870
Devil... Is that your true form?

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.370
There's something I've been 
meaning to tell you forever.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.120
Thank you!

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.130
Huh?

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:19.300
Your powers helped me out 
time after time in battle.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:40.080
Right here, right now... 
I'm going to surpass my limits!

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.410
This is everything...

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.810
that I've got right now!

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.350
The reason I've been able to fight 
up until now is all thanks to you!

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.010
So seriously, thank you so much!

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.950
Did you seriously just say that to 
the guy who stole your right arm?

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.960
Well, that was the deal!

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.410
I've got no complaints!

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.260
You really are so unbelievably stupid.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.080
And that's exactly why I'm about to kill you.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.080
I can't let you do that!

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.500
And, hey! I just remembered 
our first conversation!

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.260
A little dwarf like you 
has no chance of winning.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.000
But you're short, too!

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.290
No fair acting all giant!

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.680
I don't want to get my butt 
kicked by anyone like that!

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:51.770
You moron. I guess you still don't 
understand the situation you're in.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.650
Demon-Slayer!

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.930
There's no way you're winning this!

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.380
You just walked right into my turf.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.610
This time, it won't just be your right arm.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.380
I'll be taking all of you!

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.650
Hold it, you jerk! I don't 
intend to fight you!

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:23.390
I wanna talk—

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.630
Fight.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.930
You came here to become stronger, didn't you?

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.110
Then defeat him, whatever it takes.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.930
If you lose... the devil 
will take over your body,

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.980
and you'll become a grotesque monster.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.820
All the skulls you see in the altar are 
those who failed the devil-binding ritual.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.660
If you fail, I'll dispose of you and 
add your skull to the collection.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.500
Isn't this... forbidden magic?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.670
Hey, is the devil-binding ritual 
something we shouldn't be doing?!

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.260
We only have two days.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.390
Did you actually think you'd become 
stronger using decent methods?

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.580
This is the world you stepped 
into because you have

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.100
no magic and wanted to become stronger.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.210
What are you doing?

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.110
At this rate, he's going to kill you.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.120
No.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.410
He's not actually trying to kill me.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.620
I can tell from his ki.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.460
What are you talking about? 
The one in front of you is a devil.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.880
Devils don't have any principles.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:46.640
That's right! Every single devil 
out there is a piece of shit!

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.270
This guy isn't like the 
devil I fought before.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.520
I'm gonna steal your body and—

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.980
Just because you're a devil...

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.230
doesn't automatically make you a bad guy!

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.910
Damn it...

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.180
Because...

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.010
You're not a bad guy!

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.550
Petit Clover

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.940
Petit Clover!

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:54.060
Vice Captain

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.350
Vice Captain.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.930
Come to think of it...

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.000
The Black Bulls don't have a vice captain, huh?

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.900
Well, you know how Captain Yami is.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.190
It's gotta be rough being his vice captain.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.320
They'd need to be able to 
keep up with his drinking.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.450
They'd also need to be tolerant enough to 
deal with any of his ridiculous requests.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:19.620
Th-They'd need to be powerful enough 
to keep up with his heroics!

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:25.010
And they need enough patience 
to deal with his long shits.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.000
Man, that's rough.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.870
The Black Bulls...

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.610
I hate them.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.350
In this world where magic is everything,

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.310
there was one boy who couldn't use magic.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:49.740
He never gave up on the future, 
no matter what challenges he faced.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.680
