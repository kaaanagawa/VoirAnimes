00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.150
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.920
We're being led far away

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.230
Until we shatter the road 
between light and darkness

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.730
Yo Guess who's back

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.400
Everybody get down

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.400
Guess who's back

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.030
Hey step up step up!

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.670
Proof of Rightness

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.290
I'm falling down because of a twist of fate

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.440
The harmony we had is in the past

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.970
Still left behind

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.450
The scent of you is stuck in my head

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.260
Can't shake it

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.560
Waiting just isn't enough anymore, Yai yah!

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.410
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.610
As I hold on to my wish

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.600
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.820
The roulette points to tomorrow

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.880
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.200
Let the light shine

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.170
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.250
In the dark maze

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.600
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.420
Hey Guess Who is back!?

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.480
Until we seize the hope in front of us

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.810
To tell you the truth, 
when we were interrogating

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.810
the two Eye of the Midnight Sun members,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.020
they told us one more thing.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.880
Asta, do you remember the stone 
tablet back at their hideout

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.200
when you were taken by them?

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.760
That thing...

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.240
They call the stones that were 
set into it "magic stones."

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.240
They believe that if they 
collect all of them,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.790
they will be reborn into their true forms,

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.960
which are linked closely to mana, 
and gain enormous power.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.380
There are three magic stones left.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.330
They know the location of one of them.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.390
Yeah? And where's that?

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.650
In a strong magic region...

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.980
The Underwater Temple.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.290
So you want us to get there before 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun does

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.480
and snatch the magic stone or whatever?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.680
That's right.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.260
This is an important mission. 
The best squad for the job

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.850
is the one with lots of members who aren't 
restricted by familial or social status...

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.990
Which means your Black Bulls, Yami.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.490
Will you do it?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.500
I dealt with you in the end.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.800
Hopefully, you can pass on now.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.050
Thank you from the bottom of my heart 
for saving our Underwater Temple!

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.430
Thank you! Thank you!

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.890
All right, we'll be taking it.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.510
This concludes our mission.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.440
All of you...

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.730
Well done.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.820
The Black Bulls were given a 
special mission by the Wizard King

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.650
in which they fought hard against a 
terrifying enemy, obtained a magic stone,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.870
and finally returned safely, 
without losing a single member.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.100
Great job, everyone!

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.670
You're the most beat-up of all of us.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.050
I'm so tired...

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.040
Ah, Marie... I'm finally 
back on land where you are.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.180
I'm breathing the same air as Marie now...

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.500
It's munchy time!

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.890
My tummy always has room for fish and meat!

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.940
Nothing beats a drink, or a full 
bottle, after a hard day's work!

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.460
The glory goes to all of 
us Black Bulls, doesn't it?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.570
We'll get a little closer 
to positive stars again.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.960
Maybe we're not a lost cause after all!

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.640
I say we might be getting closer,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.080
but we're clearly still below 
every other Magic Knight squad.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.750
Hey, look.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.530
Oh, yeah. I forgot he wasn't with us.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.590
Gordon... I totally forgot about him.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.280
Welcome back. I was so lonely...

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.190
Hey, someone go talk to him.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.410
You guys are so mean.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.770
Is he sad?

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.490
I can't believe you left me behind.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.790
Nah, I think he's pissed. 
He's, like, mumbling something.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.450
I wanted to go, too.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.520
I was looking forward to going so much.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.580
Isn't he always mumbling?

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.520
No idea... I have no idea what he's thinking.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.550
I even bought sunscreen and a parasol.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.210
And you left me behind...

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.550
I wanted to help at the Underwater Temple.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.100
I wanted to fight alongside everyone else...

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.960
Gordon Agrippa.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.290
He's a loner who just wants friends, 
but he can't seem to make any.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.310
No one even brought any gifts...

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.810
Tell me what happened at the Underwater Temple.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.900
I want to know what you all did.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.740
I want to record everything...

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.860
Well, I'm not looking forward to this, 
but I'm gonna go report to the Wizard King.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.100
Charmy, you're coming 
with me. Bring the prisoners.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.050
Will there be yummy food?!

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.100
Nope.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.770
Finral, transport us there.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.980
Will there be pretty girls?!

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.200
Nope.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.230
D'oh.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.430
Marie's an angel!

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.490
I-I wanna go, too! Please, sir, please!

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.950
You sure are full of energy.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.700
Hey, you need to get plenty 
of rest so you can heal up.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.750
N-Not that I'm worried about you!
 Don't get the wrong idea!

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.750
What's the big idea, Noelle?!

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.010
You are pretty hurt. Just stay put, kid.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.770
Or so I'd like to say,

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.810
but I guess you were with me when the 
Wizard King gave us this mission.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.470
Fine, come with.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.720
Yes, sir!

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.600
Everyone else, make sure
you get some rest...

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.360
Yeah, guess I don't need to tell you that.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.710
Take care.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.980
You coming, too, Nero?

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.120
Come to think of it...

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.710
Didn't that thing you found at Saussy Village
 sorta look like a magic stone?

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.710
Asta!

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.710
Coming!

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.040
We're going! Hurry it up.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.840
Quit wastin' time!

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.550
Sorry!

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.580
Man, this place is as stupidly huge as ever!

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.060
Shut up.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.080
Good work, Finral.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.740
Huh?

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.250
You can go play until we come back.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.040
What?! No fair!

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.050
I wanna meet the Wizard King, too!

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.880
I really am nothing but your ride now!

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.250
But then again, it'd be more fun to go

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.520
flirt with girls in the capital 
than to see the Wizard King.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.830
See ya, guys!

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.950
Wait for me, cuties!

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.250
I see.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.850
He was a member of the 
Third Eye, the strongest of

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.420
the Eye of the Midnight Sun, then?

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.130
His name was Vetto the Despair.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.650
Despair, eh?

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.250
We'll send his corpse in for an autopsy

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.040
I can't move! Let us go!

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.770
and interrogate the other 
Eye of the Midnight Sun members.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.770
Let us out!

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.190
Got it.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.630
Your binding spell is fantastic.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.480
That fluff is superb.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.150
Who are you?

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.490
By the way, Yami, is this 
little one your child?

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.440
When did you end up with a kid this big?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.420
She's not.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.350
Gimme something yummy.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.770
But anyway...

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.810
La!

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.790
Safe!

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.410
Here's the magic stone.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.000
Well done, indeed.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:15.470
I'm sure you've heard, but many lost 
their lives fighting at Raquey.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.100
This should help them rest in peace.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.920
The Black Bulls accomplished 
this very important mission

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.310
without losing a single member.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.860
Absolutely brilliant.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.610
It seems that you've also grown stronger,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.140
Yami.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.600
I heard he made that 
foreigner a Magic Knight.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.860
What's Captain Julius thinking?

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.490
You're going to make someone like 
that a Magic Knights Squad Captain?!

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.590
Are you insane, Wizard King?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.750
Aren't you a little too 
happy-go-lucky, mister?

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:07.730
You've truly become a magnificent 
Magic Knights Captain, Yami.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.150
Cut it out. I'm 28 now, you know? 
You're embarrassing me.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.650
Oh, sorry about that.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.340
"If you want to say you're right,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.790
then prove it with the results you 
get from doing things your way."

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.250
That's what you told me, Julius.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.300
I've said this before, but all I did

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.990
was prove that you were right.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.640
And these guys, my Magic Knights...

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.230
Ow!

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.580
...proved that I was right.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.080
Yeah...

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.400
Asta, you've earned another achievement.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.790
You're another step closer 
to becoming the Wizard King.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.590
I look forward to seeing what you do next.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.910
Yes, sir!

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:10.010
U-Um, Wizard King, sir, I have a r-request.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.280
What is it?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.920
U-Um, well...

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.260
C-Could I have your autograph?!

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.680
Sure, I'll write it right on your face.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.960
Please, no!

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.640
You jerk. Get nervous around me, too!

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.370
I do! I do!

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.850
I'm sorry to interrupt, Wizard King.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.810
Mushroom Head.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.440
Who are you calling "Mushroom Head"?!

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.430
No, now's not the time for that!

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:34.980
What's the matter, Marx?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.310
The border town of Kiten, which has a history 
of skirmishes with the Diamond Kingdom,

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.620
is under attack by a 
Diamond Kingdom squad.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.660
They couldn't have chosen a worse time.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.130
This is...

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.910
Wh-What's with that massive horde of people?!

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.570
This looks like a bit more 
than their usual harassment.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.530
Not to mention the ones leading this army...

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.320
Yes, sir. We believe they're Lagus,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.780
Brocks,

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.740
and Yagos.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.570
Three of the Eight Shining Generals.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.280
What are the Eight Shining Generals?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.040
The eight strongest from the Diamond Kingdom.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.420
What?!

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.930
They're similar to the Magic Knights 
Captains of the Clover Kingdom.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.010
That's super bad news!

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:49.580
Clover Kingdom

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:49.580
Kiten

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:49.580
Diamond Kingdom

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.730
This isn't good. Kiten is the 
cornerstone of our border defense.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.560
It'll be easier for the Diamond Kingdom
to invade if they take it.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.520
The time has come.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.770
The Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals
Lagus

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.770
The history of the Diamond Kingdom 
will finally move forward.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:02.400
The Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals
<font size="30">Yagos</c>

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.400
It's been so long since my last battle!
I can barely contain myself!

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:10.620
The Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals
<font size="30">Brocks</c>

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.620
Those Clover Kingdom weaklings! 
I'll crush them all!

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.370
It appears that our intel about their 
border defense being weakened due to

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.880
their struggles with a terrorist group

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.800
called the Eye of the Midnight Sun was correct.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.950
If we can conquer Kiten, it'll immediately 
give our forces the advantage!

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.810
I can't wait!

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.630
Besides, that location is 
packed with resources.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.640
They're wasted on the likes of the Clovers.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.320
The Diamond Kingdom is attacking!

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.100
In the name of the Magic Knights, 
do not allow them to invade!

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.650
Yeah!

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.030
Activate the magical barrier!

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.470
That's a magical barrier built with 
the power of fifty Magic Knights!

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.550
They won't be able to 
break through that easily!

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.160
And this barrier doesn't allow 
attacks from the outside in,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.140
but will let spells from the inside out.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.370
First, we'll attack that 
lightning magic user,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.890
one of the Eight Shining Generals, Lagus!

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.390
Concentrate all your attacks on him!

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.150
Such pathetic and ugly magic.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.120
Watch carefully. <i>This</i> is how you use magic.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.630
Lightning Creation Magic: Thunderbird 
Warrior Air-Splitting Magic Bow!

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.300
All right! Now we charge!

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.340
Don't break formation.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.570
Stay in squads of ten.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.730
Defense mages, activate barrier spells 
and watch out for long-range magic.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:12.530
Yes, sir!

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.630
Close-range and mid-range attack mages,

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.210
scout for enemies and let 
your magic charge up.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.040
Yes, sir!

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.060
Long-range attack mages,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.920
keep up a barrage of spells with low magic 
consumption to throw them into confusion!

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.810
Yes, sir!

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.880
And then—

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.050
Go!

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.110
Red Clay Creation Magic: 
Raging Great Boar Charge!

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.270
Long live the Diamond Kingdom!

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.810
Curse that Brocks! I was still talking!

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.330
What kind of general charges in personally?

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.450
Also, you should be flying.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.560
Oh, well. This is nothing new.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.300
There was very little beauty in it,

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.910
but he was trying to use that 
attack to make them cower in fear.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.150
Yagos, we're going after him.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.850
I-It's no use! They're just too powerful!

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.850
Well, that ain't good.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.150
The Magic Knights charged 
with defending Kiten

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.190
have mostly been wiped out.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.880
That's—

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.210
What? What is it, Mushroom Head?

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.830
It's them.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.080
The Clover Kingdom's most
powerful Magic Knights Squad.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.770
The Golden Dawn!

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.550
All right, everyone. Let's ask our 
rude guests to take their leave.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.120
Yuno!

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.800
My meal-saving prince?!

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.670
Weak! Too weak!

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.560
Where are the Magic Knights Captains?!
You're all worthless!

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.770
A message for the generals!

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.140
It appears the Clover Kingdom's 
reinforcements have arrived!

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.590
The only enemy is the 
members of the Golden Dawn!

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.470
I repeat, the only enemy is 
the members of the Golden Dawn!

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:18.810
Idiots! Do they think they can 
stop us with just one squad?!

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.750
They're all fools!

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.690
Blocking my way? You've got some guts!

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:33.090
You fool! I'll blast you to bits!

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.590
Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.110
Who's blasting whom to bits?

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.230
Well, look at you, acting all cool.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.900
Use my powers, too!

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.370
Listen, the reason you 
can't make any friends is

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:02.200
Wind Spirit
Bell

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.030
because you put on airs like that!

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.200
Why don't you try putting on a breezy 
smile once in a while, Yuno?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.260
Breezy? Not happening.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.770
Hey... What do you mean by "not happening"?

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.280
I'm one of the Four Great 
Nature Spirits! Don't ignore me!

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.880
Say something, dang it!

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.870
"Something."

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.530
"Something"?!

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.640
You'll never be able to make 
friends like that, you sourpuss!

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:26.040
But don't you worry. 
I'll be staying with you forever!

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.270
Aren't you lucky?

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:32.530
Okay, let's hurry up and take care 
of those guys and go on a date, Yuno!

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.070
Nope.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.620
How dare you refuse a date 
with me?! Unbelievable!

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.900
Hey!

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.000
Looks like at least one of you has a spine!

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.020
My meal-saving prince!

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.430
So that's the Wind Spirit? 
I want to see her in person!

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.140
Looks like you've gotten even stronger, Yuno.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.140
Damn, Yuno!

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.580
The Golden Dawn rushed to the scene,

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.070
but they're up against three of the 
Eight Shining Generals and that many troops.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.260
I'd like to send reinforcements,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.670
but the only ones who can 
head there immediately are...

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:39.020
The Crimson Lion Kings went to the 
Ioto Mountain Range on another mission.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.500
The Silver Eagles are tied up 
with the Spade Kingdom...

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.430
You want me to go, Julius?

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.480
I'm pretty sure Finral's been there before,
so we can go immediately.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.980
Are you sure, Yami? You just returned 
from the Underwater Temple.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.580
Sure. I'm pretty invincible right now anyway,

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.490
and...

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.740
There's a guy I'm a little concerned about.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.930
I'd feel better if you were to go.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.660
I'd like to go, but...

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.410
We need you here, Wizard King.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.040
If this is a feint, their next 
target will be the royal capital.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.050
What he said. I can't just leave.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.370
Besides, the king is here.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.050
All right, then...

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:28.170
Shit. I should've had Finral 
come up here with us.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.850
That useless bastard.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.900
I wonder if someone's talking about me.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.640
Cuties spotted!

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.760
Hey there, you beauties who 
put flowers to shame...

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.740
Are you busy?

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.370
Captain Yami!

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.940
Take me with you!

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.380
With your arm like that?

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.420
There must be people who couldn't get 
away! I'm sure I can do something!

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.420
I'd like him to get experience on that 
kind of battlefield, but right now...

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:00.850
No.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.210
Someone who's as beat up as you 
will just get in the way. Go home.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.260
But...

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.700
As his senior, I'll go along and protect him.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.360
Miz Charmy...

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.810
That makes it all right, doesn't it?

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.320
You two! Especially you, Charmy...

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.250
Oh, fine. Come with me, you dumbasses!

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.720
Let's go get Finral!

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.610
Roger that, sir!

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.570
La, sir!

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.740
Now I can see my meal-saving prince!

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.250
Just you wait, Yuno!

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.010
Wow, that's amazing. It's in pieces.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.160
He'll get even stronger.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.990
I guess I wouldn't expect any 
less from our genius, Yuno,

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.980
who became one of our best knights 
less than a year after joining.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.440
Well, shall we, Langris?

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.490
Yes, sir.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.230
Let's make them regret barging into 
our country with their muddy boots.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.370
4 AM in the morning

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.740
Why can't I sleep?

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.340
On such a bad day, whispering 
"Bye Bye Black Birds"

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.840
Won't make my anxiety go away

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.870
for hours, lately

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.390
I've been crying for hours Baby

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.950
I wish you were here

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:42.480
All those letters that you gave to me

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.360
Every time I read them again, the pain's gone

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:54.490
We're not alone, cause we're perfect as four

00:21:54.490 --> 00:22:00.500
Even though we're far apart, 
we're connected, believing you

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:06.630
I always feel you next to me

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.730
closer to me and a "clover" for you

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.400
I wish you the best of luck

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:18.980
You know you're not alone, 
cause we're perfect as four

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:25.190
Even though we're far apart, 
we're connected, you live in me

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:31.440
I'll always be by your side

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.120
closer to me and a "clover" for you

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.820
I wish you the best of luck

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.420
Petit Clover

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.580
Petit Clover!

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.930
Promise!

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.630
Promise!

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.560
It's been a while, Yuno! 
Looks like you've gotten even stronger!

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.600
Of course. I'm going to 
become stronger than anyone.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:06.440
Do you remember our promise? About seeing 
who can become the Wizard King first?

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.610
Promise? I've forgotten about the past.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.400
Why are you trying to act so cool?

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.240
So, uh, what're you doing tomorrow?
You got work?

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.210
Tomorrow? Who knows what tomorrow brings?

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.880
Seriously, why are you trying 
to act so cool, Yuno?!

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.890
Yuno? Is that my name?

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.670
I don't know anything! 
This can't be happening!

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.090
So you weren't just trying to 
act cool?! Get a grip, Yuno!

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:37.320
The super fun anime, <i>Black Clover</i>! 
We hope you guys keep watching!

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.890
The Diamonds are attacking?

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:46.360
The Golden Dawn is on the job? 
Then let's just leave it to them!

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.990

 Whoever's Strongest Wins

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.820
What? Asta's headed there, too?
Well, that's worrying.
