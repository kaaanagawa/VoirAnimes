WEBVTT

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.940
What in the world is that creature?!

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.370
R-Run!

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.080
Where are we supposed to run?!

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.870
Oh, God...

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.970
It's the end of the world.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.480
It appeared as though the world 
would be destroyed by the demon.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.990
But a single mage...

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.010
Lumiere...

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.370
Please kill me!

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.370
I finally understand...

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.210
why I was born with so much...

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.980
magical power.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.500
I will not let you...

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.960
become a murderer!

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.700
A Reunion Across Time and Space

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.780
That's...

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.890
The prince!

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.500
Prince Lumiere!

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.420
They used a magic item that I created

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.650
to steal the elves' magic...

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.210
It was supposed to be used so 
that we can all share magic.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.420
Prince... Lady Tetia... What should I...

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.210
Is there still something I can do?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.210
What were you even trying to do?

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.180
How annoying.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.920
Wouldn't you have been better off 
just giving me that body of yours?

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.370
Of course, if I had taken over your body,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.920
that light magic would've 
been absolutely useless.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.430
But at this rate...

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.850
Everything will soon be gone!

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.600
The magic stones are amplifying his magic.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.500
Even if I stop him, the kingdom will be...

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.120
Can I even stop him?

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.940
My prince!

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.450
Our magic item! The one we 
made for equality and peace!

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.130
Of course!

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.980
I'll use the magic item we created...

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.460
and absorb his magic!

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.970
Did that work?

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.230
As I suspected... It's impossible 
for it to absorb all of the magic!

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.890
He stopped...

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.990
The negative mana seems to be subsiding.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.250
Lumi...ere...

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.150
Lumiere...

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.450
Soon, I'll marry Tetia and become your brother.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.500
I'm sure there will be humans 
who look down upon that.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.870
You're probably right.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.010
But with you...

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.940
I'll be able to create a 
peaceful and equal world.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.640
I truly believe that.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.660
I believe that, too.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.990
I'm sure...

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.550
...it was fate that brought us together.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.690
Now's your chance.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.090
Hurry...

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.710
Licht...

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.550
You are the future we believed in.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.020
You are hope.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.180
I... will stop you!

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.650
He defeated that monster!

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.450
The prince saved our kingdom!

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.230
He's our savior!

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.010
You stopped me from obtaining his body,

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.170
but that was still quite 
an entertaining show.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.770
I guess I'll just have to take 
his grimoire for the time being.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.940
Stop!

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.760
I won't let you have Licht's grimoire!

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.510
The magic stones...

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.200
You witnessed the end of that elf, didn't you?

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.290
If a human like yourself who isn't 
loved by mana tried to use those,

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.690
you wouldn't be able to keep

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.540
your form even if you tried to 
perform a puny little spell.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.530
Like I care. I'm going to use the 
magic stones to increase my magic.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.280
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.300
This is...

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.290
Confinement magic, eh?

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.620
This girl isn't even concerned about 
the effects of using forbidden magic.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.850
Her seal is a bit vexing,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.640
but I'll be able to use reincarnation 
with the magic stones.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.800
In that case...

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.810
"Come."

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.560
What?

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.550
Even more despair and tragedy for 
the soul who possesses the four-leaf.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.890
I guess I'll just have to 
sow those seeds for him.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.320
Forbidden Magic: Noad Nepesh.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.970
I'll be sure to work slower and 
much more carefully next time.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.080
In an era where you two don't exist.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.180
Secré!

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.850
Are you all right?

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.720
My prince!

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.100
So you managed to seal the devil.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.770
But the seal that I put on 
the devil will eventually...

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.860
Prince!

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.360
No...

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.870
This is how it should be.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.670
I was able to keep my promise to Licht.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.370
So...

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.380
My prince, I'm going to use 
the magic stones to seal you.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.790
It probably won't be complete, but it 
should be enough to keep you alive.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.380
If the devil's seal is broken,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.120
the peaceful future we sought 
will be taken away from us.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.490
Secré, don't. If you use 
any more forbidden magic,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.150
you'll lose your humanity.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.350
I cannot let you die here, Your Highness.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.020
As Licht said, you are our hope for the future.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.040
Several Years Later

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.300
The prince began his long 
slumber in the form of a statue,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.770
and for some reason, I turned into a bird.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.560
I've been spared? But in this form...

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.660
I'll need the help of the future mages.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.560
Five hundred years ago, I was 
excluded from the natural realm.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.640
I started preparing for the day that 
the devil's seal would be broken

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.950
as I watched over Licht's 
five-leaf grimoire.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.950
And the one who ended up with that grimoire...

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.890
was a boy who was born without magic.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.470
There was a sign that things were in motion,

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.670
but once the wheel started turning,
 it proceeded quickly.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.420
And finally, that day has come.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.930
Today, we put an end to this long fight!

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.020
There you are, you creepy bastard!

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.990
Well, well... To think you were 
able to undo his dark elf form.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.360
I have no interest in toys 
I'm done playing with, though.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.020
I'm surprised this anti-magic

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.970
was able to undo this spell that 
craves the life of whoever it touches.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.780
It's far more annoying than 
I could've ever imagined.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.000
It's been five hundred years 
since we last met, devil!

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.900
Unbelievable! To think I'd also 
be reuniting with you two.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.710
Wait, Yuno, is that...

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.900
Yeah...

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.400
The legendary first Wizard King?

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.820
Are you the real deal?!

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.730
But wait, you can move?! 
Wait, what the heck is going on?!

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.240
Calm down, Asta.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.990
Now's really not the time for that.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.830
Wh-What?!

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.610
Who are they?

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.010
An elf revived by forbidden magic

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.860
and Magic Knights from 
this era who helped with

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.300
gathering the magic stones 
and protecting the kingdom.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.470
That lady's ki seems kinda familiar.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.060
Prince, we need to help Licht first.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:17.410
Probably due to the forbidden spell, 
he was reincarnated with his soul intact.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.550
His soul is indeed here, 
but he's not fully awakened.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.740
Licht... Will you be able to wake him up?

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.860
Leave it to me.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.870
Once, my magic could only 
open and close things.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.370
But after spending time with the prince,

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.640
it started to evolve as we 
pursued further opportunities.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.880
The prince was a genius at figuring 
out the best potential for my magic.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.130
My sealing magic in its current 
state can release any seal!

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.100
Licht...

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.370
I can finally say

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.070
the words I wasn't able to say back then.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.220
Thank you, Lumiere.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.250
Well, it's a good thing you 
made it in time in this era.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.880
You had a rather unfortunate 
farewell five hundred years ago.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.880
This time, I'll get rid of both of you at once.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.640
Licht...

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:37.360
Patry, I saw everything from 
within my soul's deep slumber.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.640
Licht, I...

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.940
Five hundred years ago, we lost
 to this devil's scheme.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.190
While I was drowning in despair,

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.040
the one who kept me from hurting 
even more innocent people

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.370
and causing even more despair

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.950
was Lumiere.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.700
Regardless of how it was done,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.970
it appears that someone came to stop you, too.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.480
Patry, even though you believed the 
blade you wielded was for justice,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.010
for those who were struck by your blade,
 it was an unforgivable crime.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.670
Still, even if you cannot be forgiven,

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.710
let me just say this...

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.310
I know you did your best.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.900
Licht...

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.110
What we can do right now

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.810
is fight against the next tragedy

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.370
that's about to occur without letting 
our mistakes break our spirits.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.290
Let us finally put an end 
to our five hundred years.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.660
Yes, indeed.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.390
I'll swallow up your trivial little feelings,
 and that'll be the end of it.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.420
Light Magic: Mana Zone...

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.920
Lamp of Avior-Gloria.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.180
Sword Magic: Origin Flash-Rampage.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:11.530
They managed to blow apart my magic, 
which devours this world's magic.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.860
The one who used the most forbidden spell,

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.240
and the one who absorbed all his magic...

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.220
In other words, they've been 
affected by </i>that<i> world.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.590
They're fast!

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.510
H-Holy crap...

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.310
If our attacks continue at
 this speed and power...

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.940
He won't be able to counter 
with his word soul magic.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.780
They did it!

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.030
Douve Nuutra Edde!

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:08.500
My prince!

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.540
Lumiere!

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.880
That spear... It breaks down spells.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.970
I commend you for being able 
to attack me this much.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.140
But no matter how powerful you may be,

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.310
you will not be able to kill me now 
that I have my body and grimoire!

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.940
Not happening!

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.270
Anti-magic?

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:32.740
As I thought...

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.070
Maybe with anti-magic...

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.100
This spear can break down 
anything it touches, but he...

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.160
But alone, he's nothing to fear.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.660
"Get back."

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.970
"Storm of Blades."

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.060
Thanks, everyone!

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.270
His magic is overwhelmingly vast...

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.930
But it doesn't feel oppressive at all.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.340
It's like a well-honed blade.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.060
So this is the awakened elf leader.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:12.070
But what is this warm and nostalgic 
feeling that seems to be embracing me?

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.090
My prince! Your arm!

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.570
I will close the wound and seal the damage.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.570
Sealing Magic: Closed Sorrow.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.240
Thanks, Secré.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.970
That's so freakin' cool!

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.820
As I'd expect from a friend 
of the first Wizard King!

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:33.350
But, uh... Somehow, I don't feel like 
this is the first time we're meeting.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.300
Hrm...

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.960
Like, your ki, your atmosphere,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.260
and your eyes really remind 
me of someone I know...

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.560
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! What's 
the big idea?! Ow, ow, ow!

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.270
Focus on the fight.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.560
That ability of yours is rather convenient.
 It did manage to seal me, after all.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.750
For magic of this world, which is 
like a weed and not even powerful

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.440
like four-leaf magic, that is.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.410
Though now that I have my body, 
it's just stunted and worthless magic.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.900
Be quiet.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.220
My prince managed to find 
possibilities even in magic like mine.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.500
He showed me that there was 
something even I could do!

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.390
I have a four-leaf grimoire and light magic,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.570
so people say that my magic is amazing,

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:21.180
but I just think we're all different, 
and we're all pretty amazing.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.120
But my magic can only open and close things.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.600
It's practically useless.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.150
What did I tell you?

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.220
I'm sure there are plenty of 
uses for your sealing magic

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.570
that you haven't discovered yet.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.440
There are opportunities for everyone, 
and things that only they can do.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.990
Something only I can do?

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.360
Just like the magic items 
we're making right now...

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.690
If everyone tried to use 
their powers for everyone,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.610
I think this would be a wonderful kingdom.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.070
You exist only to steal from others!

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.520
The ones you looked down on, 
stomped on, and made a mockery of

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.300
are going to defeat you today!

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.130
Then you should probably hurry it up.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.890
No matter how much you blow away this magic,

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.140
it will keep flowing until you defeat me.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.190
Since the exit is on this top floor,

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.340
all of your friends in the lower levels

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.330
will be swallowed up and die 
if you keep wasting time.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.690
You bastard!

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.470
But even Licht and Lumiere's 
magic wasn't able to defeat him.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.780
Anything but a full-fledged attack 
on our part will be useless.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.090
But of course.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.380
We will rid this place of this accursed magic

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.790
with a mighty blow made with 
the help of our friends.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.040
Licht!

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.790
I'll be borrowing your strength.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.050
Tch. This seemed like 
a good idea at the time.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.090
Hey, you're far too close to me, human.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.940
Can't you make this space wider?

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.070
Are you being serious right now?

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.380
I just saved your ass, 
and that's how you thank me?

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.490
You're totally still the Prickly Queen, 
despite being someone else inside.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.980
Damn it. At this rate, it's just going to

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.070
chip away at my magic until it's all gone.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.300
The only bright side to all this

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.870
is the fact that you can use 
recovery magic. Damn it...

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.250
You have some nerve. And when I 
was kind enough to heal you...

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.070
Wait, uh... Why the hell are you shining?

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.710
You're blinding me!

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.260
This is...

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.150
That's what you get for
 wasting my precious food!

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.510
Behold the power of appetite!

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.360
Licht...

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.750
And now, you will face the 
true wrath of the elves.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:57.710
Ultimate Sword Magic: Demon-Dweller 
Sword-Conquering Eon!

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.590
Holy crap!

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.860
His magic is on a completely 
different level.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.620
We did it.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.830
You're so amazing, Licht!

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.190
That's... the devil's heart?

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.670
"Heal."

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:59.940
I told you! You cannot kill me.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.440
Not with magic from this world.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.970
He can still regenerate, 
despite how powerful that spell was?

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.200
How are we supposed to...

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.950
That's the true power of that sword.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.330
Is there still some power I haven't 
unlocked in my own sword?

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.220
There might still be a possibility!

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.660
I couldn't erase that spear, 
but I was able to block it!

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:29.210
In that case, it's just that my anti-magic 
was weak, but it was still effective!

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.720
If I can fight like them...

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.170
There's a power I can use 
because I've got no magic!

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.940
I have no magic.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.190
But that's exactly why there's 
a power only I can use!

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.400
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.400

 The Final Attack

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.490
Yuno! Let's shut that guy up together!
