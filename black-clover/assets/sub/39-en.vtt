00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.200
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.510
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.870
The Eye of the Midnight Sun 
is led by a man named Licht,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.530
who owns a four-leaf grimoire.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.680
They are a terrorist group he formed 
six years ago, and they hold

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.800
a grudge against the Clover Kingdom.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.320
They have about fifty mages who are members.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.200
Among them are their leader, Licht,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.010
as well as the three they call the 
Third Eye: Raia, Vetto, and Fana.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.030
They are much stronger 
than the other members.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.470
They all hold a strong grudge 
against the Clover Kingdom,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.050
and they use that to justify 
their terrorist attacks.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.960
Their endgame is to have an 
independent country of their own.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.300
That about covers everything, doesn't it?

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.200
Yes.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.680
And this is the most important 
bit of information...

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.300
I've learned that there 
is a traitor among you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.560
who is working with the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.230
What?! Among the c-c-captains?!

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.900
I knew it.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400
Who could it be?

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.410
Because of you, Captain Fuegoleon was...

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.920
Why?! Why would you betray us?!

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.850
Three-Leaf Salute

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.150
Now, would you kindly tell me

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.930
which one of these captains is the traitor 
who aided the Eye of the Midnight Sun?

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.520
Tell me their name.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.160
It's...

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.740
The captain of the Purple Orcas,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.010
Gueldre Poizot.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.280
Impossible! What are you talking about?

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.560
Th-They're terrorists that 
attacked our beloved nation!

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.700
You'd actually believe what they're saying?

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.170
As if I would ever betray the Clover Kingdom!

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.090
I'd rather not say this,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.650
but I've heard a few dark rumors about you.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.430
It's not just a few. We've heard many.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.390
Wh-What? Really?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.540
Come to think of it, I've heard 
plenty of rumors like that.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.210
Apparently, they weren't all false.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.650
I knew you were probably up to 
something sketchy, but this is just...

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.280
Don't be ridiculous! Th-This 
must be some kind of mistake!

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.790
I know! They're trying 
to frame me as a traitor!

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.960
They're only telling me what 
they know, plain and simple.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.780
Information obtained with 
my memory exchange magic

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.670
is absolute.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.260
You heard him, Hard Ham.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.970
I'm not hard!

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.120
Just calm down.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.390
Why not just let the guy with the 
bowl cut look at your memories?

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.400
If you're really a clean ham, that is.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.490
I agree with everything other 
than what you called me.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.490
If you're truly innocent, you should.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.780
W-Well, I...

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.040
What? Are you embarrassed?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.730
You a teenage boy or something?

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.490
You're behaving shamefully, Gueldre.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.620
You will pay for betraying 
the kingdom with your death.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.300
So it really is you.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.420
Because of you, Captain Fuegoleon was...

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.420
No! This is some sort of trap!

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.090
I'll clear my name! 
This is a strategic retreat!

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.520
Transparency Creation Magic: 
Invisible Great Mage!

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.270
He disappeared?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.390
He's actually trying to get away?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.530
Well, this just got real.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.570
This isn't good. His transparency magic

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.200
makes him vanish for a set amount of time, 
and all spells will go right through him.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.500
Meaning while he's invisible, 
our attacks won't do a thing.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.210
What?! But that makes him invincible!

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.590
Transparency Creation Magic:
Invisible Troops.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.340
Hold them back for me!

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.100
We can't just let him get away!

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.880
Dorothy, this is no time to be sleeping!

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.200
What are we going to do? We can't 
catch him if we can't see him.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.410
Yami.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.460
There's nothing to worry about.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.350
I'm not going to get caught 
by the likes of you!

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.410
My magic is invincible!

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.510
I used this power to claw my way up to 
the position of Magic Knights Captain!

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.800
Then I accumulated a fortune through 
business and became a wealthy merchant.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.340
I am a great mage who has 
both wealth and power!

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.480
I won't let it end here!

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.760
I will rise again and again with this 
magic and my business talent!

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.910
You're right there!

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.250
Wh-What?!

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.240
Y-You shouldn't have been able to see me!

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.760
How?! How were you able to attack me?!

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:35.210
Hard Ham is able to hide his 
magical powers, but not his ki.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.270
And since the anti-magic sword 
isn't magical, it'll work against him.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:47.020
Looks like an anti-magic kid who can read 
ki ended up being his natural enemy.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.830
Don't mock me! I'm a captain!

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.410
You magicless peasant!

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.970
You look better when you're 
groveling on the ground!

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.130
Not yet!

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.300
I'm not letting you get away!

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.030
The Magic Knights Captains 
that I admire so much

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.230
wouldn't run away over something like this!

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.480
Very well. If you want to die that badly...

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.110
I shall grant your wish for you!

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.480
Mr. Poizot.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.070
Hold still a sec.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.140
Picture Magic: Spring of Restriction.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.080
Ah, yes, Mr. Poizot, you're
a picture-perfect fellow.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.110
I think I'll call this...

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.480
<i>The Drowning Captain</i>.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.360
What do you think?

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.900
What is this magic?

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.120
Rill, how dare you go easy on him?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.710
Well, I mean, if I hadn't done that,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.120
this building would've been destroyed.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.780
His magic allows all magic 
to pass through him.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.920
In that case, we can simply 
attack using physical objects.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.430
We'll just have some commoners 
rebuild the building.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.430
I lost the chance to let loose on a captain.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.440
The guy resembles a ham exactly, 
so he would've been perfect to slice up.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:53.970
We're Magic Knight Captains. 
We can't just sit around and space out.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.180
We have to at least strike a pose.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.700
Are you still asleep?!

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.930
Actually, you still managed to keep up...

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.180
You sure are reliable for 
someone who's always asleep!

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.340
Running away, even though 
you're a man. How pathetic.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.090
Even if you weren't a traitor, 
you'd still be a failure as a captain.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.230
Wh-Why is Yami only paying 
attention to Dorothy?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.590
Does he like women like her?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.600
Friends, I believe that's enough.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.850
Someone may be controlling him with magic.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.480
Wow, I'm glad I said that 
when everyone was here.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.480
I can't tone down my magic, after all.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.170
These people are insane!

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.990
These are the best Magic Knights... 
the best in the country?!

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.990
Hey! You were amazing earlier!

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.560
How did you know where Mr. Poizot was?

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.620
How'd you undo his transparency magic?!

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.410
U-Um...

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.130
Well, whatever. I'm Rill,
and I'm nineteen! Who are you?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.290
I-I'm Asta, and I'm fifteen. 
Wait, you're nineteen and a captain?!

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.090
Ah, so you're younger than me!
Hey, Asta, be my friend!

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.890
Wait, with a captain? Uh...

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.100
Well, sure! Okay!

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.380
Yay! Just between you and me,

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.100
everyone here's way older than me, so it's 
been rough having to tiptoe around them!

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.200
I see! And they're all weirdos, too!

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.440
Hey, you jerks. I can hear you.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.450
Also, <i>you're</i> the weirdos here.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.870
Now, then...

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.950
I have some questions for you,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.870
Gueldre.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.880
Gueldre, everything you've 
said so far is true?

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.340
Yes.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.680
Man, that's quite the list.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.960
Abusing his own squad members,

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.480
embezzling funds, selling national 
treasure-class magic items

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.750
on the black market...

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.670
And smuggling dangerous magic 
potions from other countries.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.070
He's already pitch-black 
before even being a traitor.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.330
He might be a good fit for the Black Bulls.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.670
Actually, becoming a burnt-black 
ham sounds better for him.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.700
What are you even going on about?

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.080
So this is why he didn't want 
his memory read with magic.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.870
Most important of all... 
Kidnapping barrier mages.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.210
That's direct cooperation with 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.080
That's solid proof of how they managed 
to infiltrate the royal capital.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.140
He was dazzled by rare magic items and 
made a deal with those terrorists.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.390
What a fool.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.230
Well, unfortunately,
he's always been like that.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:40.730
The Eye of the Midnight Sun has probably 
killed the kidnapped barrier mages already.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.490
This is an unparalleled blunder.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.760
He was a Magic Knight,
charged with protecting our citizens,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.990
yet he sold them out instead.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.930
In order to keep the citizens 
from growing uneasy,

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.370
we won't make this a public matter.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.670
But to ensure that this never happens again,

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.160
check all of your squad members to make 
sure no one has ties to the enemy.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.340
Yes, sir!

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.470
Well, well...

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.370
I'm a pretty decent actor.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.110
No one can see through my 
copy transformation magic.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.570
So which one of them was actually me?

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.490
Now nobody's going to be 
suspicious for a while.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.170
I'm sorry for making you two stay behind.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:45.150
It's sad... being betrayed by 
comrades who fought alongside me.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.650
I sprinted at full speed to get where I am,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.910
but as a result, I may have 
made a lot of mistakes.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.180
If that's the reason you had us stay behind,

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.020
you picked the wrong guys, Julius.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.940
To tell you the truth, 
when we were interrogating

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.760
the two Eye of the Midnight Sun members,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.990
they told us one more thing.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.780
Asta, do you remember the stone 
tablet back at their hideout

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.160
when you were taken by them?

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.740
That thing...

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.170
They call the stones that were 
set into it "magic stones."

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.670
They believe that if they 
collect all of them,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.750
they will be reborn into their true forms,

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.970
which are linked closely to mana, 
and gain enormous power.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.170
Apparently they also went after Fuegoleon

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.470
because they wanted the 
magic stone that he had.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.360
Reborn, eh?

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.480
You sure they didn't just read 
one too many fantasy novels?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.310
We don't know whether that's true or not,
but their obsession with it is real.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.120
We must not let them get the stones.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.830
Oh, and?

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.870
There are three magic stones left.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.820
They know the location of one of them.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.870
Yeah? And where's that?

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.130
In a strong magic region...

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.540
The Underwater Temple.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.950
A... strong magic region?

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.880
What's that?

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.760
I'm pretty sure you don't 
need this head anymore.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.180
Stop! I won't say any more! Please spare me!

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.660
Perfect. Let me crush it for you.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.780
Strong magic regions are, as the name 
suggests, regions with strong magic,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.140
where all sorts of magical phenomena 
occur to prevent people from entering.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.230
Of all the regions with strong magic,
the Underwater Temple

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.750
is said to be especially dangerous.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.020
The dungeon you recently 
conquered could be considered

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.240
a beginner's course in comparison.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.790
There's a place that's even 
more amazing than that?

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.080
So you want us to get there before 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun does

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.290
and snatch the magic stone or whatever?

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.410
That's right.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.540
This is an important mission. 
The best squad for the job

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.570
is the one with lots of members who aren't 
restricted by familial or social status...

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.800
Which means your Black Bulls, Yami.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.270
There may still be traitors 
among the Magic Knights.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.670
Will you do it?

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:07.270
You're the Wizard King. If that's 
what you think, just give the order.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:13.430
As a captain, you're definitely right that 
I don't have anything holding me back.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.760
I hear he's not from this kingdom.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.030
Apparently he's a castaway from some foreign 
country who lives on the coast by himself.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.290
He looks kinda dangerous.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.530
I wish he'd just leave the country.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.610
You can't be serious! Why does a 
foreigner like him get a grimoire?

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.470
I bet his magic's worthless.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.520
Let's get rid of him with our magic later.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.310
What's that magic?

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.950
Scary...

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.310
How creepy.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:06.890
Yeah... Just because I got a grimoire, that
doesn't change the fact that I'm a foreigner.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.610
I don't have anything tying me down,
but that also means I'll always be alone.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.230
Or so I thought...

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.340
Wow! That's dark magic, isn't it?!

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.730
That's amazing! I've never seen that before!

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.390
Hey, hey, hey! Let me 
get a better look at it!

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.640
No. Who the heck are you, old man?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.520
Old...? Oh, but I'm not suspicious at all!

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.260
I'm just a Magic Knights Captain who 
was wandering around in disguise.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.890
What's a Magic Knight?

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.830
Huh? You don't know?!

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.450
Hmm...

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.620
Well, why not come see for yourself?

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.340
I'm sure you've got potential.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.140
Nope.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.860
Oh, come on! Don't be like that!

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.660
Nope.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.880
I'll treat you to dinner.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.830
Okay, I'll go.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.710
I see. I guess that's not enough...

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.290
Wait. You'll come?

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:00.030
I'll go if you buy me dinner.
I'll definitely go.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.670
You sure are interesting!

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.970
I guess I've been stuck with you ever since.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.690
I'm just going to use my power 
to prove it, that's all.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.950
To prove that you've made no mistakes.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.080
Yami's actually saluting.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.230
I'm counting on you, Yami.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.780
And you, Asta...

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.130
Y-Yes, sir!

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.270
It's a strange coincidence 
that you joined Yami's squad.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.800
Strong magic regions have 
strong mana force fields

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.140
around them that prevent 
outsiders from getting in.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.600
I doubt anyone would be able to 
get in without your anti-magic.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.280
And your experience fighting 
with the Eye of the Midnight Sun

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.650
is bound to be very useful.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.610
I'm counting on you.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.430
Yes, sir!

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.390
I got too excited and 
knocked the air out of myself!

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.550
I've never seen someone 
self-destruct from saluting.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.170
I can definitely tell that you chose him,
considering how interesting he is.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.270
You were stiff as a board back there.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.690
I guess clowns can get nervous, too.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.420
Who are you calling a clown, sir?

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:24.160
It's just... I've never had someone who I 
thought was amazing, like the Wizard King,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.680
expect anything from me before.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.190
Joining the Magic Knights when 
you can't even use magic?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.190
There's no way!

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.670
Actually, no one's ever really expected 
anything from me to begin with.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.320
Ouch!

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.810
I let you join the Black Bulls 
because I thought you could do it.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.830
Work your butt off.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.410
Yes, sir!

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.010
All right!

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.220
The beach!

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.580
Men bring to mind the beach! 
The beach brings to mind men!

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.640
I'm getting all excited for no good reason!

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.140
Yeah! Come to think of it, I've 
never even seen the ocean before!

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.890
I haven't either, Shrimpsta!

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:37.110
Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach!

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:15.170
There's nothing better than enjoying 
a cold one under the blazing sun!

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.560
Shake, shake, let's shake!

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.220
I'll make some original drinks and flirt 
with some hotties in swimsuits on the beach!

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.200
S-Swimsuits?!

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:24.860
Does that mean...

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.550
If I go to the beach, I-I-I-I'll 
have to wear a swimsuit, too?!

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.490
Mr. Shrimp, Mr. Crab, and all the 
many other varieties of seafood,

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.110
I can't wait to grill you 
all up on the beach...

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.800
I hope we all get to put sunscreen 
on each other at the beach.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:42.670
Captain!

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.100
Captain, what should I get for Marie?

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.650
Hey, sharks are strong, right?

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.520
I hope the sharks eat you both.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.510
S-Swimsuit... Swimsuit...

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.440
If you don't have one,
you can borrow one of mine.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.270
Beach! Beach! Bea—

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.280
Shut up!

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.830
We're not going for leisure! 
We're going for work!

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.620
Yes, sir...

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.150
The Underwater Temple, huh?

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.290
I wonder what it's like...

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:56.430
Petit Clover

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.970
Petit Clover!

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.940
Game Tournament

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.410
Game Tournament.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.190
This is so cool!

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:07.030
To think your magic can let us play games 
like this... You're amazing, Mr. Bowlcut!

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.150
This is called memory amusement magic,

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.510
and it allows you to battle with characters

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.200
you've created from your memory.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.450
And my name is Marx—

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.080
Whoa! The captain was super 
strong when he was young!

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.250
How nostalgic. It's Yami 
when I first met him.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.590
You're no match for me, kid.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.600
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.420
Go right! Right! Counterattack!

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.350
Now left!

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.470
You bastard...

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.680
Why don't we have a real battle 
instead of one in a game?

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.680
I'll die!

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.950
It'll seriously be game over!

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.540
Wh-What should I do? If we're going 
to the beach, I'll need a swimsuit.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.270
I need to buy a new one!

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.730
I wonder what kind Asta likes...

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.900
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 40: 
"A Black Beach Story."

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 40
 A Black Beach Story

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.820
Like I care about what Stupidsta likes!
