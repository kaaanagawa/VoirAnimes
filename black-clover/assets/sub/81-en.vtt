00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.750
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.000
The Life of a Certain Man

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.230
In the second stage of the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.520
the battle between E Team and 
G Team was growing intense.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.360
Leopold from E Team approached 
G Team's crystal,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.660
and Langris from G Team was also 
getting closer to E Team's crystal.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.990
It's over, Brother!

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.370
Langris!

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.080
I'll stop you!

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.050
What a nice cold dessert.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.140
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.940
Snow Magic: Unclimbed Ice Wall!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.650
Yes! We did i—

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.800
G Team wins!

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.450
G Team's crystal was also destroyed, 
but E Team's crystal was destroyed first.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.460
Thank goodness. Langris must've
 gotten to it first.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.670
Oh, dear. What happened?

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.540
Damn it! We lost! I wasn't 
concentrating enough!

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.710
Does this mean I'm still nowhere 
near my brother's level?

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.060
This ominous magic...

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.400
It's coming from where Finral is.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.260
What in the world is happening?

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.290
How do you like that? 
There's nothing you can beat me at!

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.250
What?

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.960
Miz Charmy!

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.840
Cotton Creation Magic: Fluffy Sheep Cushion!

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.310
Disappear.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.990
Hey!

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.700
Just try and do something else.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.540
Forget the match. We'll kill you.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.900
There's something wrong with you!

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.500
The match was already over!

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.700
Maybe you've been on a roll lately, 
but you're still Black Bulls flunkies.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.760
What do you think you'll do against 
the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn?

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.770
Who the hell cares about status when we're 
trying to protect our precious friend?!

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.030
Precious friend?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.270
That's enough.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.090
Those who go easy on their companions 
in a fight can't be trusted.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.140
But those who try to kill their 
companions have problems

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.330
that run much deeper than trust.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.650
He's in bad shape. Leave him to me.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.950
Dr. Owen!

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.050
Water Recovery Magic:

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.530
Qualle Operation.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.010
Will he be okay?

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.310
I'll do everything I can.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.060
Companion? That useless fool brings 
shame upon the Magic Knights.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.350
You little...

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.310
Let's kill him after all.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.190
Finral's nicer than anybody! 
That's what makes him a true Magic Knight!

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.570
No matter how tough you are, 
you're no Magic Knight!

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.830
I'm not a Magic Knight? What?

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.640
I guess making it this far 
has gone to your head.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.210
You sure talk big for a Black Bulls newbie.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.470
Wizard King, before the next 
teams conduct their match,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.370
would you let me battle them?

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.100
Actually... Let's just start.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.020
Why, you—

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.020
Asta!

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.350
Let the semi-finals begin!

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.940
You little—

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.200
Asta!

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.430
Vice Captain Langris has always 
been a bit belligerent,

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.620
but it's not normal for him to act like this!

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.330
Yes. Something definitely isn't right.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.140
Sir, aren't you going to stop them?

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.210
In actual combat,
 no one says "stop" or "start."

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.610
So keep going.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.510
You were with him then...

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.700
I disliked you from the first time we met.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.350
You belong to the worst 
possible Magic Knight squad,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.670
Asta of the Black Bulls!

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.490
That's my line, you jerk...

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.860
Vice Captain Langris Vaude
 of the Golden Dawn!

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.750
Time Binding Magic: Chrono Stasis.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.760
You two can hear me, yes?

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.330
Although I'd like for you two to fight as if 
this were real combat, it is still a match.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.680
Sit tight for a long second,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.820
until preparations for the 
match are completed.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.350
Don't worry. I'll have everything 
ready before your enthusiasm cools.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.760
Prepare for the semi-finals. 
Get the crystals ready.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.880
Y-Yes, sir!

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.180
Also, bring the other members 
of B Team and G Team here.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.370
Roger-dodger-roger! Um...

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.770
B Team has Xerx Lügner 
and Mimosa Vermillion.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.900
G Team has Fragil Tormenta

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.630
and Sekke Bronzazza.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.630
Now, then...

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.230
I need to make sure to thank you 
for interrupting my golden time.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.140
Y-You don't need to thank me-ha.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.010
Now, there's no need to be shy.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.790
Pardon me.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.080
Dark Magic...

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.150
Dimension Slash!

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.150
What in the world?!

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.150
His heartbeat is getting weaker.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.710
Finral!

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.620
I'll never forgive you if you die!

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.130
Yeah! If you're going to die, 
I need to kill you first!

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.410
Wake up! Don't make me set you on fire!

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.480
It'll be okay. I know that 
he's really strong deep down!

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.900
Today won't be the last entry in 
my observation journal for you!

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.900
That's a long way off!

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.230
If you die, you won't be able 
to eat delicious noms, la!

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.510
You can make it through, la!

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.810
To think that's what was going on...

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.510
Must've been rough.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.140
My eternal rival, Asta! Don't lose!

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.430
Have fun!

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.430
I thought we won.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.480
Asta...

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.280
What's going on?

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.790
Huh? What's Asta doing here?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.020
The semi-final round 
between B Team and G Team.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.790
We've already set up your crystals 
at your starting positions.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.670
What? We're starting the semi-finals already?

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.830
Let me just remind you that this is a match.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.380
Whichever team can destroy

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.020
the other team's crystal first wins. 
It's not about killing your opponent.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.940
I wish you luck.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.970
Mimosa, Xerx, I'm sorry about this.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.690
I didn't mean for this to happen, 
but I want to beat him!

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.070
Please, help me!

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.070
Of course!

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.890
There's something wrong with Langris.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.510
Xerx?

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.730
Magic Knights clashing over personal stuff 
and doing whatever the hell they want...

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.920
Are you all stupid?!

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.090
Hey!

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.550
But fine, whatever.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.310
For now, he's much worse than you.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.560
Let's do this, you little shit!

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.940
Langris...

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.710
What's going on?

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.300
Kindly explain, bah-ha.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.480
Shut your mouths.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.810
Bah-ha! Ha-bah, ha-bah...

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.500
You shouldn't talk to us 
like that. Don't worry-ha.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.800
Next time, I'll use my magic to—

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.660
There's no need.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.650
Bah-ha?

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.990
All of you are absolutely worthless.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.870
I'll show you all that I'm special!

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.300
Unconscious betrayal?

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.580
Yes. Based on the circumstances 
up to this point,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.190
it seems someone 
among the Magic Knights

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.360
is unwittingly cooperating with 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.730
I can't help but feel like 
there's someone like that.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.320
So they're being controlled 
by some kind of spell?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.480
No... It's not a spell.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.850
I wonder...

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.830
Maybe it is a spell.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.850
He always leaves work undone to go 
on his little trips to observe magic,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.560
but his intuition is sharp.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.780
There must be something going 
on with the Magic Knights.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.260
My other goal with this 
Royal Knights Selection Exam

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.390
is to bring this unconscious 
traitor to light.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.340
Huh?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.400
When they expend their 
mana on the battlefield

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.890
or when they're confronted by powerful mana,

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.550
people tend to show their true colors.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.400
But won't that be dangerous?

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.670
No.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.480
We're doing this.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.410
Does this mean that Langris 
is the unconscious traitor,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.380
Wizard King?

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.090
Let's go after the enemy's crystal

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.080
while protecting our own,
 like we did in the first stage!

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.330
Mimosa, could you pull the crystal?

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.240
Right!

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.860
I need you to back me up, Xerx!

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.180
There has been a change of plans.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:31.960
Sekke   Langris   Fragil

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:31.960
G Team

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:31.960
Xerx   Asta   Mimosa

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:31.960
B Team

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.200
We will now begin round 
one of the semi-finals.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.960
B Team: Xerx, Mimosa, Asta versus 
G Team: Langris, Fragil, and Sekke.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.210
Begin!

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.570
They handled that quickly.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:46.110
His anti-magic sword can cut the 
crystal in two with a single slash.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.430
Which means...

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.660
I just have to break you and your crystal

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.990
before you can get to ours!

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.740
These don't suddenly change like 
Magna's attack, so I can cut these.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.530
But there are so many of them!

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.850
Recovery Magic: Princess-Healing Flower Robe!

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.480
Thanks, Mimosa!

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.230
It's only a matter of time before your 
recovery spells aren't fast enough!

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.480
Before that happens, take back what you said!

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.280
Come on! Asta's doing his best out there!

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.700
You need to keep fighting 
so you don't get laughed at!

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.950
That cowardly loser isn't a Magic Knight!

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.120
I won! That makes me the true Magic Knight!

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.580
You didn't even hesitate 
to abandon the people!

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.550
Oh, well. They'll just have to be noble 
sacrifices for the sake of our country.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.970
Give me a break!

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.970
Finral has always used 
his magic to help others!

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:54.670
So what, you naïve little brat?!
 That's all he can do!

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.660
He was never strong enough 
to defeat his enemies!

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.480
Asta!

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.280
I can't...

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.280
The one who wins in the end is the 
one who's right about everything!

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.910
Is that so? In that case,
I'm right about everything!

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.160
What?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.420
Because I'm going to win 
for Finral's sake, too!

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.500
Oh, please.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.050
Asta!

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.840
Don't give up, no matter what!

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.590
Asta!

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.500
This is no longer a match.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.540
What's going to happen in 
this battle, Wizard King?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.700
My recovery magic can't keep up!

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.250
Asta! Any more of this and your body 
will break down before the crystal does!

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.250
We—

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.160
Not yet!

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.510
The side effects of my black form...

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.730
The intense pain in my muscles and bones...

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.630
My cool-down period is over.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.130
Right now, I'm only able to go 
into that state twice a day.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.550
I was planning to save it for 
when I fight Yuno in the finals,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.890
but I can't afford to think like that now!

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.420
Still, in order to go into that state,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.770
I need to concentrate and 
make my ki circulate.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.400
In these circumstances, 
that's going to be impossible.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.380
So...

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.570
It's all you, Xerx!

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.110
You dumbass!

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.570
Like I'd take orders from you.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.330
Xerx!

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.160
I'm only doing this because 
I don't like that guy.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.660
Yet this dumbass is actually 
putting all his trust in me.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.170
Damn it.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.180
Zora! Zora!

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.050
Zara Ideale

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.050
I'm home, Zora.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.350
Welcome home, Dad.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:04.190
Did you behave—Whoa! You did 
all the housework perfectly again!

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.280
Thanks for everything you do, Zora.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.530
My father was a very cheerful person.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:12.900
You stink!

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.120
My father loved practical jokes.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.890
You fell for it, Zora.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.710
And he always laughed like a child.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:32.470
Boom! The envoy of justice, 
the Super Magic Knight Zora!

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.380
What is this?

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.660
It's a doll I made.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.290
You made this?

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:45.080
Super Magic Knight Zora has a mouth 
on him, but he's as good as his word.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.390
He's a warrior who protects 
the country behind the scenes!

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.860
Well? Isn't he cool?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.680
I'm twelve years old, you know...

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.720
I'm not saying you have to match this.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.590
I just think you should learn to 
communicate with others more, Zora.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.410
Right...

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.910
All right, then.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.620
I'm gonna go protect the peace again.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.660
Zara was the first peasant 
to become a Magic Knight.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.460
From the age of fifteen,

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.060
he failed the Magic Knights 
Entrance Exam over and over.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.920
But despite getting older and 
becoming a father, he never gave up

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.660
and worked harder than anyone.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.070
All of Zara's hard work 
shone in Zora's eyes.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.860
And he was prouder than anyone when 
his father became a Magic Knight.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.220
I ended up alongside this amazing 
guy on the battlefield today.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.310
He could use time magic.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.750
He's the kind of guy who's gonna succeed.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.490
I get to protect the country with a 
bunch of amazing people like that.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:56.030
Man, being a Magic Knight is awesome!

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.760
We all believe in each other and get 
through life-or-death situations!

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.590
I'm going to continue protecting everything 
I can with all the power that I have.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.520
That's what makes a Magic Knight!

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.230
How are you going to protect 
anything if you're dead, Dad?

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.310
Those are... Magic Knights 
from the Purple Orcas.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.740
They're Dad's companions.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.140
They must've come to pay their respects.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.420
Too bad, Zara Ideale.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.490
A peasant trying to pass himself off

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.620
as a Magic Knight on the battlefield?

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.970
That's why you got nailed in 
the back by one of your own.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.530
I mean, the insolence of a mere peasant 
thinking he could get along

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.630
with nobles like us...

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.410
Buzzing around saving civilians 
on the brink of death...

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.490
You were an eyesore, you piece of trash.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.040
No one wants a filthy Magic Knight like you.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.430
Y-You people...

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.550
You call this a VIP room?

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.220
We're Magic Knights here!

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.760
Bring us your best alcohol!

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.060
B-But...

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.370
What? You don't want to pour me a drink?

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.520
Th-That's not...

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.010
I guess I'll have to punish you 
for that attitude of yours.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.340
Sir... Please forgive me!

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.530
Good job. This is making the 
alcohol taste a little better.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.660
Well, hello there, Magic Knights.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.500
I'm about to get in your way.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.430
Huh?

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.000
Who the hell are you?

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.090
Just try and arrest me for 
obstructing public duties!

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.130
You people...

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.740
You people...

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.380
You people...

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.280
You people...

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.630
You people...

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.620
They said my granddaughter 
who lives in the town of Poe

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.340
was taken away by you and hasn't been back.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.920
Please... Please give me 
back my granddaughter.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.970
Lord Xerx is exhausted after a long 
expedition! Stay back, you old hag!

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.390
Please... Please, Sir Magic Knight!

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.430
You people...

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.170
Would you like to beautifully lose what 
little life you have left with my magic?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.400
Don't you dare defy the Vice Captain of the 
Purple Orcas! He's the Saint of Pure Ice!

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.660
Who are you?

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.170
You people...

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.510
You people...

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:29.430
are not the Magic Knights 
that my father dreamed of!

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.480
Petit Clover

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.460
Petit Clover!

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.990
Golden Time

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.930
Golden Time.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.700
Golden time.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.700
Golden time.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.540
Golden time.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.350
Golden time.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.810
That's my very precious 
and irreplaceable time.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.470
If someone is stupid enough to disturb it...

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.590
This is what happens.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.250
You should all be careful. Bah-ha...

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.010
Lalala-di-la!

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.810
Next week,

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:45.700
we're going to make sure you stuff 
yourself full of extra yummy goodness!

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.280
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 82: 
"Petit Clover! The Nightmarish Charmy SP."

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 82
 Petit Clover! The Nightmarish Charmy SP!

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.250
My never-ending appetite is my magic, la!
