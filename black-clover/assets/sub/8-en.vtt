00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.700
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.530
Go! Go! First Mission

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.710
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.420
I know, yeah I know

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.630
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.670
I dreamed it all my life

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.470
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.520
Don't care how much I fall

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.990
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.480
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.490
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.870
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.120
Someday I will write the next page

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.620
You are my hope

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.380
Like that page from someday

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.710
I was able to meet you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.670
I call this a miracle

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.770
Mornings start early for Magic Knights.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.480
There are many things they must do.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.620
Cleaning.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.450
Laundry.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.260
But my heart belongs to Sister Lily.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.430
Next!

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.440
The Beasts' Room

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.900
Taking care of the beasts.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.710
Sit!

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.650
There, there. Good boy.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.580
Here.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.000
You must endure, even if you're 
almost eaten by a beast. And...

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.010
In Front of the Captain's Room

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.010
Captain Yami...

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.010
Captain...

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.430
You must wake up the captain of 
the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.770
Captain! It's morning!

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.270
Don't wake me up! I'll kill you!

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.770
Sorry about that!

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.590
Even though you're the one who told me
 to wake you up every morning!

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.030
Magic Knights must also deal with 
unreasonable demands.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.580
Man, I've been working hard 
 since the crack of dawn again.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.290
Magic Knights sure have a lot of work to do.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.780
Wait, how is this any different from 
what I was doing at the church?!

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.450
What are Magic Knights 
supposed to do anyway?!

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.680
Cafeteria

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.190
There's nothing but meat for breakfast.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.530
Noelle, why don't you help me 
with the cleaning and stuff?

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.970
Cleaning? But I'm royalty.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.630
But you're a newbie just like me!

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.440
I've never cleaned or 
done laundry in my life.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.170
That's not something to brag about, is it?

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.940
We're in the same squad, aren't we?

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.300
I'm pretty sure you should 
be helping with that stuff.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.890
But I'm royalty.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.240
Why are you talking to me like that?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.530
Shut up, you insect.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.130
Damn it!

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.250
So, uh...

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.650
What do Magic Knights do anyway?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.010
What? Are you seriously asking that?

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.680
We protect the kingdom and handle security!

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.740
It's the most manly job 
in the world, you dumbass!

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.550
Why'd you decide to join 
when you knew nothing about it?

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.400
I'm sorry!

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.200
I'm going to become the Wizard King.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.420
I'm going to barf everything back up!

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.620
They sure are lively first 
thing in the morning.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.120
Being energetic is the best. 
Can I have some of that energy?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.710
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.670
Damn it. Show 'em what Magic Knights do,

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.380
you drunk witch.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.520
Well...

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.210
We keep the citizens safe? Something like that.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.310
You might even be able to get closer to some 
noble when you're assigned to protect them.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.530
I see!

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.590
It's a super-fun job where you get 
to fight with enemies all you want.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.460
If they're criminals, you can beat them up
all you want and not get in trouble!

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.120
Most importantly, it's a wonderful job 
that my sister respects me for having.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.870
Isn't she an angel? I can buy her 
whatever she wants with my pay.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.590
But if you lay a finger 
on Marie, I'll kill you.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.990
Wh-What about you, Finral?

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.510
It's the best job in the world,
 since I get to save girls and be popular.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.350
Of course I'll tell you. 
We're friends, after all.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.450
Charmy?

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.300
I'm... out of food!

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.690
I'm nowhere near full.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.040
Cotton Creation Magic: Sheep Cooks!

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.610
Thank you for the food!

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.870
As long as you're a Magic Knight, 
you can eat plenty of food!

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.000
Munchy...

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.700
Uh, Grey?

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.450
Huh?!

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.570
Well, basically, it's a good job.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.830
He looks just like you.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.670
I'm looking forward to working 
with you on a mission.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.380
R-Right...

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.090
Th-They're all weirdos.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.010
Should I really be in this squad?

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:36.710
If you take this and this, and put them 
together and do this, it's really yummy.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.790
Try a bite? 'Kay?

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.810
No, I'm full, thanks.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.230
Well? Do you understand 
what Magic Knights do now?

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.240
Not at all!

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.870
Let's go, Magna.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.960
Yes, sir, Mister Yami!

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.660
What's going on? What's going on?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.140
There's a mission.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.500
A Magic Knights' mission?

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.690
C-Can I come with—

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.640
No!

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.310
We can't bring any kids along.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.110
This is a very important mission for adults.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.970
All right. We're off.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.610
Hey! Don't break everything while we're gone.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.450
Okay! Have fun!

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.470
Captain! Will you fight me 
when you come back?

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.200
Come back soon. I'll be waiting.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.880
Come back by dinner! Munchy...

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.170
Can I go see Marie soon?

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.510
I'm having withdrawal symptoms.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.970
Maybe I'll go flirt...

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.690
I mean, go on a mission, too.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.350
Should I really be in this squad?

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.630
Captain Yami and Magna 
both looked so serious.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.150
What kind of mission could it be?

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.210
This is bad...

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.830
This is really bad!

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.350
And now you're both...

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.350
finished!

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.290
And now you're both...

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.290
finished!

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.530
Flush!

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.710
Two pair.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:12.710
I've got nothing!

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.750
You got me!

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.220
This feels great!

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.900
Damn it! That's six months worth of pay.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.170
You've still got a ways to go, 
Magna. You, too, Captain!

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.100
Good! Very good!

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.110
Now I can buy some great gifts for 
everyone in the village on my way home.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.890
Let's go another round.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.700
Mister Yami?

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.860
Oh? But you don't have 
anything else to bet, do you?

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.340
You don't have any clothes or cash.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.930
Yeah! We're basically naked!

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.110
No, there's still more.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:55.420
Hey, gramps.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.590
Let's do one last round.
 If we win, we get everything back.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.550
Oh, and if you lose?

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.850
This!

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.470
M-Mister Yami! That's...

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.230
So let's do another round!

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.090
Er, you probably shouldn't be betting that.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.730
Yeah, Mister Yami!

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:19.820
Shut up!

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.280
Use this moment to go beyond your limits!

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.940
But you know...

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:32.940
All right. If you lose,
 how about you do anything I ask?

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.370
Anything?

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.680
Anything? Of course Mister Yami
would never accept...

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.050
I accept.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.620
Mister Yami accepted! I'm in!

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.450
Old Man Seihi, say your prayers!

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.520
I wonder who'll be saying their prayers...

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.670
This could work!

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.860
Shoot!

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.620
There, there. Good boy.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.540
Here.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.580
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.200
Hey! Don't just stand there! Help me!

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.030
I'm royalty.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.250
You should be thankful that 
I even got out of bed.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.790
How?! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.010
I thought I was going to die.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.810
You really are freakishly strong.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.680
Well, I train!

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.180
Captain Yami and Magna...

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.880
I wonder if they finished their... mission?!

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.690
What?

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:27.200
That old man actually had 
a royal straight flush!

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.490
Who would've thought? He's amazing!

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.380
We're no match for Old Man Seihi!

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.500
People sure are strong when they 
have something on the line.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.350
Hey, Stupidsta, Lady Noe, we're back!

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.340
Be happy! You two are going on 
your first mission

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.650
as Magic Knights.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:53.590
Huh?

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.680
And so, we're giving you your first mission.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.230
Our first mission...

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.450
...as Magic Knights.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.980
Wh-What is it?

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.480
It had better be something 
worthy of me as a royal.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.870
Yeah, you should be honored.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.670
You'll be hunting wild boars
 in Saussy Village!

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.630
Wild...

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.870
...boars?

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.620
Boar!

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.380
Wh-What in the world is this lame mission?

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.710
What are you calling lame?!

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.430
I can beat a wild boar with my bare hands!

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.970
Don't you dare underestimate wild boars!

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.530
They come charging outta nowhere!

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.730
Haven't you ever heard
 the phrase "rushing into things"?!

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.110
We both ended up losing to 
the mayor of Saussy Village.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.280
Huh?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.220
C-Captain Yami and Magna lost?

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.660
Just how strong is he?

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.600
It was cards.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.660
Cards?!

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.710
He basically stripped us of all we had.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.410
And six months worth of pay, too!

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.020
Why...

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.920
...are you bragging?

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.620
And we ended up promising him 
we'd do anything if we lost,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.730
so he asked us to take care 
of some wild boars for him.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.260
Apparently, a herd showed up near
 the village, and they're ruining the fields.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.020
Well, I'll be waiting at my village.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.400
Oh, I'll at least return these to you.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.610
Hi, question! That has nothing 
to do with us, right?

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.580
Yeah! You two are the ones who lost! Then...

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:48.090
You idiots! You're asking Mister Yami
 to clean up his own mistakes?!

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.420
Normally...

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.880
...you would.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.710
We're the ones who clean up
 Mister Yami's mistakes!

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.520
Are you going to go, or are you going to die?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.690
Which will it be?

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.690
We'll go!

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.210
Even though we're hunting wild boars,
 this is our first mission as Magic Knights.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.310
I'm so excited!

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.930
I'm supposed to get rid of wild boars?

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.580
What? You're still complaining?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.090
I'm not complaining, but...

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:35.940
I was just wondering if I should go,
 since I can't control my magical powers.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.970
You idiot!

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:37.930
What...

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.180
You'll be able to fix that in no time 
with some missions under your belt!

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.430
And...

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:49.850
I'll be sure to clean up any of you 
newbies' mistakes, since I'm your senior.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.040
Magna, you're such a manly man!

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.650
Stop it, Stupidsta. You're making me blush.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.440
I-If you insist, I guess 
I could accompany you.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.590
Thank you very much!

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.090
Wait. Why are you always looking down on us?!

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:10.600
I'm not. It's just that 
you're always below me.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.510
What kind of reasoning is that?!

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.970
So...

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.220
Use your spatial magic to 
get us to Saussy Village.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.790
Saussy Village?

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:24.560
Not happening.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.620
What do you mean, you jerk?!

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.370
Well, I can only go to 
faraway places I can't see

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.490
if I've marked them 
with my magical powers.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.670
Huh?!

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:38.820
Meaning I can't go to places 
I've never been to before.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.430
You're so useless!

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.620
Guess we don't have a choice. 
We'll go by broomstick.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.580
Magna, sir!

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.640
Yeah, Asta?

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.220
I can't fly on a broomstick!

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.070
Sir.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.300
Yes, Noelle?

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.420
I can't, either.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.260
What?! Are you two serious?!

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.790
Why can't you do something 
so easy, you morons?!

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.400
Damn it! That's as basic as it gets!

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.810
Well, I don't have any magical powers!

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.710
Why are you bragging about that?!

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.410
Well, I can't control my magical powers, 
so of course I can't. You fool.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.660
And why do you sound so high and mighty?!

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.210
Guess I don't have a choice.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.340
I'll give you two a ride on my baby.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.840
Baby?

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.840
Her name's...

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.110
Crazy Cyclone!

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.600
Crazy Cyclone

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.180
S-So cool!

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.480
I know, right?! Isn't she a beaut?

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.420
Yeah, she is!

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.170
Lame.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.890
What?! Are you not able to 
comprehend her majestic form?

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:02.820
So lame!

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.810
Let's go!

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.800
Are you going to be all right?

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.460
A man never goes back on his word!

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.640
Here we go!

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.390
Fly!

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.340
How do you like that?
 Crazy Cyclone can even handle three riders!

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.290
Hey! Fly a bit more steady!

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.650
H-H-Hey! Don't get so close to me!

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.580
You can't be serious, 
you mohawked delinquent!

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.290
Who are you calling a mohawked delinquent?!

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.470
Yahoo!

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:02.180
This is amazing, Magna! 
We're one with the wind!

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.420
And if you don't want to die, 
get a little closer, Stupidsta!

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.300
Yes, sir!

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.490
Hey! Where are you touching me?!

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.230
What the hell are you two doing?!

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.950
Saussy Village

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.940
Right on schedule.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.100
So this is where the magic stone is located.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.050
We're going to find it.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:28.980
Yes, sir!

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.110
Be lost in the mist.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:56.640
No one can escape from here

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:03.390
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:11.640
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:18.080
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.520
I've thought many times

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.230
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:32.820
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:39.670
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:46.920
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:53.810
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:58.520
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.370
Petit Clover

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.970
Petit Clover!

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.870
Regards!

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.040
Regards!

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.750
Well? Isn't Crazy Cyclone super cool?

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:32.010
Actually, I'd probably call your head 
a crazy cyclone before I would your broom.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.560
Who are you calling a cyclone?!

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.220
Apparently, you're okay with "crazy."

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.810
We came here to hunt wild boars,
 but end up encountering a crazy enemy.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.140
I'm not going to forgive you for 
causing everyone so much trouble!

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.740
Not giving up is my magic!
