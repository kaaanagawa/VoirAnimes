00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.180
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.140
Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.270
Mine!

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.940
Remember this, Magic Knights.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.660
We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.220
The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.580
Asta!

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.710
I've been waiting for you.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.330
H-He's...

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.840
The Wizard King, Julius Novachrono?!

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.960
Kill him!

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.730
I-Impossible!

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.930
I killed them.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.060
It would've been too difficult 
with your numbers.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.980
How about it? I'll let one of you 
survive, so why not surrender?

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.900
It'll be first come, first served.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.560
Don't underestimate us!

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.240
How is he moving like that?!
I can't keep up!

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.270
I guess I don't have a choice.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.740
I might be able to handle these numbers.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.440
Time Binding Magic: Chrono Stasis.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.250
What... is this?

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.750
I can't move...

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.760
...at all.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.580
I guess I was able to restrain all of you.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.760
Were you more worn out than I thought?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.660
Ow...

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.270
Hey there, Asta.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.020
We seem to be connected by fate somehow.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.770
R-Right...

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.650
You want to become the 
Wizard King someday, right?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.410
In that case, watch carefully 
and don't look away.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.410
This is only a small fraction 
of what you'll have to surpass.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.940
Something's coming?

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.500
That's blinding!

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.220
What is this light?!

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.740
I would always close my eyes

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.080
And cower at reality

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.770
I can't stand the idea

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.130
Of just making excuses to give up

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.340
Stand right there

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.400
I don't want to be near you

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.540
Any minute now

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.930
Just wait right there

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.930
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.020
Black and blue

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.940
I'll give up on giving up

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.440
And get the world on my side

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.330
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.460
And head where the light shines

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.300
I want to keep my promise

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.840
I'll deliver it to you

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.820
shape of love

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.560
Light

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.530
Everyone's gone!

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.660
Looks like he got us.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.660
He took all of his little friends back.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.870
Light magic that's faster than my own... 
I wonder if that was the enemy's boss.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.140
He seems interesting... I mean, formidable.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.690
But...

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.840
We managed to keep one.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.750
I finally got through.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.010
Where are you, Wizard King?

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.690
Hello there, Marx.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.880
Sorry about that. I've been a bit busy, 
so I blocked the communication spell.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.990
Never mind that. Please hurry
to the medical ward.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Fuegoleon... Leopold...

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.030
I hope they wake up soon.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.010
Indeed.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.310
We've strengthened the magic barrier 
and repaired the communication spells.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.930
We've gathered more Magic Knights

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.180
and are having them scout 
every inch of the town

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.400
to ensure no enemies remain.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.420
I'm sure the royal capital is fine now.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.990
We're also looking for that awfully loud—
er, lively Black Bulls boy.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.410
He wouldn't die so easily!

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.740
Curse you, Asta. I'm going to 
punch you when you get back.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.820
This magic...

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.250
Hey, everyone. Great work.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.010
Th-The Wizard King?

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.270
Asta!

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.890
H-Hey, guys. Looks like you're all here.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.630
Is that... an enemy?

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.140
Man, I thought I was done for.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.250
Hmph! It's because you're always so reckless.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.210
I hope you learned your lesson, Stupidsta.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.400
Thank goodness!

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.750
Asta!

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.190
You're safe, Asta!

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.090
I'm... I'm so glad you came back alive!

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.780
I thought you were dead. I'm so glad.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.330
Y-Yeah... Thanks for worrying about me.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.290
I thought you were going to punch him.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.260
Asta!

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.190
I was so, so worried about you!

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.140
I-I'm sorry!

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.720
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.720
I see...

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.950
Despite how strong Fuegoleon is, 
we don't know when he'll wake up.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.850
That was a miscalculation on my part.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.270
No, this was due to our inexperience.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.490
We've confirmed that the pendant 
Fuegoleon was wearing is missing.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.170
Pendant?

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.750
Could that be what they were after?

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.670
Who in the world could they be?

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.940
From what they said,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.260
they appear to be a terrorist group 
with a grudge against the kingdom.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.070
We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.760
The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.110
But it doesn't seem to be that simple.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.770
The jewels embedded into that stone slab...

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.020
Was Fuegoleon's pendant a part of that?

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.340
It had several holes 
that were still empty,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.530
but what happens when 
they gather all of them?

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:58.040
There is the possibility that Fuegoleon 
was targeted because of his pendant,

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.450
but there's also a high possibility

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.540
that his strength and ideals 
would've gotten in their way.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.570
I've been investigating 
various dissidents in secret,

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.300
and this is the first time 
I've picked up their trail.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.300
But to think that they were planning 
something that extraordinary and powerful.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.540
Maybe I shouldn't have left the capital.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.670
We'll get the details from our captive later.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.310
In any case,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.740
people look to the
Magic Knights for one thing...

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.650
Peace in the Clover Kingdom.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.570
In order to preserve that, we'll keep 
fighting with everything we have.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.560
Yes, sir!

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.830
If you'll excuse me.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.500
Nozel...

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.270
What is that guy's problem?

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.590
We're supposed to be showing solidarity 
right now. Take the hint, man!

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.120
Has the enemy

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:54.090
awakened not a sleeping lion, 
but a sleeping hawk?

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.340
Pathetic.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.060
What an appalling spectacle.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.880
Never let this happen again, Nozel.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.600
And Fuegoleon, I will find 
the scum who did this to you

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.750
and slay them myself.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.500
I hope I never feel this useless again.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.210
Right.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.030
We shall become stronger.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.430
Indeed.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.120
I'm the one who'll become the strongest!

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.590
Leopold!

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.500
You need to be resting!

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.160
Asta! I'm relieved that 
we both pulled through!

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.510
As my rival who has faced death 
with me, you must also get stronger!

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.270
I will surpass my brother!

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.310
I'm going to be the next Wizard King!

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.770
And this...

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.030
Fuegoleon,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.760
what is that mark on your forehead?

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.780
Ah, this?

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.290
This mark is handed down in the Vermillion 
family as a sign of a personal oath.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.290
It's worn only by those prepared to 
conquer themselves and become king.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.960
This... is the mark of my oath.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.610
Yeah! I don't really get it, but it looks 
like you're worthy to be my rival.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.520
So... who the heck are you, anyway?!

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.480
What?!

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.540
How?! How could you still not know who I am?!

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.590
I only remember people who 
properly introduce themselves!

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.450
I am Leopold Vermillion!

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.560
We're going to be friends, 
so call me Leo!

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.640
Y-You're moving way too fast!

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.850
I don't want to hear that from you!

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.450
The Wizard King concluded that 
the attack on the royal capital

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.750
had been the work of 
anti-Clover Kingdom terrorists.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.500
He declared his intent to continue 
resolutely opposing them,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.610
and the masses were fully supportive.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.930
The enemy's invasion was enabled by

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.530
the disappearance of some of the mages who 
maintained the capital's magic barrier.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.100
Had the enemy done away
with them, or had they defected?

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:19.780
This fact was not made public,
but the Wizard King was sure of it.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.280
I don't want to believe it,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.740
but there's a traitor among the 
mages in the royal capital.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.840
Interrogation Room

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:42.840
It's no use.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.850
There's some kind of protection on them,

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.710
and I can't search for information.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.090
Even if there wasn't, we'd never talk.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.620
Our master is the light in the darkness!

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.360
He's our god!

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.370
He's the only one who hasn't abandoned us.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.620
We will never betray him.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:19.630
Apparently, their master has some absolute
unifying force and fearsome magical power.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.960
I'm assuming the one who defeated 
Captain Fuegoleon is also their master.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.890
Indeed.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.890
When he wakes up, we may learn something.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.250
Let us wait for the Lion King to awaken.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.020
Damn it! Damn it!

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.070
Damn it!

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.860
Damn it all to hell!

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.690
They hurt. They hurt...

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.370
My wounds hurt!

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.580
That stupid little brat Asta...

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.870
I'm going to kill him, no matter what!

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:58.090
I'm going to gather the 
ultimate army of the dead!

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.080
That anti-magic kid, Asta...

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.240
You can't kill him, Rades.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.540
I want to tinker with him 
while he's still alive.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.550
What?

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.640
Not to mention, I already 
treated your wounds,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.930
so there's no way they'd still be hurting.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.920
Shut up! They still ache!

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.750
I saw that brat first!

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.820
Hands off, Sally!

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.130
Can't hear you, can't hear you,
can't hear you!

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.890
I hope I see you again soon, Asta!

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.090
For the next time I see you, Asta...

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.590
I'll use the little samples 
I got while you were in the gel,

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.740
and research and research!

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.850
I couldn't save Geork and Catherine.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.860
Those two have big egos, 
but they worship you.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.060
They won't give them any information on us.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.110
That's not what I'm worried about.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.490
As long as they're alive, I will
save them, no matter what.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:23.180
I thought I had dodged it, but I seem 
to have taken a little of the attack.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.810
Magic that accelerates 
time... and drastically.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.640
The Wizard King... As expected, 
he has phenomenal power.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.900
But we will build up our 
strength and defeat him.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:56.260
In order to get our revenge and establish 
a new country that will be ours alone.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.040
Mister and Miss Magic Knight,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.250
thank you for saving me!

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.200
No problem!

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.550
I just did the obvious thing.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.050
This is to thank you. I made them myself.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.270
They look great!

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.360
Thank you so much!

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.430
Bye, now!

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.380
So good!

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.050
Why...

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.070
...are you here, Charmy?

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.490
Where the nummy things are,
there I shall be!

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.790
More importantly, have a bite.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.510
La? La?

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.960
Uh, she gave those to <i>us</i>...

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.410
Don't sweat the details.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.300
Come on. They're delicious.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.450
Th-Thanks?

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.990
I guess I don't mind having one...

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.450
It's good!

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.460
What a surprise. It's actually good.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.570
You seem to be in an unusually good mood.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.220
I had a fateful encounter.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.790
You're probably too young to understand.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.410
By the way, how did you get into the castle?

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.950
Like this!

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.660
Seriously?

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.130
Is her magic actually really amazing?

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.140
That's...

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.370
Hey!

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.230
It's Asta and Noelle.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.320
Asta!

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.730
Have your wounds fully healed?
I asked you that before, didn't I?

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.440
I'm fine, like I said before!

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:52.380
Yuno, I heard you took down the enemy 
like it was nothing, you jerkface!

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.450
Jerkface?

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.990
My meal-saving prince!

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.450
Hey, Yuno! Greet me properly, you jerk!

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.410
Wait, you know my prince?

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.610
Don't get a big head just 
because you took one down!

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:08.750
Courtesy makes the world go round!

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.050
Yuno?

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.850
Huh? Was that too much?

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.830
What do you think you're doing, Yuno?!

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.970
Is he stupid?! Was he 
actually trying to kill us?

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.840
See ya, Shrimpsta

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.250
See ya, Shrimpsta.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.590
Who are you calling "Shrimpsta," 
Yuno, you jerk?!

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.690
Come down here and fight me right now!

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.730
Don't shoot something like that 
just so you can write magic letters!

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.140
Don't you dare ignore me and leave!

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.230
Ah, the ferocious storm of love.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.300
Ignoring me is the worst thing you could do!

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.590
Hey, wait, Yuno!

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.060
Yuno's magic has gotten much stronger.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.870
What could've happened in 
such a short amount of time?

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.870
Asta,

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.030
I'm going to get stronger,

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.980
so the next time we meet, I'll be
able to fight alongside you!

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.880
And then... And then...

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.890
I guess we'll just have to fight 
when we both get a lot stronger.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.290
I'm not going to lose, Yuno!

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.650
The stronger you become, 
I'll get even stronger!

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.650
Black Bulls' Base

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.650
Welcome back, Magna, Luck!

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.060
Man, I'm so exhausted from my mission.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.990
So tired.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.060
However!

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.370
We got recognized for our 
deeds and got a star!

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.710
That's right, Magna!

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.710
Not so close!

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:17.010
Our combo attack, the Crackling Magna
Typhoon, was amazing, wasn't it?

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.550
Crackling Magna Typhoon

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.550
We're never doing that move again!

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.550
Thank goodness you're all back safe.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:27.330
I'm gonna keep on showing the 
other Black Bulls how it's done!

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:32.310
Asta, my time has arrived! 
Make sure you keep up!

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.410
Yes, sir!

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.010
Oh, by the way, Magna.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.820
What's up?

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.740
They were so impressed with what I did 
during all the trouble at the capital

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.150
that they made me a third-class junior 
Magic Knight at a special awards ceremony!

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.850
Huh?

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.850
What?!

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:50.520
Wait, what's a third-class 
junior Magic Knight?

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.330
No idea.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:52.560
What?!

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.530
Have you guys been Magic Knights all 
this time without knowing what that is?

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.470
It's a Magic Knight rank.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.870
And since you guys haven't 
changed since you all joined,

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.350
you're still fifth-class Magic Knights.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.340
Better start showing Asta some respect.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.600
What?!

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.600
Huh?

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.140
And by the way, Charmy became 
a first-class junior Magic Knight.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.360
On your knees, inferiors!

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.460
What?!

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.990
Make sure you follow me, you inferiors!

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.990
Apparently, they were impressed that 
she captured one of the rebels.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.010
Looks to me like she was just trying 
to beat her up, though.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.150
Worship me!

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.180
What's that weird dance?

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.130
This is somehow very infuriating!

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.100
Anyway, well done, kid.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.680
But Captain Fuegoleon...

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.390
Huh? Fuegoleon?

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.900
Who do you think you're worrying about, punk?

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.530
That hot-blooded king of seriousness 
won't die that easily.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.400
I bet he'll come back even stronger.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.610
Of course!

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.650
All right! I'm going to train even 
harder and get stronger, too!

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:12.660
No, you're gonna rest.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.730
Huh?

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.510
You're too injured. You're going
to die. Are you stupid?

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.420
But you made me do it in the first place!

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.290
Yeah! You need to take a break!

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.410
You too, Noelle?

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:23.420
How stupid are you?

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.130
A break...

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.930
A break? You're getting time off, Asta?

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.300
Then let's head to a mixer!

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.310
Huh?!

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.430
A m-mixer?!

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.560
You get to work.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.740
I'll set everything up!

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.810
I just told you to get to work.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.910
Things are getting busy!

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.060
I'll kill you.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.820
Wait, do you wanna come too, Captain Yami?

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:06.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.570
And push me forward

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.640
(I can't find a place to go)

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:22.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.660
(Break free yourself)

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:52.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:58.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:01.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.290
Petit Clover

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.770
Petit Clover!

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.790
Captain Yami's Lecture
on Magic Knight Rankings

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.210
"Captain Yami's"... Wait, what is this?

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.690
"Magic Knight"... Ugh, I can't be bothered.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.290
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
1st Class Junior Magic Knight
2nd Class Junior Magic Knight

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:33.590
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
1st Class Junior Magic Knight
2nd Class Junior Magic Knight
 3rd Class Junior Magic Knight
4th Class Junior Magic Knight
5th Class Junior Magic Knight

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:30.220
So the most important is the Wizard King, 
and then there's Grand Magic Knight...

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.580
This is too much work.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.590
Why are you making a
Grand Magic Knight read this?

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.950
I'll kill you!

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.060
What?!

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.480
Is this what they call love?

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.770
My meal-saving prince!

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.030
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 28:
"The One I've Set My Heart On."

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:57.000
Page 28
 The One I've Set My Heart On

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.700
Wait, is Asta falling in love, too?
