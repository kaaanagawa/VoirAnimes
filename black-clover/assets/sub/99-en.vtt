00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.880
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.640
The Royal Capital was thrown 
into chaos by the attack of

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.510
the Magic Knights who had 
reincarnated into elves.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.730
Leopold and the other Crimson Lion Kings
 faced a life-or-death situation

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.270
after being attacked by 
their vice captain, Randall.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.520
And then...

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.040
None shall...

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.620
stand in my way.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.080
Even if I lose an arm, or my 
flesh is burned by flames...

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.840
As long as there are people waiting for me,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.480
I shall go to them, for I 
am Fuegoleon Vermillion,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.830
the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.770
You fought well, Leo.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.770
Brother!

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.780
As the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.250
and as your older brother,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.670
I will never lose... again!

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.160
Fuegoleon had finally awakened, and with 
the fire spirit, Salamander, at his side!

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.630
And around the same time, back at the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout...

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.010
You can head home first,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.590
you fools.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.220
Captain Mereo—

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.070
Mereoleona Vermillion tried to 
fight Raia and the others herself.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.780
The Desperate Path Toward Survival

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.700
What?

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.610
You're going to stay behind and try to 
stall all of us so those two can escape?

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.580
Well, aren't you nice to 
your friends, Miss Royalty?

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.840
You seem to have the wrong idea.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.380
Those kiddos would've just been in my way.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.370
Stall you? Don't make me laugh.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.230
I intend to kill all of you!

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.230
Kill all of us?

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.730
You're the one making me laugh.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.740
There's no way someone like you can't 
see what you're up against right now.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.900
Sorry, but we're going to go after 
that anti-magic kid really soon,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.830
because that grimoire and those 
swords belong to the real Licht.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.110
I don't really care about this 
"real Licht" or whatever,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.880
but you can shut up now.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.760
Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium...

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.750
Barrage!

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.770
If you're going to go after that fool,
 do it after you defeat me.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.270
Five against one...

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.840
You still need more of a handicap?

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.250
There's no way even Captain Mereoleona
 can fight all of them alone!

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.470
We have to go back and help her!

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.540
You dumbass. We're getting outta here.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.340
Huh?! What the hell are you 
talking about, you jerk?!

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.540
At this rate, Captain Mereoleona—

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.050
It's not like we have a strategy, 
so we'll just get killed if we go back.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.580
You might not have felt

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.850
how powerful they were,
since you don't have any magic.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.270
Believe me, I don't want a 
damn royal saving my ass.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.520
But this is the best way for 
at least some of us to survive.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.900
Don't you dare go wasting

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.910
the captain's resolve like that, you little shit.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.010
Wing Magic: Angel Wing Gift!

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.730
You think you can defeat all of us?

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.290
Humans sure have gotten 
cocky while we were asleep.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.800
I thought I told all of you to shut up.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.740
Then let's just get this over with.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.710
Unlike you selfish humans,
we elves are connected by strong bonds.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.070
Your attacks won't even touch us.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.580
Wing Magic: Angel Flapping!

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.250
Calidos Brachium!

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.140
Tch. That's too many for me.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.180
Picture Magic: Subterranean Giant's Iron Arm.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.080
I think you might have a hard time burning 
something this big. Don't you agree?

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.400
Here you go!

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.280
Tch...

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.340
It managed to graze me. My senses are shot.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.210
My attacks seem to be losing their edge, too.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.960
What's...

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.430
Snow Magic: Phantom Snow Box Garden.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.300
I'm forcibly putting the senses of 
everyone in this space to sleep.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.470
Of course, I mean everyone 
other than us elves.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.550
You crafty little brat.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.060
You're rather skilled at using mana,
 even though you're human.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.150
But it's only a matter of time 
before you won't be able to move.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.410
You've got some nerve to be attacking me,

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.350
Ruben!

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.270
My name is Rossa, not Ruben!

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.550
Also...

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.350
I don't know anyone as violent as you!

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.830
Is that so?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.670
Then I guess I don't need to hold back!

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.430
Sandstone Magic: Variable Hardness Prison!

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.700
Take your last breath in there.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.890
The end.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.120
Looks like it's happily ever after.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.690
Don't tell me...

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.120
Since you were a member 
of the Crimson Lion Kings,

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.500
I'll do you a favor

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.750
and kill you with my own flames!

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.750
What is this feeling? It's like my body knows 
this woman and is frightened of her...

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.840
I'll never let you kill my friends ever again!

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.160
Well, see ya, Miss Royalty.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.610
Raia!

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.080
What's wrong?

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.170
You're going to kill all 
the humans, aren't you?

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.840
But I'm still alive.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.140
Is this woman actually human?

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.890
Hurry up and... try to kill me!

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.650
You sure are a pain in the ass!

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.390
I'm...

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.650
still...

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.150
alive.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.900
Yeah, I'm at a loss for words.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:44.240
To think you can still stand 
back up after all those attacks...

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.250
I'll stand back up as many times as it takes...

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.250
Until I've killed all of you!

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.500
But I think it's about time we end this.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.090
Yeah...

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:04.350
You'll all be finished... after 
I use my most powerful spell.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.760
Mana Zone...

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.850
Full Release!

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.810
She still had this much magic?!

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.820
What is this stinging feeling?

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.450
My snow magic is being erased.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.460
Flame Magic...

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.470
Calidos Brachium Purgatory!

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.910
Owie, that hurt!

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.890
I used up quite a bit of mana on defense.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.890
That human is insane.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.270
My word, that human sure 
did a number on us.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.490
She was an unbelievable 
woman to the very end.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.500
She passed out on her feet. 
She <i>really</i> didn't want to go down, huh?

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.160
Hey...

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.930
Whoa, she's alive!

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.410
I can't believe it! Is she really human?

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.510
Hurry up... and come at me.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:08.060
She can't even move after using 
up all her magic, and yet...

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.260
Damn, you're scary.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.890
We need to kill her right here and now.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.130
I'm all for that.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.990
Let's send her out with a bang.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.340
Copy Light Magic...

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.380
Snow Magic...

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.780
Wing Magic...

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.860
Picture Magic...

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.330
Sandstone Magic...

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.970
Captain Mereoleona!

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.630
Sheesh...

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.850
You fools...

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.990
You really are idiots.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.900
You just wasted all the 
time this lady bought you.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.910
Compound Magic: Elemental Quintet!

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.410
You can all die together!

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.840
But this is the best way for 
at least some of us to survive.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.430
Don't you dare go wasting

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.430
the captain's resolve like that, you little shit.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.690
Who gave her permission to 
sacrifice herself like that?!

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.820
And I've just decided that all three of 
us are going to survive this together!

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.950
Give it a rest, you little shit.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:59.560
Even in your black anti-magic form, 
you can't shake all five of those monsters.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.140
Yeah, that's right! Besides,
 that form is drawn to huge magic,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.800
so it's not great at running away!

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.510
Well, if you know all that,
 don't brag about it!

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.690
What the hell are you gonna do?

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.400
What am I gonna do?

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.770
Oh, I know! Your magic!

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.840
The thing where you double 
the magic and bounce it back!

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.850
Wha?

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.650
All five of them will launch 
spells at the same time.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.770
That's when we'll bounce 
their spells back at them!

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.150
All five of them attack at once?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.930
Like anything that convenient 
will ever happen, you moron.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.500
Well, look at that. It actually happened.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.750
This is all thanks to the captain 
managing to weaken them.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.010
He's ignoring the force of those spells?

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.010
I'll use my counter trap to double it...

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.520
But just doubling it won't 
be enough to throw them off!

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.940
Then I'll fling it back!

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.860
He shot it at the brat?

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.770
Then, after we double it, 
we'll double it again!

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.660
We'll quadruple it!

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:27.130
Damn it... How dare you 
find us a chance like this?

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.360
I'm not taking responsibility 
for the consequences!

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.140
Shit! I knew I threw the circle together 
too fast, and now it's falling apart.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.430
I won't be able to—

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:45.210
Heads... up!

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.950
Okay, let's get the heck outta here!

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.950
We made it out!

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.340
See? I told you we could save 
her if we worked together!

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.040
We just got lucky because we managed 
to get one coincidence after another.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.960
Deflate that giant head of yours, you moron.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.340
You're definitely going to get hurt someday.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.030
And when that happens, I hope 
you'll help me if you can!

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.140
Man, my head hurts.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.390
Hang on, now...

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.270
I'm not letting <i>you</i> get away.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.030
I'm gonna have you come with me to see Licht.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:37.040
You're going to return that grimoire 
and those swords to Licht.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.400
I won't make it in time.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.410
Zora!

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.410
Take care of Captain Mereoleona!

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.160
Hey!

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.420
I promise I'll make it back alive!

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.680
So head on back first!

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.920
You can't be serious!

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.410
What did you just say earlier?

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.420
Weren't the three of us 
gonna survive this together?

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.930
I'll make sure you regret it if you 
don't make it back, you hear me?!

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.040
You little shit!

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.250
What's wrong, everyone?

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.760
Klaus? Hamon?

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.760
Yuno?

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.100
Are you referring to us?

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.370
Klaus?

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.630
Do not speak to us.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.570
You are not one of us.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.800
What are you—

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.730
She seems to be royalty.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.030
Indeed, she does.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.950
We will never forgive you humans!

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.500
I need to concentrate on defense for now.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.260
Plant Recovery Magic: 
Princess Healing Flower Robe!

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.720
It's no use.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.730
You don't have any time to rest, royal.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.570
You accursed royal...

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.330
That's a fitting look for you.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.210
They're not their usual selves.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.590
Both their magic and their
 personalities are totally different.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.570
Even Yuno!

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.860
It appears he doesn't have 
a clear sense of self yet.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.970
Indeed. I'm sure he'll figure 
that out as some time passes.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.120
Stop squirming! Ugh, you're such a pain!

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.070
Asta?

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.790
Mimosa?!

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.110
Asta...

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.780
You okay?! Who the heck did this to you?

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.830
Hang on! I'll get you down!

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.920
Hold it.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.370
I will not allow you to free that 
descendant of criminals.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:37.880
Klaus and... the chubby 
guy from the Golden Dawn?

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:42.010
You can't be serious... Not you guys, too!

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.370
You mean... the others, too?

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.390
No!

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.050
Stop it! I don't want to fight my friends!

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.520
Wake up!

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.520
We're—

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.810
Yu...no?

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.200
H-Hey... Don't tell me...

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.210
Yuno's an enemy, too?

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.690
Yuno!

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.520
Petit Clover

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.910
Petit Clover!

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.020
The Mereoleona Challenge

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.330
The Mereoleona Challenge!

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.690
Try saying "Mereoleona" ten times!

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.630
Mereoleona, Mereoleona, Mereoleona, 
Mereoleona, Mereoleona, Mera—

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.680
You fool!

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.020
That's what you get for failing!

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:12.860
Next!

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.730
Mereoleona, Mereoleona, Mereoleona, Mero—

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.460
Pathetic!

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.640
Show us how it's done, Captain Mereoleona!

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.040
Listen carefully, you foolish kiddos.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.730
Mana Zone: Full Release!

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.840
Gulp...

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.070
Meo—

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.090
Captain!

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.440
Impossible!

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.870
Hey, Yuno! Don't tell me you've 
turned into an enemy, too!

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.320
Remember our promise!

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.610
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 100: "We Won't Lose to You."

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 100
 We Won't Lose to You

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.530
Not giving up is my magic!
