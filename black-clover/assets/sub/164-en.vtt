WEBVTT

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.780
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.220
a devil.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.390
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.710
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.710
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.880
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.750
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.700
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.760
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.390
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.690
Just being fast won't be enough to defeat me.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.990
Skin Magic: Skin Fort!

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.450
True Lightning Magic: Ceranos!

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.660
One of the Dark Disciples, Svenkin, 
who attacked the Heart Kingdom with Vanica,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.020
was defeated by Luck after a fierce battle.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.550
Meanwhile, the Black Bulls' hideout 
was under attack by Dante.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.420
Stop!

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.550
Gauche!

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.700
Grey was able to save Gauche, who was 
mortally injured, with unknown magic.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.740
Grey?!

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.860
She sealed his wound?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.510
She can do that with 
her transformation magic?

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.920
What is this magic?

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.540
Asta was enraged after seeing his friends 
get hurt, and his devil powers went berserk.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.290
But his attacks still didn't work on Dante.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.550
Magnificent!

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.030
To think there was another arcane stage.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.720
Dante tried to take Vanessa and Grey, 
who were both also arcane stage mages.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.420
But then Yami arrived.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.980
Hey!

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.680
Keep your filthy mitts off my squad.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.530
But Yami was the one Dante was truly after!

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.940
He believes the key to connect this 
world with the underworld is Yami.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.360
Arcane stage? Serve your ends? 
The hell are you talking about?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.540
I only brought them in because I liked them.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.950
Mana Zone: Condense...

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.520
Dark Cloaked Iai Slash.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.520
Ain't no way in hell I'm gonna let

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.770
a creep like you have any of them.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.230
Battlefield: Heart Kingdom

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.130
Kill...

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.520
Kill... I'll kill them! They will pay...

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.890
Kill... Kill...

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.260
What...

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.260
Kill...

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.520
What the heck happened?

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.860
My body won't move.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.030
Wait! Gauche!

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.790
I can sense Gauche's ki.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.650
He's alive! Thank goodness!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.790
That Spade bastard...

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.800
While using Mana Zone with
condensed mana, my iai blade...

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.970
will never miss.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.940
I never imagined anyone would 
make me use this magic.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.840
What the hell is that magic?

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.300
This power is completely different 
from the magic he was using earlier!

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.300
What's going on?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.970
Envy, rage, hatred... I can't get enough.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.900
Splendid, Yami Sukehiro!

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.020
I was bored... of absolutely everything.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.580
There wasn't a single thing...

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.330
the could satisfy my malice.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.530
It's just starting. We've only 
just begun, Yami Sukehiro.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.590
You will open up an even 
more wonderful world.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.130
Yeah, just stop. You're creepy as hell,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.120
Mr. Psycho Hipster Goatee.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.860
You said something about me 
being the key to the underworld,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.760
but I dunno what you're talking about.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.360
I don't have any mysterious powers like that.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.700
The thing that connects this 
world with the underworld is...

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.520
a magic channel called the Tree of Qliphoth.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.200
And to create that Tree of Qliphoth,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.090
we need dark magic and world 
tree magic at the arcane stage.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.940
Yes...

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.470
That means you, Yami Sukehiro,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.970
and William Vangeance.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.260
This guy knows about William, too.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.720
And what happens once this world 
connects with the underworld?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.520
Devils will pour into this world.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.120
Once this world is filled with devils...

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.800
It will be overcome with 
every possible malice.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.290
Oh, what a delight.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.330
Wouldn't you agree, Yami Sukehiro?

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.840
Yeah...

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.840
Guess I'm gonna have to 
take you out here and now!

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.450
If anyone dares to harm this 
kingdom's nature or food,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.350
I, Charmy, will never let that stand!

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.750
O flames...

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.240
Shine beautifully upon me and my hair.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.270
Oh, no... The Polnfrume Forest...

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.250
We're finished!

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.790
The Spirit Guardian's been defeated.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.500
Sir Potrof shielded us...

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.260
You're truly blessed.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.650
You get to engrave

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:59.780
Dark Disciple
Halbet Chevour

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:01.160
the beauty of the Dark Disciple 
Halbet Chevour into your eyes before you die.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.810
What do you think you're doing?

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.860
Oh?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.360
It seems an unsightly fatty has arrived.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.780
Sir Potrof! Charmy is here!

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.170
Charmy...

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.400
Charmy!

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.820
Hey, Charmy. Did you sneak 
away from training again?

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.550
Want to take a break and have some food?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.050
You have an amazing talent!
Let's do our best together!

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.560
You won't get away with this.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.480
It's Charmy's sheep!

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.570
Save us, Charmy!

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.080
I guess your magic is as slow as you are.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.070
Oh, dear. Perhaps this is 
what they call "affinity"...

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.430
Our spells are going 
right through each other.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.890
But there's one very decisive difference.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.310
My magic is able to protect me...

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.240
But your magic cannot protect you.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.490
Not only is my hair absolutely 
beautiful thanks to the devil's powers,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.260
it's also the strongest!

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.250
Charmy!

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:56.590
You're so pleasantly plump, you'll have
 no chance of escaping my attacks.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.650
Consuming food is idiotic.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.960
All you need for beauty is nutrition.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.010
There's no way you can beat me with my 
beauty, strength, and proper nutrition.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.100
I'm done looking at an unsightly fatty.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.040
Let my beauty embrace you as you die!

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.280
Hey.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.030
You need to shut your mouth. Didn't I tell you?

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.510
You won't get away with this.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.110
Hey.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.040
You need to shut your mouth. Didn't I tell you?

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.000
You won't get away with this.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.020
What?

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.120
She doesn't even have devil powers.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.540
What in the world is this magic?

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.120
Food Magic: Glutton's Banquet.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.520
Well, isn't she an agile one?

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.270
In that case...

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.260
I'll just have to cook her.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.540
What are you doing?!

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.360
The Mana Method is my kitchen.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.720
And when I cook there...

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.030
Any dish becomes delicious, so the 
wolf won't be such a picky eater!

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.810
It appears as though I created a monster.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.660
How dare you do this to 
someone as beautiful as me?!

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.610
Lookin' good.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.390
I'll just... help myself!

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.930
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.440
True beauty and strength come 
from a well-balanced diet!

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.410
Thanks, Charmy!

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.200
You gobbled her right up!

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.460
The Fire Spirit Guardian, Sir Floga,
 has also been defeated.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.960
I can't believe he couldn't 
defeat them, either.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.440
What is with that attack, anyway?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.460
There's no way to dodge that!

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.460
There's no way that Clover 
Kingdom boy can win.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.850
Where did they—

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.230
Well, he's tough.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.430
My attack didn't even pierce his body.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:56.750
But I wonder how long you'll hold up. 
Your mana just keeps draining away.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:03.150
Dark Disciple
Sivoir Snyle

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:04.000
You're just going to get punched to 
death by me, the Dark Disciple Sivoir.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.010
You cannot escape my 
Eye Magic: Catoblepas's Evil Eye.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.690
The countless eyes floating in the 
air can not only see where you are,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.510
but can identify your mana 
and stamina, too.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:21.020
I can even predict your next move from where 
you're looking and how your muscles move!

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.570
When I use those eyes to lock on to you

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.520
and shoot my magic shells made 
from my condensed mana...

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.030
They'll never miss!

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.440
Damn it...

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.360
Floga...

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.270
Why not concentrate on your strengths?

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.380
My... strengths?

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.680
You have the strength to endure.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.900
You're you, remember, Leo?

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.520
Sharpen your senses!

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.770
There you are!

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.650
Flame Magic: Profound Spiral Flames!

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.270
You dumbass. I can easily dodge that attack.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.160
You may be using the Heart Kingdom's arrays 
or whatever, but there's still no point.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.090
His attack this time took 
longer than the others.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.420
That's because he dodged my attack.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.830
You can move closer all you want.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.180
I'll just have to go farther away.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.530
The enemy is moving, but just as I thought,

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.630
the distance between us hasn't changed.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.990
He's keeping as much distance 
from me as possible

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.690
while staying in his attack range.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.200
I've never been injured or 
experienced pain during a battle.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:02.200
There's no way an attack from a 
simpleton like you will ever hit me.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:05.830
Endure...

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.960
I'm not going down until I defeat him!

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.960
Just die already. Man, you don't
 know when to give up.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.980
It's true. I may not have as much 
talent as my brother and sister.

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:32.480
But with those two in front of me, 
I've endured and let my inner flames blaze!

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.490
There's no way you're gonna win 
if you're just enduring, dumbass.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.410
Let's end this.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.720
What?

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.320
This is...

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.740
What is this giant array?

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.960
When did he...

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.720
I endured and took my time making it.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:12.760
All while you couldn't 
keep your eyes off of me.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.500
I have to get out of this array!

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.350
True Flame Magic:

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.800
Crimson Eruption!

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.040
Wow...

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.640
I've never seen an array so big.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.300
It's hot, hot, hot! I don't like pain!

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:47.310
I've never even gotten scratched before!
 How dare you?! How dare you?!

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.320
Thanks to all your yowling, 
I know exactly where you are now!

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.820
How dare you say that after all 
the innocent people you hurt?!

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.410
S-Stop...

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.870
If you aren't prepared to get hurt,

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:09.660
stay off the battlefield!

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.680
You won't have your way, Dark Disciple!

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.860
Wow!

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.680
You're amazing, Sir Gaja!

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.610
I hate to admit it, but you're 
definitely on another level,

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.820
even among the Spirit Guardians, Gaja.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.170
I somehow made it in time.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.050
I need to get everyone to safety and 
return to Queen Loropechika immediately.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.030
They've defeated all of the Dark Disciples.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.950
Excellent work, everyone.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.200
Hmph. That's the least they could do.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.710
Thank goodness! Great job, everyone!

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:56.460
My water can't reach where the 
enemies were, so I'm grateful.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.750
It doesn't matter how powerful 
their opponents are.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.220
The Magic Knights of the Clover Kingdom

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.800
evolve when they're in battle.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.090
I sense the mana of some luscious girls!

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.490
We knew you would show up.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.440
So we were ready for you!

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.200
Plant Magic: Magic Cannon Flower!

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.410
You're disgusting!

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.170
That was a splendid attack, Mimosa!

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.170
It's all thanks to the mana you sent me.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.930
Yoo-hoo!

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.690
Such ominous mana...

00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.020
It's just been so long since I've 
seen you, so I came to play!

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.580
My widdle Loropechika!

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.500
Petit Clover

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.880
Petit Clover!

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.010
The Strength to Endure

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.130
The Strength to Endure.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.890
Are you almost at the end 
of your rope, Miz Charmy?

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.100
I'm still totally fine, la.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.150
You don't need to push yourself, either, Leo.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.200
Nay! Floga has shown me 
the strength to endure,

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.780
and I shall use it to defeat you, my rival.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.410
It's hot!

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.570
W-Water!

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.870
Y-You can hop out anytime, Miz Charmy!

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.480
A-A-Asta, you're turning blue.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.550
Leo, you don't do well with the cold, do you?

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.040
The strength... to endure!

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.720
My, but they're lively.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.860
Vanica, I will not let you 
have your way any longer.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.140
I now have friends I can depend on!

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.950

 Water Crusade
