WEBVTT

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.840
H-H-H-H...

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.110
And you're barely staying on your feet.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.340
You sound out of breath, my rival.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.040
Not yet...

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.700
Just you wait!

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.450
So that's what the creatures
here were scared of.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.030
That's my line!

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.680
Aw, it got away. Too bad.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.190
Speak for yourself, dumbass!

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.520
I think it's pretty strong. We came 
here because we wanted to fight it, too.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.680
La?

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.840
Looks like that spider wanted 
to eat you, too, Charmy.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.830
How dare you?! I just missed out 
on eating the nummies in there!

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.340
I'm nearing my limit... 
But my rival is also suffering.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.640
Luck, Magna, thank you.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.040
That was a close one!

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.960
You okay?

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.160
La!

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.530
La?

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.320
I can't... hold on any longer!

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.940
N-Now's not the time for that...

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.510
I'm not letting this big one get away!

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.590
Charmy, h-hurry and let go of the net!

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.940
It's so powerful...

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.510
Look out!

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.330
Not yet! Hold up, Noelle!

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.290
But then, when I tried to become 
a member of the Royal Knights

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.610
and competed against each 
other to reach new heights.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.150
Ever since then, we've fought together,
 trained together,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.980
I felt something in my heart 
when you told of us your dreams.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.640
Despite that you were 
a peasant with no magic,

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.260
and shut you all up!

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.300
become the Wizard King,

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.300
I'm going to pile up merit,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.710
Listen up, you bastards!

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.920
The moment I first met you...

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.170
Asta!

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.710
I can't let this get to me if 
I want to be the Wizard King!

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.010
Of you, probably.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.320
But I will not lose!

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.490
How are our magic levels so different 
when we're both royalty?

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.320
I'm having a harder time getting 
through than I thought.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.170
it's the worst possible compatibility 
with my water magic.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.450
With the mana in here being this powerful,

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.100
She's so fast!

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:41.820
Wha—

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.850
Pardon me!

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.410
Reinforcement Magic: Leg Strength Boost!

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.350
No, it'll be me!

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.240
I'm getting to the goal first!

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.950
I'm not done yet!

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.170
Right!

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.370
Let's show them what the 
Crimson Lion Kings are truly made of!

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.050
Is that all you've got? 
Leo and Asta are far ahead of us!

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.620
Stay calm, stay calm...

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.290
If I get irritated, I'll lose even more control.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.230
Calm down, calm down...

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.310
They're distracting me and making 
me lose control of my magic.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.990
Ugh, they're so loud!

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.900
Jeez, could you be any less motivated?!

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.520
So that I can go into the hot spring.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.770
Actually, Nero, what the 
heck did you come for?

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.350
I'm not going to lose, my rival!

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.680
That's the spirit!

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.710
...we just have to shout!

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.560
At times like this...

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.140
I'm starting to get dizzy from all the heat!

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.510
which is exhausting us 
at an unbelievable rate.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.760
The deeper we go, the more the 
mana underground increases,

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.080
Hot, hot, hot!

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.990
I'm not going to lose!

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.690
Hot, hot, hot!

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.560
There's no room! Let me pass by, Asta!

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.980
I'm going to get to the goal first!

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.100
as their training ground.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.110
Wait... this isn't a shortcut to the goal?!

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:08.250
La! I can feel it! The ingredients 
are hiding in fear of something!

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:03.250
Something's wrong... I sense the 
unknown creatures down there.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.370
Maybe they're not here.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.310
But you haven't been able 
to catch a single thing.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:53.400
La! We need to taste the unknown creatures 
and replenish our mana right away!

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.860
Charmy, it's dangerous 
to stay here much longer!

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.510
It's so hot... My mana is being used 
up much faster than I expected.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.560
Nummies...

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.600
Hi-yah!

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.390
such a powerful aura?

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.390
How am I supposed to not fight 
it when it's emitting

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.930
We don't have time to fight 
anything like that, you dumbass!

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.740
to take down the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
who killed my brother,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:21.210
Don't worry. The strong guy lurking 
in this cave should be right up here.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.330
Isn't the goal deeper underground?!

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.570
And anyway, is this really a shortcut?!

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.530
I'm gonna kill you, no matter what!

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.490
I'll kill—

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.570
I'll kill—

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.370
You little shit... You did 
that on purpose, didn't you?!

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.590
My bad, Magna.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.680
if I let my guard down for 
one second, I'm in trouble.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.310
Even with this magic item helping me out,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.490
The heat from the mana 
down here is so intense...

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.600
How do you expect to survive 
if you can't even handle this?

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.770
Petit Clover

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.990
A dungeon, eh? Things are getting exciting.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.190
Don't tell me that's...

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.550
Must be an ancient curse.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.280
Elaborate camouflage that 
even I couldn't see through...

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.550
That must be how it kept hiding from you.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.040
And...

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:51.180
That thing has man-made mana within it.
 Mana it wasn't born with.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.330
But it appears that bug isn't a mere mutant.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.280
Or so I'd like to say...

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.030
I can't argue with that.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.150
True... I didn't picture 
this as an actual battle.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.840
Petit Clover!

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.980
Not to mention, we're going to be 
facing a devil from another world!

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.230
The unexpected always happens in battle!

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.720
Don't be naïve!

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.700
If you knew that thing was down here,
 you should've told us—

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.520
How could you do something like that?!

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.210
It attacked you, thinking you 
were food, just as I planned.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.680
So I decided to try to throw you lot in here.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.200
It never shows itself before me.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.920
but I'm sure it's able to sense 
those that are stronger than it is.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.900
I wanted to teach it a lesson,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.190
eating up all the creatures around here.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.230
Hey, where's your food?

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.930
May my roar resonate through 
the depths of the earth!

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.270
Page 133
The Lion Awakens, Continued

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.540
Next time on <i>Black Clover, Page 133: 
"The Lion Awakens, Continued."</i>

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.420
I will conquer it first!

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.870
Just watch, Asta, my rival.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.960
A dungeon?!

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.950
You went too far!

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.320
No, 10,000!

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.040
Actually, I'm just gonna surpass 
that and go to scenario 100!

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.570
And scenario 3!

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.010
You just didn't eat!

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.210
Ha! I surpassed you in eating!

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.560
That bug is a mutant that 
recently showed up and has been

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.870
Let's dig in!

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.730
Scenario 2!

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.480
You didn't surpass me! You cut in line!

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.780
What?!

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.780
See ya!

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:14.830
Captain Yami! I can't hold it
any longer! Please come out!

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.670
Scenario 1!

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:08.570
Scenario 1

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.170
Asta! I've made up my mind to catch 
up to you and surpass you immediately!

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.520
I'll Surpass You.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.080
I'll Surpass You

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:22.040
I-I'm royalty! I may make others wait, 
but I don't wait for anyone!

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:51.610
What's wrong?!

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.230
We're in a cave! A cave! We're not at the beach!

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.480
G-Get a grip, me!

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.310
I'm seeing nothing but the ocean!

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.270
Let's go swim together!

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.140
Wait up, Noelle!

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.590
Stay calm... Calm down and take another look...

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.210
What?!

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.340
Noelle!

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.910
N-No, it couldn't be! I must be seeing things.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.120
Swim trunks?!

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.280
Wait up!

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.980
No!

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.990
Hold up, Noelle!

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.940
I can't keep this up much longer.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.440
We're still not at the goal?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.710
I'm going to catch up to you!

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.330
I've continued training hard to this day.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.000
With that frustration still in my heart,

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.510
I will get revenge for Captain Fuegoleon,
 no matter what!

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.860
Leopold...

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.170
and surpass you!

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.230
I will train even harder, 
catch up to all of you,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.910
I was not chosen.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.670
Crap—

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.950
Really?

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:53.470
You never look this happy after 
our daily training sessions.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.680
Yes.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.090
You can stand, can't you, Leo?

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.550
You okay?!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.270
Leopold!

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.740
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.030
Take this!

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.570
I missed?!

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.020
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:04.680
Asta!

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.600
There's another reason why 
I chose this underground cave

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.030
You okay? What the heck is that monster?!

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.550
Asta?!

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.500
Was it my imagination?

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.350
Asta?

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.600
I wonder why...

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.240
The mana seems calmer in here.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:11.320
Honestly... Th-That was his fault 
for talking to me out of nowhere.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.240
Hey, Noelle! Where'd you go?!

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.740
What the heck was that for?!

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.670
Whoa!

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.320
What?!

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.010
Hey! Where the hell are we?!

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.550
I've heard of your adventures 
fighting the elves and the devil.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.550
It's been a while, my rival.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.230
Leo! And Captain Fuegoleon?!

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.470
Of course...

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.060
You'll be training, of course!

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.970
Lady Mereoleona, since you brought 
us here, does that mean...

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.550
Yul...tim?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.160
This is a strong magic region, 
the Yultim Volcano!

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.800
Right... This is the first 
visit here for most of you.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.790
I'm losing calories just by standing 
here and getting hungry, la!

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.540
This is so exciting, isn't it?!

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.430
Why did I wake up in a crazy place like this?!

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.710
And I heard you were fighting on the 
front lines with the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.610
We see it, all right...

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.480
Yultim
Volcano
Trail

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.480
Shut up. You'll see when we get there.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.060
Where are we supposed to go?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.780
I seriously have no idea 
what's going on right now!

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.470
This seems fun!

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.800
But we haven't finished eating our cakes, la!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.210
No! I have nothing but 
bad feelings about this!

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.150
All of you who are here 
right now, come with me.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.120
I don't see Yami, but whatever.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.870
So... what brings you here today?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.570
the devil who was manipulating the 
whole situation from the shadows.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.230
Huh? Wha?!

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.780
Hold it.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.890
All right! Let's haul ass to 
the hot springs at the top!

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.140
We were kidnapped, just like last time.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.750
I wouldn't call this "invited."

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.050
Yes, ma'am!

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.510
we'll be training with the Crimson Lion 
Kings and the others I have invited.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.300
Just like last time,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.790
we'll all have to become stronger individually.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.880
and in order to prove Asta's innocence,

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.830
We will protect this kingdom as the 
proud Magic Knights that we are,

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.400
I hear that the devil in the 
Spade Kingdom is an even bigger threat.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.120
I see your door is as weak as ever.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.920
The only one to blame here is

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.650
What are you talking about?

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.020
We ended up turning against all of you, 
our allies. We're deeply sorry.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.710
In the previous battle, the three of 
us had our bodies taken over by elves.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.300
I am the Vice Captain of the Crimson 
Lion Kings, Randall Luftair.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.890
Vice Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Randall Luftair

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.830
Do you have a moment?

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.590
Black Bulls...

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.230
Hey! Well, I've gotten more muscles, too!

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.210
Not only did I get taller, 
I've grown as a Magic Knight, too!

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.490
Hey, did you get a little taller?!

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.370
After receiving some time off from Yami,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.870
On the contrary, they were very proud of him

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.850
But no one in Hage Village had 
doubted Asta, not even for a second.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.190
Please believe that.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.250
Asta isn't a devil's servant. 
He's actually trying to defeat them.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.180
That article is mistaken.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.170
Right. About that...

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.220
I saw you in the paper.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.010
was suspected of being a devil's servant.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.290
they learned that the village 
already knew that Asta

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.090
Once they reached Hage,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.590
On the way, he unexpectedly reunited 
with Yuno, who was also heading home.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.620
Asta headed back to his home village of Hage.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.080
and Yuno for becoming Magic Knights 
and saving the village.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.850
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.490
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.020
or even if you're poor...

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.680
He continues to diligently 
aim for the top!

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.760
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.920
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.630
His name is Asta.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.970
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.640
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.080
Thanks!

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.890
Mereoleona Vermillion

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.490
I-I knew it! You're...

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.730
I'm pretty sure this has happened before...

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.810
led by Mister Yami, the Black Bu—

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.810
Don't you know this is the hideout 
of the Magic Knights Squad

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.110
You bastard! I have no idea who 
the hell you are, but keep it down!

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.470
Magna's covered in cake!

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.910
Thanks, Charmy.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.160
In that case, here. All of you have 
some so you can work even harder.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.340
so we can go up against the 
devil with everything we've got!

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.830
We need to get even stronger

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.580
It's so good! I can feel the 
energy flowing through me!

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.820
You won't be climbing the volcano this time.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.950
Try some. You need your nutrients.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.660
There are other things to 
think about, aren't there?

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.700
Well, aren't you all riled up 
first thing in the morning, Asta!

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.850
I'm gonna get even stronger!

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.720
Just you watch, Yuno!

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.300
The Lion Awakens

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.510
...let's continue moving forward.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.310
In order to protect everyone...

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.360
We've only just begun.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.580
But it's not over yet.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.580
Asta and Yuno got to enjoy 
a brief visit back home.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.660
Sh-Shut up! Don't make me kill you!

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.780
Me!

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:18.780
No, me!

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.070
No, it'll be me!

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.530
I'm gonna get to the goal first!

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.940
Yeah!

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.470
the heat of this strong magic region!

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.300
Get through this trial with burning 
desire that surpasses even

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.180
You are the proud Magic Knights 
of the Clover Kingdom.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.040
It appears you're all prepared.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.170
Mana Skin... I should be able to handle 
that now by donning my Valkyrie Armor.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.170
Shut your stupid mouth!

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.480
Nyah, nyah, Scaredy-Cat Magna!

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.140
It'll be me!

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.200
Ha, so you <i>were scared!</i>

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.280
I'll figure out this Mana Skin 
business in no time!

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.710
I've got no time to be scared!

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.990
Not bad, Asta!

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.230
Well done, my rival! 
I'm feeling even more fired up!

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.900
All right, this will work!

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.560
He surrounded his body with anti-magic.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.180
Oh?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.390
so that I don't immediately get 
sucked in by the powerful magic.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.840
I'm going to concentrate 
and control my powers

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.380
But now, I have some control over it.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.260
Uh, but...

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.050
It's no fun for them to just 
try to get to the hot spring.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.550
Well... I wonder how many 
of them will reach the goal.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.590
Wait!

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.040
Just you wait, unknown ingredients that 
were seasoned by the underground mana!

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.450
Hell yeah!

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.700
I assure you that they are.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.660
So these creatures... Are they delicious?

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:01.530
I want to become stronger so I can 
fight alongside the other Black Bulls.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.530
If you have no desire to grow, then flee.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.830
but also unknown creatures that 
have adapted to such conditions.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.540
You will endure not only 
scorching mana in the cave,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.810
I won't stop you.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.920
but I couldn't control it at all.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.090
I'm going to run away, la.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.390
Shh! I'm starving, so I have no interest 
in going anywhere that has no food.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.540
Charmy, where are you going?

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.200
Sneaky-sneak...

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.670
Yes!

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.650
Let us go, too!

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.520
Wait up, damn it!

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.380
I'm gonna leave you behind if 
you dawdle too long, Magna!

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.950
I won't lose, either!

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.530
Hot spring...

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:21.730
It'll be me!

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.180
If your Mana Skin falters,

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.650
I dunno.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.630
Wait. What the hell is Mana Skin?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.710
It actually exists?!

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.310
You're not ready for that!

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.750
sweet honey flows instead of lava!

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.320
I request that we switch over 
to the sweets region where

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.660
Hot... spring?

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.820
Well? Doesn't that make you excited?

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.570
has an even better hot spring!

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.710
Have no fear. The goal, which is
 the deepest part of the cave,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.890
and burn up, reducing you to ashes.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.750
your bodies will be exposed 
to the immense mana

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.950
You Magic Knights essentially 
enhance your physical abilities

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.380
the stronger the influence of 
the mana heat source becomes.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.000
Which means the further you go underground,

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.630
become lava due to the heat 
and burst onto the surface.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.990
The rocks deep underground 
that are soaked in this mana

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.700
An enormous mana heat 
source deep underground.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.200
It's what makes this volcano 
a strong magic region...

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.950
...Underground Cave?

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.320
Yultim...

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.050
Into the Yultim Underground Cave!

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.240
Yultim Volcano Underground Cave

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.190
You'll be heading underneath the volcano...

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.300
but it's only a supplement.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.530
flowing through my sword and into my body,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.440
Back then, I went into my 
black state by using the power

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.620
Yeah...

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.120
If it stops working,
 you'll be burnt to a crisp.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.120
That one power of yours takes a lot out 
of you and doesn't last for long, right?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.740
You say that, but what are you even 
going to do when you can't use Mana Skin?

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.760
And I'm going to just keep 
moving forward to get stronger!

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:45.810
I will overcome this blazing mana with 
my flame magic and reach the goal first!

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.590
All right! Let the training begin!

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.800
Huh?

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.000
If you lose control of your magic, 
the item's effectiveness will be lost.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.030
The Clover Kingdom.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.400
It's a magic item that'll help 
you use your Mana Skins,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.910
What's this?

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.530
I will allow you to use this magic item.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.630
For those who were brought 
here unexpectedly,

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.690
What?!

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.470
Then be reduced to ash.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.230
Wait, you can't expect us to 
be able to do that right away!

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.360
and your body is constantly 
protected by enormous mana.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.150
Flawlessly don your magic like so,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.850
