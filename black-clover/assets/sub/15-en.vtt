00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.670
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.510
A new dungeon was discovered on 
the border of the Clover Kingdom.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.390
Asta, Noelle, and Luck of the Black 
Bulls were assigned to investigate it.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.730
W-Wow!

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.490
Here it is, Asta.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.650
This.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.150
Where?

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.060
Hup.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.230
The dungeon was filled with traps.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.420
This is so much fun!

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.130
Isn't this exciting?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.590
We're going to die if we stay with this guy.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.260
Now, then...

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.510
I think I'm about to reach my limit.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.520
I knew it.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.060
There are others here.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.270
The strongest looking one is...

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.860
Something important just came up.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.370
So I'm leaving the dungeon 
exploration to you guys!

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.050
Don't worry.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.870
No matter what kind of traps might spring up,
I'll slice through them with my sword.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.840
We're alone right now.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.370
Something wrong?

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.530
It's nothing! Nothing at all!

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.340
Let's hurry.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.980
A trap! Oh, no!

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.810
Noelle!

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.360
Asta and Noelle were in danger. And then...

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.480
Crap!

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.650
Such precise and powerful magic...

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.540
Who could it be?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.510
Now...

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.090
I've repaid my debt,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.800
Asta.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.800
Yuno...

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.910
I would always close my eyes

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.110
And cower at reality

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.870
I can't stand the idea

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.170
Of just making excuses to give up

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.270
Stand right there

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.470
I don't want to be near you

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.340
Any minute now

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.920
Just wait right there

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.920
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.250
Black and blue

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.090
I'll give up on giving up

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.140
And get the world on my side

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.810
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.150
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.280
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.450
And head where the light shines

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.290
I want to keep my promise

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.840
I'll deliver it to you

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.920
shape of love

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.560
The Diamond Mage

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.220
Captain Vangeance!

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.540
What is it?

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.000
Sir, about the exploration 
of the new dungeon...

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.860
Why did you send that new peasant 
recruit on such an important mission?

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.650
Do you trust me?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.840
Of course.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.600
I, Alecdora Sandler, am ready to die for you.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.100
In that case, I'd like you to trust 
him, too. Because I trust him.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.610
He's also a member of the Golden Dawn.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.690
I'm sure he'll become an even 
more powerful force for us.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.610
Yes, sir.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.240
Yes... We need him to get stronger.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.050
So he's Yuno? And that's...

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.880
Yuno,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.390
why did you bother saving them?

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.790
Our only mission is to explore this dungeon...

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.630
In other words, to quickly reach the 
treasure chamber buried deep below.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.120
We don't have any time 
to waste on these fools.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.160
Hey, Yuno. What's the deal 
with this rude four-eyed dude?

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.370
He's my senior.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.360
Four—

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.090
You're the rude one!

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.870
I'm a four... er, I'm a nobleman! 
How dare you address me so casually?!

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.660
He's flustered all of a sudden.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.690
Member of the Golden Dawn
Mimosa Vermillion

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.690
Good day, Noelle.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.240
I don't think I've seen you since 
the royal banquet last year.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.130
You know her?

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.800
Yes... Somewhat.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.350
I'm Noelle's cousin.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.390
Huh...

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.390
So, you're here, too.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.960
It just had to be her...

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.420
I've heard the Black Bulls are a very 
barbaric squad. Have you been faring well?

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.260
And are you doing okay, Mimosa?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.070
Huh?

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.660
I'm not sure someone as dense as you 
can make it in the Golden Dawn.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.480
Yes! Everyone is so kind.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.290
Because of that, I've been able to 
use my magic without hesitation.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.260
If I remember correctly, you weren't 
able to control your magic at all.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.920
Have things improved since then?

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.900
She's as obliviously rude as ever. 
She still pisses me off.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.430
I-I've been working on it.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.850
Oh, the three of us recently received 
a star from the Wizard King himself

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.940
for another mission.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.730
Hmph.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.810
We just got a star, too!

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.840
Hmph.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.700
You liars.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:19.330
Newbies from the Black Bulls wouldn't 
be awarded stars so easily.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.130
We <i>did</i> get one!
We're at minus thirty now!

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.050
It's laughable that you've been 
charged with this mission, too.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.480
The Wizard King appointed 
us to this mission himself!

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.010
Such a blatant lie.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.970
I'm not lying!

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.300
Hmph.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.140
He really is flustered.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.740
Come to think of it, I heard 
there'd be three of you, too.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.980
Where's the other one?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.940
Don't tell me they left you two and ran.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.700
Or did they fall prey to one of the traps?

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.370
He didn't run away, nor did he 
fall prey to any of the traps.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.930
Then where is he?

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.960
Just a little more!

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.310
There's no way we can tell them he 
ditched us and went off somewhere.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.970
Nope.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.810
Regardless, it's clear your lot consists 
of filth that leaves new recruits behind.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.850
The Black Bulls... How unsightly.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.060
You're an embarrassment to the Magic Knights.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.600
You've got some nerve, you jerk!

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.970
We're going to conquer this 
dungeon first for the Black Bulls!

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.860
Just you wait, Gol... No, Goober?

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.790
No, uh... you guys with the 
weird masked captain!

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.870
Goober? It's Golden!

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.870
And "weird mask"? You scum!

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.550
You dare mock our esteemed 
Captain Vangeance?!

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.280
You're the ones with a weird captain!

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.180
What kind of freak runs around with all 
those muscles bulging out of a tank top?!

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.440
What'd you say?!
He's manly and totally awesome!

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.000
How dare you talk to a noble like that?!
Not to mention your senior!

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.160
Well, excuse me! My bad!

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.150
You bastard!

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.740
Yeah, he's really flustered.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.810
Very well, you fools!

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.770
We'll just have to show you the difference 
between the top of the Magic Knights

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.820
and the bottom!

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.700
Mimosa!

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.980
Sure.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.650
Plant Creation Magic: Magic Flower Guidepost.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.850
Let's see... Ah, got it.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.770
I've learned the basic layout of the dungeon.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.600
Very well. Yuno!

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600
Right.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.110
He can carry all three of them so easily.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.660
I hope you suffer.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.330
Impressive as always, Yuno!

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.920
All right! Let's go, Noelle!

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.090
Hey!

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.150
Let's see which of us gets to 
the treasure chamber first!

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.350
And what are we supposed to do?

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.790
Neither of us can use tracking spells!

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.350
We'll just have to check 
every path very carefully!

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.150
I'm gonna do this!

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.240
Are you stupid? Oh, right, you are.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.980
At this rate, we'll get lost before 
we even find the treasure chamber!

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:17.570
Nero?

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.430
Take the next right.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.640
Okay.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.010
What was that fool's name? Asta? The nerve.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.580
There's no way he can beat us.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.840
What's with him, anyway? I couldn't 
sense any magic from him.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.340
You're right.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.810
What was the captain 
of the Black Bulls thinking,

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.000
taking someone like him—

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.450
Klaus.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.600
It's best that you don't underestimate him.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.130
They'll do well enough to get 
out of this dungeon alive.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.120
I'm just trying to conquer this dungeon as 
fast as possible, for our country's sake.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.490
I have a report for the Wizard King.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.130
The two Magic Knight Squads,
the Golden Dawn and the Black Bulls,

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.090
have begun their investigations 
of the dungeon.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.340
We have also confirmed that a military mage 
squad from the Diamond Kingdom is there.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.210
Our neighbor, the Diamond Kingdom...

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.910
They've been trying to expand 
their borders lately.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:40.550
Clover
Kingdom

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:40.550
Dungeon

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:40.550
Diamond
Kingdom

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.930
They're an aggressive kingdom.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.730
There'll be trouble if we let 
them steal the ancient magic

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.530
that might be in the dungeon.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.950
Who's in charge of this 
invasion from Diamond?

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.950
Yes, sir. The one leading the 
enemy squad is Lotus of the Abyss.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.850
Lotus?!

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.210
Ah... I've met him on the battlefield before.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.420
He was pretty strong!

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.640
The magic he used was really interesting.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.590
Sir, should you sound so amused right now?
Shouldn't you be more concerned?

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:08.980
Don't worry, it's fine. I hear Yami's 
sent an interesting one on this mission.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.890
But...

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:15.390
Lotus is strong, but our 
kids are strong, too.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.400
Huh?

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.080
You're so weak.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.950
But I'm sure you're different.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.580
Well, this isn't good.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.080
Nothing good comes of 
raising hurdles too high.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.760
Enthusiastic young power...

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.840
Terrifying, really.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:45.420
Lotus of the Abyss

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.140
You took my subordinates out in an instant.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.420
You're pretty strong.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.210
Well, they are just subordinates.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.930
But if you're their boss and you're 
strong, there's no problem.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.430
So you fight wrapped in 
your own lightning magic.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.620
Not only is that practical, 
but you seem pretty powerful.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.070
And you're fast.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.140
You're making the most 
of your youthful strength.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.950
You've got this old man shaking in his boots.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.160
What kind of magic do you fight with?

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.370
You seem rather enthusiastic.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.580
You Clover people are also after this 
dungeon's treasure chamber, aren't you?

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.170
Come on, let's fight!

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.720
Good grief.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.470
Actually, I'm pretty sure 
we don't have to fight.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.270
Let's just compete nonviolently!

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.730
Yeah, great idea. Bye!

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.730
Nope!

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.810
You sure are fast.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.020
He dodged me?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.860
Smoke?

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.530
Goodness, that was scary.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.630
I can see why the citizens of 
the Clover Kingdom would be mad.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.320
I mean, we've been trying 
to invade here and there.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.290
I apologize for all the trouble the 
Diamond Kingdom's been causing you.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.470
But you see, our kingdom's running out 
of resources, so we have it rough, too.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.410
If we want to survive,
we don't really have a choice.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.970
Living can be so hard.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.350
You see, I have three daughters...

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.600
Oh, is that so?!

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.030
Whatever! I don't care as long 
as I get to fight strong people.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.780
Looks like I've caught the 
eye of some real trouble.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.260
This old man might just cry.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.420
What is this place?
The gravity's all messed up!

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.090
Are you sure we're going the right way?

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.550
Hey, Nero!

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.510
Don't fall asleep!

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.640
Hey, treasure!

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.270
Yeah, that's definitely <i>not</i> treasure.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.070
Come on, Stupidsta! That has to be a trap!

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.660
All right! I got it!

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.460
Hey, stop that!

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.830
I wonder what's inside! 
I wonder what's inside!

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.620
I told you to stop! What are you 
going to do if it's a trap?

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.190
Open!

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.900
Wh-Why did you have to 
show me that, Shrimpsta?!

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.130
It's not my faul—

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.440
You're so full of life.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.730
Stop dodging, and let's fight!

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.480
Please? Come on!

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.990
Oh, now I remember. The Black Bulls.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.250
I've fought with your captain before.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.580
He was pretty hot-headed, too.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.000
What? You know the captain?

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.610
How could I forget?

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.010
He gave me this lovely scar.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.080
I pissed my pants and ran.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.510
Goodness, that was scary.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.520
He had a very unusual fighting style.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.020
He was the only younger opponent 
I've had that I couldn't defeat.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.190
That makes you even more worth figh—

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.860
Wh-Whoa, there...

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.050
Oh?

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.160
What's the matter?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.660
It's... nothing!

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.930
So slow!

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.580
Little by little, fall right into the abyss.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:59.430
What is this? Magic? But I don't 
remember getting hit by his magic...

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.060
You see, this whole room 
is enveloped in my magic.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.570
Very thin smoke that you can't really see.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.570
It's called Weakening Smoke Magic: Garden
of Plundering Smoke, if you were wondering.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.700
My body's not listening to me.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:27.790
A spell that lowers physical 
abilities? When did he...

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:33.040
I had a feeling you'd block it 
if it were a visible attack.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.610
I lowered my magical 
ability as much as I could

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.880
so I could use this without you noticing...

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.300
While you were fighting my subordinates.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.320
They didn't go out in vain.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.230
They sacrificed themselves 
so I could use this spell.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.300
It's very important, isn't it?

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.490
Teamwork.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.500
We're almost there. Once we
get through this tunnel...

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.040
How amazing!

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.520
That's all there is to dungeons? 
That wasn't very difficult.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.770
I wonder how you get in.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.560
It appears the Black Bulls aren't here yet.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.990
Of course not. There's no way they'd beat us.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.490
Indeed.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.410
Mimosa!

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.750
It ripped through her 
magic-shielding cloak...

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.510
She's an expert at sensing mana,
but she didn't notice?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.070
You're alive, aren't you?

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.880
That wasn't a trap spell... 
What is this magic?

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.440
Who are you?!

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.940
Who stands in my way?

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.010
Move.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:28.260
Friends you can trust are 
worth their weight in gold.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.460
Sorry, but stay there a while and get weaker.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.980
Win...

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.460
Win...

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.470
Keep winning, Luck!

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.470
Wait.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.360
It's been a while

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.640
since things actually got interesting.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.570
More... More!

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.000
Let's fight some more!

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:28.280
I'd rather not pluck a bud 
that's still so young...

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.570
And push me forward

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.630
(I can't find a place to go)

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:11.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:16.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.650
(Break free yourself)

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:47.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:06.280
Petit Clover

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.780
Petit Clover!

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.780
A Lotus Flower
That Doesn't Bloom
Is Just a Lotus

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.780
A Lotus Flower That Doesn't 
Bloom Is Just a Lotus.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:14.030
You see, I have three daughters...

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.040
"When I get older,
I'm going to marry you, Daddy!"

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.040
And all three of them fight over me.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.840
But once they hit puberty...

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.590
"Get away from me!"

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.090
"Don't mix my laundry with yours!"

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.010
I'm sure they'll say things like that.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:37.210
And my wife was so nice when 
we first met, but now...

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.340
This is really annoying, so I think I'm 
ready to fall into the abyss now.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.530
We're not done yet. It's finally getting fun.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.320
More! Let's play more!

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.250
Let's kill each other! Please, Mister?

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.760
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 16: "Friends."

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:55.250
Page 16
Friends

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.700
Not giving up is my magic.
