WEBVTT

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.110
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.570
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.950
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.610
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.910
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.700
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.700
He continues to diligently 
aim for the top!

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.390
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.870
and to become the Wizard King!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.600
To the Heart Kingdom!

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.990
Captain Yami! The Heart Kingdom!

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.150
All that's coming through is your 
enthusiasm. Use your damn words.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.130
Gordon's dad looked into it for us!

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.610
There's a stupidly huge 
curse in the Heart Kingdom!

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.410
Oh?

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.450
I think we can find out something 
about the devil's curse

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.320
if we go to the Heart Kingdom!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.080
Where's Gordon? And what 
does he think about this?

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.430
He was gonna learn some curse magic, 
so he decided to stay at home for a while.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.180
I see. Also, why did those two come back 
looking like their minds are blown?

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.440
Something about the food not 
agreeing with them or something?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.360
I thought it was great!

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.110
I think I got the gist of what's going on.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.110
Hup.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.650
Then do I get to go to the Heart Kingdom?

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.820
Sure.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.470
I'll go make the arrangements, 
so just sit tight.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.450
Not happening.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.410
Huh?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.670
There's no way into the Heart Kingdom.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.960
What?!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.810
What's that supposed to mean?!

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.530
I was going to go to the Heart Kingdom, too,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.300
since the devil's curse is there!

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.070
The Heart Kingdom has

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.100
a bunch of its own unique trap 
spells set up along its border.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.830
We set any of those off and 
we're instant fugitives.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.100
Heart
Kingdom

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.100
Clover Kingdom

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.100
Then it'd become an international incident.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.920
No way! Oh, but if we nullify the 
trap spells with my anti-magic,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.980
we could probably get in!

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.740
No, you fool. The moment we mess 
with them, they'll find us out.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.010
Well, that's not good.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.250
Sounds like Rouge isn't going 
to be able to help either, then.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.730
It'd be pretty much impossible 
to get in without them knowing.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.230
Come to think of it, I think Mimosa mentioned 
going to the Heart Kingdom before.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.380
Really?!

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.220
Yes. She mentioned that

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.010
there were some nobles going there 
like they were exchange students.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.010
All right, Finral. Take these 
jerks to the Golden Dawn.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.350
Sure!

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.690
Huh? Finral, you usually complain 
when you get used as an errand boy.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.810
Well, there's someone in the 
Golden Dawn that I want to see.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.820
The Golden Dawn's Headquarters

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.910
And that's when Finral did his best to stop you.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.660
Curse you, Brother.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.460
Langris! I heard you're awake! Thank goodness!

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.980
Brother!

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.210
Finral!

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.210
I'm so glad you're all right, Miss Finnes.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.920
Must be satisfying.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.720
Huh?

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.740
I tried to kill my own brother, 
but was defeated.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.730
Then, when my parents tried 
desperately to apologize for me,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.450
I tried to kill the king.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.190
I'm sure Father must be 
quite disappointed in me.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.900
What are you talking about?!

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.130
It all happened because you 
were possessed by an elf!

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.440
Don't worry! We can clear this up—

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.240
On top of everything, I was saved by my
brother, who I've mocked this whole time.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.280
I heard about the trial.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.890
You and that peasant are so insolent!

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.790
You have no talent, yet you 
take on so many burdens!

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.670
This isn't over yet!

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.350
Yeah, that's the spirit!

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.180
You being like that makes 
declaring war on you worth it.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.220
What?

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.120
Starting now, I'm going to work hard 
to make Father acknowledge me.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.640
I'll be a man worthy of being the 
head of the House of Vaude!

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.190
And...

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.990
I'll be the one who makes Miss Finnes happy!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.600
I'm sorry to drag you into this, Miss Finnes.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.650
But...

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.690
I'll become a man worthy of you, 
and then I'll come for you.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.410
Please try not to take too long.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.910
Brother, a moment.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.630
Wait! Should you be moving, Langris?!

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.990
Please wait here, Miss Finnes.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.170
Huh?

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.990
Don't worry. I'm not going to try to gouge 
a bunch of holes in my brother again.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.670
That's pretty scary, Langris.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.470
What's wrong, Langris?

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.000
As you are now, you won't be 
able to make Miss Finnes happy.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.980
Huh?

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.560
Because...

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.080
Vice Captain Langris...

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.380
So you've awakened as well, Vice Captain.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.140
Yay! Look at you cuties!

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.870
How about we grab some tea?

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.870
See? I knew it.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.940
You're cursed!

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.740
What?!

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.150
You're a hopeless playboy who hits 
on any woman in your path!

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:48.010
Playboy

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.350
P-Playboy?

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.580
All that running away and trying

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.780
to act cool made you a bigger 
failure than you already were!

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.010
Failure

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.780
Failure?

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.010
And once you pick up bad habits, 
they won't be easy to break!

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.010
Bad Habits

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.190
How could someone like you with so 
many faults make Miss Finnes happy?!

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.720
Y-You're absolutely right.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.700
What in the world are these two doing?

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.980
The vice captain has seemed like a 
 different person ever since he awakened.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.100
Make sure you work hard to 
rid yourself of that curse.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.490
If you don't, I might just end 
up marrying Miss Finnes first.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.010
So was breaking my curse a part 
of this investigation, too?

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.500
"No."

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.490
Hmph. I won't let you be happy 
that easily, Brother.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.220
I see... So that's why you've come to see me.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.220
Anything to help Asta.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.590
Yes, I've been to the Heart Kingdom.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.820
I went there on an exchange with 
my brother when I was thirteen.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.980
Though I hated the fact 
that it had to be with him.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.870
We were only allowed access to a limited area,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.480
but their magic techniques

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.650
are different from the Clover 
Kingdom's, so I learned a lot.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.020
It's a lovely kingdom with 
abundant water and lush greenery,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.750
and its rich natural environment 
generated so much mana.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.730
If what lies at its center 
is indeed a devil or a curse,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.710
that's truly terrifying.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.000
Though it's hard to believe.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.010
A curse... That might be a clue about 
the devil that Mother encountered.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.090
We weren't allowed to meet her, but the 
queen who rules over the Heart Kingdom

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.020
is apparently as powerful as 
one of our Magic Knights Squads.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.980
She's known as the all-knowing mage who sees

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.150
everything that happens in her kingdom.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.670
What?! That's awesome!

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.410
A queen... Is she like the Witch Queen?
 Then we might be in trouble.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.130
But I guess we're not going 
over there to pick a fight.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.620
I'm not letting my guard down, though.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.130
I believe they're recruiting applicants 
to go there right about now.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.420
I'll apply for permission 
to enter their kingdom.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.420
Thanks, Mimosa!

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.890
Holy crap! This is the first time 
I've ever been on a ship this huge!

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.690
My, what a cute little ship.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.010
You idiot. We're not going to play.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.110
I didn't know you had a boat, Yami.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.160
Why didn't you ever mention it before?

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.230
Well, I went to go see the mushroom head 
who works for Julius and threatened...

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.940
er, discussed the matter with him, 
and he was happy to lend it to us.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.910
Huh?

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.130
You guys better not damage it.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.260
Right!

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.610
Asta...

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.110
Take care of Mimosa.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.340
You're overreacting, Klaus.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.160
We're not going over there to fight.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.640
But if something happens while 
you're in a different kingdom,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.920
we won't be able to come to your aid.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.150
If only I could go with you...

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.970
There's a limit of four... 
So first, there's Asta.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.470
The royal lady from the Golden Dawn
 who arranged all of this...

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.180
And then Noelle, who doesn't seem like 
she'll let go of her spot this time.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.040
And lastly, Finral.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.190
Oh, yeah. Why am I the fourth one?

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.890
Having wheels with you comes in handy.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.820
Right?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.930
Yup, yup.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.460
Can't really argue with that.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.530
Definitely.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.200
He is rather convenient.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.040
Indeed. Spatial magic is convenient.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.640
I know that, but...

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.710
No, really. You don't need to understand!

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.330
Asta! Go kick some ass in the Heart Kingdom!

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.320
What are you talking about?

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.120
Right!

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.310
Take care of things there and come home soon.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.720
I still have to fight you, Asta.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.950
Right!

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.340
If you get homesick and have trouble 
sleeping, just have a sip of this.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.450
Right!

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.720
Wait, you can't.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.210
That should be enough to send them off.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.480
I hope you guys didn't forget that 
you have a job to do yourselves.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.660
Of course we didn't forget, Mister Yami.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.340
Off we go!

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.730
Yeah.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.110
All right. Make sure you all 
stay on your toes out there.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.430
Yes, sir!

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.350
Two thousand and thirty-one...
Two thousand and thirty-two...

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.010
Two thousand and thirty-three... 
Two thousand and thirty-four...

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.060
Two thousand and thirty-five... 
Two thousand and thirty-six...

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.010
Keep it steady...

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.940
Keep it steady...

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.890
Two thousand and thirty-seven...
Two thousand and thirty-eight...

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.890
Keep it steady...

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.420
Out of all the possibilities, 
why did I have to be stuck on a boat

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.900
with two super-adorable royal cuties 
and a cool beauty who turns into a bird?!

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.860
I don't think I'm gonna be 
able to sleep at night!

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.620
Tough it out... Tough it out, Finral!

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.210
Miss Finnes is the only one for me!

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.200
Um...

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.240
Why don't we have some lunch?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.000
Thanks, Mimosa!

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.250
I hope you like them, Asta.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.510
So you made these, Mimosa? 
I'm digging right in!

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.500
It's so good!

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.630
This one's good, too!

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.220
Thank you very much.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.140
Asta... Don't eat all of it, okay?

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.740
This frustrates me for some reason.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.810
I-I need water!

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.380
Here's some water.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.060
That's too much!

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.500
I hope you're grateful.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.560
For what?!

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.900
I almost fell into the ocean just now, y'know!

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.300
I'm not sure why, but this frustrates me.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.820
Didn't I tell you that I can't swim?!

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.650
I don't recall.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:02.930
What?!

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.820
What in the world am I being 
forced to watch right now?

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.570
How was I supposed to know? I'm royalty.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.420
What?! That doesn't even make sense!

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.450
We're finally here!

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.300
We're actually entering 
the Heart Kingdom legally!

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.740
We're not coming here to play, you know.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.430
I'm sorry I was only able to 
gain entry for the four of us.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.610
What are you talking about, Mimosa? 
I have nothing but thanks for you!

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.320
If all else fails, we could 
use Finral's spatial magic—

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.730
That would be unlawful entry.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.480
It got foggy all of a sudden.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.690
The only ones who are 
allowed through this fog

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.400
are those permitted by the 
Queen of the Heart Kingdom.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.810
I couldn't sleep one bit knowing two 
beautiful girls were sleeping near me.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.260
More importantly, what does the Queen 
of the Heart Kingdom look like?!

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.210
Damn it! Is she hot, too?!

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.580
The Heart Kingdom... I wonder what it's like.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.100
Heart Kingdom

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.270
That's the Heart Kingdom?

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.280
Their water sources, the city, and the
 forest are all mixed together?

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.910
That's awesome!

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.530
It looks like they have arrived as planned.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.710
The devil power from the Clover Kingdom...

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.150
We must get our hands on it.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.820
Hmph. I guess this place is sort of pretty.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.840
I wonder where we should tie the boat up.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.900
Please continue sailing forward.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.100
You're...

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.530
Welcome to the Heart Kingdom.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.600
Spirit Guardian
Gaja

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.600
I am the Spirit Guardian Gaja, 
and I will act as your guide.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.360
Is he someone important?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.610
Seems to be.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:06.750
It's been quite some time, Lady Mimosa. 
We met on your previous visit.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.540
Good day to you, Gaja.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.870
I'm honored that you remember me.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:15.620
You were quite popular with those who 
had made your acquaintance, Lady Mimosa.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.630
This is Asta, Noelle, and Finral.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.130
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.540
Here is some crimson orange 
juice that tastes even sweeter

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.380
after some magic is run through it.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.660
Please enjoy.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.390
Thank you very much.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.330
What in the world is this? It's delicious.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.700
Mine's not sweet at all! Run some
 magic through mine, too!

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.230
O-Oh, fine...

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.520
You said to keep sailing, but it 
looks like a dead end up ahead.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.250
Fear not.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.010
The queen will transport us.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.650
The queen? So this is just one mage's magic?!

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.140
The mist barrier and the water stairs

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.390
are a product of the queen's Mana Zone,
 which covers the whole kingdom.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.950
That's awesome! And so is this juice!

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.260
He can't be serious. It covers the 
whole kingdom? Is that even possible?

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.390
Look! Pretty butterflies!

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.510
It truly is a lovely kingdom.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.190
It's hard to believe there's a devil here.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.590
It's been 1,200 years since 
our kingdom was founded.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.740
In every generation, 
the queen has made a pact

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.480
with the Water Spirit as a priestess,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.200
and has used its magic to protect the kingdom.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.690
Using the power of the water and trees,

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.870
this has encouraged the development 
of a magic civilization with deep mana

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.710
that does not allow unwanted guests to enter.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:50.220
That's amazing... A single queen manages 
to keep peace in a kingdom this big?

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.130
Yes. That has been the case up until now.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.220
Though we do not know what the future holds.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.140
Asta!

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.060
What are you... What is the 
meaning of this, Gaja?!

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.730
There's something we need 
to maintain this peace.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.240
First, we need to go after Asta!

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.110
Leave that to me!

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.460
Let's go, Mimosa!

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.990
Believe in our transporter!

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.020
Of course!

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.830
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.250
Ah... That's only third stage or so.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.760
Your magic is rather intriguing.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.800
Finral!

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.180
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.760
Huh?

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.190
He's floating without using any magic?

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.770
I don't know what you're trying to do here...

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.030
But do you really think you'll 
get away with harming a friend

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.070
of royalty from the Clover Kingdom?

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.580
That's our Noelle! 
She's super cool, pretty, and cute!

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.410
No, wait! Miss Finnes is the only one for me!

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.420
Rare and powerful magic...

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.000
Definitely first stage.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.900
That's rather impressive water magic.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.760
I will not hold back either, then.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.140
What is that?

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.530
I'm sorry for inviting you 
here in such a rough manner.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.030
Huh?

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.390
We were waiting for your devil, 
for the sake of our kingdom.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.130
I just got blown away to some weird place!

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.910
This is the Heart Kingdom's queen?

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.500
Then that's...

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.700
Damn it!

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.570
His attribute is lightning?

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.800
Then what were those rune things?

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.810
Is that a unique Heart Kingdom 
magic technique?

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.610
Lightning Magic: Tenjiolia.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.190
It's fast...

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.440
But I can evade it with my Valkyrie Armor!

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.730
As expected from a first stage. But...

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.110
I told my spell to pursue 
you until it strikes you.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.100
Gaja, please return Asta to us.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.630
Otherwise, we'll be forced to fight with you.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.430
An attack spell...

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.800
It appears Lady Mimosa 
has also grown to third stage.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.490
And it looks like that spatial mage

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.130
is able to create a path wherever he can see.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.390
Let me give you a glimpse of the 
difference between our levels.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.770
He cast his technique into the sky?

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.030
This magic is...

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.830
Humans are no match for 
the vast mana of nature!

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:27.060
I'm somehow getting by for now, 
but I don't know how much mana they have!

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.730
Damn it! Why the heck am
I even fighting, anyway?!

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.180
So you negate magic... 
That is your devil's power.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:34.980
What the...

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.460
It's quite abominable, but it
 also seems rather useful.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.310
It's a pleasure to meet you, 
devil-possessed boy from the Clover Kingdom.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:55.250
Water Spirit
Undine

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.450
I'm Undine. I'm one of the four 
Great Spirits, and I'm contracted

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.250
to the Queen of the Heart Kingdom.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.340
You're quite amazing,

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.340
but you're no match for me.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.030
Not to mention, you don't have 
a lick of magic yourself.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.600
Without any magic, you're less than ninth stage.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.600
Ninth stage?! What's that?!

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:17.370
Oh, right. You don't use magic 
stages in your kingdom, do you?

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.240
The lowest is the ninth stage, and then 
you have the eighth, the seventh...

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.320
That's how we measure and rank 
both magical talent and skill.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.740
I can't move... or breathe!

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.490
And the highest...

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.830
is stage zero.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.760
True Lighting Magic: Irial Astrauza!

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.800
I can't sense their mana 
anywhere that I can see.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.900
They must've fled using spatial magic.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.940
A wise choice.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.790
But no matter where they go...

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.420
He accurately manipulated space 
in a place he couldn't see?

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.300
Plant Creation Magic: Magic Flower Guidepost!

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.310
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.050
Sorry, but we can't just back down 
after you did all that showing off!

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.060
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:44.070
Sorry, but you can't measure our 
true powers by talent alone.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.070
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.820
This magic...

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:54.030
I'll keep my anti-magic in reserve
 so she can't pull me in!

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.480
Judging from the ki, 
there's definitely a person over there!

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.210
That means there must be air there, too!

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.300
Pardon me! I'm coming in!

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.350
Asta and the others are attacked 
as they arrive at the Heart Kingdom.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:47.280
Could it be that the Heart Kingdom 
has been taken over by a devil?

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.200
Next time on </i>Black Clover<i>,

Page 129
 The Devil Megicula

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.990
And the queen, Loropechika, appears.
