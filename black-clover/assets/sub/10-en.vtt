00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.530
Asta, Noelle, and Magna encountered

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.070
a mysterious enemy when they 
arrived at Saussy Village.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.760
They fought hard against the enemy's 
attack in order to protect the villagers,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.870
but the enemy's magical powers 
were just too great.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.470
Not only can you negate magic,
you can repel it, as well.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.940
But that is not enough to defeat me.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.380
The blades of ice will 
come one after another.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.720
Now, just try and protect them.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.390
Damn it!

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.140
It's going to take everything Asta 
and I have to protect the villagers.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.890
Not to mention, my powers 
are reaching their limit.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.790
This turned out to be one hell 
of a first mission for those two!

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.900
This isn't good!

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.420
But if I cut and run now, I'm not a real man!

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.740
It just so happens I'm a lowly 
commoner myself! I'll protect you!

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.800
I'm... royalty.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.670
I have more magical power 
than anyone else here.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.590
Step back, Lady Noe!

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.340
And yet I'm just holding them back!

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.050
Miss Magic Knight...

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.300
Save us!

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.560
This little girl is asking for help.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.290
I'm going to protect them!

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.570
There's no way...

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.790
I can run now!

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.570
A new spell?

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.120
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.590
As their owners mature, new spells 
are engraved into the grimoires.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.570
Maturity can stem from the wizard's 
magical powers growing through training,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.320
or improving the creativity 
of their magical powers.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.350
But sometimes, it can come 
from a rise or change

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
in their emotional state, 
or gaining new resolve.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.350
I'll protect them! I'm royalty,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.940
and a member of the Black Bulls!

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.300
Those Who Protect

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.870
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.390
I know, yeah I know

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.790
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.650
I dreamed it all my life

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.530
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.680
Don't care how much I fall

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.100
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.290
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.460
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.840
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.100
Someday I will write the next page

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.600
You are my hope

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.540
Like that page from someday

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.690
I was able to meet you

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.650
I call this a miracle

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.090
Miss...

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.340
W-Well, I guess you're not so tough after all.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.290
Look at that power!

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.350
Hey, Lady Noe! What'd I tell you?
You can do it if you try!

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.360
What? What is this magical power?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.910
The beast had been waiting for 
his chance to fight back.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.870
For the moment when he could sink his teeth

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.790
into his prey's throat.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.790
The three of you

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.620
also had enough magical power to 
join the Magic Knights, did you not?

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.630
I don't have any magical powers!

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.630
But I'm going to kick your ass!

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.140
Lord Heath!

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.180
Stupidsta!

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.140
He... He did it?

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.650
He broke my momentum by 
making me slip on a patch of ice?

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.130
Though your sword can negate magic,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.660
it appears that you're just 
a normal human after all.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.790
Now it's my turn.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.580
May you sleep... for eternity.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.890
A-Asta!

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.250
That spell possesses 
immense magical power.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.400
But it's only a matter of time.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.000
I should be able to create an 
entrance big enough for one person.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.850
It should take about 25 seconds.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.150
You lot seem to greatly enjoy wasting my time.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.860
You will pay a heavy price for that.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.680
I don't have much power left, 
but I have to fight.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.850
Fire and ice. In terms of magical 
attributes, I have the upper hand.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.030
But he has enough magical power 
to turn that advantage around.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.190
He's just too strong.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.070
Sorry, Mister Yami.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.120
I don't think I'm going to win against...

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.990
I'm not done yet!

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.000
Too slow!

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.580
Asta!

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.950
I'm surprised you're still alive.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.630
You're quite resilient. However...

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.010
You won't be able to swing 
that sword with those wounds.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.850
Not yet!

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.850
You're no wild boar.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.540
I'm not done yet!

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.580
Stop. Don't make me waste any more time.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.330
That's amazing, Magna!

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.380
To think that someone from Rayaka 
would end up being a Magic Knight!

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.670
You're the pride of our village!

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.470
Let's lift him up!

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.250
Magna!

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.400
Magna!

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.640
Magna!

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.900
I see. That's wonderful. Good, good.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.530
Well done, Magna.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.940
Yeah.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.360
Now you're more than just a delinquent.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.540
Huh?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.370
This is from me.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.370
Old Man...

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.380
Well?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.630
It looks good on you.
Become the best man you can.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.330
Yeah!

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.640
I'm not going to give up until the end.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.140
What good would it do if I gave up?

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.500
This spell... It's probably a lot easier 
to get outside than in, right?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.650
Uh... Yes, I think so.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.660
I'm leaving the villagers to you, Lady Noe!

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.160
H-Hey!

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.670
You have no chance of winning. 
Why won't you give up?

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.670
If I give up, who's going to protect them?

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.930
I've realized something.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.790
It's not just because of our promise.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.580
I'm going to become the Wizard King

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.690
so I can protect everyone!

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.940
The Wizard King? What a foolish dream.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.940
Unfortunately, you'll be dead in one minute.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.950
That's not happening, you dumbass!

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.950
If you want to kill him,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.460
you're going to have to get 
through me, his senior, first!

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.250
Magna!

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.090
You know... You're quite the man, Asta.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.590
You fool. You've just hastened your death.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.100
Thirty seconds.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.390
Bring it on!

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.890
Here we go, Asta!

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.100
Huh?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.110
Time for an initiation!

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.360
Take this! My last remaining bit of magic!

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.290
Soul Ball!

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.570
Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.630
So this is your final spell?

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.100
How wasteful.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.100
It's time.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.520
It's not a waste!

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.700
They drew us in with a decoy, 
then used our blind spot...

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.280
Magic reflection!

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.530
I'm okay?

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.490
You'd better thank me,
you mohawked delinquent.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.880
Yes! Yes! I was able to control my magic!

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.340
You never shut up, do you?

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.350
These flames... won't go out?

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.540
Then I'll just freeze them over!

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.630
Not yet!

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.380
I can still move!

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.110
W-Wait...

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.950
Like hell I will!

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.850
These flames... won't go out?

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.990
Then I'll just freeze them over!

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.100
Not yet!

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.860
I can still move!

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.610
W-Wait...

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.470
Like hell I will!

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.530
Impossible...

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.280
I...

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.340
lost to this brat?

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:17.040
I wanted... to be of more use...
to the master...

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.050
They did it?

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.030
Miss?

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.970
Yes. We beat him for sure this time.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.140
First, my Flame Magic: 
Prison Death Scattershot,

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.330
and now, Flame Binding Magic: 
Flame Bondage Formation.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.030
I guess you're more talented 
than you look. Have some praise.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.020
Shut up! I'm your senior!

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.370
Why are you looking down on me?!

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.340
Well, you're physically below—

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.840
Magna!

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.030
What are you doing?! You need 
to follow through properly!

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.380
So cold!

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.650
You've still got a ways to go, Lady Noe!

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:26.240
More importantly, it looks like one got away.
Ugh, I blew it! Damn it!

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.750
How'd you like that?
Some lowly commoners just won.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:47.010
How'd you like that, damn it?!

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.790
Asta!

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.890
Wait, he's asleep?!

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.150
Honestly, he's so ridiculous.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.150
He's stupid, loud, and a lowly commoner...

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.660
But he's sort of amazing.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.170
Whew... We're saved.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.330
He's just a boy.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.160
Is he really a commoner like us?

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.670
Magna, young lady... Thank you.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.130
No problem!

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.920
It was nothing.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.890
You're our saviors!

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.390
What's that? An anti-bird?

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.850
You finally awake, you jerk?

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.180
I'm going to rest a bit more 
and then escort you to

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.210
the royal capital on my Crazy Cyclone.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:32.360
Spend the rest of your life atoning for what 
you did to those villagers, you bastards.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.870
So my magic is sealed.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.030
You're going to spill everything 
to the Magic Knights,

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.130
including who you guys are 
and what your motives are!

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.110
I refuse.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.410
It appears the end has come.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.850
There was a magic item inside him?

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.850
Ice Magic: Ice Burial.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.350
Wha—

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.950
Talk about resolve. Is there 
someone he was that loyal to?

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.420
You idiot!

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:29.670
He went through all that... 
What was he after, anyway?

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.980
What do...

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.730
What do you think life is?!

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.680
I'm never going to acknowledge these jerks!

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.510
Never!

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.330
Grandpa...

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.820
Let's go home, Nick.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.840
Grandpa really loved the view from here.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.220
Yeah.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.130
So, Nick, I heard

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:18.600
that Old Man Seihi was the only 
one to stand up to those guys.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.700
Your grandpa was a real man.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.850
Grandpa sounded really happy.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.050
He said that even though it was

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.820
just gambling, he still
beat some Magic Knights.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.840
Yeah.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.570
He gave this to me as a gift.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.250
He even bought lots of yummy 
food for everyone in the village.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:16.740
He never got to be one, but Grandpa 
always admired the Magic Knights.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.490
Yeah.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.700
And they were also his regret.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.570
Regret?

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.780
He always regretted not working 
harder when he was younger.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.330
Yeah...

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.180
But... he seemed really 
happy about the fact that

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.840
Magna was working hard for the both of them.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.590
Yeah.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:48.350
Hey, do you think... I'll be able 
to become a Magic Knight, too?

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.100
Of course!

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.460
Nothing's impossible!

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.320
Your future is something that 
you decide for yourself!

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.490
Not only am I a commoner, but I've got
no magic powers, and I still made it in!

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.750
But you've gotta work super extra hard!

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.030
Give it your all!

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.290
Do your best.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.290
Yeah!

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.210
By the time you join the Magic Knights,

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.450
I'm going to be working even harder,
doing even more missions,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.010
and I'll be even closer to 
becoming the Wizard King.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.560
Jeez. There you go talking nonsense again.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.810
But you need to dream big.
That's what it means to be a man!

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.440
I'll be waiting for you, kid!

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.030
Right!

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.570
Yeah!

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:47.660
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.710
What do you have against my head, 
you stupid bird?! You wanna fight?!

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.670
Why, you...

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.010
What's that stone?

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.680
Oh, that's a charm that my grandpa had.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.890
Hey, that's really important!

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.470
Let go! Give it back!

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.340
You can have it.
Apparently that bird really likes it.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.730
It's the least I can do to 
repay you guys for saving us.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.140
O-Okay...

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.100
Those spiteful little eyes...

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.500
Th-They're so cute!

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.290
You can come over here, too!

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.880
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.850
What is your problem with my head?!
I'm gonna barbecue you!

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.510
Come back here!

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.160
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.670
The heck are you doing, you jerk?!

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.030
So Heath was... I see.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.060
So the magic stone fell into 
the hands of the Black Bulls.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.540
Yes.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.460
No matter.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.450
We can take care of the 
Black Bulls at any time.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.920
Let them hold on to the 
magic stone for a while.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.810
Our master's resurrection is close at hand.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:59.090
No one can escape from here

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:05.840
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:13.600
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:20.610
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.480
I've thought many times

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.200
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:34.660
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:41.630
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:48.880
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:55.770
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:00.970
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:19.290
Petit Clover

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.050
Petit Clover!

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.790
Who's the Most Similar?

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.790
Who's the Most Similar?

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.660
The winner is...

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.800
this bird.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.500
What?!

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.350
Magna, you've grown so much.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.110
You're no longer just a delinquent. 
You're a real man now.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.520
You're on fire! You're shining!

What Happened on a Certain Day in the Castle Town

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.900
"What Happened on a Certain 
Day in the Castle Town."

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.700
Not giving up is my magic!
