WEBVTT

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.410
A Village Out in the Boonies: Hage

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.260
Here we go again...

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.900
There, there...

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.250
There you are.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.600
Those two finally calmed down.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.230
Are they brothers... or perhaps twins?

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.050
No, they're not.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.380
This one is rather calm, but this one...

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.030
seems like he has a lot of spunk.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.950
First of all, they don't look a thing alike.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.070
Hm? "Yuno"...

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.250
Let's see. And the spunky one over here is—

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.450
Hey! You're a bit too spunky...

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.150
"Asta," eh?

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.870
Right! You two don't need to 
worry about a thing anymore.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.020
Starting today, this is your new home...

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.310
Asta, Yuno.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.010
15 Years Later

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.580
Hopefully, we'll have a 
great harvest this year.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.710
Yeah.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.780
Hup.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.810
Sister Lily!

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.080
What the...

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.180
Must be that runt from the church again.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.060
I'll become the Wizard King 
someday and make you happy!

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.020
So please marry me!

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.460
I'm sorry, Asta, but I'm everyone's sister.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.100
Not yet!

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.900
Um... I'm sorry.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.260
I'm not giving up yet!

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.240
Er, um... But...

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.450
I'm not giving up!

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.390
I'm really sorry!

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.500
One more time, Sister Lily!

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.800
Stop pestering me!

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.220
Water Creation Magic: Holy Fist of Love!

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.010
I-I'm sorry, Asta.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.020
I used magic from my 
grimoire without thinking...

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.910
Well done, sister.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.560
No mercy whatsoever.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.020
I-I... It just happened..

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.860
I'm not done yet!

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.260
Sheesh.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.080
How many times does she have to dump you?

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.180
Why are you getting in my way too, Yuno?!

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.590
Why?

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.200
Because you're loud, short,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:23.090
Loud

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.090
Short

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.110
obnoxious, and immature.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.090
Obnoxious

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.090
Immature

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.090
Basically, you're not appealing
to women in any way.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.360
Not appealing

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.180
Hey! Is that what you say to 
someone you've grown up with

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.250
for the past fifteen years,
you handsome jerk?!

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.420
Let me give you a hand.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.340
Thanks.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.830
Don't ignore me, damn it!

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.850
Asta, Sister Lily is a woman of the cloth,
so she can't get married.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.260
Also, you're only fifteen,
so you can't get married anyway.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.870
Shut up! Yuno, you jerk... I oughta...

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.870
I challenge you to a fight, Yuno!

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.930
And I decline.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.670
Why the hell not?!

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.060
Because it's a waste of time.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.270
What'd you say?!

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.680
Give it a rest, Asta.
There's no way you can beat Yuno.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.180
Take this...

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.060
My ultimate...

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.180
Hold up, Asta.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.010
Attack!

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.010
I mean, you can't even use magic.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.300
Nothing came out!

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.950
I'm not done yet!

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.210
You're funny, Asta!

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.320
You have zero sense.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.860
It's hard to believe someone
your age can't use magic yet.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.130
The hell's your problem?! How dare 
you speak to your elders that way?!

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.380
Shut up.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.500
Magic is everything in this world.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.240
It's only natural to be able to use magic.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.590
You're the only one I've ever 
seen who can't use it, Asta.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.890
G-Guess I don't have a choice...

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.550
I'll have to show you what 
I'm really made of...

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.220
What you're really made of?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.730
How you like that?! I know you 
can't do sit-ups this fast!

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.670
What's your point, you idiot?

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.860
You're funny, Asta!

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.250
Yuno's so cool!

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.200
That's Yuno for you.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.980
He's such a great help.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.480
Then leave... the wood-chopping...

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.380
to me!

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.090
I still can't believe you 
two are the same age.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.230
Yuno is the hope of this church!

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.060
I won't be surprised if you end up joining

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.110
the Magic Knights who serve
the Wizard King, Yuno!

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.680
The awarding ceremony is coming up, Asta.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.540
Once you receive your grimoire,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.180
it should trigger something within you, 
and you should be able to use magic, too.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.380
Sister...

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.700
At least, I think so.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.930
I'll get my grimoire soon...

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.710
Finally... Finally!

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.180
I'll get a grimoire that's more 
amazing than anyone else's,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.010
get into the Magic Knights,
follow in your footsteps,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.640
and become the Wizard King!

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.930
There he goes again.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.430
And I'll fix up this shabby, ugly church!

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.910
Well, I'm sorry it's so shabby and ugly!

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.020
Right, Yuno?

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.090
Right?

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.700
Just you wait...

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.720
Just you wait, damn it!

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.900
Asta, wait!

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.580
Is he really older than me?

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.890
Say, Yuno... Couldn't you 
be a bit nicer to Asta?

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.070
Like you used to be. Remember how you two 
were always together when you were little?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.070
Yuno used to be such a crybaby,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.160
but ever since the day he brought
Asta back with those terrible injuries,

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.390
Yuno hasn't cried at all.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.420
I can't be nicer to him.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:30.020
Come to think of it, Asta has come home
covered in mud ever since that day, too.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.180
I wonder what he's doing out there...

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.540
994... 995, 996,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:46.790
997, 998, 999... 1,000!

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.740
And now for this moguro leaf juice,
which is supposed to be

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.950
good for increasing magical powers!

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.360
I'm going to become the Wizard King.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.510
That's the one thing I'll never give up on!

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.970
But before that, I need to build myself up!

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.980
March... When firefly dandelion fluff 
starts to dance through the air.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.670
Once a year, all around the Clover Kingdom, 
all of the 15-year-olds are gathered,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:32.130
Grimoire Tower

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.380
and an awarding ceremony 
is held, where they receive

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.980
their own grimoires, which 
enhance their magical powers.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.030
Wow!

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.010
A-Are all of these grimoires?

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.040
Which one is mine?

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.790
Once I get my grimoire, I'm sure 
I'll be able to use magic, too.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.790
I'll catch up to Yuno in no time!

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:55.160
Hmph. I guess today's the day
I become a full-fledged mage.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.590
Hey, look over there.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:02.600
Pathetic, isn't it? They shouldn't have 
to give grimoires to dregs like that.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.760
You said it.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.390
Don't tell me they're

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.980
actually planning on taking the 
Magic Knights' entrance exams, too.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.570
Only nobles born with immense magical power
or ties to the royal family ever get in.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.860
Besides, I heard that shrimp
can't even use magic!

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.500
Wow... Then we need to take good care of him.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.670
He's like a national treasure,
since he's probably

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.210
the only one in this whole 
kingdom who can't use magic.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.010
Welcome, young men and women.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.590
You all begin a new journey today.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.760
I wish you all faith, hope, and love.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.640
I am the master of this grimoire tower.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.230
We've never had a Wizard King from this area,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.900
nor anyone who's actually achieved 
greatness in the Magic Knights.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.950
I sincerely hope that one of you 
will become the Wizard King someday.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.410
No, really! Seriously!

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.910
Ahem.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.540
Now it's time

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.870
for the awarding... of the grimoires!

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.730
This is my grimoire?

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.650
Check it out! Mine's bigger!

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.580
Mine's thicker, though.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.790
All right! Now I can leave 
this town and go to the city.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.690
I'm gonna take over the family business.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.160
<i>This</i> is my grimoire?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.420
Mine's like...

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:49.620
I'll... think about my future more once 
my grimoire has more pages filled in.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.830
We'll be taking the Magic Knights' 
entrance exams in six months.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.550
We'll be sure to get in.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.510
Good, good. I look forward to it.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.560
Um...

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.770
My grimoire's not coming.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.570
Um...

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.570
My grimoire's not coming.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.080
Er...

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.830
Try again next year.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.000
What?!

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.240
What the heck?!

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.840
That's actually amazing!

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.340
That's way too funny!

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.200
Seriously?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.180
I can't believe it.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.220
If we competed to see who was most pathetic,
we'd be no match for that guy.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.810
A four-leaf clover...

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.640
A four-leaf? You mean the legendary...

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.080
H-Hey...

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.470
The one that the first Wizard King received?

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.500
The grimoire said to be filled 
with immense power and good luck?

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.150
Him?

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.930
That peasant?

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.300
Wow!

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.260
I'm going to become the Wizard King.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.990
Awesome!

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.110
He's the shining star of Hage!

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.980
You're amazing, Yuno!

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.320
He's so cool.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.450
Yuno...

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.420
Just you wait.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.200
I'll catch up to you in no time.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.210
Because I'm your rival!

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.700
Did he just say "rival"?

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.970
He didn't even get a grimoire. 
What is he thinking?

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.370
Not possible.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.870
All right, kids! We're heading 
home to prepare for the feast!

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.160
You can each have three tatoes today!

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.200
Yay!

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.540
I sure would like to eat something 
else once in a while.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.940
What an amazing thing to find 
in a crummy little town like this.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.110
I thought that once I got my grimoire,

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.070
I'd be able to use magic, but...

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.060
I never thought I wouldn't even get one.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.750
But... like hell I'm gonna give up!

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.630
Don't you dare underestimate me, fate!

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.500
I'll show you!

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.970
Even if it takes one, two, 
ten, or a hundred years!

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.170
I'll keep working hard 
until I get my grimoire!

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.330
I'll become the Wizard King, and prove 
to everyone that anyone can be awesome,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.510
even if they're poor or just some orphan!

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.470
You jerk!

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.720
Just you wait, Yuno!

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.140
H-Hey, you don't have to go that far.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.860
We should've been the stars today.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.820
And yet... this peasant receives 
a four-leaf clover?!

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.240
I'll just...

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.250
Hey!

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.820
I'll just have to turn it into ash!

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.390
He held back my flames without 
even using his grimoire?!

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.390
D-Do something!

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.870
But...

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.870
Do it!

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.360
I can't let you go and burn that.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.990
Don't bother to resist.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.770
My Creation Magic: Binding Iron Chain

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.540
restricts the magic and movements 
of the one it captures.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.950
Who are you?

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:53.050
Until recently, I was a pretty well-known 
Magic Knight called Revchi of Chain Magic.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.060
But I got kicked out, so now 
I'm just a wretched thief.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:03.060
And I'll be taking that grimoire.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:10.570
Revchi, was it? It's pointless 
for you to steal that.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.640
The only one—

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.150
The only one who can use a 
grimoire is the one it chose.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.920
However, underground collectors 
are buying grimoires

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.580
with four-leaf clovers for insane prices.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.330
A four-leaf clover may have chosen you,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.100
but you only just received it.
You're still just a little chick.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.580
How unfortunate for you that 
I happened to be here.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.090
Your legend is going to end 
before it even begins.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.820
Hey, that pendant looks like 
it's worth something, too.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.420
I guess I'll be taking that...

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:47.270
Hold it!

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.030
What do you think you're doing?!

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.780
I've come to save...

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.530
Huh?

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.080
Who the hell are you?!

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.140
That's Yuno's grimoire!

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.210
Why do you have it? You thief!

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.420
Aren't you the pathetic little brat 
who wasn't even given a grimoire?

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.690
Oh, you remember me!

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.100
Yeah, I'm that pathetic little brat!

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.850
A grimoire is precious to 
the person who received it!

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.410
Give it back to Yuno, you jerk!

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.900
The outside world is a place where crooked 
deeds like this can be overlooked.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.730
But you'll be dead before you
find that out for yourself.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.700
Asta, run!

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.430
I'm not going to run away

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.250
from a disgraced loser like him!

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.110
I'm not done yet!

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.190
No... You're finished.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.150
Dance of the Pitless Viper!

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.830
Wh-What a heavy blow...

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.830
So this is the power of the mages 
from outside this town.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.090
I can't possibly beat him 
with just my physical training.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.250
Thank you for that useless struggle, brat.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.430
Not yet. I'm not finished...

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.400
I'm going to be... the Wizard King.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.060
You? The Wizard King?

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.060
I have the ability to find out

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.730
just how much magical power 
one has with these chains.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.940
And you have no magic whatsoever.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.950
You must've been born that way.
No wonder you couldn't get a grimoire.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.540
To think that you lack
even an ounce of magic

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.790
in this world where magic is everything.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.370
What a priceless find!

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.120
Huh?

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.790
What the hell?

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:20.590
Then no matter how hard I try, 
I won't be able to use magic?

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.260
To think that someone so pathetic existed.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.630
You won't even be able to find a job, 
let alone become the Wizard King!

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:33.530
I'm sure your friend, the great 
genius over there, mocks you, too.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.650
Yeah, maybe.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.420
Yuno's so amazing that he 
was chosen by the four-leaf.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.280
I'm just...

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:47.490
You can't do a thing in this world. 
Just give up on everything.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.460
You were born a loser!

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.170
He's right.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:58.500
No matter how hard I try, 
some things just can't be helped.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.260
I'm just going to give...

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.510
Hey!

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.680
Who are you calling a loser?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.350
Asta, it's true that you won't be 
able to become the Wizard King,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.990
no matter what.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:16.110
You hear that? Even your little friend 
is telling you it's impossible.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.400
That's because I'm going 
to become the Wizard King!

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:23.800
What?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.570
He's no loser.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:28.950
He's...

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.870
Asta's my rival!

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:35.970
Huh?

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.810
Him? Your rival?

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.210
This brat who has no 
magical power whatsoever?

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.170
Not... Not yet.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.520
Sorry you had to see me 
looking that pathetic, Yuno.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.140
Just a sec...

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.060
I'm gonna kick this guy's butt!

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.370
A gri... moire?

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.710
I knew it.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.000
There's no way that Asta 
wouldn't have been chosen!

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.790
Your magic?

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.100
But you didn't have any magic within you!

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.090
What in the world is that grimoire?!

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:47.070
The three leaves of the clover
 represent faith, hope, and love.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.500
Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.790
Within a fifth leaf...

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.620
resides a demon.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:22.480
Asta and Yuno

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.580
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.080
I know, yeah I know

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:46.590
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.880
I dreamed it all my life

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.370
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.430
Don't care how much I fall

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.860
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:04.260
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:09.620
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:14.770
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:20.060
Someday I will write the next page

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.550
You are my hope

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.130
Like that page from someday

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.810
I was able to meet you

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.900
I call this a miracle

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.560
I'm not going to give up just 
because I can't use magic!

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.810
It doesn't matter if you're a peasant or
an orphan! Anyone can shine in this world!

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.510
<i>Black Clover,</i> Page 2: "The Boys' Promise."

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.500
Page 2
The Boys' Promise

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.740
Not giving up is my magic!
