00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.150
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.550
In search of the magic stone, Asta and the 
others arrived at the Underwater Temple,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.890
where they were forced to participate in High
Priest Gifso's game, the Temple Battle Royale.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690
According to your ranking system,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.900
my temple mages would be more
powerful than intermediate knights!

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.070
Wh-Wh-Wh-What?!

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.290
Don't think I'm gonna get discouraged 
just because I'm surrounded by water.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.470
Magna and Luck also participated in the game,
hoping to get the magic stone.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.210
Ya snooze, ya lose, Magna!

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.510
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.180
Well, well, aren't you lively?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.680
My son is the strongest mage 
of the Underwater Temple!

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.290
He's strong...

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.560
No doubt about it... He's definitely 
the strongest one here.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.530
You two should come at me at once.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.780
I'd rather not hurt you 
any more than I need to.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.870
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.190
You ain't ending anyone, you bastard!

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.850
I'm not done having fun yet!

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.310
The one who appeared 
before Magna and Luck

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.170
was one of the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's top brass, Vetto.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.930
Looks like you're having fun.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.430
Why don't you let us join in?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.670
The Pointlessly Direct Fireball
and the Wild Lightning

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.570
Oh, it's a full moon tonight.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.360
I wonder if Asta is looking up 
at the same moon right now.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.460
Oh, silly me!

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.340
Bah-ha? I guess I fell asleep—

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.680
Bah-ha?!

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.240
Hmph. Not even good for a warm-up.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.450
You're just a pack of mice.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.740
Let's go.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.540
Yes, sir.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.410
Bah-ha...

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.320
I know we were all on vacation, but there 
were a number of senior Magic Knights here!

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.570
And they were all defeated by one guy...

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.830
What were the Magic Knights we 
believed in so much all about, then?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.150
That thing wasn't human.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.960
That was...

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.360
a beast!

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.320
Where'd this macho dude suddenly come from?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.720
He looks pretty hardcore.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.440
Aw, that shark guy was my prey.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.570
All I know is... This guy's magic 
power is greater than Captain Yami's.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.100
You made it through 
the rough ocean currents

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.770
and then forced your way in here...

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.110
That's some incredible magic, all right.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.990
Oh? I guess you can still move.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.670
Ow...

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm pretty sure you're not a Magic Knight.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.840
What brings you to the Underwater Temple?

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.210
We're after the same thing as those 
two over there, the magic stone.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.960
I see. But it's not like I'm 
just going to hand it over.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.010
Oh, I don't expect you to just hand it over.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.470
We're going to lay waste to everyone here,
make you despair, and seize it!

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.720
What are you...

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.440
Scatter and spread despair!

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.550
Yes, sir!

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.180
Well, you're all rather rude, abrupt guests.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.240
Could you head on home now?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.740
Hey, you.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.160
That's also a pretty rude 
way to address someone.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.030
If you want to get your way,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.790
do something about it,
and hit me with all your magic.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.810
Looks like you're completely 
underestimating me.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.420
I may not look like it, but I am the 
strongest in the Underwater Temple.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.930
Enough talk! Say it with your magic!

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.050
Well, if you insist...

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.270
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.210
Beast Magic: Rhinoceros Armor.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.610
It didn't even faze him.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.340
That's not a bad spell, for a mouse.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.620
Let me give you a reward.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.960
A reward?

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.130
Yes, a reward called despair.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.540
This world is all about the 
survival of the fittest.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.720
The strongest beasts survive, and the 
weak vermin live only to become prey!

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.470
Beast Magic: Bear Claw!

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.860
Did you get a good feel for how 
vastly different our powers are?

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.130
You insects aren't even 
allowed to hold on to hope.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.130
I-Impossible...

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.080
The temple's greatest warrior, Gio, 
is being defeated so easily.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.470
I've never seen anything like this.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.100
Hey, gramps. Playtime's over. 
Hurry up and get me in there.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:29.110
Well, if you insist... 
But who in the world is this man?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.610
He's one of the leaders of a nasty terror 
group called the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.660
The Eye of the Midnight Sun?

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.060
I don't have time to explain.
We're short on time, so hurry it up.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.130
Sadly, I can't.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.790
We can't leave here until the game is over.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.800
I can't even undo the spell. 
Those are the rules of my magic.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.510
I see.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.470
What are you...

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.730
Then I'll just let myself out.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:58.640
Say what?

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.040
Dark Magic: Lightless Slash!

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.900
Wh-What in the world?!

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.060
Tch.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.400
This is...

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.910
Spatial Magic: Different Dimension Sphere.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.420
Once you're trapped in my spatial magic,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.660
no matter who you are,
you won't be able to escape.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.420
Black, foreign swordsman...

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.000
The mana tells me you're here.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.050
Stay there and watch for a while.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.590
You're going to be my main dish...

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.600
After I season you with despair, 
as you watch all of your friends die!

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.640
If he gets out, the temple's done for.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.600
Hey, gramps.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.380
Wh-What?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.080
Can you make it so they hear us out there?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.950
Huh? S-Sure...

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.860
But what are you going to do?

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.870
Testing, testing...

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.660
That's the captain...

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.580
Hey, you dumbasses, listen up.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.450
Captain! I beat one!

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.830
Someone really dangerous 
just crashed the game.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.370
He's one of the leaders of 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.370
and a beast of a man strong enough to go 
head-to-head with a Magic Knight Captain.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.390
It's him...

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.760
Also, three of his underlings 
are over there, too.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.510
Hurry up and hand over 
that yummy-looking food...

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.700
Here's the problem... Due to reasons, 
I can't go over there.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.190
What?! What do you mean, "reasons"?!

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.440
Meaning you guys gotta 
do something about him.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.930
You can't be serious!

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.990
Listen up.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.650
All of you, surpass your limits,
right here, right now.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.430
If you die, I'll kill you.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.340
That's all.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.000
Live...

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.500
He's insane.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.680
I never thought the game 
could get so exciting.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.510
It's a game that'll determine the fate 
of the Underwater Temple, blast it!

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.100
The game rules have changed!

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.270
No time limit.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.770
To clear the game, defeat the
Eye of the Midnight Sun's team.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.120
Those who contribute to clearing the game

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.930
will get any wish that's 
within my power to grant!

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.280
There's an absolute monster here...

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.750
Damn it.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.210
I'm scared, but...

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.670
That makes him worth fighting even more!

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.170
I'll do this... I'm gonna do this, damn it!

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.180
Asta...

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.970
I guess we'll have to put 
our match on hold.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.330
Kiato...

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.640
All right, let's go!

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.520
Yeah!

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.240
Now, then... Who's my next prey?

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.300
Not yet...

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.700
Who said you could move on to the next?

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:09.080
We're still alive, you know.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:18.210
After what Mister Yami said, 
I can't just lie here napping.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.210
Besides...

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.050
I'm not...

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.770
...going to break!

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.450
Excellent.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:34.120
The more stubborn the prey, the better 
it is when they're finally in despair!

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.050
Well, we managed to get back up,

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.880
but how the hell are we supposed 
to fight that monster?

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.240
If he lands even one more decent 
blow on us, we're finished... So...

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.420
Hey, you.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.880
Hit us with another one of those.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.880
What?!

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.720
That really fast one.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.570
Damn it, Luck! What the hell?! Are you stupid?!

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:11.140
We just barely managed to block that attack, 
and we both still took a ton of damage!

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.390
Oh? So you're imitating me. Very well.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.020
I'll keep giving you despair...

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.050
until you die!

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.160
Just what I thought! That spell leaves a 
split-second opening right after you attack.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.540
So you're already matching my pace.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.750
You've got good speed and sharp 
senses, I'll give you that!

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.420
Huh? My Thunderbolt Destruction 
didn't work at all!

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.670
I'll play with you for a while!

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.470
You speedy little...

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.520
That battle maniac... Damn it.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.520
So you're Magna, huh?

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.810
What a weird haircut.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.800
I'm Luck. Nice to meet you.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:53.280
Is this the guy who's called the Smiling
Combat Fiend and Luck the Cheery Berserker?

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.540
I need to show him who's boss.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.120
Nice to meet you, too, loser.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.460
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.460
Wow, what a funny face.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.840
Ever since I joined the squad, he was an 
annoying pest who messed with me constantly.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.510
His personality was...

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.130
"This dude's got some serious issues."

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.300
Hot, hot, hot, hot...

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.170
Take that!

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.010
Hot!

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.440
Even on our missions,
he would do insane things.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.290
Take that!

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.320
Huh?!

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.810
It's the Crackling Magna Typhoon!

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.900
I had no choice but to admit that 
he has great battle instincts.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.220
And since that dungeon mission, 
he's gotten even stronger.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:02.390
I hate to say it,
but you're my best friend.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.190
Damn it...

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.940
Don't...

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.950
Don't you dare leave me behind, you dumbass!

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.330
Flame Creation Magic: Grand Slam!

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.750
I'm gonna crush it over here!

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.190
Nice, Magna!

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.850
Take that!

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.350
When I first met you, I underestimated you.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.560
A peasant, huh? He looks boring.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.320
But my instincts warned me...

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.610
They told me, "This guy's gonna 
be dangerous, yet interesting."

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.370
You interested me so much 
that I kept messing with you.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.370
That pudding you were 
saving sure was delicious.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.160
That's going to be your last supper!

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.380
You always struck back at 
me with everything you had.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.300
I just now realized...

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.630
that you're my...

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.100
You're my...

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.650
That you're my very first friend.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.350
Magna! I bet you've got even more in you!

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.860
Shut up!

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.290
Nice catch, Fireball Gangster!

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.400
Who are you calling a gangster?!

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.700
Get off me, Lightning Boy!

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.500
That's enough playtime, don't you think?

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.720
Bring it on, you jerk!

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.000
We're just about warmed up, too!

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.210
This way!

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.140
How can you tell when you 
can't even sense mana?

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.130
I can't sense mana, but I can sense ki.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.440
Ki? It's true that I sense a 
strong magical power up ahead.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.050
And it's incredibly powerful.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.560
I've never felt anything like it before!

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.310
But as you said, we've got to do this!

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.320
Hey, your ki earlier...

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.320
It was hard to sense your presence.
How were you doing that?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.830
Oh, by dancing, I unconsciously 
put myself into a trance.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.440
A trance?

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.030
When I'm in that state, my body moves 
without me even having to think.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.840
Then my opponents can't predict my movements.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.880
I see! So that's actually possible...

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.840
All right!

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.650
Whatcha doin'?

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.100
Putting myself into a trance.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.770
I've got a clear view of that magic now!

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.350
Flame and lightning magic are fighting!

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.690
Flame and lightning... 
It must be Magna and Luck!

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.570
Their opponent has huge magic and...

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.190
What is this?

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.030
It's like hundreds of raging beasts!

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.480
It must be Vetto! Wait, you can tell all that?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.330
My tribe's eyes are good at picking up magic.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.920
But if this is who we're up against...

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.750
Nah.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.920
Those two are crazy, but when it comes 
down to it, they're both super reliable!

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.010
They definitely won't die!

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.430
Ow...

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.790
Do you finally get it?

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.440
The weak get eaten, and all 
they have left is despair.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.690
Despair?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.150
Like we have time for that, you dumbass!

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.660
Yup...

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.200
If we were in despair...

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.430
We'd be too embarrassed to 
act like his superiors again!

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.960
Not yet...

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.850
Not yet...

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.600
We know...

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.980
that if we fight him normally,
we probably won't stand a chance.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.690
Not yet...

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.030
That's why... not yet!

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.110
That slight opening we have 
right after he attacks...

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.540
Right now!

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.040
We'll hit him with all the magic we've got!

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.870
A simultaneous, full-power, body 
and soul attack at close range?!

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.170
Is this what they were trying to do?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.060
Magna... Luck...

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.640
This mana...

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.140
This power is insane.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:00.650
Combo Magic: Flame Lightning 
Explosive Cannon!

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.410
Magna! Luck!

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.350
Petit Clover

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.290
Petit Clover!

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.850
Crackling Magna Typhoon!

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.850
Crackling Magna Typhoon!

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.240
Hey, everyone! How are you doing?

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.440
We can't hear you! Put a little 
more umph into it, damn it!

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.650
Today, we're going to show you how you can 
do an easy Crackling Magna Typhoon at home.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.500
First, have a string of lightning ready.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.320
No one can do that!

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.520
Then, you wrap that lightning 
string around Magna, like this.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.840
It's electrocuting me!

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.970
Oh, you'll have to get your own Magna.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.330
They can't do that, damn it!

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.550
Once you wrap the lightning 
string around him,

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.250
you're going to spin him with 
all your strength like a top.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.270
Just like this! Take that!

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.720
And that's the Crackling Magna Typhoon.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.620
Easy, right?

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.370
You're the only one who can do this, damn it!

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.010
Save me!

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.010
See you next time!

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.730
I'll never give up, no matter 
how powerful my enemy is!

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.460
Not yet! I'm... We're the Black Bulls!

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.940

Page 45
 The Guy Who Doesn't Know When to Quit

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.960
That's right!

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.740
Not giving up is my magic!
