00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.450
The Eye of the Midnight Sun considers 
the Clover Kingdom their enemy.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.930
Their goal is to defeat the Clover Kingdom 
and create their own independent nation.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.640
They believe that once they 
gather all the magic stones,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.860
they will transform into their true 
forms and inherit great power.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.280
But in order for them to 
attain their true forms,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.530
they need three more magic stones.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.460
It was discovered that one of those 
stones lies in the Underwater Temple,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.890
within a strong magic region.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.540
I'm counting on you, Yami.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.750
And you, Asta...

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.620
A Black Beach Story

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.790
We were able to complete our 
mission yet again today.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.540
I'm sure our great Captain 
Vangeance will praise us.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.610
Yes.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.590
But Yuno...

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.390
Yes?

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.400
Sylph, was it? Your spirit 
magic is indeed powerful.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.440
But you need to stop fighting on your own.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.490
We are a team!

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.660
Yuno is ignoring him brilliantly.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.240
Got it? Next time, don't ignore my orders 
and defeat all of the enemies instantly!

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.880
We will do things according to my plan!

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.360
Are you listening to me, Yuno?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.750
I am.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.050
Excellent.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.420
That scream...

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.860
I think it came from over there.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.180
I wonder if there's an incident.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.260
Let's go!

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.920
Give it up!

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.240
No, wait!

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.100
That voice...

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.940
A robbery?!

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.690
Noelle?

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.650
What's going on?

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.560
Th-That's my line!

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.870
Swimsuits?

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.400
Yes, little Golden Dawn boy.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.200
Little boy?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.180
We're going to the ocean tomorrow.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.200
Noelle doesn't have a swimsuit, 
so I was helping her pick one out.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.690
I even told her she could borrow one 
of mine, but she doesn't want to.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.340
It was just strings!

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.180
How could I possibly wear that?

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.950
I-I see.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.180
Then that scream earlier...

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.970
That's because Vanessa 
suddenly took off my clothes!

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.680
Well, it makes no sense to try on 
swimsuits while still wearing clothes.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.190
It's your own fault for 
taking forever to undress.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.260
Right?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.320
Not a chance.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.200
What about this one, Noelle?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.140
I told you, there's no way I could wear that!

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.580
All this fuss over nothing.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.900
Picking out swimsuits to go to the beach?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.880
Are you lot just fooling 
around instead of working again?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.160
How rude! This is for a mission.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.310
A mission?

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.570
Yes.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.720
An s-e-c-r-e-t one...

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.430
Want to come along, little boy?

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.390
How adorable.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.850
We don't have any spare time 
on our hands, so I'll pass.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.860
I'd love to go to the beach, but we
also have another mission tomorrow.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.110
I see. That's too bad.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.740
I-It's my Meal-Saving Prince!

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.350
I would've loved to see you 
in a swimsuit, Noelle.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.070
Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?!

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.000
I wonder what he'll say if 
he sees me in my swimsuit...

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.000
I'll send you pics later.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.500
Glance...

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.170
She's so sexy! She looks...

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.970
so delicious!

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.730
I-I'm flattered!

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.470
Devour me—

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.180
Hurgh!

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.220
Owie...

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.020
Huh? Where's my Meal-Saving Prince?

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.010
The Golden Dawn kids already left.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.900
La...

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.370
I guess you've already 
picked out your swimsuit.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.860
Now we just need you to hurry 
up and pick one, Noelle.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.570
What about this one?

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.410
I told you, I can't wear that one!

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.450
Then how about this one over here?

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.750
Over where?

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.540
It's a little expensive, though.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.740
The price doesn't matter. 
It's pretty and cute.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.580
But... it doesn't seem to cover very much.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.390
Also, what's all that flashy decoration for?

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.470
All eyes will be on you at the beach.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.020
Eyes...

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.980
I wonder if Stupidsta will notice me.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.790
Maybe he'll at least
compliment me if I wear this...

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.860
Like I care if he notices me or not!

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.650
Um... What would you like to do?

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.280
I'll buy it, okay?!

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.920
Keep the change.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.860
What?!

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.750
Are you ready, you bastards?!

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.420
My goddess Marie... I wanted 
to take you to the beach.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.340
I wonder if whales are stronger than sharks.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.260
Sharks have very rough skin.
Did you know that?

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:01.020
Why are you two on my Crazy Cyclone, 
totally expecting a ride from me?!

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.690
Well... I can't fly on a broom, so...

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.560
The same goes for me. Did you already forget?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.570
How stupid are you?

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.120
Who do you think you are?!

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.660
Why don't you guys ride 
on someone else's broom?!

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.560
You have royalty like me
offering to ride with you.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.200
You should be thankful, you peasant.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.460
Seriously, who do you think you are?!

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.170
Is Captain Yami still asleep?

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.680
He said he wanted to check 
something out and left earlier.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.590
Really? It's pretty unusual for 
him to actually do some work.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.180
That's Mr. Yami for you!

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.930
All right! Let's go!

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.940
Crazy Cyclone, blast off!

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.530
The place where Asta and the others are 
headed is an oceanfront town called Raquey.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.510
Raquey has very strong mana, 
causing it to be hot year-round.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.000
This makes it a popular resort getaway 
for royalty, nobles, and Magic Knights.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.250
Why didn't you just use your spatial 
magic to get there, Finral?

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.070
I've never been to Raquey before.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.760
I can't use my spatial magic to go 
to places I haven't been to before.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.710
Tch. You're so useless!

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.890
Now we have to fly over.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.140
Seriously, I have seniority over you!

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.210
I'm surprised you've never 
been there before, Finral.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.040
I figured you were flirting with 
all the girls on the beach there.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.680
It's always better to save 
the best things for last.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.990
That's why I haven't gone yet.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.240
I'm so excited to go to Raquey!
Wait for me, girls!

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.290
Hey, wait. The guy who's always 
awkwardly exhaling steam isn't here.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.290
Huh?

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.530
I'm right here!

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.840
So wait, that was Grey?

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.140
Then where's the real Gordon?!

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.230
Huh? Guys? Are you still asleep?

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.310
Isn't it time to leave soon?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.940
Wait... Did they already leave?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.680
We should be able to see it soon.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.200
See what?

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.340
The ocean.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.040
I can't wait! I've never seen it before!

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.290
Me, neither!

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.130
But I still don't see any sign of it. 
Is Raquey still pretty far away?

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.840
No, it shouldn't be.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.500
What are you talking about?

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.800
We've been looking at the 
ocean for quite some time now.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.410
Don't tell me...

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.270
Seriously?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.150
It's so huge, I couldn't even tell!

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.520
It's beyond my wildest dreams!

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.770
So this is the ocean?!

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.440
This is amazing!

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.410
The ocean... It's so huge!

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.080
Awesome... This is so cool!

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.250
I wish I could show Yuno and 
the other runts this view, too.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.610
What about me?!

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.810
And someday, I'd love to 
bring Sister Lily here, too.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.550
Seriously, what about me?!

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.260
The sunset's so beautiful, Asta.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.550
Yes... But Sister Lily...

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.270
You're even more beautiful.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.310
Huh?

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.470
I became the Wizard King.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.650
So, Sister...

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.450
Whoosh! Open!

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.280
Marry me.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.170
Of course!

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.040
Just kidding!

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.250
What's he smirking about?

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.840
He'd better not be remembering that k-k-kiss!

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.290
W-Wipe that smirk off your face!

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.140
I-I-It's not like I'd ever 
kiss him or anything.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.510
I'm going to show off this swimsuit 
I bought yesterday in front of him!

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.920
D-Don't get the wrong idea!

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.030
I'm just going to show him that 
I'm way better than Rebecca.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.660
I'm so embarrassed!

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.530
But I want him to see me... 
But this is still really embarrassing!

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.370
But...

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.630
Hey, Stupidsta! Wh-What do you 
think about this swimsuit?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.000
How do you like my awesome swimwear?!

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.060
Whoa! What the heck is that, Magna?!

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:53.520
Isn't it awesome?! This is something that 
Mr. Yami also uses! It's called a loincloth!

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520
Dork.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.960
Let's swim to our hearts' content in this 
ocean that's as big as Mr. Yami's heart, Asta!

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.030
You got it, Magna!

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.530
Hey, you two.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.330
What do you think of my swimsuit? 
Doesn't it look great on me?

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.430
It's not that different from 
how you usually dress.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.350
Yeah.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.880
I guess a virgin delinquent like you 
can't understand adult charm.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.140
Who are you calling a virgin delinquent?!

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.090
Wanna go for a run?

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.690
Man, you're on fire, Magna!

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.500
Shut up, you blasted fools!

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.230
What do you think, Marie?
 I made it look just like you.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.530
Yeah, thanks!

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.900
Hey, Brother, show me the ocean!

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.900
Of course. With pleasure.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.530
Look, Marie. This is the ocean.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.030
That's amazing! It's so big and beautiful!

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.200
Next time, we can come here 
together and splash around!

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.080
Hey, it's pretty cold...

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.840
Hey, it's Asta! I want to play 
with Asta in the ocean someday!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.210
H-Hey... What do you think?

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.890
I'm giving you permission to 
look at me in my swimsuit.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.300
Anyone who tries to tempt my Marie shall die!

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.640
Hey, Asta!

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.310
Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray!

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.990
Tch.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.510
It's so salty!

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.610
Wait, huh?! I can't breathe!

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.580
I can't swim!

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.860
Seriously, look at me already!

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.030
There!

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.080
So, so many hot girls in swimsuits!

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.620
All right! Let's go flirting!

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.290
Grey! Transform into me!

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.960
Yeah! Check it out, yo!

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:49.500
Okay, Grey! We'll be twins, and our selling 
point can be our snappy dialogue!

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.320
What time is it?

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.300
Leave it to me!

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.730
This goes hand-in-hand with the beach.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.480
If it's food, I know it 
like the back of my hand.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.770
So good!

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.050
Nothing beats having drinks on the beach!

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.420
Charmy, you need to move more to the right!

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.280
Huh?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.250
Weren't you helping Finral 
pick up some girls?

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.950
Yeah, but I got bored, so I left him behind.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.160
A little more to the left!

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.430
I told you, to the right!

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.700
The left!

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.940
I can tell... Just a little more...

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.300
Just... ten more steps!

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.070
I thought I was a goner!

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.230
Hey, Asta, my swimsuit...

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.560
You're right there!

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.220
Ouch!

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.670
What are you doing, Miz Charmy?!

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.370
If you had hit anyone else, they'd be dead!

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.730
Hey, watermelon juice.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.640
You don't get it at all!

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.530
Hey! My swimsuit!

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:56.230
Hey, Asta. It only occurred to me after I 
turned into you, but your muscles are gross.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.540
You should use your transformation 
spell for something more useful, Grey!

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.600
You're wasting it!

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.210
My swimsuit!

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.710
Oh, yeah...

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.050
Now what?!

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.790
It's just like I thought! Running on this 
sand is excellent training for my legs!

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.910
Look at me in my swimsuit, you idiot!

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.230
You still can't control your magic?!

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.400
You saved my butt this time, but seriously!

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.400
Aw, it went out.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.570
Hmph. All I can manage without a staff are 
defense spells that remain stationary.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.570
Why are you bragging about that?!

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.250
Ding!

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.790
Bah-ha!

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.130
So this is the famous Raquey Beach.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.800
The ocean is calling my name!

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.280
Sekke, should we really be playing around?

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.350
Isn't that all we really do?

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.430
Well, I did such a good 
job on that last mission...

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.680
that the Wizard King gave me a hundred stars!

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:06.360
&lt; Lies &gt;

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.960
Bah-ha!

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.890
Captain Jack praised me, too!

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:11.490
And most importantly, I saved all 
the kids from those evildoers.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.720
&lt; This Is Somewhat True &gt;

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.050
It wouldn't hurt for me 
to spread my wings a bit.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.740
Hey, beautiful ladies.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.170
Bah-ha?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.970
Where are you from?

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.920
Home.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.300
Ah, I see. Want to come play with me?

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.540
Nope.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.340
Huh?

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.960
W-W-W-W-Wait!

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.620
Wait a sec!

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.300
Look at that loser trying to pick up girls.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.500
Go on, you two. Go pick up some girls.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.260
Huh? What about you, Sekke?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.710
You stupid bah-hastard!
I can't do something so vulgar.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.020
I'll meet up with you guys after you 
successfully pick up some girls.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:50.480
This jerk! He's planning to show up 
and act like he's doing us a favor!

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.640
The only reason you got to come here is 
because of me, the Magic Knight, right?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.620
I gave you a chance. Now, go on.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.760
Oh, jeez...

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.160
Guess we don't have a choice.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.880
Look, there are some ideal 
babes right over there.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.700
Bah-ha! Don't worry about me! Let's go!

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.220
You go...

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.140
Hey there, cuties!

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.020
Wanna come talk with us about 
how awesome magical girls are?

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.010
Get lost, insects.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.110
Bah-ha...

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.550
She's from the Black Bulls!

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.820
Wait, does that also mean...

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.080
Take this, damn it! Explosive Scattershot!

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.570
Watermelon!

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.160
Hup! Hup!

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.080
Die! Reflect Ray!

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.540
Bah-ha!

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.880
Bah-ha!

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.500
Oh, dear...

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.430
Did we just run something over?

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:55.230
Who knows?

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.000
I think we ran into something.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.770
Nyom, nyom, nyom...

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:04.100
Wait! Hey! We came here to 
look for the magic stone!

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.100
Why are you all playing around?!

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.600
And you're not?

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.480
C-Captain Yami...

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.170
All right, gather round, you idiots.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.740
I picked up some info while 
you were messing around.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.940
Huh?

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.080
Apparently the Underwater Temple
really is at the bottom of the ocean.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.190
But the mana kicks up the 
ocean currents so much that,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.540
ordinarily, even a first-class 
mage can't get near it.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.370
But on the night of the full moon,

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.050
the mana becomes weaker.
We might be able to get in then.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:42.220
C-Captain Yami is actually, 
seriously doing his job!

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.600
I'm seriously going to murder all of you.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.770
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.920
Like the name suggests, the Underwater 
Temple is on the ocean floor.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.000
We can't just walk to it.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.920
So Noelle...

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.140
Take us there with your water magic.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.050
Huh?

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.910
Give us a ride there.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:06.660
B-But I'd need incredible magic 
control in order to do that.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.540
I can't! You should ask someone else.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.550
I-I mean, if I fail...

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.630
You're right.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.800
If you fail, the fierce currents will 
take us all under, and we'll drown.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.600
This is a top secret mission 
entrusted to only the Black Bulls.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.720
No one else can do it.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.100
You do it.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.100
The next full moon is a week away.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.360
Learn to control it by then.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.610
Surpass your limits.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.970
Sea Dragon's Lair... Right now,
it's my only spell.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.250
Developing it further should 
be the quickest way.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.210
But...

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:09.810
Vanessa taught me some magic control
tricks before, but none of them have worked.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.440
Maybe I just don't have the 
ability to control magic.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.340
But even if I don't have talent, 
I won't run or make excuses!

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.120
I'll just keep working... 
until I figure it out!

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.890
This time for sure...

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.170
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.480
So you were training too, Asta?

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.590
And you too, Noelle?

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.930
A-As if a royal like me would train.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.600
Let's train together, then.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.590
Huh?

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.750
If you lose control again, 
I'll be able to stop you.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.060
H-Hmph! That won't happen again.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.570
Training with just the two of us...

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:05.370
W-Well, if you insist,
I guess I wouldn't mind...

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.820
Um, Asta?

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.950
I hear something.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.270
Petit Clover

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.330
Petit Clover!

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.770
Look at Me!

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.580
Look at Me!

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.450
Hey, Stupidsta. Look at me!

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.280
How do I look in this swimsuit?

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.040
You're all sparkly.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.780
Isn't it heavy?

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.130
That'd probably work great
as part of a scarecrow.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.010
You sort of look like a cow back in Hage...

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.800
Wh-What are you staring at?!

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.240
Crab!

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.800
Crab!

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.450
But you told me to look!

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.930
Ugh, I'm so embarrassed...

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.450
Crab...

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.920
Bah-ha! Did you all enjoy yet another 
appearance by me, the great Sekke Bronzazza?

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.650
I'm even more bah-hawesome on the beach!

One, two, three, bah-ha!
