WEBVTT

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.820
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.190
a devil.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.360
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.740
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.740
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.880
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.770
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.710
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.750
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.390
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.230
Stirrings of the Strongest

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.940
Right around the same time 
all of you were fighting,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.700
the Golden Dawn's headquarters was attacked.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.830
They've been almost completely annihilated.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.320
I'm glad all of you are safe.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.970
Asta and Yami protected us.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.560
What's Asta's prognosis?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.820
Thankfully, he'll live.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.350
It's just...

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.090
I don't know what we can do 
for his right arm right now.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.830
I have no idea what will come of it.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.860
U-Um... Could you take a look at Gauche, too?

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.450
At Gauche?

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.510
The wound's healed, and I feel fine.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.660
B-But you should get examined properly!

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.680
What do you mean?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.920
Gauche was run through with a giant sword,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.960
a-and I healed him with my magic, but...

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.530
You did? But don't you 
use transformation magic?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.700
All right, I'll have a look.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.650
You really got run through with a giant sword?

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.730
Yeah.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.990
I wouldn't even call this healing. 
His tissues themselves have been rebuilt.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.780
The true nature of your magic 
might not be transformation.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.370
Then what kind of magic is it?

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.670
I hate to say this, but I have no clue.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.170
Grey will have to find that out for herself.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.080
Right...

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.400
We'll have Asta continue to rest here.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.930
The rest of you can return 
to the Black Bulls' hideout.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.620
There's going to be an emergency Magic Knights
 Squad Captains' meeting in the morning.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.880
The best thing you can do right now is rest.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.800
What? My body won't move.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.360
Where do you think you're going?

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.950
Who is that? Is his magic 
the reason why I can't move?

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.700
You should probably head back in.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.370
I have to go save Captain Yami!

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.520
That's not going to happen.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.610
The place you're trying to get to

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.170
has not only the devil-possessed 
you didn't stand a chance against,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.090
but two others who are equally as powerful.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.810
Your devil's forsaken you, too.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.600
And you don't know what's 
going on with your right arm.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.970
How does he—

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.070
Going in your condition 
isn't brave or anything.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.940
It's ignorant and reckless.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.140
Still... I have to go!

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.820
While I... While I'm here, Captain Yami is...

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.100
Just leave him.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.490
I don't know who the hell you are...

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.500
but what the hell do you 
know about Captain Yami?!

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.790
Oh, I know him very well.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.850
Huh?

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.990
He's boorish, violent, and vicious.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.050
He's irresponsible, immoral, and insincere.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800
He's honestly pretty worthless.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.320
I can't win this one without you...

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.040
Asta!

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.080
You don't know anything! 
Captain Yami risked his life for us!

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.080
But if he lost, he's nothing more than a fool.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.430
Demon-Destroyer!

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.010
If you can't even defeat me, 
there's no way you can save Yami.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.270
That's because...

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.810
you're weak.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.530
If only...

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.960
I was stronger...

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.360
You're such a fool.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.960
But you're a good person.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.860
I like you.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.800
Don't worry. Yami's still alive.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.090
Weg?

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.220
Who... are you?

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.450
I am the Vice Captain of 
the Black Bulls, Nacht.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.540
If you so desire, I'll show you 
how to use the devil's powers.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.740
The Black Bulls? How to 
use the devil's powers?

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.080
Hey, Nacht. Who's the shrimp?

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.580
This ki... That's a devil!

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.800
Gimodelo, I regret to inform you that 
you're even shorter than he is.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.550
Oh, come on. You know that 
this isn't my true form.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.040
He's having a casual conversation 
with that devil.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.640
You're devil-possessed, too?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.240
I am. This is my devil, Gimodelo.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.720
You really do belong to the Black Bulls.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.900
Wait, you're really the vice captain?!

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.560
Yes, though Yami just 
decided that on his own.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.660
Aw, but I wanna talk—

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.630
Captain Yami?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.030
I can't blame you all for 
not knowing about me.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.420
I've only been in the hideout once.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.060
But why?!

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.710
Because I hate Yami.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.720
Huh?!

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.710
As annoying as it is, 
people like him are rather tough.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.970
There's still time before he'll die.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.470
How do you know that?!

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.850
Because I've been undercover in the 
Spade Kingdom for a very long time.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.780
I still don't really know you, 
or even know if I can trust you...

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.800
But...

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.260
You're the only one that 
I can rely on right now!

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.240
Please! Show me how to use my devil powers!

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.360
Nice and straightforward.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.890
I like people like you.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.770
Th-Thanks!

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.920
But for the time being, I can't say 
that I sense any talent in you.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.520
What?! Y-You say such mean things 
with a smile on your face!

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.120
But I'm sure things will work out if you 
can figure out how to use your powers.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.180
Then let's get started—

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.190
Nope. You need some good rest first.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.300
Huh?!

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.340
There's somewhere I'd like to go with 
you tomorrow, so just rest for tonight.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.140
How the heck am I supposed 
to sleep in this situation?!

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.600
I don't like selfish people.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.460
It looks like you're all here.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.550
Then let's get this emergency 
captains' meeting started.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.150
That concludes the report from 
the members of the Black Bulls.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:44.300
The Tree of Qliphoth, which connects 
this world to the underworld...

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.160
In order to create it, 
they need Yami and Vangeance.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.500
I can't believe those two were kidnapped.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.860
They probably let their guard down.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.250
And they're Magic Knights 
Squad Captains. Unbelievable.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.840
Such pathetic men.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.760
No... No! Yami's been...

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.020
Is he all right? Is he alive?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.130
I haven't even gotten to tell 
him that I love him yet!

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.000
We did everything we could.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.210
But it wasn't enough.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.150
Even worse, our enemy wasn't 
even fighting seriously.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.220
Well, isn't that interesting?

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.370
I bet you got scared and overestimated him,

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.620
Mr. Vice Captain of the 
Golden Dawn who almost died!

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.000
Jack, don't.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.540
Even as we speak, our world may become 
connected with the underworld.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.880
Then what? The world's finished?

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.370
We must act to prevent that from happening.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.470
But there are too many unknowns.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.730
So basically, all we've got are guesses,
 since we don't know anything.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.370
This is stupid.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.370
Nothing's gonna come out of this meeting.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.690
I'm out.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.770
Stop.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.070
You'd better not be thinking about 
infiltrating the Spade Kingdom on your own.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.080
What? Why would I go there for that idiot?

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.580
Even if I did, it wouldn't concern any of you.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.870
You fool! Of course it would!

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.670
You can't be allowed to do something 
so reckless as a captain!

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.920
I want to go save Yami, too!

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.630
You guys can sit here picking 
your noses as long as you want.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.180
I want to kill that fool just as much as you do!

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.020
All of you, settle down!

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.670
Lord Julius...

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.980
Well, I'm glad you all seem motivated, at least.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:46.240
But... I dislike people who 
can't even hold a proper meeting.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.360
H-Heya...

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.660
Could you quiet down a bit...

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.570
Captains?

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.250
Asta...

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.750
Who are you?

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.540
An intruder?!

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.790
Oh?

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.300
I'm pretty sure I have every 
right to be at this meeting.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.770
Four devils?! There were others?

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.600
Devils? This man is devil-possessed?

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.150
Who are you?

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.780
He's a vice captain... with the Black Bulls.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.990
Lord Julius?

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.420
He's been acting as a spy 
in the Spade Kingdom,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.240
though I didn't know that 
he was devil-possessed.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.000
The Vice Captain of the Black Bulls?

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.690
A spy in the Spade Kingdom?

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.630
I guess anyone could be the 
vice captain of Yami's squad.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.380
I've seen this asshole before.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.300
Wait, you're... But your magic is...

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.470
That man doesn't exist anymore.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.230
We're wasting time, so I'm going 
to get straight to the point.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.730
Everyone, please sit down.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.180
As you all know, the gate to the underworld 
is about to open in the Spade Kingdom.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.040
And to make that happen, 
I'm sure the preparations for

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.520
the ritual of the advent of 
Qliphoth are underway.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.880
Yami and Vangeance will be offered as 
sacrifices for the core of that ritual.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.920
Captain Yami...

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:29.130
From that point on, over seven days, 
the advent of Qliphoth will begin.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.560
Seven levels, seven gates, will open one by one.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.880
Ten devils compatible with the Qliphoth 
are scattered throughout them.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.710
The deeper the level, the stronger the devil.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.780
The upper devils are equal to the Dark Triad.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.570
The devils lower than that are far superior.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.850
And...

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.870
If the final devil, Lucifero, 
appears, this world is done for.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.120
As the catalysts of the advent, 
Yami and Vangeance will also die.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.550
Conversely, until the gates fully open,
 they will both live.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.350
He managed to gain this much 
information on his own?

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.760
From the very heart of the enemy's country,
 the most dangerous area...

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.520
Why is the Dark Triad trying 
to do something so dangerous?

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.320
I'm sure we wouldn't be able to understand.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.290
You're all Magic Knights. I'm sure you've 
seen it more than you'd ever want...

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.340
Ones who will hurt others without 
hesitation to satisfy their desires.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.280
They only care about themselves.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.210
Absolute trash who won't 
feel a shred of guilt.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:42.750
I don't want to understand how the 
ultimate form of that trash thinks,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.000
nor do I care.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.210
Irrational evil... 
There's nothing that I hate more.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.960
Even if God and the devils 
forgive them, I never will.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.130
That being said, I can't 
defeat the Dark Triad.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.970
I'm aware of my own limits. I can 
only do what's within my abilities.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.900
And that's why...

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.140
I'm going to make him our ultimate warrior.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.110
Huh?

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.310
Anti-magic has that much potential.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.740
In three days, the gate to the 
underworld will be opened.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.680
Before that happens, we're going 
to take back Yami and Vangeance

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.750
and destroy the Tree of Qliphoth.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.120
With my magic, we'll be able to infiltrate 
their castle without being noticed.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.930
We will then attack the Dark Triad
 and take each of them down.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.400
Dante has gravity and body magic.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.370
Vanica has curse-warding and blood magic.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.150
Zenon has spatial and bone magic.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.690
Zenon?

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.440
But my magic won't allow me 
to take that many people.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.120
We will need to gather forces

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.200
that have a chance against the devils,
 with Asta at our center.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.580
Hell yeah. You'd better believe you're 
picking from the captains first.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.960
Let me go.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.990
I know I'm being impudent, but please.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.050
Huh? What are you, stupid?

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.840
Like we'd send anyone who's 
already lost to them.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.570
Yuno, I understand how you feel,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.930
but staying behind and protecting the 
Clover Kingdom is also an important job.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.030
Yuno...

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.100
There's actually something I want to ask you.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:34.650
There is a resistance that fights against 
the Dark Triad in the Spade Kingdom.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.780
The other day, one of them 
snuck into the Clover Kingdom.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.410
They're at your hideout 
right now, aren't they?

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.580
What?

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.960
Just who are you?

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.460
Apparently,

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.590
I'm the Prince of the Spade Kingdom.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.660
What?!

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.130
The Prince of the Spade Kingdom?!

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.270
Yuno, are you s-serious?!

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.090
Yeah. When the revolt against 
the royal family happened,

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.270
I was a newborn, and someone apparently
 escaped with me to the Clover Kingdom.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:18.030
I see. If he's royalty, then his 
tremendous amount of mana makes sense.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.280
The man who's with me now served 
the previous royal family.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.510
He should know a great deal 
about the enemy and the castle.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.830
That's even more reason not 
to let you handle this.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.040
That guy could be an enemy spy!

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.050
Not to mention, there's even
 a chance <i>you</i> might a spy.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.300
If I don't save him, there's no point.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.320
It's not just me. 
Ever since the elf incident,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.560
you've all been suspicious 
of Captain Vangeance.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.230
And I can't blame you for that,

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.060
because he wasn't able to choose 
between the humans and the elves.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.440
And that's exactly why, even though 
he's hurting, he's constantly fighting

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.590
more earnestly than anyone 
else as a Magic Knight.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:10.830
After I lost to that guy, there's something
 I remember as I was blacking out.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:17.340
Captain Vangeance was fighting while 
protecting the members of the Golden Dawn.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.120
You should probably get rid 
of some of your baggage

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.270
so you can concentrate on the fight more,

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.350
but you won't.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.180
And that's exactly why you're going to lose.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.100
Of course I won't abandon them.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.300
I made them walk down a path of thorns.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.240
Even so, they rose again without 
cursing me and forged ahead.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.410
They are my pride and joy! They are my dream!

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:50.370
It's because he fought while protecting 
us that Captain Vangeance was captured.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.750
Even if he's a traitor who turned his 
back on this kingdom once to all of you,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.350
to us, he's the kindest and most 
reliable captain we could ask for!

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.970
Yuno...

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.840
That guy thinks he annihilated 
everyone in the Golden Dawn.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.960
But we're still alive... 
because of Captain Vangeance's magic!

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.600
This isn't over yet!

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:18.360
The Golden Dawn is the greatest 
Magic Knights Squad in the Clover Kingdom!

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.840
I'm going to prove that Captain Vangeance 
did the right thing when he protected us,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.370
and just how powerful we are!

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.190
I will be the one who 
saves Captain Vangeance!

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.680
What the hell's up with this mana?

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.400
Hey, shut your mouth alr—

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.590
Hey, could <i>you</i> shut up already?

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.970
I'm storing up mana here

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.580
so we can take down that bony bastard!

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.750
Yuno's not going to lose again!

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.160
Very well. I don't hate people like you.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.440
Who cares if you're the 
Prince of the Spade Kingdom

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.410
or the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn?

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.820
You'll always be Yuno!

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.480
Now, we'll be leaving for the 
Spade Kingdom three days from now,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.030
early in the morning.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.570
I will send you details of our plan later.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.830
This time, we'll be the ones who attack.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:14.950
I don't have time to cry when 
Yuno's being this serious.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.700
If I lost because I was weak, that just 
means I need to get stronger!

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.590
No...

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.970
I'm going to surpass my limits 
and become the most powerful!

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.680
Let's defeat the Dark Triad 
and rescue our captains!

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.120
Yeah!

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.930
Then we should also ask the 
Heart Kingdom for help.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.600
Actually, I haven't been able to 
get a hold of them since yesterday.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.730
What?! Did something happen 
to Charmy and the others?

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.090
Each member of the Dark Triad 
left their castle yesterday.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:49.270
Vanica might have attacked the Heart Kingdom.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.440
What?

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.570
You're...

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.850
I can't believe the 
Vice Captain of the Black Bulls

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.190
is someone who can use the devil's powers.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.660
What kind of training are we 
going to do to make me the best?

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:53.440
