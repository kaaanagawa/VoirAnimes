00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.660
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.590
And currently...

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.030
Now that my arms are better, I need 
to make up for all the time I've lost!

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.520
It appeared as though peaceful days 
had returned to the Black Bulls.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.370
Man, there haven't been any 
incidents lately. It's so boring.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.700
It's so peaceful!

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.120
But a single mage destroyed it all.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.120
Raging Bull

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.000
One potato! Two potato! Three potato, four!

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.000
All right, all eyes up here.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.210
He was called the Captain of the Black Bulls,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.460
and for some reason,
he was wearing a happi coat.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.720
So, yeah, there's a festival happening.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.890
A festival?

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.250
A Fun Festival Double Date

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.730
Captain Yami!

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.230
What's this festival all about?!

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.230
To put it simply, it's a 
friggin' awesome festival!

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.100
Understand now?

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.070
I see!

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.810
Or not at all!

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.160
That was a bit too simple.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.530
Finral, explain this festival in more detail.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.040
Huh? U-Uh, sure...

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.420
But I have seniority...

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.300
As you all know, the Wizard King awards stars

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.510
to Magic Knights Squads to
recognize their achievements.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.930
All of the squads compete to 
see who can get the most stars.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.800
Then they announce the number 
of stars won in a year

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.220
and determine the top squad for that 
year. That's what this festival is.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.050
Heck yeah! Let's shoot for number one!

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.450
Considering how much trouble 
our squad causes each year,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.740
I'm sure we're always fighting for last place.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.940
Nope!

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.010
Last Year's Star Numbers
1: Golden Dawn 96
2: Crimson Lion Kings 93
3: Silver Eagles 88
4: Purple Orcas 74
5: Blue Rose Knights 72
6: Green Praying Mantises 65
7: Aqua Deer 53
8: Coral Peacocks 51
9: Black Bulls -50

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.630
We're dead last, without contest.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.810
I mean, we're the only squad in the negative.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.950
What?! We're causing way 
too much trouble, then!

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.100
Also, this festival is held 
in full view of the public,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.830
and is the biggest, most-loved 
festival of the year.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.090
And it's called...

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.840
The

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.840
Raging
 Bull

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.590
Star

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.340
Festival

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.220
Festival

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.220
...the Star Festival!

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.630
The Star Festival

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.630
Festival

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.340
Whoo! Mister Yami!

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.930
He's really into this! 
Captain Yami is surprisingly into this!

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.560
Right. I can never get into this 
stupid festival, but let's go.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.130
Yet you're dressed like that?

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.850
I'll go with you, Mister Yami!

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.290
Festival! Festival! Festival! Festival!

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.290
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.610
Oh, sorry to interrupt, but Finral...

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.450
Girls! Girls! Girls... hm?

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.160
There are some people 
I'd like you to bring with us.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.450
This is awesome!

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.750
All right! Go live it up, you dumbasses!

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.350
Raging Bull

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.350
Festival

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.350
There's still time before 
they announce the rankings!

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.110
Woohoo! I'm drinking tonight!

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.110
La! Noms!

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.710
I'm gonna go get some food, too.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.780
I wonder what I should get for Marie.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.750
I wonder if there's anyone strong around.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.620
Hey...

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.420
Where'd you buy that funny-looking mask?

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.070
This is my face.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.920
Stop that!

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.910
I'm super excited!

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.720
I wish I could show this 
to everyone back in Hage!

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.180
Don't get so excited that 
you end up getting lost.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.770
W-Well, I guess I'd better 
go around with you.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.990
Hey!

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.580
Oh, there they are!

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.030
Kahono! Kiato!

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:47.910
I've missed you guys!

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.980
Asta! You're looking great!

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.190
Yeah!

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.550
What brings you here, though?

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.390
I had Finral bring them over.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.670
Always happy to help out one 
of my adorable juniors.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.890
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got 
some ka<i>yute</i> girls waiting for me.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.700
Flirty, flirty, flirt!

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.620
So this is what a festival
 in a surface city is like!

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.390
It's amazing!

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.060
I'm already grateful enough that you 
guys saved the Underwater Temple

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.540
from those terrifying 
Eye of the Midnight Sun guys.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.020
Thanks for inviting us, Asta.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.820
And there's my beautiful goddess!

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.670
Kahono, you still can't talk,
so don't get too excited.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.940
I'm sure Kahono really wants to sing.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.460
And I...

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.500
Kiato, did you bring your leg?

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.340
Huh? Yeah...

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.960
We preserved it with water 
magic. Why do you ask?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.760
Good.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.910
In that case...

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.530
My leg!

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.910
Awesome! We got secret witch 
spells from the Queen of Witches,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.200
and that was one of her healing spells!

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.000
This is amazing!

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.750
I can dance! Just like before!

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.310
No...elle?

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.510
My voice... I can talk!

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.520
I... can....

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.060
sing again!

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.750
Noelle!

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.880
Thank you!

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.990
Kahono!

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.020
Thank you so much, Noelle!

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.280
I'm so happy for you!

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.310
Thank you so much, Asta!

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.530
S-Sure...

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.780
Everyone can hear my song again...
Thank you so much!

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.480
That was so pretty!

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.730
What a magnificent voice!

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.080
I guess now we can strive to be idols again!

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.450
Yeah! I'm gonna get even better,
and then get filthy rich!

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.300
O-Oh, right...

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.830
That's her main goal.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.790
Kahono's way more responsible than I am.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.680
Money's important!

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.850
Hey, this festival only 
happens once a year, right?

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.840
Let's have a total blast!

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.080
Yeah!

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.780
Your heart is mine, my beautiful goddess.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.220
Shrimpsta!

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.630
Magna! What's that giant thing?

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.450
What else? It's a cannon to shoot fireworks!

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.040
Fireworks?!

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.290
I'm gonna be shootin' them off once the 
sun goes down, so you better help me!

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.170
Heck yeah!

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.490
Oh, but I'm about to go enjoy 
the festival with them.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.330
What? You aren't going 
to listen to your senior?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.000
There're two guys... and two girls.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.040
H-Hey... Are you guys going
 on a d-double date?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.840
Double?!

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.920
Not bad, Shrimpsta.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.290
Uh, what's this double whatever thing?

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.600
Huh? A double date's—

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.100
Th-That's not it at all! 
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?!

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.520
I certainly won't complain about 
a date with my beautiful goddess.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.500
Jeez... I see you still have 
a problem with being honest.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.860
That means I'll just have to...

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.500
Oh, come on!

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.200
It's been forever since we've seen 
each other, so let's all have a blast!

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.710
I know! Let's actually make it a double date!

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.210
What?!

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.790
What the heck's about to happen here?!

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.510
Okay! Let the double date begin!

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.770
A d-double date? That's w-way too bold!

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.730
For Kahono to bring this up... 
Does that mean she likes Asta?

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.230
Kahono... She's doing this to bring 
me and my goddess together.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.320
Well done, little sister! 
Your big bro's gonna do his best!

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.200
What the heck's a double date?!

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.460
Whoa!

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.870
Come on, Asta. Let's go have some fun!

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.960
Ah, so a double date means having fun!

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.070
S-So I was right?! Goodness, she l-linked 
arms with him right in front of me!

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.510
Shall we dance as we go?

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.050
Yup. She's panicking.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.320
Noelle, if you don't do something, 
I'm going to enjoy this festival with Asta.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.060
If you don't fight and win, 
your wish won't come true!

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.710
So good! Yum!

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.980
Could you write "my beloved goddess"
 in mayonnaise for me?

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.030
"My beefy glasses"?

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.870
No, "my beloved goddess."

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.250
I can't shoot!

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.260
Sir, you've got to use your magical power.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.540
In that case...

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.870
Use some of mine.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.300
Thanks!

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.620
Hey! What're you doing, miss?!

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.030
Ugh! What's your deal?!

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.350
I found this lovely mask that'd 
be perfect for you, my goddess!

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.110
Woohoo! I got a prize in the magic gun game!

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.520
You're awesome, Kahono!

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.190
I got some smaller balls 
as a consolation prize!

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.470
Those two seem like a good match.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.450
Wh-Why do I have to care 
about something like that?!

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.370
My beautiful goddess, a crêpe for thee!

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.790
Ugh, why aren't you even trying, Noelle?

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.000
At this rate, I'm just getting 
in the way of your crush.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.090
I guess I'll just have to change things up.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.260
I know the perfect spot.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.050
Hey, Noelle. What's this place?

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.840
I-It's a haunted house, duh!

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.000
What's that?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.310
Huh?! You seriously don't 
know anything, do you?

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.110
They didn't have these things at 
the festivals in Hage Village.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.390
Places like this are well-known for being 
extra scary and bringing couples super close!

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.070
Otherwise known as the couple 
establishment factory!

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.500
At this rate, I'm just going 
to have to force them together!

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.770
K-Kahono, don't leave my side!

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.250
I can't let my goddess see me like this!

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:02.220
Come out, ghosts... Or should 
I say, cupids of love!

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.760
Bah-ha! Let's go over this one more time.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.140
You'll scare the customers, 
and then I appear!

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.770
Bah-ha... Miss, are you all right?

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.270
My, what a brave gentleman!

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.300
Indeed! I'm the bravest!

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.030
I <i>am</i> the most powerful of 
the Magic Knights, after all!

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.030
&lt; Lies &gt;

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.670
Just between you and me,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.280
I'm confirmed as the next captain 
of the Green Praying Mantises!

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.280
&lt; Lies &gt;

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.540
But I've fallen head over bah-ha for you!

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.540
Complete Nonsense

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.790
Let us enjoy this night together.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.670
Yes!

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:43.290
And that's how I'm going to 
get the girl! Easy peasy.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.920
Yeah, for you.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.680
And here they come. Give it your all!

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.280
So when are these ghosts coming out?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.980
H-How am I supposed to know?

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.190
Phati!

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.280
Aphro!

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.280
Huh?

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.790
There we go. They're scared.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.500
Asta and Noelle should be clinging to 
each other for dear life right about now.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.080
Phati!

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.540
Or not?!

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.540
Get lost! You stupid insect ghosts!

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.590
You guys had the nerve to attack 
the royal capital again?!

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.410
Bah-ha?! Th-They're...

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.810
Save me!

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.860
Don't come over here! Hey! Look closer!

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.190
It's me!

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.190
You must be the boss!

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.700
Bah-ha?!

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.370
Oh, so they were all fake.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.090
Of course they were! We got 
kicked out because of you.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.050
You flew off the handle too, you know.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.050
Y-You're just imagining things.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.880
I-I was so scared...

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.130
Another failure! Noelle has to 
work harder, but Asta's too dense!

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.560
I wonder how he really feels about Noelle.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.650
Hey, Asta.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.690
What does Noelle mean to you?

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.080
Huh?

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.930
What does she mean to me? Hmm... Let's see...

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.650
Mommy!

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:39.770
Is she lost?

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.570
Where the heck are her parents?

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.800
Hey, you oka—

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.090
Look at her shabby clothes.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.550
What an eyesore.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.270
I wonder if her parents are peasants 
who came here to find work.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.550
What a noisy brat. Peasants can't 
even raise their kids properly.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:59.060
How dare those lousy peasants 
spoil the Star Festival for us?

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.760
Only those who possess strong magical 
powers can live in the realms above us.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.440
There's prejudice against 
those who lack magical powers.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.810
Even though we're all human.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.090
Huh...

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.790
Hey!

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.290
What's the matter? Why are you crying?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.370
Hey! I can't help you 
if you just keep crying!

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.650
Get a hold of yourself!

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.590
H-Hey...

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.300
I know!

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.890
Hey, lookie over here!

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.310
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.460
I got you...

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:55.950
Asta the Superman can do anything!

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.610
He's tiny, but his voice sure is huge!

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.620
He's dumb, but he's bursting with muscles!

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:08.470
He can't use magic, but he 
can slash through any spell!

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.130
Are you making fun of me?!

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.470
He can't use magic,
but there's nothing he can't do!

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.570
Superman, Superman, Superman Asta!

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:29.520
Asta the Superman can do anything!

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.900
Bursting with muscles!

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.450
Slashes through any spell!

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.740
Ta-da!

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.420
There's nothing he can't do!

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:52.630
Superman, Superman, Superman Asta!

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.550
Wow...

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:02.310
My goddess, behold this dance,
 which I offer to you!

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.060
So, tell me your name.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.180
Emma.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:13.160
Kahono, could you use your song magic to 
broadcast this girl's name to her parents?

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.690
Oh, yeah! Leave it to me!

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:21.420
Emma!

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.250
How can I ever thank you?

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.310
I'm glad your mom showed up.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.540
Thank you, everyone.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:37.070
Didn't I tell you to stay put? 
I'm here to work, remember?

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.330
I'm sorry. The festival seemed so fun...

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.970
Thank you so much.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.530
Those ornaments... You're royalty?!

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.690
From the House of Silva?

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.570
I-I'm so terribly sorry!

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.030
My daughter didn't offend 
you in any way, did she?!

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.900
Sh-She's royalty?

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.490
She has silver hair... She must 
belong to the House of Silva!

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.370
It's rude enough for any 
peasant to even speak to her!

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.750
Yes, I am royalty.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.880
We're said to have the best 
magic in this kingdom.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.630
And that's exactly why we should 
extend a helping hand to everyone.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.170
Being arrogant because 
you think you're better

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.970
than everyone else and 
looking down on others...

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.540
Only those with shallow hearts do that!

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.020
You can enjoy the festival too, Emma.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.020
It doesn't matter if you're a royal, 
an aristocrat, a commoner, or a peasant!

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.650
Everyone should have fun together!

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.160
You're so cool, miss!

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.410
What does Noelle mean to you?

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.980
Well...

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.220
I guess...

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.090
I like Noelle quite a bit.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.440
Take that!

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.940
Whoo! Fireworks!

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.670
Huh? What's wrong?

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.100
Finally!

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.650
Come on, Noelle! 
Tell him how you really feel!

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.360
Where...

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.500
Where the heck did that come from?!

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.650
Have you lost your mind?!

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.170
What the heck?!

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.140
That's hot!

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.970
Whoa...

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.500
That's royalty for you.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.080
Is he okay?

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.090
Yeesh...

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:38.380
Asta, did you fly off in
 consideration for my feelings?

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.930
Jeez... He's so dense, and she just 
can't be honest with herself.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.170
What was that?

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.550
I-I thought I was going to die...

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.480
Festival

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.200
I've wanted to settle the score 
with you for a long time.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.120
Wh-What's going on?

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.340
Petit Clover

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.900
Petit Clover!

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.850
Hitman

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.060
Hitman.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.270
My angel... No, my client, Marie...

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.360
As you requested, your big brother 
is going to end that man's life.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.180
The target is that doll.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.320
We are hoomans.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.540
Marie likes that thing a lot lately. 
I'm going to bring it down.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.540
With all my magical powers!

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.350
Mirror Magic...

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.120
Real Double! And then...

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.630
Reflect Refrain!

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.780
Hoomans... Hoomans...

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.670
Wha— We missed!

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.670
Hoomans...

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.210
Oh, this really short, buff 
kid broke that gun earlier.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.670
He's going to die!

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.350
I went on a d-date with you, so 
you'd better be grateful, Stupidsta!

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:47.450
Wait, who said it was a date?! I'm a royal!

Uh, what are you doing, Captain?
