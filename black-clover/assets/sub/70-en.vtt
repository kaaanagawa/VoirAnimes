00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.260
The Star Festival.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.570
A festival where the number of stars that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.180
Last Year's Star Numbers
1: Golden Dawn 96
2: Crimson Lion Kings 93
3: Silver Eagles 88
4: Purple Orcas 74
5: Blue Rose Knights 72
6: Green Praying Mantises 65
7: Aqua Deer 53
8: Coral Peacocks 51
9: Black Bulls -50

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.270
each squad has accumulated in that 
year is announced to the public.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.520
The squad that places first

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060
proves they have done the most work that year.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.440
It is considered the highest honor.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.930
They're about to announce the 
Magic Knights Squad achievements!

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.310
All the captains are gonna be there!

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.200
I hear that includes the new captains of 
the Crimson Lion Kings and the Purple Orcas!

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.740
All the captains?

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.000
Raging Bull

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.000
Festival

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.510
We're late.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.260
Crap. What are we gonna do?

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.020
Two New Stars

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.450
Everyone, thank you 
for gathering here today.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.640
Over there!

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.180
It's the Wizard King!

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.900
28th Wizard King
 Julius Novachrono

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.900
This year, I'll be announcing the Magic 
Knights Squads' achievements myself.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.730
The Wizard King is doing it himself?

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.220
Wow!

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.220
After the results are announced, 
the king will also make an appearance,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.060
so please look forward to that.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.820
Wizard King!

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.330
Wow, the Wizard King is as popular as ever!

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.580
Now, then...

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.660
As you all know, our Clover Kingdom 
has been battling invasion attempts

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.630
from both the Diamond and Spade Kingdoms,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.720
as well as a new terrorist group 
called the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.520
The royal capital was attacked, 
and many lives were lost.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.300
I even considered canceling the 
Star Festival for this year.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.790
But it's because of all 
these events that I wanted

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.260
to commend the courageous men and 
women who fought against them,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.730
and decided to hold the festival.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.700
Now, then. Let us welcome them...

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.330
Our nine Magic Knights Squad captains, 
whom we hold in the highest esteem.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.270
It's the captains!

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.630
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.630
That's the captain of the 
Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva!

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.380
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises 
Jack the Ripper

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.380
The captain of the Green Praying Mantises,
Jack the Ripper.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.510
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
Dorothy Unsworth

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.510
The captain of the Coral Peacocks,
Dorothy Unsworth.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.260
Captain of the Aqua Deer
Rill Boismortier

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.260
The captain of the Aqua Deer,
Rill Boismortier.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.470
The new captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
Mereoleona Vermillion.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.770
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Mereoleona Vermillion

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.770
The new captain's a woman!

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.540
The rumors say that her flame magic powers
 are equal to those of the former captain,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.360
her younger brother Fuegoleon, 
or maybe even more powerful!

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.780
The new captain of the Purple Orcas,
Kaiser Granvorka.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.370
Captain of the Purple Orcas
Kaiser Granvorka

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.370
They have a new captain, too!

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.100
I heard a lot of things went 
down with the Purple Orcas.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.870
I look forward to the new captain!

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.620
And last, but not least...

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.150
Captain of the Golden Dawn
William Vangeance

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.820
The captain of the Golden Dawn,
 William Vangeance.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.200
Sir William!

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.810
The Golden Dawn's definitely taking 
first place again this year!

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.020
Wait, aren't we missing some captains?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.140
Now that you mention it...

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.740
After I told them over 
and over to be on time...

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.270
Yami's late all the time, but 
I'm surprised about Charlotte.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.610
Good grief. There's already trouble.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.280
<i>You're</i> the cause of it!

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.280
Raging Bull

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.550
Well, anyway...

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.790
Let's announce the ranking.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.210
In first place...

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.120
The Golden Dawn!

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.730
Kiten defended  5
Number one arrest rate for misdemeanor crimes this year  5
Medical relief to various locations  10
Aided the Zekka region after a typhoon  6
Border defended  6
Magic ore importer arrested  3
Magic Knight Squad financial donation contributed  5
Band of burglars vanquished  2
Palace defense squad assisted  5
Noble Realm welfare facility aid  3

Illegal substances exposed  2
Aided in scouting and negotiating with the Diamond Kingdom  3
Nobility guarded  3
Assisted with flying lessons at a children's facility  1
Assisted with farming in the Clover Kingdom  3

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.340
The number of stars they accumulated is...

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.920
an astounding 125!

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.710
That's a huge jump from their 
record of 96 from last year!

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.550
That's amazing!

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.440
They can't be stopped!

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.680
The Golden Dawn is on a whole other level!

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.450
The Golden Dawn did excellent 
work yet again this year.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.460
Now let's have the member who made the 
biggest contribution of stars take the stage.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.230
The promising newcomer attended 
by Sylph, the Wind Spirit,

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.650
Yuno!

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.260
La?! Yuno?!

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.890
He's a dreamboat!

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.740
He's so handsome!

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.750
Excellent work, Yuno!

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.300
You're amazing!

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.500
What did you expect?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.920
4th Class Senior Magic Knight, Golden Dawn
<font size="30">Alecdora Sandler</c>

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.250
Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn
<font size="30"> Langris Vaude</c>

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.840
Yuno... I can't lose, either!

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.340
Next, in second place...

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.270
Do you think it's the Crimson Lion Kings,
 like in the years before?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.290
No, their former captain, Fuegoleon, 
being injured probably hurt their chances.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.560
Then it must be the Silver Eagles.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.790
I'd love for the Blue Rose Knights to get it!

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.880
I wonder why Lady Charlotte isn't present.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.400
Hey, there.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.200
Want to enjoy the festival with 
me after the announcements?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.700
That robe...

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.620
You're a Black Bull. How about no?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.080
I bet you guys are going to come in last again.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.830
In second place...

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.750
We're always in last, 
so none of this matters to us!

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.170
The Black Bulls

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.440
The Black Bulls!

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.010
What?!

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.380
Seriously?!

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.280
Medical relief to various locations  10
Aided the Zekka region after a typhoon  6
Border defended  6
Magic ore importer arrested  3
Magic Knight Squad financial donation contributed  5
Band of burglars vanquished  2
Palace defense squad assisted  5
Noble Realm welfare facility aid  3
Sodeel Village restoration aid  3
Frontier expeditions  6
Magical mine discovered and conserved  3
Aided in magical item research  2
Assisted in guarding the king  3
Illegal substances exposed  2
Aided in scouting and negotiating with the Diamond Kingdom  3
Nobility guarded  3
Assisted with flying lessons at a children's facility  1
Assisted with farming in the Clover Kingdom  3

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.170
They managed to accumulate...

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.390
101 stars!

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.220
What?!

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.250
We're in second place?! What the heck?!

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.520
Seriously? Well, crap.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.950
Y-You can't be serious.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.520
That's amazing!

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.520
Yay!

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.650
What a lovely surprise.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.530
I figured they'd climb the 
ranks this year, but...

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.470
Well done.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.900
Y-You mean that squad of ruffians?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.570
This has to be some kind of mistake.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.530
Maybe they threatened somebody.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.470
They must've cheated.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.000
That's not true!

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.750
The Black Bulls risked their lives fighting 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun to protect us!

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.010
There's no way they would've cheated!

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.720
Kahono... Kiato...

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.100
They saved us, too!

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.720
The Girl from the Restaurant in Nean
<font size="30">Rebecca Scarlet</c>

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.290
Some of them are a bit rowdy, 
but they're all kind people deep down!

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.560
I understand your surprise,

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.790
since the Black Bulls made

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.070
their own unprecedented record last year 
by getting negative 50 stars.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.320
But things are different this year.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.970
They advanced by leaps and bounds 
to climb this far up the ranks.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.080
One of the most impressive 
members is their newcomer...

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.850
Then again, their captain's not even present.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.290
Hey, is anyone from the Black Bulls around?

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.920
Man, that was a shock.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.420
Hey, aren't you boys from the Black Bulls?

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.220
Unfortunately, that stage has some other 
lousy brat's name written all over it.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.060
Yup!

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.040
Where in the world is he?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.820
I'll let you take the glory this time,

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.060
so just hurry up and get on the stage!

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.790
Huh?

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.230
He's calling you,

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.400
kid!

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.590
Man, that was dangerous.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.090
I see you showed up, Asta.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.090
Heck yeah, I did, Yuno!

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.810
Yuno!

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.150
Asta!

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.070
The Black Bulls' growth from last 
year is far greater than ours.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.380
Asta, looks like you guys got a lot of stars.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.680
Don't let it go to your head, though.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.370
I'm still the one who'll be the Wizard King.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.410
<i>I'm</i> gonna become the Wizard King!

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.060
Look who's talking! Your squad won 
and even broke your last record!

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.100
You're the one who better 
not let it go to your head!

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.500
I'm gonna get twice the amount 
of stars you do next time!

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.250
Then I'll get double that.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.260
Say what?! Then I'll get five times that!

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.010
So how many times more stars are you 
going to get than me in total now?

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.400
Uh... That was double... another 
double... and then five times that...

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.230
So nine times?

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.770
Twenty times more, you moron.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.020
Damn it!

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.480
Well, that was quite the entrance.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.030
This is the rookie who worked the hardest 
out of the Black Bulls this past year.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.340
Asta!

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.030
Oh, hey. Hey, there.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.980
Yuno and Asta placed first and second in 
obtaining stars among all the rookies.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.040
They're two new rising stars.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.940
In only six months since they 
joined the Magic Knights,

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.280
they've both built up magnificent records.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.550
On top of that, they're childhood friends,
 and they're both just sixteen.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.770
They're both very impressive youngsters.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.800
I wonder what noble families they're from.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.890
Nope! Apparently they're 
peasants from the boonies!

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:30.150
Bah-ha! Not to mention that Asta 
kid doesn't even have any magic!

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.620
They're peasants? No way.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.180
He doesn't have magic?

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.820
Did they really use their 
abilities to rise up the ranks?

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.260
Ugh! What's with these people?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.570
Bell.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.920
What?

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.830
Full power.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.120
I wouldn't have it any other way.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.260
Uh, Yuno? What are you doing?

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.760
Asta...

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:07.110
Doesn't this remind you of the 
training we did when we were little?

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.690
The hell?! Why do you keep doing 
stuff like that outta nowhere?!

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.350
Besides, we're not kids anymore!

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.230
Are you trying to kill me in the middle 
of my big moment?! You ass!

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.020
If you had died there, 
then that's all you were worth.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.350
Glad you survived.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.060
What?!

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.610
S-Such powerful magic...

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.980
And the other guy stopped it?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.230
They're on a completely different level!

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.980
Now that you've seen their powers,

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.780
if any of you still doubt their 
achievements, please come forward.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.980
It's true that they're both peasants.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.410
But they've worked harder 
than anyone to get here.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.530
Proud citizens of the Clover Kingdom!

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.170
A round of applause for 
these two new Magic Knights!

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.740
And... let us overcome 
our differences in status,

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.670
band together, and lead 
our country to victory!

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.400
Wizard King...

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.420
I guess peasants aren't too bad.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.580
Yeah! Now's not the time to 
be talking about status!

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.180
Let's all work together!

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.830
Yuno...

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.820
Yeah.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.510
We...

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.500
actually made it this far.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.150
And now that you're all fired up,

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.950
I'll announce the remaining rankings!

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.210
In third place, the Silver Eagles!
 They earned 95 stars!

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.210
In fourth place, the Blue Rose Knights!
 They earned 83 stars!

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.710
In fifth place, the Crimson Lion Kings!
 They earned 76 stars!

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.220
In sixth place, the Green Praying Mantises!
 They earned 69 stars!

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.470
In seventh place, the Coral Peacocks!
 They earned 67 stars!

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.480
In eighth place, the Purple Orcas!
 They earned 51 stars!

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.170
And in ninth place, the Aqua Deer!
 They earned 49 stars!

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.480
D'oh!

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.820
This concludes the announcement of 
the Magic Knights Squad achievements.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.990
To all the squads... Please continue 
all your hard work next year.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.030
W-We're last!

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.270
H-How? Why?

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.250
It's because all you do is draw dumb pictures.
You don't have your act together.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.250
Double d'oh!

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:46.760
Asta! How did you get all those stars?!

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.760
H-Hey, let go of me! Have you no shame?!

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.010
No, no, I don't wanna!

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.010
Is he really a captain?

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.950
We lost to the Black Bulls?

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.270
We lost to the squad that Noelle's in?!

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.460
Good for you, Noelle.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.290
What did you expect?

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.240
I'm sure you'll get first place next time!

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.360
And when that happens...

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.610
Dance a joyous dance with me!

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.370
Hooray for the Magic Knights!

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.370
We'll be counting on you again next year!

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.990
Now that the achievement 
announcements are over,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.680
here's the moment you've 
all been waiting for.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.540
The appearance of our beloved 
King of the Clover Kingdom!

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.250
The king?!

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.570
Come to think of it, what's the 
king of this kingdom like, anyway?

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.730
Do you know, Yuno?

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.550
Nope.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.050
That's quite a lot of excitement 
for a mere sideshow.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.540
Now, greet your king with your loudest cheers.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.150
Now, my citizens...

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.480
The King of the Clover Kingdom
Augustus Kira Clover XIII

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.480
Revere me!

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.300
Don't stand right next to me.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.370
You're in my spotlight.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.870
My apologies, Your Majesty.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.170
Ahem...

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.460
My wonderful citizens, 
how are you doing today?

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.930
I am the King of the Clover Kingdom, 
Augustus Kira Clover the 13th.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.750
Long... live the king.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.390
Revere me more, would you?!

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.250
Whoa! He freaked out!

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.230
You can't be serious.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.450
I am the king! The king!

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.900
I'm the most important person 
in this whole kingdom!

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.160
Behold this sublime mana that's 
been passed down for generations!

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.660
My thoughts!

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.160
My appearance!

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.040
Everything about me is righteous!

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.900
I am greater than any Wizard King!

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.130
I wonder if the Wizard King would 
consider becoming the king.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.430
If only the Wizard King 
was the actual king.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.640
Couldn't the Wizard King just be the king?

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.580
The Wizard King should just become the king!

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.430
Shh!

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.980
Your Majesty, please calm down. Calm down.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:11.630
Curse you, Julius! Stealing all 
the popularity for yourself!

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:12.950
Not to mention...

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.510
The Golden Dawn is number one again?

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.140
You and your weird mask!

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.450
How dare they surpass squads 
that have royalty as captains?

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.590
Unforgivable... Completely unforgivable!

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.840
I'll show them! I will be the one 
who earns the people's support.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.970
My loyal citizens, I have 
an announcement to make.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.890
The Eye of the Midnight Sun's 
hideout has been located.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.150
I-It has?

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.180
Until now, they have attacked us many times,

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.920
and they had the upper hand in every battle.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.610
But things are different now.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.860
We are going to launch an 
all-out attack on the enemy!

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.440
To that end,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.120
I have decided to gather an even more 
select group from the Magic Knights

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.460
to form the ultimate hand-picked unit.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.670
They will be called... the Royal Knights!

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:09.840
The

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.090
The Ro

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:10.340
The Royal

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:10.590
The Royal Kni

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:11.670
The Royal Knights

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.180
A week from now, I will hold 
an exam for all Magic Knights.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.680
Only those who pass this exam will 
be allowed to join my Royal Knights.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.730
And then, we will destroy 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:33.230
Magic Knights, offer up your grimoires 
in service to this kingdom!

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.300
Royal Knights!

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.240
Royal Knights!

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.160
Royal Knights!

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.120
Nailed it.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.870
This was all Julius's idea,

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.110
but I shall take the glory for it!

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.330
Why are you choosing, Your Majesty?

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.570
The ones we think are awesome are the Wizard 
King and the Magic Knights Squad captains.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.220
Not the king.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.910
I've never heard about the king 
doing anything amazing before.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.880
Have you, Yuno?

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.040
No...

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.950
He has, like... a lot of mana,

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:11.250
but he hasn't done a single good 
thing for the people, right?

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.230
I guess so.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.470
I don't have any magic,
so I don't really get it,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:21.320
but that king doesn't have much of a 
presence... and he seems pretty petty.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.250
Hey, Asta. Take a hint.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.750
You're not supposed to tell 
the truth at times like this.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.370
Huh? Wait, so I'm right?

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.880
This is hilarious.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.020
Execute them!

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.560
Execute those filthy peasants immediately!

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.270
This is all your fault.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.040
How dare you involve Yuno like that?!

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.300
Execute them?

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.310
Seriously?

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.820
Now! Now! Now!

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.390
Hurry up and kill them!

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.620
Your Majesty, please calm yourself.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.500
Out of consideration for me, 
I ask that you pardon those two.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:12.940
They may become the shield 
that protects you someday.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.170
Besides...

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.430
If you recklessly brandish your 
power over something like that,

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.470
you'll make the king's authority look cheap.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.340
The Royal Knights! I'm looking 
forward to this, too!

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.770
Magic Knights! Show us 
your courageous strength!

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.520
You don't need to tell me that.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.530
If our members get chosen, 
our squad's rep will go up.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.230
I'm not gonna let Yami's squad keep the lead.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.910
I'll work hard so we don't end 
up in last place next time!

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.620
Jeez... This is totally Julius's idea.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.000
He always thinks up something fun.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.380
Wizard King!

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.800
I'm sorry for making the king mad earlier!

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.250
You should apologize to me, too.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.180
I almost got executed because of you.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.740
Since you two wish to become 
the Wizard King, the Royal Knights

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.130
will be a chance for you to 
achieve even greater things.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:09.930
Yes, sir!

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.980
But while you two may be amazing, 
you're still rookies.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.770
Plenty of tough veterans are going 
to show up for the selection tests.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.780
Tougher than you've ever seen.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.400
Bring it on!

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.740
If we fail, it just means that 
we weren't up to the task.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.360
Go forward, without getting 
full of yourselves.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.570
I'll be waiting for you.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.450
Yes, sir!

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:43.050
The Royal Knights, huh? I dunno what kind 
of exam it'll be, but I'm gonna do this!

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.070
Don't cry if I'm the only 
one who gets in, Asta.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.080
Like hell I'm gonna cry!

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.560
I'm gonna pass and kick the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun's ass!

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.840
And for that to happen,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.360
I need to hurry and figure out how 
to make the most of that power.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.440
You absolute imbeciles!

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.370
The Crimson Lion Kings placed fifth?

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.790
What kind of travesty is that?!

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.290
Do you want me to kill you 
all right here, right now,

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.300
before you ever have a chance 
to die on a mission?!

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:25.350
W-We just stumbled upon a major bloodbath!

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.270
Petit Clover

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.730
Petit Clover!

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.780
Rill the Artist

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.830
Rill the Artist.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:12.050
Sigh... I just can't get it right.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.740
What are you up to, Rill?

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:20.160
The king asked me to draw a portrait of him,
 but it's just not turning out right.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.170
I guess even you have bad days.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.570
His face doesn't spark 
any inspiration at all,

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.070
and I can't make it look artsy.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.770
Let's see...

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.620
He drew him so cool.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.770
Who the heck is this scary lady?

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.060
Huh? She's Captain Fuegoleon's big sister?

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:48.280

 The Uncrowned, Undefeated Lioness

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.620
Now, I finally get to say this again!

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.700
Ready, and... Not giving up is my magic!
