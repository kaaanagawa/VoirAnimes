00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.880
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.760
The Wizard King, Julius Novachrono, 
protected the kingdom's citizens

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.990
from an attack by the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun's leader, Licht.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.770
But as a result, he was gravely injured.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.940
What the hell's going on here...

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.230
Vangeance?!

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.160
Good day to you, Yami Sukehiro.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.650
I am Licht.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.820
Yami attacked Licht, but...

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.120
Dark Magic...

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.370
Dark Cloaked...

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.870
Dimension Slash!

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.330
He got away.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.630
And Julius...

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.800
I leave the rest to you...

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.420
You got it.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.890
This is goodbye for all of you.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.980
You will serve as the foundation 
of the resurrection.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.980
Licht's true intentions were
 about to come to light!

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.790
Reincarnation

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.630
A four-leaf grimoire!

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.880
Licht of sword magic was chosen 
by a four-leaf grimoire!

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.510
What's a four-leaf grimoire, Mommy?

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.560
It's a grimoire with good fortune in it.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.290
Only those it chooses can wield it!

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.770
Licht

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.930
Licht, with the four-leaf grimoire...

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.910
He's so cool!

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.460
Licht!

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.490
You again?

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.830
You're so annoying,
 coming by every day. Go away.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.170
Shoo, shoo.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.590
Patry

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.590
I'm not here to see you.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.220
What did you just say, shrimp?

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.860
Oh, come on. He's not annoying, Raia.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.710
I'm glad you came to see me.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.350
Oh, I see.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.100
So what do you think, Licht?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.230
Hm?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.560
About the rumors that the 
humans might attack us.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.030
I believe they're just rumors.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.130
But I wouldn't say it's 
completely impossible.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.390
They're...

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.460
Humans are a wicked-hearted
race that kills animals for sport.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.880
Their magical powers are weak,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.470
but their increased numbers 
have made them overconfident.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.750
Even though we elves have saved them

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.800
from countless natural disasters in the past...

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.210
I'm sure they're just scared.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.050
Scared?

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.310
They're just like us.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.560
We're much alike, but they don't 
know that, so they fear us.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.650
But we should be able to 
understand each other...

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.310
because we both receive grimoires.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.370
That's...

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.280
It's a tornado caused by 
natural mana running wild.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.290
It's pretty big.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.780
It'll go away on its own if we ignore it.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.300
Licht!

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.260
Someone else appeared 
behind the tornado?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.220
That's...

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.900
Sword Magic:

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.270
Origin Flash!

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.690
Light Magic:

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.780
Lamp of Avior!

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.330
Licht!

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.980
He managed to destroy a tornado 
that big! He really is amazing.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.080
But...

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.000
Who's that guy who just used
light magic that seemed

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.090
just as powerful as Licht's magic?

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.250
Are you all right?

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.090
Y-Yes.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.340
Thank you so much.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.440
Tetia! Why did you leave the 
castle without permission?

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.600
Brother...

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.170
Your magical attribute is wind.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.500
How did you, of all people, 
get caught up in a mana tornado?

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.520
Thank you for saving my little sister.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.870
It's nothing...

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.880
He has a four-leaf grimoire, 
just like Licht.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.980
A human...

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.150
Licht sure has been hanging 
around those two a lot lately.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.650
He sure has. I guess he's happy 
to have some human friends.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.370
I mean, those two are really decent people,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.620
and they seem to have the 
same thoughts as Licht.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.700
The same thoughts?

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.910
They were wondering if elves 
and humans could get along, too.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.200
I see.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.810
Why must Licht keep hanging 
around those humans?

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.460
But Licht is never wrong.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.940
And that human was also

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.300
selected by one of the four-leaf 
grimoires, just like Licht.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.770
We can come to understand each other.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.860
You elves have truly amazing mana.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.710
By combining that with the magic-item 
technology that we humans created,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.110
we can make this land 
safer and more prosperous.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.850
Let us live together, hand in hand.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.130
You're with child?

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.900
With you two as its parents,
I'm sure it'll be a wonderful child!

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.680
Congrats, Tetia... and Licht, too, I guess.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.430
Well, thanks, I guess.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.220
What? Something bothering you?

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.140
Well...

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.060
I guess you are still a kid.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.630
Be quiet! Stop treating me like a child!

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.700
Yeah, yeah... Ooh, aren't you scary?

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.700
Oh, there they are.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.200
Hey there, Raia.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.850
Are you too lazy to even wake up nowadays?

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.000
You're the worst.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.770
Oh, shut up.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.090
Jeez, Patry. Hogging the 
spot next to Licht again?

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.900
After tomorrow's ceremony, 
he's going to belong to someone else,

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.080
so you should probably cut the cord now.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.350
Shut up. I can do what I want.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.990
What, you little brat?!

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.520
It's fine. Even if I marry Licht, 
he still belongs to everyone.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.330
The human princess sure is nice.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.280
That kindness is going to 
bring you trouble someday.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.530
And pretty soon, there won't be 
any room for you anymore.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.980
Stop picking on him. Patry knows that.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.790
So, Licht, how does it feel, knowing you're
 going to be a father in a few months?

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.500
I can feel the mana blessing us.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.380
I'm very happy our child will come into 
this world welcomed by everyone.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.540
This child is our future.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.350
It'll bridge the gap 
between elves and humans.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.930
Congratulations!

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.570
I wish you both years of happiness!

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.090
May the mana bless you!

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.870
Thank you so much.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.530
Please take care of my little sister for me.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.970
Yes. I will protect her, no matter what.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.780
Thank you for being here today, everyone.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.740
Congratulations!

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.750
Tomorrow's the day you get your grimoire.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.730
Licht, you remembered!

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.060
Of course. How could I forget?

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.520
I'm excited to see which 
grimoire chooses you.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.320
Yes!

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.410
Aw... I hope someday I'll also...

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.620
I'm sure you'll meet 
someone lovely soon, Fana.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.160
I sure hope so.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.650
I wish you a lifetime of happiness.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.670
Thank you.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.670
If this guy ever cheats on you,
 let me know right away.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.450
I'll make sure to kick his ass.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.960
Hey, come on now, Raia...

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.090
I'm just kidding.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.970
Licht seems so happy.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.930
I mean, Licht always seemed happy.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.940
I'm a bit jealous she's the one 
who made him happier, but...

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.730
It's because of those two humans.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.610
We can come to understand each other.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.320
I wonder if we can come to understand 
humans someday, just like he said.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.280
Licht seems to believe that, too.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.710
I guess it's possible... for elves 
and humans to join hands someday.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.920
Wh-What's going on?!

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.570
The humans are attacking!

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.090
This way! Hurry!

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.830
I can't use any magic!

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.540
Our magic has been sealed!

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.480
Get down!

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.610
Run... quickly...

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.890
You loathsome humans...

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.160
This is light magic. That means...

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.620
...dare you...

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.000
How dare you?!

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.300
Mommy!

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.470
Run!

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.430
Hey, wake up! Open your eyes!

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.930
This can't be happening!

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.140
This has to be a dream!

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.490
Hey, answer me!

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.690
It hurts! It burns!

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:40.450
How dare you, how dare you, how dare you,
 how dare you, how dare you?!

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.090
They put up a barrier! We can't go—

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.940
How dare you... How dare you...

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.940
It's all over!

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.100
How dare you?! How dare you?! 
How dare you?! How dare you?!

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.870
How dare you?! How dare you?!

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.830
I'll never...

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.250
Licht...

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.620
Lich...

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.330
...t...

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.310
Where... am I?

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.060
What in the world is going on?!

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.140
Didn't I die?

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.860
These aren't... my hands.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.450
Huh?! Licht?

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.370
What's going on? 
I somehow look like Licht!

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.960
Did my soul somehow end up in Licht?

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.770
No... The feeling of this mana...

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.060
This body... It's human!

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.970
A human that looks like Licht?

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.720
That's right... I'm sure that I died.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.410
The thing that Licht activated 
when our magic was sealed...

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.830
It must've been forbidden magic!

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.930
Meaning... a reincarnation spell.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.060
This is...

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.590
I can tell... I can feel them.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.850
Raia's soul...

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.750
The souls of all the elves from the village!

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.750
Licht must have activated a reincarnation 
spell in those last moments!

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.760
In order to save us elves!

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.520
But not everyone's been fully reborn.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.770
It's just me.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.770
Right... my grimoire.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:29.730
This grimoire chose the soul that 
inhabits this body, so I can't use it.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.370
I don't know if I was chosen 
or if this is sheer coincidence.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.060
But... I was the only one who was reborn.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.620
And in Licht's form!

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.880
I'm the only one who can save them all!

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.860
I'm the only one who can!

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.390
I have...

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.100
been chosen.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.930
I will become Licht.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.530
No matter what I have to do...

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.110
I will bring back all the elves.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.610
And this time...

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.880
The humans betrayed someone precious 
to me. They betrayed all of us!

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.870
This time...

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.630
This time, we'll destroy the humans!

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.510
Forbidden Magic: Evil Eye.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.620
I've added magic from the other 
world to your soul and assisted

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.740
your reincarnation in a human 
with a similar wavelength.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.530
Gathering the magical power I needed 
to use this spell was no small task.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.530
I'd appreciate it if you didn't 
cause me any trouble, Raia.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.090
You're Pat—

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:07.790
However, bringing you back 
is Licht's—no, my mission.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.710
Isn't that right, Raia?

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.990
It sure is, Licht.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.340
You guys...

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.500
Raia...

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.470
So you're finally awake. You overslept.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.230
All things considered, I wish 
I could've slept a little longer.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.930
I was also able to resurrect these two.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.640
Vetto... You're a kind soul 
who can talk to the animals.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.190
And yet, even now, you're being persecuted.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.670
Come live with us once more.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.560
You're not the one who should be in despair.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.780
It's the humans.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.230
Remember your true self.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.430
How unfortunate, my old friend.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.810
Nothing has changed.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.460
Humans still continue to harm other humans.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.320
I shall destroy you all, 
as you seem to desire.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.880
But I need your body.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.450
I need you to live.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:28.100
Fana, not only do you look alike, 
but you both share the same name.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.080
This cannot be a coincidence.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:35.020
You shouldn't have to meet the same 
sad ending in this lifetime, too.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.290
Now... awaken.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.350
The only ones I can resurrect 
right now are these three.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:55.030
For a complete rebirth... In order 
to resurrect everyone else,

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.450
I will require a phenomenal 
amount of power and sacrifices.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.060
We'll gather the magic stones 
that were once in our village,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.700
which have now been scattered.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.500
By using the humans, of course.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.420
Isn't that a wonderful idea?

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.380
Yeah.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.000
Let's do this, Licht.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.270
We will get revenge against 
those loathsome humans.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.050
I will give them endless despair!

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.230
Humans, you shall serve as the
foundation of the resurrection.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.540
Foundation of the resurrection? 
What the hell are you talking about?!

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.660
We're about to awaken to an insane 
amount of magical power now!

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.530
Don't tell me you actually tricked us?!

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.910
What the...

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.820
Th-This is...

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:02.380
When I gave you your new names and 
welcomed you as comrades, I marked you...

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.780
as sacrifices for this forbidden spell.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.100
Forbidden spell?!

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.340
You can't be serious!

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.450
You just randomly gave me that name!
 I've never used it!

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.240
My name is Rades Spirito!

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.660
Master... Licht...

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.200
Were we not...

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.690
your precious comrades?!

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.790
Yes, you truly were precious.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.730
Then why...

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.300
Because...

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:45.300
You are sacrifices that will help 
bring back my true comrades.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.710
You bastard!

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.940
Yuno?

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:53.600
Petit Clover

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.270
Petit Clover!

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.100
Sally, the Strange Little 
Glasses Girl of the "Sa" Column

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.100
Sally, the Strange Little 
Glasses Girl of the "Sa" Column.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.680
Rii

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.890
Sa

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.830
Sally (Sarii).

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.070
Yay!

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.770
Rii

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.880
Butt (shiri).

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.900
Shi

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.540
Boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.360
Jeez, this is embarrassing.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.490
Rii

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.650
Su

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:08.850
Rub (suri).

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.360
I'm gonna rub up against you.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.490
Ri

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.700
Sero

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.120
Celery (serori).

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.300
Did you think we were going to say "serii"?

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.340
Well, that wouldn't make any sense, 
so we went with "celery."

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.620
Om, nom, nom...

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.750
Rii

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.920
So

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.490
Sled (sori).

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.050
This feels great!

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.850
This is the strange little 
glasses girl of the "sa" column, Sally!

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.400
How y'all doin'?

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.300
Let me dissect you guys while 
you're still alive sometime, okay?

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.330
Oh, of course, there won't be any anesthesia.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.020
Suddenly, Marx and Owen attack Yami.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.130
Despite all the confusion,
Yami incapacitates them.

 The Black Bulls Captain VS the Crimson Wild Rose

"The Black Bulls Captain

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.070
Every beautiful rose has its thorns.
