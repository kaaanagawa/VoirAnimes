WEBVTT

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.070
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.580
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.650
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.310
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.920
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.800
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.610
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.800
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.790
Lord Julius...

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.140
I told you that you're not allowed 
to go wandering off for a while.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.130
I'm surprised you knew I'd come through here.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.490
Do you realize how many 
years I have served you?

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.470
Now please return to the office and 
take care of that pile of documents.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.060
Oh, I'm done with the ones for today, though.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.100
What?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.740
Going through those is the best way 
to find out what's going on out here.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.730
But nothing beats coming out 
here and seeing it for myself,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.990
so I'm off to wander around.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.970
Please wait.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.740
I understand how you feel,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.030
but with the threats of the Spade Kingdom and the devil looming over us,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.740
if something were to happen...

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.750
True. I've lost most of my mana and magic, 
so there isn't much I can do right now.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.960
In that case, I have some 
favors to ask of you, Marx.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.020
First...

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.710
A Favor for Julius

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.880
Here I go, Asta!

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.720
Got it!

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.480
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Waterball.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.230
Come on! You can do better than that!

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.480
Noelle! Hit me with all you've got!

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.070
You don't have to go easy on me 
just because we're teammates!

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.960
Fine. Don't come crying to me later.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.580
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.520
I'd like you to get stronger and 
fight alongside us in six months.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.100
Not yet... This isn't nearly enough!

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.730
Aw, you stopped it.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.800
You're...

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.030
Sally

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.260
Sally?!

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.030
Heya, Asta! How have you been?

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.730
What are you doing here?

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.280
Wait, did you escape?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.950
Nah, the white mushroom head brought me.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.910
Who are you calling a white mushroom head?

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.930
Hey... You're the Wizard King's attendant and...

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.460
Uh, who are you?

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.670
Magic Item Research Lab Specially-Appointed Researcher 
Makusa North

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.930
I'm Makusa from the Magic Item Research Lab.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.110
Huh?

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.680
Creating magic items?

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.360
Yes! Lord Julius saw potential in 
Sally's knowledge of magical science

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.180
and asked her to create a new magic 
item to help with the upcoming battle.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.020
I was against this, but...

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.740
So, like, I need a bunch of data to make one,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.280
so I decided to experiment on you guys.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.990
Like we'd ever agree to that!

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.530
You may have turned over a new leaf,
 but who knows what you'll do?

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.780
You got it!

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.040
W-Wait, what are you talking about?!

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.280
Do you remember that I promised

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.540
you could do whatever you wanted with 
my body once the battle was over?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.050
Well, I'm glad you remember that, too, Asta.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.770
Just remember! Nothing that 
hurts super bad, okay?

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.180
Is that really the problem here, Stupidsta? 
What if she tries to dissect you?

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.340
D-Dissect? She couldn't possibly...

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.270
If so, we'll have to call off 
this experiment right away.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.650
Then let's get started!

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.560
Or so I'd like to say... but I think
 I'll save you for last, Asta.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.330
The thing I'm trying to make is supposed to 
increase one's mana, and you don't have any.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.750
Maybe I'll experiment on <i>you</i> first!

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.770
A-Again, I want no part of this.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.750
I'm royalty, and even if I wasn't, 
there's no way I'd agree to this!

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.510
By the way, where are the other Black Bulls?

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.690
Oh, they're all either out 
training or on missions.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.160
They ones out training should 
be back any time now.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.370
Gah.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.590
Hey, how long have you guys been there?

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.660
Right. I just remembered 
I need to do something.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.280
Restrain yourself, me...

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.890
Well, see ya!

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.670
Woohoo! So many test subjects!

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:01.770
Hey!

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.680
Stop at once!

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.120
You are not allowed to conduct any 
experiments without Makusa's or my supervision!

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.740
Hey, look! It's the Wizard King!

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.820
Huh?!

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.830
There!

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.570
Sally!

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.330
Asta, Noelle! Please don't worry 
about us! Just go after Sally!

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.590
Got it!

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.950
This is probably far enough.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.090
Like hell I'm gonna let that 
crazy chick experiment on me.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.410
L-Let go of me! I'll kill you!

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.070
Aw... But when the magic item's done,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.730
your magic's gonna get explosively stronger,
 so help me out, Funglasquent.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.070
Who the hell are you calling a mohawked 
virgin delinquent in glasses?!

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.790
Since you use flame magic, Glasquent...

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.570
Stop making it even shorter, damn it!

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.090
The dark magic item equation will be this...

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.490
And then the mana exponent 
will end up like that...

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.960
This is the experimental liquid I'll use!

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.960
Now I'll just use my Sticky Salamander 
instead of the magic item and...

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.980
Inject!

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.190
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What the hell?!

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.680
There's an insane amount of 
flame mana flowing out from me.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.350
I know, right? Amazing, isn't it?

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.600
Huh? H-Hey, hang on a sec! 
There's too much flowing out... I'm gonna...

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.200
e-explode...

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.510
Huh? Maybe the dark magic item 
equation is still incomplete.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.110
And maybe the experimental 
liquid's too potent.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.620
But I got some data, so on to the next one!

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.040
Don't worry! I won't dissect you!

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.530
Transformation Magic—

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.040
Hold it! Now's not a good time!

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.200
Huh? But why?

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.870
Wait, that's...

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.130
Marie?!

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.920
No one's laying a finger on my angel!

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.120
B-But that's not the real Marie!

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.620
And she's all sticky!

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.890
Even if she's all sticky, 
Marie is still Marie!

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.020
You guys use combo magic, so it might 
be fun to experiment on you both at once!

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.260
The two of us together?! How embarrassing!

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.270
Marie!

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.120
Y-You can't! You said you were 
going to restrain yourself!

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.490
But this is an insanely rare 
vintage I may never see again.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.540
Let's go, Vanessa. I'm telling you,
 this is definitely a trap.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.210
Experiment! Experiment!

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:34.010
A bewitching trail of noms. 
Could this be the path to heaven?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.390
Welcome!

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.310
Restrain yourself... Restrain yourself...

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.920
E-Explode...

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.690
Finral! Vanessa!

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.420
Are you guys okay?!

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.550
Huh? Did something happen?

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.200
Looks like we got here too late.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.660
We need to stop Sally, quick!

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.950
H-Heaven...

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:08.090
Hm... So far, none of these 
experiments are going as planned.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.520
I still need more data.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.670
Hold it, Sally!

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.870
Charmy, are you okay?

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.940
What's this? Asta, you're supposed to be last.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.100
What, you couldn't wait any longer?

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.260
Hngh!

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.490
I'll never go back on my word!

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.240
You can do whatever you want with my body, 
just stop messing with everyone else!

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.530
You're still going on about that, Stupidsta?!
 Maybe you won't just end up in a daze!

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.710
Yeah, but the only reason we 
made it to the royal capital is

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.250
because Sally and the others showed up.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.030
That's how we protected everyone!

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.370
So I'm going to keep my promise!

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.080
Good point. Keeping your promises is important!

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.130
Don't forget the anesthesia!

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.990
Oh, don't worry. This won't hurt one bit!

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.220
Here I come!

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.310
Asta!

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.910
All mine!

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.770
I'll have to culture it when I get back!

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.690
Wait. You just needed my hair?

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.770
Well, remember what you said, Asta?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.780
You said I could experiment all I wanted
 as long as I didn't harm anyone.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.460
Oh, yeah. You said I couldn't 
bother anyone, either.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.930
Don't worry. They'll all be back to normal soon.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.290
Their magic just got too powerful for 
a moment, so it sorta knocked them out.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.800
Sally! I guess you remembered 
our promise, too!

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.710
Aw, but Asta,

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.200
your hair's not going to be enough, 
so could I have some nail clippings, too?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.050
Of course!

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.680
Wh-Why are you touching him like that?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.790
Actually, that's not quite enough, either, 
so could I have some of your blood?

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.050
While we're at it, maybe your heart, 
your lungs, and your eyeballs?

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.690
You most certainly can't!

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.440
Anyway, just make sure this research 
will help everyone out, okay?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.500
Ugh... That was awful.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.410
Why, you little...

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.180
Go to hell!

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.840
Now, now, guys. You're all better now.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.180
As for the results of this experiment...

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.690
I can't understand a single thing here,
 but it sure is interesting!

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.670
Makusa will take this information back 
to the capital and inspect it carefully.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.850
The magic item will be created after that.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.400
Do your best making it, 
Sally and researcher guy!

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.650
Okay!

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.640
We will!

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.690
Well, we ended up being guinea pigs, 
so I'm hoping the data gets put to good use.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.900
Yeah!

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.750
Don't you dare slack off!

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.570
I'll kill you if you mess it up!

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.260
What are you waiting for, Finral? 
Use your spatial magic already.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.750
R-Right...

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.580
I do still have seniority here...

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.630
Let's go, Sally.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.080
Sure thing!

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.590
"I prefer doing research that helps people out."

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.550
Sally! See ya later!

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.090
That might actually be true now!

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.710
We're almost to Arandom Village.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.160
To think that the two of us 
would end up on a mission

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.700
together despite being in separate squads.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.240
This isn't a field trip.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.960
I will find anyone who threatens 
our kingdom and strike them down.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.610
What in the world happened in this village?

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.970
Lord Julius,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.760
I've brought the captains of the Crimson 
Lion Kings and the Silver Eagles.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.840
Thanks! Sorry to summon you 
both here when you're so busy.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.320
It's fine.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.340
What did you need, sir?

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.730
Have you two ever heard 
of a village called Arandom?

00:12:54.730 --> 00:13:01.070
Noble Realm

00:12:54.730 --> 00:13:02.480
Common Realm

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.410
A while back when I was wande—

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:02.480
Forsaken Realm

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.390
When I was investigating 
various parts of the kingdom,

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.960
it was a small village I visited 
in the Forsaken Realm.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.940
According to some reports, bandits have 
shown up around that village lately.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.990
Then we should send a team 
to deal with them at once.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.140
No, that probably won't be enough.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:19.000
I have a feeling there's something rather 
unfavorable going on in this kingdom.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.340
Unfavorable?

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.750
What could that be?

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.240
So I'd like you two to conceal your 
identities, interact with the villagers,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.260
and gather information on the bandits.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.760
This will be an undercover investigation.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.310
An undercover investigation?

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.060
We're just wandering around in disguise!

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.470
Um... About these disguises...

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.070
I think these will just draw 
attention in the Forsaken Realm.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.410
True, I can't deny that,

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.670
but since neither of us is 
familiar with how peasants live,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.790
our cover will be blown immediately.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.500
Though few, there are traveling mages who

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.200
were once royalty or nobility, 
but forsook their titles.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.960
Oh, I see. By the way, as for where 
we should gather information...

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.090
The village square should do.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:10.510
I agree. Lord Julius said to act casually 
around those who interact with us.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.100
Let us go blend in with the masses.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.340
Is that even possible?

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.950
Also, you probably don't need 
to be so serious about this.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.100
How do I explain that to them?

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.610
Forsaken Realm
Arandom Village

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.040
Th-This is...

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.820
We'd heard there were places that 
had yet to be restored, but...

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.250
To think it'd be this bad.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.190
This matter will need attention eventually,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.570
but our mission comes first.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.890
I'll go gather information over there.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.760
And I'll head over there.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.390
You there.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.110
Huh? I don't think I've seen 
you around here before.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.430
I'm a traveling mage named Leon.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.560
A-And I'm, um... Mark.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.690
Traveling mages?

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.740
We heard that there were bandits around here.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.440
I'd like you to tell us what 
you know to ensure our safety.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.950
No idea. Go bother someone else.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.730
As I thought. They're wary of
us because of our disguises.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.950
What shall we do, Fue... I mean, Leon?

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:27.380
Oh, yeah! If things get 
difficult, try saying this...

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.260
Chrono... vala.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.510
Chronovala?

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.300
D-Don't tell me you're...

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.650
You're friends of Chronovala's?

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.790
That old lady helped us out so much!

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.110
Whenever I didn't have enough customers, 
she'd help find me some.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.790
I made a fortune that day! 
But before I knew it, she disappeared.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.870
How's she doing, anyway?

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.440
Chronovala... Chrono...

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.790
Novachrono!

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:06.040
I get it! Chronovala must be the alias 
Lord Julius used when he wandered out here.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.650
So you know her!

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.710
That old lady was great.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.840
Here, take this!

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:18.010
Though my fields have been destroyed,
 so I don't have much.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.850
I couldn't take them for free.
 Will this be enough?

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.560
Th-This much?!

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.090
This is way too much, even if 
you bought everything here!

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.810
Then use the rest to help get 
this village back on its feet.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.570
Are you really sure about this?!

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.200
Wow...

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.900
Who are those guys?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.510
Apparently, they know Chronovala.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:46.610
Amazing, Lord Julius. People respect 
you so much, even as an old woman.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.850
But we've brought a lot of 
attention to ourselves when this

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.740
is supposed to be an undercover investigation.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.050
I hope Captain Nozel is faring better...

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:59.830
You know Chronovala? She saved my baby's life!

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:00.850
She did?

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:06.140
I went into labor out in the fields,
 and she called a doctor for me.

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.790
I know! Here, you can hold him!

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.480
I named him Vala.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.150
Wait, I—

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.710
I haven't held a baby since Noelle was born.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:21.790
Noze...

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.580
Noze?

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.720
Everyone here seems to know Ju—Chronovala.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.140
It appears so.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.800
I am the mayor of this village, Mayer.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.590
We can't offer much, but please 
stay the night in our village.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.730
Yeah, that's a great idea! Stay the night!

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.850
We can't make much, but we'll treat you!

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.600
What shall we do?

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.450
We have no reason to decline.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.270
Well, he did say to act casually 
with anyone we encountered.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.280
W-Well, if that's the case...

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.970
I guess we never got any 
information on the bandits.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.710
I wonder what the unfavorable 
thing going on here could be.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.000
What is it?

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.360
As I figured...

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.240
Looks like they're asleep.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.280
Let's go.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.270
So you're the bandits ravaging this area!

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.860
So what if we are? Give us all your money!

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.780
Or you're gonna get hurt.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.280
Get 'em!

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.750
Y-You're...

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.310
The villagers?

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.760
I was hoping that wasn't the case.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.600
This is the end.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.510
Mayor!

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:10.270
We knew this would happen, even though 
we were just trying to survive.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:15.360
After the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack,
 our village was left in shambles.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.450
But we never received aid 
from the royal capital

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.700
and were driven into even worse poverty.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.850
Still, stealing from others in order 
to try to restore our village

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.410
was far too selfish of us.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.990
I was the one who led my people to do this.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.600
Please, let it just be me who 
gets taken to the Magic Knights.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.680
What are you talking about?!

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.640
You were just looking out for us!

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.560
I had no idea they were this dismayed.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.890
If only we'd acted sooner, 
this never would've happened.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.030
We can't let the mayor take 
all the blame for this!

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.480
We're going down with you.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.120
N-No!

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.160
Y-You're...

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.270
Lord Fuegoleon and Lord Nozel!

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.750
M-M-M-Magic Knights captains?!

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.670
What?!

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.540
We can see that your village 
is in need of assistance.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.670
We can let this misconduct go.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.180
You're too soft, as usual. 
A crime is a crime.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.960
Do not let your emotions get in 
the way. They must be judged.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.460
And you're being far too cruel.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.950
You are hereby ordered to help restore 
all of the villages in this area.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.560
But a crime is still a crime.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.690
Atone for what you have done.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.700
D-Does that mean we're...

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.200
The royal capital has not forsaken you.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.940
But we may not have been 
aware of the entire situation.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.710
We are going to work even harder to restore 
this whole kingdom. Please have faith.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.710
Thank you very much!

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.290
Thus ends the report on everything 
that happened in that village.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.970
Great job. You made the right choice.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:15.230
We've sent squad members to the other 
villages to see what kind of aid they need.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.760
Yes. Our job is to protect this kingdom,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.530
as well as to make sure its 
citizens can live in peace.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:27.990
By having to face the truth, perhaps your 
view of this kingdom has changed a bit?

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.390
As I thought...

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.990
That's why he sent us.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.220
Nozel, Fuegoleon...

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.750
I want you to work even harder to lead 
the kingdom and the Magic Knights.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.750
As you wish!

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.000
Yup. I'm counting on you two.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.700
Now, then... I feel like 
wandering around a bit myself.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.570
Absolutely not.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.510
Aw...

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.400
Then maybe I'll talk to Yami...

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.520
Since there isn't much I can do right now.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:06.330
That may be true, but this kingdom 
still needs you very much.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:45.090
Yuno struggles with the Golden Dawn since 
they are made up of nobles and royals.
