00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.070
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.300
Holy crap! There's a castle 
floating in the sky!

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.690
That's the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's hideout.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.190
The Royal Knights, a team of 
individuals specially selected

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.570
to defeat the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 finally began their operation!

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.530
So that's where Licht is...

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.410
We will now split up into 
five groups and proceed.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.490
Group 1 will attack from the upper left.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.290
Yes, ma'am!

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.990
Group 2 will attack from the lower left.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.790
'Kay!

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.790
Yes, ma'am.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.170
Group 3 will attack from the upper right.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.000
Yes, ma'am.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.020
Group 4 will attack from the lower right.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.840
Yes, ma'am!

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.000
And we're going to attack front and center.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.800
Yes, ma'am!

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.620
All that matters is if you're weak or strong.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.930
You're here because you're strong,
 are you not?

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.370
The fools that Yami selected...

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.440
Don't let me down.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.870
Yes, ma'am!

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.900
Sure thing. Guess I'll 
be careful, Lady Captain.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.960
I'm sure you don't need detailed plans.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.830
Take down any enemies you encounter 
as you proceed toward the center.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.580
You may do that

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.160
however you prefer!

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.080
The Royal Knights infiltrated

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.250
the Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout, 
which was a floating dungeon

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.630
located in the strong magic 
region known as Gravito Stones,

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.630
and were headed toward its center.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.410
Their ultimate goal is to 
defeat the leader, Licht.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.380
H-Holy crap!

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.510
Wait, do we even need to be here?!

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.260
Meanwhile, back at the Black 
Bulls' hideout...

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.300
Well, I'm heading out for a bit.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.620
Where are you going, Captain?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.270
Apparently, Golden Weird Mask Guy 
wants to apologize for Langris's behavior.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.570
So I'm heading to the 
Golden Dawn's headquarters.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.930
Actually, why the hell do <i>I</i> have to go?

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.390
If he wants to apologize, 
he should come over here.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.270
Then can I go see Marie, too?

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.430
Of course not, you dumbass.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.850
What if we get an emergency mission?

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.650
Tch.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.660
I'm going to go visit Finral.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.140
How long is that boy going to stay asleep?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.660
I hope he wakes up soon.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.770
I'm gonna go train!

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.830
I'm gonna get even stronger!

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.560
You can do it! Don't even worry about 
not being picked for the Royal Knights,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.750
you virgin delinquent.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.580
Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you calling a virgin?! 
And I'm not worried!

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.090
I'm going to go find some delicious noms, la!

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.970
You should all look forward to it, la!

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.670
H-Have a safe trip!

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.010
Come back soon.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.600
It gets lonely when the whole gang isn't here.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.740
Well, see ya. Make sure you don't let any 
bandits take over the place or anything.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.990
Man... what a pain.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.820
Make sure you ask that quack 
doctor how Finral's doing.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.130
Of course. Sure thing!

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.500
Stronger... I'm gonna get stronger!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.760
Just wait, la... All of you delicious noms 
that have grown just to be eaten...

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.930
Me and my sheep cooks are coming for you, la!

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.050
The Black Bulls' Hideout

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.130
Fidget, fidget... Fidget, fidget...

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.490
What the hell?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.440
It's not like we're going to do anything,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.630
but both Grey and Gordon are sitting near me.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.090
Fidget, fidget...

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.790
It's probably because all 
the rowdy guys are gone,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.780
but this is somehow really distracting.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.550
Fidget, fidget, blush, blush...

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.940
It's nice spending time together, 
just the three of us.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.160
We have so much to talk about,
 and my heart is happy.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.760
I'm so excited.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.930
Hey!

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.370
Want to exchange secrets?

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.040
Though I already know all your secrets...

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.600
Heheh.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.360
If we get a summons for a mission, I'll go,
 so you two can rest in your own rooms.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.950
N-No! B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-But 
th-th-th-th-th-th-that's...

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.550
Oh, come on.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.410
If we get a mission, 
of course I'm going with you.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.790
What the hell are they even saying?!

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.060
Just go get some rest already.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.710
I'm telling you that I'll go so I can get some 
more money to get presents for Marie.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.710
You don't need to hold back.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.140
It's so embarrassing, not using 
my transformation magic

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.810
and talking in my normal form.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.810
I wanted to form deeper bonds with 
everyone at the Underwater Temple, too.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.870
But the others consider me a part of the team!

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.320
So I should try to stay 
myself in front of them!

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.450
I didn't get to create deeper bonds with 
everyone at the Star Festival, either.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.820
Gauche even complimented me on how I look!

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.100
So I'm going to deepen my bonds 
with the two of you today.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.350
As deep as I possibly can get them.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.370
I'm going to my room

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.550
so I can concentrate on making 
this doll of my goddess.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.550
Let me know if we get a mission.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.310
It's so embarrassing for you 
two to see me like this,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.790
but it's even more embarrassing 
to be left alone together

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.780
and have him stare at me! I just can't!

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.740
Then I'll go to your room, too.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.080
I don't care if it's messy.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.100
We went to the library together, after all!

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.320
What the hell is wrong with these two?!

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.830
I need to be more confident 
and speak to him myself!

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.200
G-G-G-G-G-Gauche, wh-wh-wh-wh-what...

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.590
What's that you're making?

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.700
Oh, this?

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.960
The other day, when I became a nerd, 
I realized how awesome figures are.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.010
So I'm making a 1/8th scale Marie!

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.250
M-Marie?

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.030
When I'm finished, I'll let you worship her.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.950
I-I see?

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.820
I already knew

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.740
that Gauche had an interest in dolls.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.700
The day that I can show you 
my collection has come at last.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.610
Peeksies...

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.720
My handmade Black Bulls dolls.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.840
They look just like everyone, don't they?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.010
V-V-V-Voodoo dolls?!

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.000
So cute.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm so scared!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.440
Seriously, you're terrifying.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:46.810
Huh?!

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.940
I probably shouldn't be the one to say this,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.150
but if you want to get 
along with everyone else,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.550
you need to make an effort to be friendlier.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.010
Starting with your face.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.070
M-My face?!

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.910
Try smiling.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:59.660
Smiling?

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.530
Go on.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.130
Ba-dump, ba-dump...

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.430
That's terrifying!

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.440
D'oh...

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.090
D'oh... D'oh...

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.740
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.690
Don't touch her.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.370
I-I won't!

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.250
Where's the bathroom today?

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.140
Today, it's on the second 
floor on the far right.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.990
I guess I should've asked this sooner,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.130
but why do parts of this hideout 
keep changing randomly?

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:31.940
Who knows?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.150
It's been like this ever since I joined.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.090
Talk about a pain.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.390
I'm sure it's some kind of magic, 
but what the hell is the point?

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.650
P-P-P-P-P-P-Please come 
back as soon as possible!

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.640
I heard Charmy and Vanessa 
talk about it before, but...

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:52.020
I-I saw it, la! It was kind of floaty!

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.660
It wasn't one of my sheep cooks! It was 
something even more mysterious, la!

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.970
I swear I wasn't seeing things!

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.370
It was really there! It was a ghost.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.660
I'm telling the truth.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.550
What if it wasn't magic, 
but was actually a ghost?

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.860
Please don't make weird jokes like tha—

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.540
What the hell are these things?!

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.740
P-Please don't look at me!

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.580
This is no time to be embarrassed!

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.540
Hurry up and transform, damn it!

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.810
So many of you came here 
to be friends with me...

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.420
The hell they did!

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.420
I don't know what these guys are, 
but this is obviously an enemy attack!

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.470
Hurry up and get ready to fi—

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.090
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.600
So this is Asta's hideout.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:16.630
The Eye of the Midnight Sun

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:16.630
Sally

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:16.630
Rades

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.370
Sadly, Asta's not here today, though.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.010
I was hoping to dissect him while 
he's still alive. What a shame.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.340
Sally, Asta's not your toy.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.620
He's <i>my</i> toy. And after I came all 
this way to play with him, too...

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.640
Eye of the Midnight Sun
Valtos

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.290
Sally, Rades... Don't forget our objective.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.730
But I'm sure I can get some other decent toys

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.970
while I'm at the Black Bulls' hideout.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.890
I wanna conduct experiments! Dissections!

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.640
Modifications! Operations!

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.990
Wow!

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:03.490
I don't know who the hell is dumb 
enough to attack our hideout...

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.250
But now you're gonna pay!

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.670
There you are, you useless Magic Knights.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.550
You bastards...

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.780
You know them, Gauche?

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.660
Do I know them?

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.350
They're from that dirtbag terrorist 
group, the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.370
The Eye of...

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.230
So what the hell do you want?

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.240
Did you come to get your asses kicked again?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.490
Since you're pulling the strings on those 
zombies, I'm assuming you're Rades.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.550
You assumed correctly.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.450
We happen to be looking for something.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.380
You're looking for something?

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.720
What could you possibly want 
from our broken-down hideout?

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.620
I'm sure you guys wouldn't know about it, 
but you've got something really good.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.110
If you're looking for friendship, it's right here.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.380
They're not!

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:05.420
And as long as we're here looking for that, 
we figured we'd also destroy your hideout.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.890
Oh? Then you can die!

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.520
Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray!

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.100
Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.230
Whee!

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.570
That's right... My magic 
doesn't work on that woman.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.570
Tch.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.450
Come on, relax.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.540
Gauche, was it? I have no 
interest in you, anyway.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.330
We've been told to not kill you, so...

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.330
Huh?

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.730
What are you talking about?

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.830
Who knows? I'm not really sure, 
but Master Licht insisted.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.260
The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun?

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.090
Actually, before...

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.840
I couldn't...

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.090
risk hurting you...

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.510
What are you talking about?

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.230
What? You know him? 
Sorry I beat the crap out of him.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.310
Of course I don't know this bastard.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.190
You'll understand eventually...

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.310
I guess he did say that...

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.570
So, let's play.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.820
Are you ready, Black Bulls losers?

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.280
Now's not the time to think about that.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.830
For now, I've gotta do something 
about these bastards.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.800
The captain and the others probably 
won't be back for a while,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.490
so the three of us will take care of them!

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.580
There ya go.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.840
Dark Magic Item: 
Special Properties Plus Alpha Reinforcement!

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.110
All right! Let's go!

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.270
The Eye of the Midnight Sun... The really 
bad people who hurt my friends...

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.740
Stay away from our hideout.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.690
Poison Curse Magic: Aufwachen Dachs.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.460
Since we're dealing with the dead, 
I don't have to hold back with my magic.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.630
Damn, man.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.880
Oho... That's some impressive poison.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.880
But if we're playing with poison...

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.510
I'll just neutralize it with my gel!

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.020
G-Gauche!

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.270
I learned a new spell!

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:31.060
T-Transformation Magic: Magic Conversion!

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.910
She turned my gel magic...

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.530
...into crystal magic?

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.610
N-Now, Gauche!

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.290
Right! Now I can actually crack it!

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.900
Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.420
Oho!

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.900
Ooh, you can change the properties of 
magic itself. That's pretty interesting!

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.810
I think I'm a little interested in you now!

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.940
P-P-P-Please don't look at me!

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.330
That's the way. This'll make 
crushing you guys even more fun.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.260
Valtos!

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.320
Right.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.490
You're up, Number Zero...

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.300
Mikael Caesar.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.330
What the hell is that creepy thing?

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.830
Do it.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.890
It used two different 
magic attributes at once?

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.510
And why the hell is it so powerful?

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.070
Making this guy was a pain in the ass, you know.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.330
He was only completed because I helped 
you with some dark magic items.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.010
You'd better be grateful.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.580
That thing's made from two different corpses.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.530
Both of those corpses used to be 
Magic Knights Squad captains!

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.730
You'll never be able to 
defeat my perfect corpses

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.680
with your stupid little tricks!

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:31.570
Hurry up and destroy this stupid 
Magic Knights Squad hideout!

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:34.690
Let's go.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.500
Stop it...

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:53.010
Since I was born into a family that dealt with 
curses, I wasn't allowed to make friends.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.130
So I ended up unable to speak to people, 
and had this hideous poison magic.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.970
I was shunned by everyone around me.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.430
Stop it...

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.030
Because I was unable to be self-confident
and couldn't reveal my true self,

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.980
people didn't trust me and 
were creeped out by me.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.410
I was all alone.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.700
But even then...

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.950
But even then...

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.340
You're hilarious! Come join my squad!

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.500
A bull! That's friggin' awesome!

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.500
I-I'm awesome?

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.900
I'm happy that you're all having fun.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:46.570
You'll be even happier after 
eating a lot of delicious noms, la!

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.110
Maybe he'll be able to speak louder someday.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.530
It's delicious.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.700
This cooking made with love is filling 
not only my stomach, but my heart, too.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.660
Happy birthday, la!

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.590
Come on, let's drink!

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.510
Th-Thank you very much!

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.050
He's fast asleep.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.040
This one's Asta and this one's Grey?

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.610
Wait, maybe the other way around?

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.000
Either way, your muscles are creepy.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.730
This place...

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.200
This place...

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.760
...accepted me for who I am!

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.700
What the hell are we supposed 
to do with this freak?!

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.770
Don't give up, Gauche.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:38.990
We're going to protect our hideout!

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.490
For crying out loud... I guess
you <i>can</i> speak loud and clear!

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.750
Damn it...

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.870
Now I have things I want to protect

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.250
besides Marie!

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.080
And once the captain gets back,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.680
who knows what he'll do to us if 
we couldn't protect the hideout?

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.010
Wow, they can still stand.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.170
But I think it's about time 
I dissected you guys.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.190
Having a lot of spirit isn't gonna help you.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.570
It doesn't change the fact 
that you guys can't win.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.450
Now, I'm gonna finish you off!

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.290
Make sure you don't kill them, though.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.860
I'm gonna dissect them 
while they're still alive.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.930
Don't hold your breath on that one.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.080
Go, Mikael Caesar!

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.740
Emergency! Emergency!

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.840
What the?

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.650
It's floating?

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.100
What's going on?

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:56.100
Emergency! Emergency!

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:21.090
What's... going... on... here?

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.560
Petit Clover

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.510
Petit Clover!

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.060
Gordon and 
Grey's Comedy Routine

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.340
Gordon and Grey's Comedy Routine.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.060
G-G-G-Gordon and Grey's Comedy Routine!

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.320
Bulls

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.320
Hello, we're Gordon and Grey.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.450
Please don't look at me!

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.930
Don't listen to my voice, either!
 Cover your ears!

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.200
But then we can't do our comedy routine.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.140
W-Well, I can't tell what 
you're saying anyway,

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.070
so how can we even do a comedy routine?

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.690
Well, you got me there. Hahaha.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.660
Th-That's all from us!

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:38.350
Bulls

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.140
You two need to apologize 
to every comedian out there!

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.480
What? What the hell is going on?

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.500
I don't know who you are, 
but speak faster, damn it!

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.610
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>,

 Crazy Magic Battle

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.820
My little sister, the goddess Marie...

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.030
I'm gonna hurry up and end this 
battle so I can come see you!
