00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.940
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.350
Vetto realized his true powers,
and they were unbelievably immense.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
Asta used the last of his 
strength and faced him.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.110
Not giving up is my only weapon!

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.880
And I'm never going to give 
up until I fulfill my wish!

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.510
No matter what!

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.340
His teammates were moved 
by his words and actions!

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.000
You didn't give up, and that's why I'm here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.660
My juniors are working hard.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.040
That means I have to
act like a proper senior.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.010
I swear that we won't let you die!

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.350
Let's go!

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.480
The power of the spatial magic and
your aura are gushing all over the place!

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.190
What?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.570
The thread changed his trajectory...

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.860
I'm going to defeat you...

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.810
with this weapon!

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.650
Despair vs. Hope

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.810
That was actually effective!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.260
Now you've done it, human!

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.760
Thanks!

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.270
T-Talk about scary! If we were even a second 
too late, we would've been done for!

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.610
Good work, little boy! Keep it up!

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.480
No, wait! I didn't even do anything!

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.110
It's all thanks to you two!

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.160
Amazing... These two are this powerful?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.030
As I thought, I cannot heal.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.660
Did he sever the magic current 
that enables self-healing?

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.060
The one weapon here that has a chance 
of defeating me... that anti-magic sword.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.350
If I only had to deal with that unskilled 
brat, there would be no issue,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.230
but those two are supporting him
and giving him mobility.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.570
The spatial magic is troublesome, 
but the real nuisance

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.070
is that woman's thread magic!

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.510
Her magic runs through this whole space,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.450
interfering whenever and 
wherever she wants.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.470
It cannot attack or bind me personally,

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.170
I can barely see it, and it's too 
thin for me to detect its magic.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.340
That means I won't be able 
to read that brat's moves!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.980
How amusing.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.010
To think that three people 
who are worthless alone

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.320
could fight me by banding together...

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.850
It makes me sick.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.660
Don't think that you have hope just 
because you've banded together, humans!

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.740
He's coming!

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.540
Let's go!

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.660
Got it!

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.210
Finral!

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.500
Got it!

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.070
Not yet, damn it!

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.350
He did it!

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.850
No! That wound's too shallow!

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.850
We won't be able to defeat him 
just by scratching him like that!

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.360
This'll make things even 
more dangerous, but...

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.730
We need to let the kid get even closer!

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.090
I'm all for getting closer! Bring it on!

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.130
I'm not imagining it!

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.030
What the hell is this ridiculously 
huge and creepy magical power?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.720
This is even more ridiculous than the 
ridiculous magical power I felt earlier!

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.900
We could say that it's now super ridiculous!

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.110
Shut up! Stop saying stupid crap!

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.720
P-Please don't look at me!

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.310
More importantly, have your 
powers recovered at all?

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.290
U-Um, not at all yet.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.800
I used all my powers against 
that steel ball lardbutt.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.470
I can't shoot even a single Reflect Ray now.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.240
At this point...

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.760
Hey, domehead! You're going 
to have to go ahead, and...

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.300
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.700
Are you seriously still 
eating at a time like this?

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.500
La!

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.920
My spell from earlier to 
summon the Sleeping Sheep

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.420
One Hit

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.500
eats up my magic, so I'm left starving.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.880
Two Hit

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.500
Mega Hit

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.820
We can't fight on such empty stomachs!

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.510
We all need to eat and recover 
as much magic as possible!

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.590
Well, I guess you have a point.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.010
We should also eat and recover some magic.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.270
O-Okay!

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.200
Take that!

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.480
The Magic Knights haven't lost yet!

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.690
You can do it!

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.700
They're up against a crazy monster, 
but they still might have a chance!

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.010
That's it! Keep it up!

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.350
Offense is the best defense!

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.010
Don't give him time to counterattack!

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.760
How dare you leave my son and 
grandchildren in so much pain?!

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.750
Please get revenge! Beat him to a pulp!

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.700
Not bad...

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.150
Those guys never work together, 
but now, by working together,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.730
they've surpassed their limits.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.020
However...

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.360
It happened again. He held his 
ground against their attack.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.370
Could that bastard be...

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.040
I can't let my guard down even for a second.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.420
How long am I supposed to keep 
up with this tense situation?

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.010
Barely missed!

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.720
Get a grip! This is no time for whining!

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.250
Asta is holding his own against that monster!

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.020
Compared to that, this pressure's nothing!

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.750
Finral! Do you still have some magic left?

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:29.020
I-It's going down at an enormous rate,
but I'm still managing!

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.170
I mean, I spent all this time 
running away and not fighting,

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.950
so it works out in the end.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.440
So it doesn't mean that our movements 
have gotten any slower...

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.240
Huh?

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.700
This isn't good.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.900
His timing is starting to match our attacks!

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.540
I guess it's about time...

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.220
Asta!

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.980
This is nothing.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.860
One of his attacks just happened to graze me!

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.250
Let's do it again!

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.810
Hold it, kid!

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.510
Captain Yami?!

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.830
You should be the first one to know that

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.480
he didn't just happen to graze you,
since you're the one fighting him up close.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.110
That bastard was purposely 
not attacking as much

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.410
and defending instead to better 
understand all of your habits.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.870
Wh-What?

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.300
If you barge in unprepared...

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.140
He's definitely going to get you next time.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.640
If you barge in unprepared...

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.850
He's definitely going to get you next time.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.520
N-No...

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.960
As expected from the Black Swordsman.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.660
That's why I'm saving you for my main dish.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.000
But what difference does 
knowing that fact make?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.410
This situation is still filled with despair.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:11.210
Insects, this next attack will be your last!

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.630
You don't get to decide that,
you hairy gorilla!

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.630
You, too, Captain!
We won't know until we try!

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.510
I know, damn it! Because I'm a 
bazillion times stronger than you!

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.270
Then stop watching and come help us!

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.360
Really? You're going to say that?

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.270
The thing that's bugging me the most?!

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:39.860
When I'm barely able to keep my blood 
from boiling in this dumbass situation...

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.360
Hey, kid! You need to calm down, too.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.870
I didn't say you couldn't attack him.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.800
I'm just saying you can't keep doing 
the same thing. He's going to kill you...

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.880
Unless you guys change!

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.590
Finral!

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.380
Vanessa!

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.470
Kid!

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.270
Yes, sir!

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.180
You know exactly what to do

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.260
in situations like this!

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.690
Right here, right now...

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.930
We're going to surpass 
our limits even more!

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.190
We're surpassing our limits 
and speeding things up!

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.190
Got it!

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.400
Asta!

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.910
A draw?

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.040
Not yet!

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.920
Let's keep on surpassing our limits!

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.960
Got it!

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.030
Of course!

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.710
Take that!

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:47.530
Little boy... when I see you fighting 
with your little body and no magic,

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.680
it gives me a courage
that's frankly unlike me.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.930
I had forgotten. I didn't 
want to remember...

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.810
how weak I was back in 
the Forest of Witches.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:05.260
Hey, did you know that beyond 
this forest is a huge city,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.530
and a lot of people who live 
there aren't even witches?

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.580
Vanessa, you've told me 
that hundreds of times.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.500
All the other witches are out playing, 
aren't they? Getting boyfriends and stuff.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.050
Why don't you also escape 
from this cage and go out?

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.800
What? I-I could never do that!

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.350
I can't defy the Queen of Witches.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.450
C-Come on, cheer up.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.050
Do you want me to talk to the 
Queen of Witches for you?

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:42.110
That's impossible! You're all 
dolls I created with my magic.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.740
If I can't do it, there's no
way you could do it.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:52.080
You're right. Besides, this whole 
conversation is just you talking to yourself.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.500
Hopefully you'll be able to make 
some real friends someday.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.560
That's impossible... How could I?

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.860
I'm always going to be stuck here.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.710
I'll never be free.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.850
That was my fate.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.420
I thought I didn't have a choice.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.800
But...

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:31.700
One day I realized that this
wasn't fate. I just lacked courage.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:41.580
I wasn't wrong for choosing to leave the 
Forest of Witches and become a Black Bull.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.370
Only you have the power to 
move the threads of fate!

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.760
Little boy, I'll pull! Just trust me and go!

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.470
I'm counting on you, ma'am!

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.570
Curse you insects!

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.090
Come on, you two! You're going way too fast!

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.130
I swear... this is the problem 
with hot-blooded people!

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.870
I've always been the guy with no motivation!

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.990
Finral...

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.920
What is that fragile and 
stunted spatial magic?

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.730
We of the House of Vaude are a family 
of attack spatial magic users that

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.840
have been Magic Knights for generations.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.930
You can't fight with magic like that.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:37.100
But I don't want to be violent or 
have people be violent toward me.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.190
You weakling!

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.000
Goodness! Look at how much 
you managed to shave off!

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.870
You're so amazing, Langris! A genius!

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.590
We'll just have someone 
rebuild what he destroyed.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.080
You don't have to worry 
about a thing, Langris.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.690
Honestly... Aren't you ashamed to 
be outdone by your younger brother?

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.060
To think that the difference in 
your abilities was this great.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:22.400
Langris is now the vice 
captain of the Golden Dawn.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.710
And yet you're...

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.950
...the pack mule for the
weakest squad, the Black Bulls.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.110
We're appointing Langris as the 
next head of the House of Vaude.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.040
I doubt you have any objections.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.910
Of course I don't. I was just thinking that'd 
be too much for me to handle myself.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.210
Langris, take care of our family for me.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.220
I don't take orders from you, Finral.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.010
You bring shame upon the Vaude family!

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.660
You've got a point... but I'm 
pretty popular with the ladies.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:02.560
I ran away from my parents,
my brother, my home, and reality.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.810
Hey there, cuties!

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.320
Let's go have some tea. There's a 
fancy café just around the corner.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.550
You girls are so cute,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.830
you're going to make me say things 
even sweeter than those sweets there.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:25.120
In the midst of that, Asta, I met you,
a kid with absolutely no magic.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.750
It's not that you didn't have enough...

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:33.550
You had nothing, but you faced yourself,
kept fighting, and never gave up.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.150
It's true that how I am now,
I'll never beat my brother.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.310
But...

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.140
Say, Yami.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:48.260
Why did you let me join your squad?
I can barely even fight.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.500
So you can take me everywhere.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.320
Huh?

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.780
Oh, right... It's not like I can 
defeat any enemies with my magic.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.640
You've probably got your own 
way of fighting, right?

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.650
Huh?

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.880
I'm saying that battling doesn't 
just mean defeating enemies.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.080
My own way of fighting...

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.770
I'm not going to become the strongest.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.060
But I'll make the Black Bulls
the strongest squad!

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.320
I had abandoned my own fight.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.740
When I did, there were words 
I couldn't say anymore.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.110
But now, I can say them!

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.900
Asta! Believe in me!

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.120
Trust me and jump in!

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.870
Sorry, but I already believe 
in you 100 percent!

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.960
Not bad for insects!

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.310
But you must be nearing your limits.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.950
If even one of you makes the 
smallest mistake, you'll die instantly!

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.640
How long can you hold up under 
such extreme conditions?

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.690
Shut up, beast guy! 
Until we beat you, of course!

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.890
Asta just told me that he 
believes in me 100 percent.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.580
I knew that! Otherwise, he could never 
fight using this ridiculous method!

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.840
Honestly, how can you trust a drunk woman

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.410
and a superficial wimp with your life?

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.540
If you believe in us so earnestly...

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.050
...we can never betray that trust!

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.930
I see. That's some 
magnificent concentration.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.800
But how about your magic powers?

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.310
They'll probably reach their limits soon.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.380
The amount of magic we have...

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:54.070
That's the difference between 
myself and you insects!

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.630
H-He sure knows how to hit where it hurts.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.610
My spatial holes are becoming smaller.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.490
My threads are screaming.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.120
I'm almost out of magic, and the 
threads are about to break.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.370
So what?!

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.880
I'm going to believe in them both and win!

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.880
It's not just them.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.660
Guess we got here in time.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.490
La!

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.300
Gauche! Charmy!

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.140
And...

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:37.110
Grey. It sounds like some terrible joke, 
but apparently, this is her true form.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.640
What?!

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.990
P-Please don't look at me!

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.240
We can talk later.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.810
Take this! This is all the 
magic I have right now!

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.870
Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.250
What's the matter, insects?

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.160
You think you'll actually hit me 
just by attacking more?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.200
Nah, I accomplished what I wanted.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.130
Domehead!

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.800
Cotton Creation Magic:

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.310
Sleeping Sheep's...

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.060
One Hit!

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.060
One Hit

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.810
Two Hit!

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.810
Two Hit

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.090
Mega Hit!

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:15.440
Mega Hit!!

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.190
You're trying to make 
some kind of smokescreen?

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.070
Annoying little brats!

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.910
What?

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.330
Wh-What's going on?

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.590
I-It's my transformation magic!

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.590
I don't have much magic left, so some 
may not look exactly like him...

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.220
Bring it on!

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.030
Domehead! Keep hitting 
until you run out of magic!

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.220
Lai-lai, sir!

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:57.940
You pesky insects! Despair already!

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.600
Despair?

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.990
We don't have time for that!

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.330
Petit Clover

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.250
Petit Clover!

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.840
Trinity

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.330
Trinity.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.940
Listen carefully. I'm going to use 
my thread to change your direction!

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.350
Then, I'll use my spatial magic 
to move you somewhere else!

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.100
But if we miss even once, you'll be finished!

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.980
Are you ready?

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.600
Yeah! All we can do is charge!

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.850
Here we go, Gordon!

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.320
Green light!

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.730
I believe in you two!

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.330
We can never betray that trust!

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.680
Green light... Red light.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.540
What?!

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:28.210
I can't tell when Gordon's done saying, 
"Green light, red light," at all.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.090
I'm so sorry, Asta.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.220
He's just too strong.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.160
This is so much fun. You're it next, Asta.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.370
I'll make sure I get to you.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.310
Oh, no. I sense that my 
friends are in trouble.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.730
I want to help you all. Please stay safe.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.150
I hope my feelings reach you all.

 Beyond Limits

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.740
My magic is becoming friends with anyone.
