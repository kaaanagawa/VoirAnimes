00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.640
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.860
Thank you all for gathering here today.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.100
Now, let us begin the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.280
The Royal Knights Selection Exam was 
about to be conducted in preparation

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.480
for fighting the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.860
Then a mysterious man suddenly 
appeared at the exam.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.860
Xerx Lügner

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.860
Mimosa Vermillion

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.570
Oh, my bad! I'm a little late!

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.390
I'm Xerx Lügner. It's a pleasure.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:08.370
Asta ended up on a team with this unknown 
man, Xerx, for the exam tournament.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.840
And thus, the Royal Knights Selection Exam 
began amidst an ominous atmosphere.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.930
All right, we're about to begin round one.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.230
All right. Are both teams ready?

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.820
I'm getting hyped!

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.060
Flower of Resolution

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.690
Asta! Kick some ass!

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.500
Show them what the Black Bulls are made of!

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.190
P-Please do your best!

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.010
Hurry up and finish them 
off so you can fight me!

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.190
Don't try too hard!

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.020
Don't worry. I know you can win before 
I even have a chance to blink.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.620
I wonder what kind of magic 
we'll see. I can't wait!

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.010
La! Have a snack while you watch the event, la.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.030
Thanks!

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.300
I'm so hyped!

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:51.240
B Team
Mimosa Vermillion   Asta   Xerx Lügner

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.540
Let's do this!

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.520
What are you so excited about? 
This is an exam.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.240
Take this seriously, you dumbass.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.880
We should be scouting the area and 
thinking up strategies, you dumb shit.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.540
How dare you say something so right?!

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.380
Everything I say is right, you shitty little shrimp.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.700
Now, now, calm down, you two.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.890
Asta's so cute, even when he's frustrated.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.280
As Xerx mentioned, we should learn each 
other's abilities and figure out a strategy.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.020
I'm sure the enemy team 
will be doing that, as well.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.850
Yeah! You're right, Mimosa!

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.820
I specialize in healing 
and support plant magic.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.660
Asta shines best in close-range combat 
with his magic-nullifying anti-magic.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.500
What kind of magic do you use, Xerx?

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.140
Wh-What?!

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.130
The enemy team is attacking?

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.380
This early? Where did it come from?

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.560
First of all, we need to guard the crystal.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.260
Again?!

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.350
It looks like a long-distance attack... 
And yet they're hitting it perfectly.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.300
How are they...

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.610
Move three meters toward 10 o' clock.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.500
A Team
The Coral Peacocks 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Rick Cornell

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.750
Got it.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.070
With my Crystal Magic: Crystal Scope,

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.150
I can tell exactly where you're moving.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.870
A Team
The Crimson Lion Kings 4th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Forti Griss

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.870
How dare you insult the Wizard King, you cur?!

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.120
A Team
The Silver Eagles 3rd Class Senior Magic Knight 
Curtis Wolne

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.120
We refuse to give you a chance to shine!

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.700
Flame Magic: Burst Javelin!

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.130
Rock Magic: Strong Bow!

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.480
Crap! This is gonna be over in an instant!

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.800
We need to work together and—

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.850
Seriously, what's wrong with you?!

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.900
Hurgh!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.540
Uh, is he asleep?

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.510
He's totally asleep.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.530
He's asleep.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.570
He sure is.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.460
Yup.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.660
Being seen sleeping by so many people...

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.990
I'm embarrassed just thinking about it!

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.220
Oh, dear. Looks like we 
have some sleepyheads.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.890
Are you two not getting enough sleep? Or...

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.580
Is this your strategy?

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.580
Why the hell are you sleeping?! Wake up!

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.310
We're going to lose at this rate!

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.860
What happened to all those 
reasonable points you made?!

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.840
Don't you want to win?!

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.510
I don't really care if I lose.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.510
You jerk!

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.290
I don't know how much you 
want to win, nor do I care.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.020
Get off my back.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.910
I was up all night. I'm tired.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.180
And you can't work on no sleep, 
so sleep comes first right now.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.630
That Xerx guy is asleep!

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.870
Maybe it's some kind of strategy.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.200
No... My Crystal Scope can also 
determine someone's physical condition.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.750
He's actually sleeping!

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.280
First, he's rude to the Wizard King, 
and now he's being this irresponsible?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.010
Unforgivable.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.460
No matter what he might have up his sleeve,
 they cannot win without moving!

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.530
Let us end this here and now!

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.380
Plant Creation Magic: Magic Flower Guidepost!

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.390
Two of our enemies are near their crystal.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.820
The other is about 60 meters 
ahead of them, up in a tree.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.450
The two in back are building up mana.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.040
I think they're going to cast a combo spell!

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.780
But from so far away?

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.610
They're going to attack.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.410
Got it!

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.870
That was a super fast attack,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.290
but as long as I can get a rough idea
 of the direction and timing...

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.130
I can cut through it!

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.120
All right!

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.430
That was so fast that I wouldn't 
have been able to dodge it.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.510
Well done, Asta!

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.230
Losing a team member is a handicap,
but we won't be able to win at this rate.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.480
Let's leave Mr. Useless behind and 
figure something out ourselves, Asta.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:52.880
I'll pinpoint the enemy's position and hold 
them down while you protect the crystal.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.000
Then the two of us can close in on their 
crystal and try to destroy it directly.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.330
This is our only choice.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.830
Mimosa thought of that so quick!

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.330
She must've survived all kinds of battles, too.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.900
All right, let's do that!

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.520
This is our first joint 
operation together, isn't it?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.810
Our first?

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.930
Y-Yes!

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.180
Here we go!

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.280
Incoming!

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.060
Hey, they're actually trying to 
charge in with just the two of them.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.840
He's pretty good, though.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.490
Isn't the other member of B Team asleep? 
Is he trying to lower his opponents' guard?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.320
Depending on his abilities, I guess 
this could be a way of fighting, too.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.930
Hey, is this actually interesting?

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.850
Going on a date with me would've 
been way more fun, Yuno.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.860
Hey, why do you look so uninterested?

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.970
I'll just have to make you smile myself!

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.830
Take that!

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.880
Those two are doing 
surprisingly well out there.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.680
N-Not that I care or anything!

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.350
Do your best out there, Mimosa and Asta.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.730
What's with that guy?

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.690
He's blocking those combo spells so easily 
and charging at us with their crystal in tow.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.690
They're heading right for our crystal.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.290
Apparently one of them can 
detect positions, too.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.680
They've almost reached midrange—

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.200
I see them!

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.200
Two enemies and their crystal!

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.600
They're here!

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.930
Stay calm.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.350
Our crystal is unharmed, but their 
crystal is already falling apart.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.540
Plant Magic...

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.460
Rock Magic...

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.350
Magic Cannon Flower!

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.170
Rock Fortress!

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.140
Whoa, Mimosa!

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.050
When'd you learn such an 
awesome attack spell?!

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:49.070
Asta... The next time we meet, I'll be 
strong enough to fight alongside you!

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.770
I'll take the lead.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.780
We'll rally here!

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.680
I'll take the lead.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.910
We'll rally here!

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.830
You're so damn reliable, Mimosa!

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.970
We've only just begun!

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.340
Magic Cannon Flower!

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.020
Not bad!

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.740
She's not just cute. She's strong, too.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.490
That gap is irresistible! 
I wish she'd come my way!

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.150
That's awesome!

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.510
I wanna fight her, too!

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:41.160
She's grown as a woman. Maybe it's 
because she's on the same team as Asta.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.820
To think that she can fight so boldly 
in front of all those people!

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.620
Asta, you have such a good teammate.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.620
Amazing!

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.810
Mimosa's amazing.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.820
I'd been admiring your growth 
as I was working out,

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.950
but I had no idea you'd progressed so far!

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.130
I am honored to be your senior, Mimosa.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.970
Mimosa's working hard.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.320
That means I need to work even harder.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.850
I can't lose.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.330
Good job, Mimosa.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.460
You smiled? You just smiled a little, didn't you?

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.080
Woohoo! I win!

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.360
I wasn't smiling. You just imagined it.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.270
Ugh, you're so stubborn!

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.560
But... That's also one of 
the reasons I like you.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.360
Hmph.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.040
She looks like she'll mature 
even more in the future.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.990
Asta! You can do it, la!

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.130
I'll give you nummies when you win!

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.660
There are two of them. 
Shall we move closer and surround them?

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:46.430
No. The little gray-haired 
boy has an anti-magic sword.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.360
I've seen him use it before.
It's invincible in close combat.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.420
Anti-magic?

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.020
I've heard rumors about it, 
but to think a little boy like him...

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.240
It's probably dangerous to get too close.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.220
In that case...

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.410
They split up?!

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.910
Which one has the crystal?

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.910
Magic Flower Guidepost!

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.130
This response...

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.350
It's the left!

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.790
Got it!

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.920
Anti-magic child!

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.180
Behold my ultimate spell!

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.020
What an intense concentration of magic!

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.200
A powerful attack spell is incoming!

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.020
I'll cut that, and then the crystal!

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.710
This is...

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.690
There are two similar responses.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.610
The other two have powerful 
midrange attack spells!

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.610
This position... We're surrounded!

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.240
If any of those attacks hit 
the crystal, we're finished!

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.020
This isn't good!

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.540
If they attack simultaneously, even Asta 
won't be able to hold them both back!

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.040
Asta!

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.880
Asta!

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.970
Asta!

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.650
Asta!

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:10.560
That's...

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.690
One of them can use paralysis trap magic?

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.750
When did they...

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.990
It's impossible to tell what'll happen.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.990
So this is the Royal Knights Selection Exam!

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:40.880
Now!

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.010
From three directions?

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:56.690
It's impossible to avoid all three attacks.
This... might be the end.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.830
What?!

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.830
Our spells!

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.940
They reflected our spells back at us?!

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.660
What was that magic?

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.030
What just happened?

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.540
Asta!

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.250
Looks like that went well.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.300
What in the world just happened?

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.950
That's a senior Magic Knight for you.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.310
I thought that would've destroyed 
their crystal, too.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.350
But to think he managed to keep the 
crystal intact and stay conscious.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.360
Good job, man.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.780
Though it looks like you and the 
crystal are both on your last legs.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.040
Now, then... I don't know 
what else might happen,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.980
so I need to take the shortest possible 
route to destroy that crystal.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.880
The crystal will never...
fall to someone as insolent as you...

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.140
Says the person who just lost to me.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.140
Talk about hopeless.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.140
Looks like you're short on imagination 
when it comes to unknown magic.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.890
Magic Knights are supposed to consider 
every possibility when fighting.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.310
If people could win by getting

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.910
all fired up and launching 
huge spells, life would be easy.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.990
Anyone who loses to me doesn't 
deserve to be a Magic Knight.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.290
That magic is... Ash Magic?

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.260
That means the trap spell 
that Asta fell for was his?

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.080
This is game over.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.340
You trash can try again some other time.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.270
Damn it!

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.910
You know, never mind.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.600
I'm not here to win.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.300
Actually, I'm here for a 
completely different reason.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.110
What do you mean?

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.220
Psych, you loser!

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.320
Crystal magic stoppage confirmed.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.690
B Team wins!

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.310
What was with that guy's magic, anyway?

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.220
He powered up his opponents' spells 
and reflected them back to them?

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.160
I don't really get it, but that was amazing.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.190
I guess that weirdo in the mask is the 
top candidate for the Royal Knights.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.900
I'm glad that Asta and his team won, 
but I'm really annoyed for some reason, la!

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.240
And the best cure for that is to eat, la!

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.530
Hey, great work, you two.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.100
That was some nice teamwork.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.500
You did a great job as a decoy.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.980
Did you see that guy's face?

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.510
For a second, he actually 
thought I wouldn't destroy it.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.460
Thanks, Mimosa.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.720
Asta...

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.310
You jackass! What the hell 
is with your attitude?!

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.690
How could you do that to a Magic Knight?

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.070
That team was amazing, too!

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.070
Amazing or not, they still lost.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.490
It just means our teamwork 
was better than theirs.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.200
Be glad, you shitty little shrimp.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.830
Teamwork? You can't be serious!

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.430
That trap I triggered was 
your magic, wasn't it?!

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.140
What's the big idea, you jerk?!

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.840
Again, I had you fall for the 
trap so you could act as a decoy.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.260
You know what they say... If you want to 
fool your enemies, fool your friends first.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.740
The hell's that supposed to mean?!

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.390
Oh, yeah. There's a spell 
set on my collar, too.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.600
My eyes! My eyes!

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.700
Asta!

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.670
My eyes! My eyes!

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.530
Man, you're hilarious.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:58.610
This guy's magic...

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:04.410
He probably seals magic effects in objects 
or the terrain by drawing magic circles,

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.450
then uses certain conditions 
to activate them.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:13.390
That trap activated after Asta 
triggered the earlier trap.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:18.670
It responded to magic that entered 
the area within a certain time frame.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.530
It's called... a counter-trap spell.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.660
It sends magic back at double 
the speed and power,

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.980
so the stronger the spell, 
the more effective it is.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.570
A huge trap spell like that must have 
taken an enormous amount of mana and time.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.780
When did you even set it?

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.790
It's still in my eyes...

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.160
Weren't you sleeping the whole time?

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.060
It's a secret. It's always better 
when a guy's a bit mysterious.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.350
Mysterious, my ass!

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.970
You crazy, cool-masked jerk!

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.550
That's a compliment, Asta!

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.910
Tell us everything, you jerk!

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.850
Man, you're loud, no matter 
who you're talking to.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:11.390
We're on stage next, so clear the hell out.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.220
Who died and made you the 
boss, Funglasquent?

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.860
Don't abbreviate "Funny Glasses Delinquent!"

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.970
What the hell kind of name is that, anyway?!

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.290
You're plenty loud yourself, Funglashorty!

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.080
Who are you calling "Funny Glasses Shorty," 
you ridiculously giant woman?!

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.680
Magna! Giant Lady! And... where's the other one?

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.730
Honestly... All of you lack elegance.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.380
Geh... Oh, no.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:52.910
C Team
The Coral Peacocks 1st Class Senior Magic Knight
Kirsch Vermillion

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.340
You're not beautiful!

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.730
Do your best not to taint my beauty, 
for I am Kirsch Vermillion!

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.400
Who the hell's that sparkly guy?

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.520
Huh?

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.380
Did he say Vermillion?

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.900
He's my older brother.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.180
Older brother?!

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.470
I wish he'd disappear.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.310
I am beautiful. Oh, so beautiful!

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.920
He seems like a fun big brother.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.620
I wish from the bottom of 
my heart that he'd disappear.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.270
Petit Clover

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.180
Petit Clover!

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.780
The Next Time We Meet

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.000
The Next Time We Meet.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:13.030
Asta... The next time we meet, I'll be 
strong enough to fight alongside you!

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.790
Black... Clover... Black... Clover...

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.790
You can do it, Mimosa.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.790
Black... Clover... Black... Clover...

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.790
You can do it, Mimosa!

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.000
Black... Clover... Black... Clover...

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.500
You can do it, Mimosa!

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.800
And so...

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.800
Asta, I've gotten stronger!

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.830
You can...

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.550
Mimosa, when did you learn to 
do an awesome serve like that?!

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.790
I did it!

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.270
Hello there. Aren't I beautiful?

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.860
The beauty that stands before 
you is I, Kirsch Vermillion.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.110
I am Mimosa's beautiful brother.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.180

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.150
It's a sin to be so beautiful.
