00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.070
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.680
In the second stage of the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.390
Langris's G Team won by a hair.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560
Finral!

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.900
Overcome with madness,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.070
Langris tried to attack his older brother 
Finral, despite the match being over.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.150
Disappear.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.080
But the members of the Black 
Bulls came to his rescue.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.040
Hey!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.460
Just try and do something else.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.170
Forget the match. We'll kill you.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.670
Maybe you've been on a roll lately, 
but you're still Black Bulls flunkies.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.760
What do you think you'll do against 
the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.770
Who the hell cares about status when we're 
trying to protect our precious friend?!

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.660
I guess making it this far 
has gone to your head.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.760
You sure talk big for a Black Bulls newbie.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.570
Wizard King, before the next 
teams conduct their match,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.410
would you let me battle them?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.880
Actually... Let's just start.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.130
Let the semi-finals begin!

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.400
Sir, aren't you going to stop them?

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.130
In actual combat,
 no one says "stop" or "start."

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.330
At Langris's forceful request,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.920
the semi-final match between 
B Team and G Team began immediately.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.640
But Julius had another goal:

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.020
to bring the unconscious traitor working 
with the Eye of the Midnight Sun to light.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.440
Asta!

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.470
In order to defeat Langris, 
Asta decided to take on his black form.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.030
It's all you, Xerx!

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.540
He put his faith in a mage who called 
himself Xerx and concentrated.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.790
Yet this dumbass is actually 
putting all his trust in me.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.490
That man's true name was Zora.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.340
Damn it.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.050
I'm going to continue protecting everything 
I can with all the power that I have.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.970
That's what makes a Magic Knight!

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.970
Zora's father, Zara, was the first 
peasant to become a Magic Knight,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.060
but he was betrayed by his 
own comrades and killed.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.940
You people...

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.860
are not the Magic Knights 
that my father dreamed of!

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.020
Burn It Into You

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.510
Begone! I am a true Magic Knight!

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.030
They got past the magic circle...

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.430
Xerx!

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.760
Congrats on landing the first 
attack on me today, Lord Noble.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.780
What?!

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.540
There's a magic circle on his body?!

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.290
What in the world is that?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.290
He drew a magic circle on himself?

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.850
That would drain his magic power constantly.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.930
That's extremely risky.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.360
Exactly.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.680
But that's apparently how he does things.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.460
What...

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.440
...is he?

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.400
Who...

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.850
Who are you?!

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.280
I'm no one of any importance.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.930
I was just...

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.960
born a filthy little brat in a peasant town.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.960
And I am hopeless rage incarnate!

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.960
Take this, you Magic Knight frauds!

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.370
He deflected that spatial magic?!

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.220
And it's twice as powerful now!

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.270
You're no one of any importance... 
Don't mess with me!

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.050
That spell was returned to 
him twice as powerful...

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.090
And he managed to erase all of it!

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.690
Vice Captain Langris's magical 
powers have grown even more!

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.020
But this power...

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.420
Sir...

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.960
Your ultimate move couldn't even scratch me!

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.450
Yet I can become even stronger!

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.960
See? I <i>am</i> special!

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.630
You lot and my useless brother...

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.760
I'm nothing like you!

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.020
Everything you do is useless!

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.400
It's not useless!

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.270
How dare you?!

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.900
Stop that.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.570
Don't heal me, you royal.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.380
I humbly decline your request.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.950
We are on the same team. 
We are both Magic Knights!

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.460
What is that form supposed to be?!

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.690
It's nothing special.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.450
It's just what happens when

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.550
one of those peasants you make 
fun of struggles for a long time!

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.430
All of you are eyesores!

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.010
Be careful not to get in the 
way of my spatial magic, okay?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.440
I can't guarantee that you 
won't lose something.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.230
If that were to happen, 
Mother and Father aside,

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.700
I'm sure she'd be sad.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.570
You're right.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.780
So to ensure that doesn't happen,
 I'm going to win!

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.750
How dare you try to stand on the 
same stage as me?! I've been chosen!

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.460
I'm special!

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.760
You don't stand a chance against me!

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:56.010
You're right. You're amazing.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.000
Your magic stands out even among nobles, 
who all have a tremendous amount of magic.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.910
On top of that, your spatial magic is nuts!

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.020
You were born special.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.610
I always admired people like you!

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.850
I get to protect the country with a 
bunch of amazing people like that.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.390
Man, being a Magic Knight is awesome!

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.270
But you're different.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.670
You're amazing, but you're different!

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.520
I'm not asking someone like you to like me.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.420
I hate you, too!

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.550
But... don't just unfairly take things away!

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.310
You people are special,
and we competed with each other

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.850
and helped each other improve

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.730
so that we could protect everyone!

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.490
We became stronger and came this far 
so that we could fight together!

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.270
Shut up!

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.600
If you didn't want to die,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.380
you should've just kept your mouth 
shut in your little hole, you failure!

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.130
Is that right? In that case, 
I'll take this failed power

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.390
and burn it into you!

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.900
My magic... won't come out!

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.610
Asta...

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.530
Black Meteorite!

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.460
Shut up!

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.830
If you didn't want to die,

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:04.550
you should've just kept your mouth 
shut in your little hole, you failure!

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.060
Is that right? In that case, 
I'll take this failed power

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.570
and burn it into you!

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.070
My magic... won't come out!

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.120
Black Meteorite!

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.180
Both teams' crystals were 
destroyed at the same time.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.170
This match is a draw!

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.810
No way!

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.830
He's passed out.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.130
He got him bah-had.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.950
You said that the one who keeps winning 
will always be right, didn't you?

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.320
You egocentric spatial magic noble.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.710
And since you lost against a peasant,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.720
that means you weren't 
right about anything.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:35.090
No one's going to acknowledge a piece of 
shit like you as vice captain anymore.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.020
You. Fluffy-hatted snow woman.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.060
What did you do during the last match?

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.490
Did you get freaked out by the spatial magic 
noble and just stand there sucking your thumb?

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.640
Must be nice!

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.450
Hey, who do you think you are?

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.960
Shut up.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.960
Like you have any skills 
to begin with, you fake.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.800
Bah—

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.460
People like you are more 
worthless than anyone else.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.180
Just quit being a Magic Knight 
already, you trash.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.150
Hey, you little shit!

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.470
You trust people way too easily!

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.580
Not everyone is nice or amazing.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.420
You're gonna regret it someday!

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.560
You don't have to say it like—

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.490
It looks like you try to make 
the best move in every situation,

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.050
but make sure you don't stop 
thinking when you hit circumstances

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.390
that go beyond what you imagined, you royal.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.500
And...

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:46.190
Cool-masked jerk, you should have 
had more faith in your companions.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.020
A draw...

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.910
We didn't win.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.150
Damn it... Damn it!

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.170
Let's fight with all we've got, together!

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:28.030
We're all Magic Knights 
of the Clover Kingdom.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.190
I heard it ended in a draw between
Asta and your little brother.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.470
I'd say the Black Bulls' little star
 of hope did pretty well.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.050
He fought head-to-head with the 
Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.660
And that's exactly why

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.890
you need to wake up already.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.370
Everyone under you is taking all 
the glory while you're asleep.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.210
I did what I could for now, 
but his wounds are too deep.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.310
I need to take him to the 
castle's medical tower.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.220
Cob, if you would.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.300
Roger-dodger-roger!

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.010
I'll go with you, too.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.550
You're up next, you jerk.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.100
You better win!

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.350
Of course!

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:36.660
Rill   Ruben   Nils

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:36.660
I Team

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:36.660
Klaus   Luck   Puli

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:36.660
K Team

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:34.470
And now, I Team: Rill, Nils, and Ruben versus 
K Team: Puli, Klaus, and Luck.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.660
We will now begin round three of stage two.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:41.690
Yay! Let's give it all we've got!

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.930
But we're up against the
 Captain of the Aqua Deer,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.140
who'll wait until we've made a move, 
then strike at our magic's weak points.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.590
What should we do?

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.220
I have an idea. Wanna hear?

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:02.230
I can't wait to see what kind 
of painting I get to make next!

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.480
If we can manage to support him, we can win.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.390
Their magic power is being 
concentrated and sharpened.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.830
We'll use a super-fast attack 
spell and nail him first

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.420
so he won't have a chance to follow up!

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.980
I'm borrowing the idea from the combo spell

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.030
the people in the first match used.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.470
Although I think the power behind 
this one is even crazier.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.850
This isn't good!

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.100
We have to hide the crystal!

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.140
There's no point in trying to move it now.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.360
On a field this size, we'll know 
where it is, no matter where it goes.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.230
This spell is probably 
going to be insanely fast!

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.610
I'll have to paint mine first!

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.620
No matter what you try to do, it'll be useless!

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.910
This spell pierces through everything!

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.580
Compound Magic: Lightning Arrow!

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.590
No one can stop it!

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.280
I won't stop it!

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.230
Picture Magic: Game of the Gods!

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.170
I was inspired by the last match, too!

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.850
My methods are different, but I'm 
going to enhance the enemy's spell...

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.200
and send it back!

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:50.910
Whoopsie.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.330
The crystal has been destroyed!

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.710
I Team wins!

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.760
What the heck was that?

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.970
Th-That was insane!

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.730
The Captain of the Aqua Deer...

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.940
That was amazing! Amazing!

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.730
Rill Boismortier cannot be stopped!

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.350
I'm seeing the masterpiece in my head!

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.110
Yay!

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.470
Well, damn. That was over in a second.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.070
No worries, la.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.470
Luck has grown so much 
during this competition.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.180
I made sure to record all of 
your progress in my diary.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.310
Good work.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.400
Black Bulls...

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.840
Asta is physically exhausted, so he's 
resting in the infirmary down below.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:38.620
I'll stay by his side, 
so please, cheer on Noelle.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:49.310
Ben   Brad   Eric

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:49.310
M Team

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:49.310
En   Noelle   Yuno

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:49.310
P Team

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:46.670
Next up, we have M Team: Ben, Brad, and Eric
 versus P Team: En, Yuno, and Noelle.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.780
We will now begin round four of stage two.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.670
I have to do this for Asta, too.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.690
I mean, we have to fight 
for everyone who's lost!

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.860
That's right.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.390
And we'll win.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.540
Round four of stage two... begin!

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.330
Huh?

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.500
Hey, wait a second!

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.580
I don't have time to waste here.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.950
Here he comes!

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.040
He's by himself?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.510
He's mocking us!

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.430
Take this!

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.820
Wind Magic: Towering Tornado!

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.940
What?!

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.610
How dare you, you peasant?!

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.220
Asta, even though you lost, 
you're getting right back up, aren't you?

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.660
I know how fast you've been growing.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.590
The more frustrated you become, 
the more you grow.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.260
Th-The crystal has been destroyed.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.700
P Team wins!

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.410
That power... What was that?

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.420
That jerk... What the hell did he do?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.190
I wish I could've fought him, too.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.020
La!

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.220
Yuno...

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.590
You're going to grow even more, aren't you?

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:29.750
Hey! Why did you take care 
of this all by yourself?

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.610
Use some of my powers, too!

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.750
You're wasting my talent!

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.500
Be quiet.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.950
Jeez! You're such a tease!

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.420
I guess I don't hate that side of you!

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.380
Next is the second round of the semi-finals.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.440
We've finally reached the last match.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.440
The first match of the semi-finals ended 
in a draw, so I Team versus P Team,

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.440
for all practical purposes, 
is the final match!

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.910
Asta...

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.410
I'm going on ahead.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.550
Petit Clover

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.910
Petit Clover!

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:49.050
Name

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.650
Name.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:55.810
Zara

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:55.810
Zora

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.530
My real name is Zora.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.820
My father's name is Zara.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.810
What? That's too simple?

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.890
Who cares? You can tell we're family.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.890
Zara

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.890
Zora

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.480
Yeah, yeah! If only I 
had quintuplet siblings!

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.530
Oldest Brother
Asta

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.750
I'm Asta!

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.550
Ista.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.240
Second Brother
Ista

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.240
Third Brother
Usta

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.350
Usta.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.240
Fourth Brother
Esta

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.150
Esta.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.240
Fifth Brother
Osta

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.240
Osta!

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.780
None of us have any magic, 
but we'll never, ever give up!

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.720
I'm the one who's going to marry Sister Lily!

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.760
No, I am.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.390
No, I am.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.810
No, I am.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.400
No, I am!

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.830
Let's fight!

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.460
We may fight sometimes, but we 
quintuplets get along great!

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.260
One of you is loud enough. Who could 
stand listening to five of you yapping?

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.030
You can't be serious.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.470
The final match is finally here.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.110
I had so much fun seeing all kinds of magic.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.230
I wish we could keep going.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.610
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 84: " The Victors."

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 84
 The Victors

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.030
Now, I wonder which team is going to win.
