WEBVTT

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.900
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.530
The sixth round of the first stage of 
the Royal Knights Selection Exam...

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.990
Steel Creation Magic: Full Metal Fortress!

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.060
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.610
Wing Magic...

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.190
Angel Flapping!

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.320
Go, Luck!

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.240
This is so much fun!

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.410
More...

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.830
Let's play some more!

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.870
Luck shows an extraordinary 
amount of growth and teamwork,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.750
giving K Team their victory.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.330
In the eighth and final round 
of the first stage...

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.460
Time for Yuno and Noelle's team!

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.220
Solid...

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.670
A House of Silva battle 
between Noelle and Solid...

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.390
And a battle between Yuno, 
who is favored by Vangeance,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.730
and Alecdora, who resents him over that fact.
Two battles filled with bad blood.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.820
I'm the one who will make 
Master Vangeance's dream come true!

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.330
Wind Magic: Towering Tornado!

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.320
I don't know anything about 
other people's dreams.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.030
The only dreams I see are my own.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.410
Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.420
The crystal has been destroyed! P Team wins!

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.410
I'm not weak anymore!

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.020
Peasant Trap

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.940
Impossible...

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.650
Im...possible...

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.010
My ultimate spell was so easily...

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.110
He didn't even use his spirit magic.
He wasn't even serious.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.370
I will be the one to make Master 
Vangeance's dreams come true.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.370
Once you elites trip up,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.850
you're so weak.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.750
Yes! Great job winning, Yuno!

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.280
You too, weed.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.630
Who are you calling a weed?!

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.020
Great job, Yuno!

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.040
Y-You were so cool!

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.060
Here's your usual after-battle dessert.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.980
Replenishing my energy is important.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.400
Thanks. I'll be sure to savor it.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.900
Thanks! I'll be sure to savor it!

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.030
It's good.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.610
La...

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.370
You okay, Miz Charmy?!

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.790
La...

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.220
What the heck?! Who do you 
think you are, you fivehead?!

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.540
I'll suffocate you by stuffing 
my scales into your nostrils!

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.550
Take that, and that, and that!

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.550
She'll be fine.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.860
That was fantastic, Noelle.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.570
I didn't know you were that amazing.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.390
You're totally different when 
you're using your mushrooms.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.190
But...

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.960
I heard Solid's remarks before the match.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.200
A big brother should never say 
such things to his little sister.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.200
Big brothers exist to protect the younger, 
weaker siblings born after them.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.060
And yet you've only said 
hurtful things to her!

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.460
Get him, Noelle! Thrash your brother!

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.470
Well, you know... Thanks for earlier.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.850
You did a great job.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.100
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
 I'm royalty, you know!

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.190
Let's do our best in the next match, too.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.290
Thanks to my Mana Skin training, 
I have much better control over my mana.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.070
I'm going to keep this up and be 
selected as one of the Royal Knights!

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.200
Wow, so many excellent matches.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.370
I can't wait until the next one!

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.870
Entertain me more.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.880
To think both of the peasants who humiliated 
me made it through the first stage...

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.170
Hurry up and lose already.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.590
Why don't we jump right into stage two?

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.390
But before that...

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.100
I'm counting on you guys.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.310
Yes, sir!

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.740
The stage is changing!

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.210
Holy crap!

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.650
It's easier to judge your abilities when

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.340
you're forced to fight in
a variety of situations.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.390
I'm back.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.630
Welcome back.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.340
Now, then... For stage two,
 you'll be fighting upon this stage.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.380
Xerx

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.380
Mimosa

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.380
Asta

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.380
Kirsch

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.380
Sol

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.380
Magna

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.330
The stage may have changed, 
but my beauty remains the same.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.660
Yeah, yeah...

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.750
The same goes for the fate of you filth.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.690
I'll make sure there's no trace of 
you left. I hope you're prepared.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.220
Hey, I'm not that easy to get rid of!

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.110
Asta isn't filth!

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.650
You're the one who should 
be prepared, Brother!

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.540
Asta! No holding back, you got it?!

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.010
Wouldn't dream of it, Magna!

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.490
At least you're spirited, Funglasquent.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.420
Stop calling me Funglasquent!

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.920
Welp, looks like we're 
facing off with royalty.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.180
Let's do our best with teamwork again, guys!

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.140
You looked anxious when they 
shifted the stage around.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.890
You probably have other 
traps set up, don't you?

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.350
This brat... That's right. He can read other people's ki or whatever.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.940
You're right. You see...

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.840
I set up a bunch of traps 
around the stage yesterday.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.330
I heard intel that the 
exam would be held here.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:04.500
Intel? But the location of the Royal Knights 
Selection Exam must've been top secret.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.790
Who in the world are you?

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.550
You set them up yesterday?

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.410
So you <i>are</i> cheating, you bastard!

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.540
What makes you think that, you dumb shit?

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.060
Gathering intel counts as an ability.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.140
Was there a rule against setting 
traps up the day before?

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.140
Well? They haven't called 
me out on it, have they?

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.630
And he already got argued into silence.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.510
This side of Asta is adorable, too.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.310
Then tell us where the traps are,
since we're on your team!

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.810
We can at least help you out!

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.910
Not happening.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.920
If I tell you, our enemies 
will probably figure it out.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.210
I can't... argue with that.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.460
I'll handle this my own way.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.790
Fine! Then I'll handle things 
my own way, too, ya jerk!

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.170
They seem to be arguing about something.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.970
I wonder if they'll be okay.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.120
They do say that the more you fight,
the closer you are.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.990
You should fight with me, too, 
someday. In a friendly way.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.400
Hopefully you can think up something 
with that shitty little brain of yours.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.980
My brain's so big that my 
skull can barely contain it!

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.770
Indeed! The only thing small 
about Asta is his height.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.610
Yeah! Hey, wait!

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.450
And now...

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:25.790
B Team: Xerx, Mimosa, and Asta 
versus C Team: Kirsch, Sol, and Magna.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.210
Round one of stage two... Begin!

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.000
Xerx   Mimosa   Asta

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.000
B Team

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.000
Magna   Sol   Kirsch

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.000
C Team

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.140
Mimosa... It seems she's 
lost sight of herself after

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.620
being exposed to such 
boorish mana for so long.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.850
The poor dear.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:51.700
I'll free you from those filthy wretches 
before you even have a chance to fight.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.990
Cherry Blossom Magic:

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:05.420
Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals 
~Plus My Beautiful Illusion~.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.710
Ah, it's in full bloom.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.050
It's so pretty! Time for 
a flower-viewing party!

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.180
Here you go.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:23.670
Now, repent your filthy selves 
within my beautiful spell!

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.560
Here he comes.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.690
I talked big, but I can't think of 
a way to break through this spell.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.080
It's better to sit tight for now.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.320
We're better off waiting for them 
to set off the magic traps.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.830
What an awesome spell. I can't see a thing.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.830
I guess this is the only way.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.210
Asta?

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.220
All right... Here it comes.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.470
Oh? Looks like something 
amazing's about to happen.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.480
Good... That's it. Go even deeper.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.940
Asta?

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.930
More... More intense...

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.410
Wh-What is this? It's not magic...

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.120
It's so powerful, intense,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.460
and...

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.300
ominous.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.260
Here I go!

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.810
Black Hurricane!

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.020
The cherry blossoms... Wait, forget that!
The traps I'd set up...

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.560
A-Asta...

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.260
This is from back then.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.760
So this is it.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.390
I knew he had been training ever 
since he went to the volcano,

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.760
but to think his power was this immense!

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.870
Way to go, Asta, my BFF!

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.030
The cherry blossoms are being erased!

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.970
Impossible... What is 
that horrific black mass?

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.650
That little shrimp... blew away 
all the magic in the area.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.230
Th-That's amazing, Asta!

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.490
What the hell did you do, you little shit?

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.790
I think I just heard the 
real you for the first time.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.540
Come on! Let's fight together!

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.300
You little shit.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.050
Th-This isn't beautiful.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.320
What is this?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.850
What in the world is going on?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.220
Asta's going to continue to get stronger.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.150
And so will I!

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.530
Looks like Asta's learned 
another interesting power.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.940
Here you go.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.780
What the hell do you think you're doing?

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.140
You just erased all the traps I'd set up!

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.870
Yeah, I guess that's a bit of a problem.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.330
So...

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.750
Think up a strategy for us!

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.360
One that'll let all three of us win!

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.430
Huh?!

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.050
You're tricky and clever, so I'm 
sure you can think of something!

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.300
From now on, think up some sneaky 
strategies fair and square!

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.020
The hell? That's a contradiction.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.100
Thank goodness. Asta is 
acting the same as usual.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.620
Just use that power of yours 
and defeat them yourself.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.030
Why do I have to do this?

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:12.990
Too bad for you! Once I use that power, 
I can't use it again for a while!

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.550
Why do you sound so happy, you little shit?

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.500
Are you messed up in the head?

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.950
I want to fight as a team, ya jerk!

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.380
I don't care if you set up traps yesterday!

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.670
Just let Mimosa and me in on it!

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.680
We're fighting to be selected 
as the Royal Knights who'll

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.480
fight against the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun, aren't we?

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.370
No one can fight them alone! 
Not me or anyone else!

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:43.520
I want to work with all the powerful guys 
here and beat some other powerful people!

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.360
Zora,

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.070
the Magic Knights are amazing.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.080
But no matter how amazing they are, 
even a Magic Knight can't fight alone.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.860
They trust their companions and 
overcome deadly situations together!

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.530
Besides, one of the powerful 
guys we're up against now

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.800
is royalty and the vice captain 
of the Coral Peacocks!

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.530
We have to hit 'em with all we've got!

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.600
Ow! What the heck was that for, ya jerk?!

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.100
I have no intention of 
getting chummy with a royal.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.230
But for the sake of my goal...

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.740
I can't think of any way around it, 
so I'll use you, you little shit.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.200
That's fine with me, as long as we fight 
together, you cool-masked jerk!

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.890
As you know, my magic attribute is ash.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.090
My specialty is trap spells.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.880
But that doesn't mean I can instantly

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.760
set up big traps like the one 
I used in the last match.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.060
Setting big traps takes time and mana,
and how much you put into them

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.210
determines their power.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.270
Like I said, I pulled an all-nighter.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.600
You were serious about that?!

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.330
And you went and thrashed them 
all like they were nothing.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.420
Yeah... Sorry about that.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.610
What was I supposed to do, though?

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:17.500
Let's see... There are three basic 
types I could set up right now.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.990
Oh?

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.160
Number one: binding traps.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.150
Whoever touches the magic 
circle gets tied up.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.000
Number two: pitfall traps.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.790
Just like it sounds. Dig a hole 
and drop someone into it.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.620
Number three: landmine traps.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.580
Make a simple attack spell 
activate on a certain spot.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.320
They'll all disappear after one use,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.620
and unless I take the time to 
pour lots of mana into them,

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.610
they won't be all that powerful.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.860
So... What do we do?

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.820
U-Unbelievable...

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:01.740
My beautiful spell was defiled by 
that peasant's pitch-black thing.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.580
I saw that coming.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.590
He'd been practicing his 
techniques like crazy.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.590
I knew he'd figure something out.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.270
You're telling everyone not to 
underestimate peasants, aren't you, Asta?

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.210
I'm a peasant myself, but...

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.010
What?! You're also a peasant?

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.600
You got a problem with that, Mr. Royalty?

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.060
Eek! I'm going to be defiled!

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.520
I can't fight alongside a peasant!

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.290
Hey, what the... Wait a sec!

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:37.350
You damn narcissist! 
The hell is your problem?!

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.450
I can handle this on my own! 
I'll finish them off myself!

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.530
You two, protect the crystal!

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.500
Is that so?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.420
Fine. I'll just do whatever 
the hell I want, too.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:55.340
Jeez... Could men be any dumber?

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:02.390
Peasants are those with meager magic. 
That also means they're unclean.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:09.160
They must not share the same stage as 
us royals, the fairest of them all!

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.670
Mimosa is heading toward our crystal.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.910
I can sense that Xerx 
fellow's magic over here.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.150
As for that filth, I sense 
absolutely no magic from him.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.950
What kind of foul creature is he?

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.020
Where did he...

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.130
Hey, here comes Mimosa's big bro!

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.290
There you are, you filthy boy!

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.410
Cherry Blossom Magic: Dance of the 
Beautiful Cherry Blossom Blades!

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.610
Some got through those tiny little gaps!

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.110
Man, you really are strong!

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.900
Look at the unsightly way he's fleeing.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.110
You won't get away!

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.470
Hey! Come get me!

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.850
It's faint, but I sense magic.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.750
Is he trying to lure me into a trap?

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.190
I can see right through your unsightly ploy!

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.430
Cherry Blossom Magic: My Beautiful Clones!

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.640
The traps!

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.400
Did you actually think I'd 
fall for such crude traps?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.090
And you went into a narrow place where 
you'll have trouble swinging your sword,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.320
with no place to run. You couldn't be uglier.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.480
Damn it! I thought this 
was a great plan, too!

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.040
Wither and fall, you peasant!

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.180
Wh-What is this?

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.220
I'm certain I erased all of the trap spells.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.070
You moron!

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.700
You keep counting on your magic detection
'cause it has higher specs than ours.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.630
That's why you fell for our low-spec,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.130
plain and simple trap that 
we got all sweaty digging up.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.260
Some high and mighty royal.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.180
They physically dug this up 
without using any magic?

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:39.210
How unsightly! I'll just fly 
right out of this primitive—

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.160
I feel bad about doing 
this to Mimosa's big bro,

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.130
but I need you to pass out for a bit!

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.970
Stay back, filth!

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.640
Anti-magic?

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.660
Now we finally feel like a team.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.580
I just used you, dummy.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.510
Petit Clover

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.340
Petit Clover!

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:54.010
The Life of a Narcissist

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.310
The Life of a Narcissist.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.140
Please do stop crying, Master Kirsch.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:01.150
Ever since he was born, he was 
only interested in his own beauty.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.100
No, no, no. No one is more beautiful than I.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.920
He couldn't be satisfied with the 
beauty of any of his wooers,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.410
so he spent his whole life single.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.270
Because of his warped personality, 
he was abandoned by those around him,

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.620
and spent his later years alone.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.130
I-I'm thirsty... Oh? I'm so beautiful.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.080
I'm still oh so beautiful.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.230
And so, his life came to a tragic end.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.140
Still, I'm so beautiful.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.980
I really wish I could make 
you come to a tragic end.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.440
Who cares about teammates?

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.520
I'm only using everyone 
to achieve my own goal.

 Mister Delinquent vs. Muscle Runt

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.990
Sneakily setting up traps is my magic.
