00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.680
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.170
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.930
The Clover Kingdom's royal capital 
suddenly fell under attack.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.680
Flames rose in five spots 
throughout the capital,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.310
and the Magic Knights deployed to each
location to help the panicked citizens.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.610
They battled an unknown enemy.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.940
Come at me yourself!

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.740
Don't get cocky, you little brat!

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.870
Come forth, Alfred.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.580
Number Two, Alfred.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.930
Go, Alfred!

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.700
I would always close my eyes

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.040
And cower at reality

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.710
I can't stand the idea

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.090
Of just making excuses to give up

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.200
Stand right there

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.400
I don't want to be near you

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.540
Any minute now

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.880
Just wait right there

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.880
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.970
Black and blue

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.890
I'll give up on giving up

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.410
And get the world on my side

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.280
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.420
And head where the light shines

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.250
I want to keep my promise

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.800
I'll deliver it to you

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.820
shape of love

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.520
The Crimson Lion King

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.570
Central District

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.070
Something's wrong.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.290
Their numbers are great, 
but they're far too weak.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.290
What does the enemy want?

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.080
Where is their main force?

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.250
What are they after?

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.330
The king?

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.010
Where is the Wizard King?

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.580
During an emergency like this,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.500
he should be the first to rush to the side of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.460
King of the Clover Kingdom
Augustus Kira Clover XIII

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.770
Augustus Kira Clover XIII,
King of the Clover Kingdom.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.700
His first priority should be 
to protect me. That is...

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.060
the most important duty of

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.870
the most powerful mage in 
the kingdom,the Wizard King!

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.710
You are absolutely right, Your Majesty.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.970
Rest assured, we, the advisors of 
the Wizard King, will protect you.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.410
Curse that Julius.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.110
He's gotten full of himself because his 
authority equals mine when we're at war,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.270
hasn't he?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.750
Honestly...

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.780
I'm the only leader of the Clover Kingdom!

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.120
Castle Town Kikka

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.780
Chef! What are you doing?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.250
The royal capital is under attack!
We need to take shelter!

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.250
You idiots! Like a true chef could 
leave in the middle of cooking!

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.530
I will deliver the best dishes, 
no matter the situation!

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.260
That's what it means to be the best!

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.910
Uh, but all the Magic Knights have 
been deployed, so there's no one here!

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.530
They left for battle.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.010
What?! How could they have left 
without eating my main dish?!

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.980
Well, our kingdom is in trouble!

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.830
Let's hurry and escape!

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.280
La!

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.530
Wh-Who's this little shrimp?

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.950
This main dish you mentioned...

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.410
Please let me eat it!

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.170
A Magic Knight's robe...

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.960
Which means she must be one 
of the big shots that got

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.500
invited to the decoration ceremony.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.880
And...

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.570
Her glaring eyes are practically on fire.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.220
Her glaring drool is practically on fire.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.730
She's...

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.020
someone special!

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.770
All right, you've got it!

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.690
Just wait!

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.470
I'll cook you up the best main dish ever!

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.060
What?!

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.240
Yay! Woohoo!

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.240
Let's just run!

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.280
Cooking...

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.040
is more important than my life!

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.040
Yay!

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.390
North District

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.000
Too bad, you stupid brat!

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.140
Your special anti-magic blade doesn't 
mean anything if it can't hit its target!

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.570
Mister...

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.320
This is your chance!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.650
Run!

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.430
O-Okay.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.660
Please help him.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.500
I know. Don't worry, he's...

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.170
a dear friend of mine!

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.050
Okay!

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.110
Come down here!

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.000
Are you stupid?

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.170
Who the heck would come down 
just because someone told them to?

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.740
Back at the dungeon...

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.980
Yeah, leave it to me.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.500
I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.830
I don't have any magic,

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.370
but I've got...

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.150
my friends!

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.250
My magical powers combined with Asta's sword.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.970
If only I could help him now like I did then,

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.760
even if the enemy is in the air...

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.260
Black Bulls girl!

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.100
I, Leopold Vermillion, shall assist you.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.890
I shall not let him harm my rival any longer!

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.110
Right.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.370
You two can deal with him!

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.860
Muddy Water Magic...
Mine's a poor match for that.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.630
Asta...

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.830
His wound from that attack earlier...

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.520
You told me earlier, didn't you?

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.110
To come at you myself?

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.200
You fool!

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.360
I'm not going to fight. I'm going to control
my corpses and enjoy the show!

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.410
I'm going to win just by watching.

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.470
That's how I fight!

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:49.930
Unlike a meathead like you,
I actually know how to use my brain.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.890
Moron!

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.850
Moron!

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.350
Damn it...

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.390
That stupid jerk doesn't even 
think of people as people...

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.390
I don't wanna lose to him!

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.900
What's that look for?

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.930
Guts alone won't gonna get you 
out of this, you stupid brat!

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.990
Alfred!

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.890
Asta!

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.290
Damn it! What should I...

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.300
Kill him!

00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:01.260
M-My Alfred... turned into 
charcoal in an instant...

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.540
He's...

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.650
Damn it... I couldn't defeat him on my own.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.520
I apologize for horning in on your fight.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.140
But I thought it would be a shame 
to let a man like you die here.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.780
Forgive me.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:51.040
You fought well for a peasant 
with no magical powers.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.040
You're funny, kid.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.960
Join my squad.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.630
I hate to admit this, but it looks like 
Yami's foresight was better than mine.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.060
Asta, wasn't it?

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.670
You mentioned that you were going to 
become the Wizard King, didn't you?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.160
Huh?! Become the Wizard King?!

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.740
There's no way a stupid brat like you who's 
way weaker than me could become that!

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.120
Then...

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.790
I guess you're my rival, too.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.770
So you're gonna fight me?

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.050
Finally, someone worth fighting...

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.340
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.330
Fuegoleon Vermillion!

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.270
Asta,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.590
leave the rest to me!

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.400
Asta!

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.690
Fuegoleon!

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.970
A captain of a Magic Knights squad...

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.570
I guess you're my rival, too.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.710
Did he just say...

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.260
This is no time for me to be a wuss!

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.940
I can still...

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.210
do this!

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.380
No, you can't.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.370
My head, my face, and my stomach hurt!

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.800
I'm sure they do.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.530
As a warrior, you need to constantly 
be aware of your condition,

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.650
and determine if you're 
able to fight or not.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.030
You are definitely not 
in that state right now.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:20.270
Your exuberance may be your greatest
weapon, but keep a cool head, too.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.380
If you truly wish to become 
the Wizard King, that is.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.280
Now, let's hear it.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.540
What are you after?

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.880
Your actions are too scattered 
for an invasion and

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.790
too organized for indiscriminate terrorism.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.860
Who are you?

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.800
Who am I? You don't recognize me?

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.230
I guess I'm the only one 
enjoying this reunion.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.510
What?

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.650
Six years ago, I was the top choice 
for a Magic Knights squad.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.150
What? You're a former Magic Knight?

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.440
I guess you wouldn't remember.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.690
I wasn't important enough for 
you people to bother with.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:22.040
He's a commoner, but he has 
tremendous magical powers.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.030
All who wish to offer, 
please raise your hand.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.190
I see... You're from back then.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.850
What's your name?

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.320
It's Rades!

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.870
That's right.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.540
I believe you joined the Purple Orcas.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.470
They expelled me!

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.480
Expelled?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.020
Rades, with all of your talent... Why?

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:55.160
They said that my magic was 
dangerous and forbidden,

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.660
and kicked me out of the 
squad and the kingdom both!

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.920
Because I was a commoner,
no one stood up for me. No one!

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.300
Even though my powers were 
better than everyone else's!

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.380
Greater than the nobles'...
greater than anyone's!

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.750
I thought magic meant 
everything in this kingdom!

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.760
And that's why!

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.100
I'm getting my revenge on the 
Magic Knights and this country!

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.230
With my powers! That's what I'm after!

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.990
Though we do have another goal.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.030
For such a childish reason...

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.280
You can't be serious, you fool!

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.490
Childish?

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.710
Reasons are always simple!

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.530
Leo!

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.090
Fuegoleon?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.550
Do you need help?

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.430
Definitely not!

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.780
Not at all!

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.820
Hey...

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.460
Very good!

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.430
Wha—

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.500
If you understand, take care
of things quickly!

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.440
Yes, sir!

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.990
Wh-Whoa, those brothers are Spartan for sure!

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.340
Way to ask the impossible!

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.710
Our attributes are lousy against each other.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.620
Not like I'm going to let you help him, but...

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.960
Sorry, but I can't control 
the intensity of the flames.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.460
Flame Creation Magic: Leo Rugiens!

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.350
A magical barrier...

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.940
Number One, Carl!

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.330
When he was alive, he was 
an expert at defense magic!

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.700
So I added my curse magic 
and made him even tougher!

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.990
He's bringing out one of those things again!

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.510
Asta.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.450
Y-Yes, sir!

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.420
Do you remember what I said a moment ago?

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.460
Watch carefully.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.330
Why are you so calm?!

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.470
Defense isn't the only thing he can do!

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.930
Flame Creation Magic: Ignis Columna.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.690
Trying to match Carl's barrier spells, huh?

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.230
Well?!

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.200
What do you think about this invincible 
barrier and super barrage?

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.200
Indeed, there is nothing I can do right now.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.710
Is that all you've got,
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings?

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.230
Flame Magic: Sol Linea.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.670
In the instant you attack,

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.710
for just a moment, the mana of 
the barrier thins in places.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.950
That's what I aimed for.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.380
I deal with difficult magic every day.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:22.910
Listen well, all of you!

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.120
As long as you are Magic Knights,

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.130
you will find yourselves constantly pitted 
against powerful enemies and magic!

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.070
But when that happens,
if you gauge the ability calmly

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:40.140
and maintain a bold fighting spirit,
you will never lose!

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.590
Is that clear?!

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:42.720
Yes, sir!

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.140
He instantly saw his opponent's weaknesses,

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.640
and even psyched up his allies.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.090
So that's a Magic Knights Captain.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.150
H-He's awesome!

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:01.450
I-Impossible! My Number One 
was defeated so easily...

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.290
D-Damn it! Damn it!

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.050
Rades, wasn't it?

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.630
Even if you possess extraordinary abilities 
and polish them to their fullest,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:18.130
without a righteous spirit,
your deeds are nothing but violence!

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.140
No one will acknowledge something like that.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.310
I have a report, Your Majesty.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.050
Most of the attackers have 
been dealt with, it seems.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.670
Took them long enough.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.170
The Magic Knights need to work harder.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.270
And? Where's the Wizard King?

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.160
Why hasn't he come to my side?

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.370
He's on an important mission.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:55.170
Honestly... There's no way it 
could be more important than me.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.360
West District

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.500
What were those things, anyway?

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.340
Regardless, they're apparently
no match for us.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.540
East District

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.220
I can't believe you fools 
tried to attack my sis!

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.070
Only the women of the Blue Rose 
Knights are allowed to touch her!

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.520
Sol, don't say things 
people will misinterpret.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.370
The only ones who can touch 
Sis's soft, velvety skin are...

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.730
That's not what I meant.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:33.430
Central District

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.430
What? Finished already?

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.650
But I wasn't done playing.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.420
Something is off.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.660
Northwest District

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.660
I guess that's most of them.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.680
Th-They were so gross.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.820
I need to get stronger so things like 
this don't trouble me so much.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.710
Th-They're so strong!

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.910
Hooray for the Magic Knights!

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:07.740
Hooray! Hooray!

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.270
It's too early for you to 
be cheering just yet.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.740
I think everything's about ready.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.240
Now for some lively sow's mana...

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.060
How exciting!

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:39.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.570
And push me forward

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.610
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:49.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:55.390
And change the flow of time

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.630
(Break free yourself)

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:25.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:31.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.340
Petit Clover

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.740
Petit Clover!

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.850
Palace Three-Second Cooking

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.230
Palace Three-Second Cooking.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.220
The time where I, the royal 
head chef of Clover Kingdom,

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.710
introduce a three-second dish 
that anyone can make.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.850
Today, I'd like to make some 
curry in three seconds.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.630
I'm going to be using simple curry 
roux procured at the market.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.230
Next, you'll need carrots, onions, potatoes,

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.820
some mushrooms, and maybe some tomatoes.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.380
If you try adding secret ingredients 
like chocolate or coffee,

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.380
you can make an even more fragrant curry.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.090
Now, then... You take 
those ingredients, and...

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.310
Immediately chop them up using 
your magic, and simmer them!

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.860
Make sure you use plenty of love and passion!

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.880
And it's finished. Wasn't that easy?

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.940
Time to eat!

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.140
So good!

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.030
And that concludes this episode of Palace
Three-Second Cooking, dishes anyone can make!

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.730
See you next time!

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.110
But that's impossible!

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.400
Magic Knights, hurry up and 
take care of the attackers.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.400

Eating and napping is the job of
