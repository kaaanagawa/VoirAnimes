00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.660
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.150
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.820
The One I've Set My Heart On

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.050
Finral Roulacase, a member of the Black 
Bulls Magic Knights Squad, was troubled.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.110
It was a very important matter.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.660
What do I do? What should I do?

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.410
Finral's troubles had nothing 
to do with a mission...

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.560
...about tonight's mixer?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.400
A mixer, meaning a gathering 
between men and women.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.250
It is a dinner intended to help 
men and women get acquainted.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.480
When I set this up, three girls 
agreed to come, and that's great!

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.880
The more girls, the merrier!

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.730
But the problem is who 
else I'm going to bring.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.980
Asta's a delight, so I'm bringing him 
for sure. I just need one more...

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.970
Hup!

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.660
Flame Magic:

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.160
Exploding...

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.060
Fireball!

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.870
Home run!

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.210
Didja see that?

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.680
This is what truly makes a man!

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.680
Yeah, no. I know there are girls
who like delinquents, but...

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.070
Pleased to meet ya!
My Crazy Cyclone's on fire!

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.260
This is what truly makes a man!
Brr-r-r-rm, brr-r-r-rm!

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.670
Magna's too much of a delinquent. 
He'd just scare them off.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.390
Almost... I'm almost done

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.340
with my life-size statue of Marie.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.220
Ah, Marie. It feels like 
you're right next to me!

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.370
My beloved little sister, Marie!

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.850
Ah, you truly are an angel!

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.850
Yeah, no. Even if I took him to a mixer...

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.110
Marie's more of an angel than any of you.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.700
I want to have a mixer 
with a hundred Maries.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.140
Yes. Marie was already an angel 
before she was even born.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.550
Ugh... A sister complex?

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.570
Really?

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.810
He'd definitely scare them away!

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.550
I heard that you were having a mixer.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.430
You want me to come with you?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.150
Yeah, I have no idea what Gordon's 
thinking, so that's not happening.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.150
No, really. You don't need to hold back. 
It's not as if I don't like girls.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.980
It might be fun to bring Charmy along,
since she's sort of like a mascot character.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.940
But...

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.380
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.740
This is so yummy, too!

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.120
Excuse me, could I get seconds?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.660
I do apologize. It's only been 
five minutes since we opened,

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.830
but we're out of ingredients, 
so we must close for the day.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.790
D'oh!

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.650
The mixer'd be over in five minutes!

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.980
At least, that's what I assume would happen.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.550
Maybe I could take Vanessa...

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.600
But she's a woman!

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.390
Let's not.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.430
Now this is paradise.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.710
Maybe I could go all-out and invite Yami...

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.310
I'm sure there are girls 
who like older guys.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.490
Yami does hate gaudy types, though.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.530
Why the hell are you three 
dressed like that, huh?

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.190
Aren't you showing too much skin?

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.170
What if you catch a cold? 
Put something warm over your stomachs!

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.860
Uh...

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.140
Not happening.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.170
So overbearing.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.340
Maybe not.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.760
Basically, that leaves...

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.180
A mixer? Yeah, sure.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.350
Great! Thanks for agreeing to come.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.360
Well, Luck looks decent, 
so I'm sure things will work out.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.690
So, what's a mixer, anyway?

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.700
Will this actually work out?

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.800
All right, it looks like we're all set.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.500
Should we go dressed like this?

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.530
We have to make sure they know 
that we're Magic Knights.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.750
Magic Knights are the most admired figures 
in the Clover Kingdom, after all.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.450
Got it!

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.990
Are mixers strong? I'm so excited!

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.300
Yeah! I'm excited, too!

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.970
Well, let's go.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.500
Come on. Hurry on through.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.490
Got it!

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.520
Can I go, too? I promise 
I won't get in the way...

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.740
City in the Common Realm: Nean

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.740
Hup!

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.290
I-I'm in the clear.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.380
Sneak... Sneak, sneak... Sneak, sneak, sneak.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.500
When I heard they were going to a mixer,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.470
I was so worried, I ended up following them.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.940
I can't believe this. Why are
they going to a mixer?

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.470
This is the problem with lowly fools.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.460
I-I mean, it's not as if I like that
muscle-brained shrimp or anything!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.510
I don't care who he hangs out 
with or what happens after that!

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.610
Wait, who am I even making excuses to?!

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.500
I'm pretty sure it was 
somewhere around here.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.240
Oh, there it is!

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.950
The Dreavy Hinker

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.760
Okay! Looks like we all have our drinks,
so let's get right to the introductions!

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.180
I'll go ahead and start.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:27.690
Finral Roulacase
21-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Touta

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.470
I'm 21 years old and from Touta!

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.890
I'm Finral Roulacase, the spatial 
magic user from the Black Bulls!

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:27.690
Nice to meet you!

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.130
These are freshly picked moon blossoms.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.450
Please take them as a 
token of our friendship.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.770
Wow! They're beautiful!

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.450
These only bloom at night 
on Mount Anahu, right?

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.300
They smell so nice!

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.200
Thanks...

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.920
Hook, line, and sinker! I'm finally 
going to get a girlfriend!

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.670
But for that to happen, I need both 
Asta and Luck to do their best.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.470
Go on, introduce yourselves.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.210
Introduce myself...

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.630
Am I just supposed to say what I like?

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.470
Okay.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:06.500
Luck Voltia
18-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Ibon

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.110
I'm Luck Voltia, and I'm 18 years old.
I'm from Ibon and belong to the Black Bulls.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.530
My hobbies include fighting tough 
enemies in bloody, mortal combat!

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.320
Isn't "fighting for your life"
a wonderful phrase?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.700
Introduce myself... A manly man should 
probably talk about his dreams.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.730
Right...

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:30.150
Asta
15-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Hage Village

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.460
I-I'm Asta. I'm fifteen. I'm from Hage
Village. I'm a member of the Black Bulls!

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.880
Um... my dream is to become 
the Wizard King someday!

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.180
The Wizard King?

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.380
That'll never happen. 
He's just a kid, anyway.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.260
These two seem kinda...

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.260
How d'ya like these biceps?

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.390
...sketchy.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.390
I mean, I heard they'd be Magic Knights,

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.390
but they just had to be Black Bulls, 
the lowest of the low?

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.790
And if he's from Hage, isn't he a peasant?

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.110
Like, a total peasant?

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.180
I'd never go out with any of these guys 
if they didn't earn more than me.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.600
And if they're younger, shorter, 
and socially beneath me...

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.360
Not happening.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.950
Crap... This seems to be going south.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.990
Okay! We've introduced ourselves, 
so now it's your turn, girls!

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.930
Let's keep things rolling! Yeah!

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.590
We're passing the baton to you!

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.540
Um... We're friends.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:22.120
Rebecca Scarlet

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:22.120
Helene Barbary

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:22.120
Erika Sitate

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.990
I'm Erika. I work at a dressmaker shop.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.630
I'm Helene, and I work as a hairdresser.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.420
Rebecca. I work at a restaurant.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.930
They're clearly losing interest!

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.410
Wow, so you all have 
solid jobs. That's great!

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.060
Say, I'd love to hear about your work.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.620
I'd love it if you made some clothes for me. 
What do you think would look good on me?

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.530
Maybe you could cut my hair sometime.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.150
I've been thinking of 
changing up my hairstyle.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.320
Could I eat at your place sometime?

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.790
No reaction whatsoever! I need to think 
of something they'd be interested in!

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.330
W-Want to hear about the Magic Knights?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.310
Yeah, tell us!

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.860
I'd love to!

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.780
Bingo!

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:59.210
That's great to hear. Well, I use spatial
magic to go to all sorts of places.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.680
Something I've done recently at my job...

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.800
Yes?

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.260
Crap.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.530
Hey. Send me to the john.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:08.550
Yes, sir.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.450
Hey. Send me to the bath.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.270
Yes, sir.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.820
Hey. Send me to my bed.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.860
Yes, sir.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.280
I don't think I've done anything lately 
other than move Yami around.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.300
Luck! You've been working hard! 
What have you done recently?

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.290
Me?

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.370
Tell them something interesting 
you've done at work lately.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.710
Helene and the other girls 
really want to know.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.370
Work, huh? Let's see... Oh!

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.540
The other day, we ran into 
a group of ten bandits...

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.750
Yes, and?

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.940
...and I beat them all to a pulp!

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.740
It was so brutal! And so much fun!

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.680
I could've easily killed them all,
but I just broke three of their bones.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.220
It completely backfired!

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.100
Oh, and when I fought this mage, I—

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.640
Right. Thanks, Luck!

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.580
Now, go on and eat up, my boy!

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.870
Oh, I'm done?

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.110
I'd love to hear what Asta's been up to!

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.530
You protected the people of the
royal capital, didn't you? Great job!

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.570
Y-Yes! I did!

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.830
Oh, you mean the incident the other day?

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.510
When the capital was attacked?

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.080
Yup! Asta worked really 
hard and got promoted!

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.370
Really?

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.000
Hey, this is going well. We just need to keep
taking the conversation in this direction!

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.420
You must be amazing!

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.850
Well, I didn't manage to protect myself.
They put three holes in me.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.350
They hurt like hell!

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.860
Hey, it's all squishy!

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.100
Ow! Hey, don't poke at them.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.340
These two are useless!

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.940
I should've known a mixer 
wouldn't work with these two!

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.360
All of our members suck!

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.650
Ow, ow, ow! Come on, stop!

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.070
Hey, are you mad?

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.910
No, but...

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.110
I heard them mention a mixer, 
so I ended up tagging along.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.970
But thankfully, it doesn't 
seem to be going well.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.180
Like I <i>said</i>! I don't care 
what happens to Shrimpsta!

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.550
Hey!

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.580
Hey, waitress!

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.580
Huh?

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.890
Get me another beer!

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.390
Get it yourself, insect.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.650
What?

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.610
So you know about that huge incident 
at the capital the other day?

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.930
I just happened to be on bodyguard duty 
for a VIP in the capital that day,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:33.750
&lt; Lies &gt;

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.820
and just happened to defeat 
a number of the intruders.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.430
Bah-ha!

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.220
They gave me an exceptional promotion

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.750
and bumped me up to 
Intermediate Magic Knight all at once!

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.620
It's a such a hassle, really.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.540
It's not like I'm even that talented.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.980
&lt; This is true &gt;

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.210
Bah-ha...

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.010
Whoops. Maybe I'm a little intoxicated...

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.940
with myself.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.510
Oh, and you were looking at a 
dirty mag during all that, right?

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.970
Hey, what are you talking 
about? Of course not!

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.190
Shh, shh!

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.580
What's wrong? You guys 
nervous to be around us?

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.440
Bah-ha! You don't have to be so nervous.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.510
He just squeezed lemon all over
the fried chicken without asking first.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.740
At least ask first...

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.370
What the heck is this mixer from hell?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.970
I'm pretty sure I've seen this 
guy before. He's, um...

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.800
Bah-ha!

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.000
Right! Bah-ha!

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.570
To think that my bronze magic 
would be so formidable.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.260
I even terrify myself.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.350
You there, waitress! Get me another drink!

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.640
Bah-ha!

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.640
Hurgh!

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.640
Herf herf!

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.260
Nice!

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.600
Oh, so that's the kind of magic 
you use when you cut hair.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.610
Yup. I just go like this.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.610
It doesn't take much magic, but you 
need really good control! Show me more!

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.380
Huh? Oh, sure...

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.130
His eyes are so pure.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.170
He has such a cute smile,
but there's danger behind it.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.840
I think I might like that gap 
more than I want to admit.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.370
Crap... I think I'm starting 
to like bad boys.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.500
Hey, could you show me your magic, too, Luck?

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.190
Sure! It's a bit cramped
in here, so let's go outside.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.330
Okay!

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.770
Well done, Luck!

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.310
And the sunrise looks really 
beautiful from there.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.050
Really?

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.060
I'll take you there with my 
spatial magic sometime.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.470
Want to go camping with me?

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.190
I think I might like that.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.690
Hey, want another drink? Excuse me,
could we get another drink?

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.450
He's a bit gaudy and not really my type,
but he's the best out of the three.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.490
He seems like a noble, and spatial magic
would be really handy.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.950
Plus, he's considerate and kind.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.660
Say, want to step out to the patio?

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.330
I guess I wouldn't mind.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.580
I wasn't sure how things 
would go for a second,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.220
but I think things might just work out!

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.850
This is so awkward.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.900
Why does this lady keep 
looking away and down?

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.230
Is she mad? Did I do 
something to make her mad?

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.530
Not good. I need to liven things up.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.980
I'm not really sure how, 
but I have to liven things up!

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.860
Right! It's my turn!

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:09.800
Um...

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.050
What's your favorite food?

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.860
I love tatoes.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.300
You don't have to force yourself 
to make small talk. This is dumb.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.530
Erika told me that I should 
find a good guy for the sake

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.200
of my siblings, so I came along.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.800
But this isn't the real me, and I'm 
too worried about my siblings at home.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.180
So you live with your siblings?

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.540
I have three younger brothers 
and two younger sisters.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.850
Really? That's nice.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:45.050
Oh, I have five siblings, too,
though we're not related by blood.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.610
I'm not with them right now,
but they're all a bunch of little brats.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.940
They annoyed me sometimes, 
but we had so much fun.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.220
We used to all sleep in the same bed.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.550
Now that I'm in the Magic Knights, I get 
my own room, so it's a little easier,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.460
but not having those fidgety little brats 
sleeping next to me gets a bit lonely, too.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.490
Yeah! They can be a pain, but it 
gets lonely when they're not around!

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.910
Exactly! And you can act like a 
dork in front of your friends,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.220
but you always want to impress your siblings!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.160
I totally get that!

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.610
Hey! They're actually having fun?!

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.540
Wh-What the heck's going on?

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.980
H-Hey! What do you think you're doing?

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.130
You just asked for a job out 
of the blue, so I hired you,

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.650
but then you blew away some customers! 
Who do you think you are?

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.620
Silence, insect.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.940
What?!

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.990
Come to think of it, you seem 
like a big sister, Rebecca.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.990
You definitely don't seem 
like the oldest, though.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.460
I have one brother who's the 
same age as me named Yuno...

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.420
Well, well...

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:50.500
You look like you're having fun,
o great Magic Knight.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.350
Aren't you a little small to be one?

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.080
Are you really a Magic Knight?

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.770
If a little twerp like you got in,
I could probably get in, too.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.500
Yeah, I'm surprised I made it in, too.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.210
And being out with a flashy little 
thing like this? I sure envy you.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.250
Bet you're desperate to catch yourself 
a Magic Knight, aren't ya, missy?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.730
Pretty sure I've seen you somewhere before.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.120
Oh, you're the girl who works 
at the local restaurant,

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.120
always carrying a kid on your back and
working until you're drenched in sweat.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.820
Are all those brats yours? That must 
mean your man walked out on you.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.510
No! That was my brother!

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.580
Well, then, of course you'd like 
to get yourself a Magic Knight

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.720
and enjoy the easy life.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.430
If you want a man that much,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.930
come hang out with me.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.770
Hey! Let go of me!

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.480
I don't know what your deal is, mister, 
but don't judge people by their appearances!

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.490
You don't know anything about her, do you?

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.930
Ooh, scary!

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:07.250
What kind of amazing magic are you 
gonna show me, widdle Magic Knight?

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.710
I can't use magic.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.530
What? A Magic Knight that can't use magic?

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.690
What kind of lousy joke is that?

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.710
But...

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.540
Hup!

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.530
Okay, time to go home.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.130
That was a waste of time.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.610
Let's get more drinks somewhere else.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.230
H-Hey, sir!

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.800
Let's get out of here!

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.860
H-Huh?

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.340
Hey!

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.130
Hey, boss! I quit!

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.740
What?! Hey!

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.150
Thanks, Asta. I feel so much better!

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.390
Nah. Sorry for ruining the mixer.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.020
It's fine.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.430
He's a bit short, but he's actually...

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:24.280
Hey, Asta... D-Do you have 
anyone that you like?

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.780
Yup! There's somebody 
I've got my heart set on!

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.330
What?!

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.050
I see.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.860
I'm sure she's a wonderful person.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.220
She is! We're from the same—

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.330
I wish you both the best.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.670
Thanks!

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.180
Hey, come by my restaurant sometime.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.700
You can play with my siblings.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.020
I will!

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.230
"Same"?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:53.510
The same squad?! Then... could... 
could that mean... mean m-m-m-me...

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.940
No! No, no, no! And what if it is?!

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.230
It's not like I th-think... anything... anything of...

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.530
Sister, we spent so many 
years together in Hage.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.500
One day, I'll become the 
Wizard King and come for you!

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.870
Please marry me then!

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.740
Just because I'm supporting him 
doesn't mean I'm going to give up.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.540
By the way, what's the 
point of a mixer, anyway?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.840
What?!

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.380
What?!

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:29.460
Apparently he threw some drunkard to 
the ground. Black Bulls are so violent!

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.930
Right? Let's go home!

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.300
She shot me down...

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.360
Petit Clover

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.810
Petit Clover!

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.870
If Gordon, Grey, and Sekke
Went to a Mixer Together

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.870
If Gordon, Grey, and Sekke 
Went to a Mixer Together.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.870
Bah-ha! Bah-ha! Bah-ha-ha-haha!

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.550
I'm Helene.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.870
I'm Erika.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.140
I'm Gordon.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.960
I'm so happy to be at a mixer 
with people as cute as you two.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.130
Will you be my friend? You will? Thanks!

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.130
Bah-ha!

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.380
Could we exchange contact info? 
I'll write you a letter.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.380
Bah-ha-ha!

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.390
Bah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.290
I want to go home.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.940
I'm going to become the Wizard King!

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.520
I'm not going to lose to anyone!

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.730
I'll prove that even peasants 
can move up the ranks!
