WEBVTT

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.050
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.550
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.610
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.280
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.910
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.770
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.610
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.380
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.780
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.920
In preparation for the upcoming 
battle with the Spade Kingdom,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.650
Asta and the others train 
diligently in the Heart Kingdom.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.370
With their training period halfway over,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.250
Noelle and the others learned the 
Mana Method and were growing steadily.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.920
Since Asta had no magic, 
he fought with Gaja in order

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.290
to obtain hints toward a new technique.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.310
Back in the Clover Kingdom, Yami finally 
learned the trick to using Mana Zone.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.420
And now...

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.670
Gaja!

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.590
I'm back!

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.170
It appears that you've grown yet 
again in these past few days.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.600
Yup!

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.130
Yesterday, I sparred with 
the Wind Spirit Guardian

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.610
and trained my ki to be able to 
read ambiguous attacks better.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.090
Today, I fought with the Earth Spirit 
Guardian who has keen senses

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.610
to polish my own fighting instincts like "bam!"

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.870
Aren't you training with Luck today?

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.620
He said he wanted to train with other 
Spirit Guardians, so he is elsewhere.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.640
Perfect timing, then!

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.870
I'd like to spar with you 
right now, if that's okay!

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.200
Of course, that's perfectly fine.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.230
But before we start, may I ask you something?

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.240
Since you have no magic at all,
your existence is quite abnormal,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.890
even among those at the arcane stage.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.720
I am constantly astounded by your growth.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.230
In order to further increase your strength 
in the future, may I ask you...

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.730
about your life up until this point,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.510
and about the devil that resides 
within your grimoire?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.480
About me... and the devil?

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.240
Five-Leaf Clover

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.150
According to Father,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.750
me and my childhood friend
Yuno were taken in

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.790
on the same day at a church in Hage Village, 
on the outskirts of the Clover Kingdom.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.980
Time passed, and...

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.390
Sister Lily!

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.850
Marry me!

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.230
I was living with my 
beloved Sister Lily, Yuno,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.230
and everyone else back at the church.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.360
But I couldn't use a lick of magic.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.230
Meanwhile, Yuno was a super-handsome genius.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.530
I'll get a grimoire that's more 
amazing than anyone else's,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.250
get into the Magic Knights,
follow in your footsteps,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.980
and become the Wizard King!

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.330
And in March, those turning fifteen 
were gathered from all over the kingdom

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.850
to receive their grimoires.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.850
But...

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.980
Um...

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.530
My grimoire's not coming.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.240
Er...

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.780
Try again next year.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.830
What?!

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.510
What the heck?!

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.120
That's actually amazing!

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.670
Yuno ended up getting a four-leaf grimoire, 
just like the first Wizard King.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.670
I thought that once I got my grimoire,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.680
I'd be able to use magic, but...

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.180
I never thought I wouldn't even get one.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.190
But... like hell I'm gonna give up!

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.790
Don't you dare underestimate me, fate!

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.610
I'll show you!

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.770
Even if it takes one, two, 
ten, or a hundred years!

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.910
I'll keep working hard 
until I get my grimoire!

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.850
But then this thieving jerk who wanted to

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.150
sell the four-leaf grimoire 
for money attacked Yuno.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.140
Hey, that pendant looks like 
it's worth something, too.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.070
I guess I'll be taking that...

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.270
Hold it!

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.310
I tried to get back Yuno's grimoire, but my
 training just wasn't enough against the thief.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.860
And of course, I was born with no magic.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.410
I found out that no matter how hard 
I tried, I still couldn't use magic.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.040
You can't do a thing in this world. 
Just give up on everything.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.960
You were born a loser!

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.200
He's right.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.630
No matter how hard I try, 
some things just can't be helped.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.610
I'm just going to give...

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.620
Hey!

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.180
Who are you calling a loser?

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.270
Asta, it's true that you won't be 
able to become the Wizard King,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.790
no matter what.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.730
You hear that? Even your little friend 
is telling you it's impossible.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.880
That's because I'm going 
to become the Wizard King!

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.570
What?

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.530
He's no loser.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.450
He's...

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.210
Asta's my rival!

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.700
Huh?

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.530
Him? Your rival?

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.000
This brat who has no 
magical power whatsoever?

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.130
Not... Not yet.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.260
Sorry you had to see me 
looking that pathetic, Yuno.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.890
Just a sec...

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.850
I'm gonna kick this guy's butt!

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.640
And that was when

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.860
the five-leaf grimoire, which was said

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.120
to have a devil residing within it,
 appeared before me.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.440
Back then, I didn't know anything about 
the devil's powers or anti-magic.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.830
I just frantically brandished my sword.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.390
That's what happened when 
I first got this grimoire.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.050
After that, Yuno and I went to

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.980
the royal capital to take the 
Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.980
Yuno ended up joining the most popular 
and powerful squad, the Golden Dawn.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.940
I was about to be disqualified 
since I had no magic, but then,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.990
Captain Yami from the Black Bulls took me in.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.090
If I remember correctly,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.120
that captain is another Magic Knight 
who uses a sword, just like yourself.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.790
Yeah! He takes forever to poop, 
but he's super reliable when we need him!

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.160
He's super strong and showed 
me how to use my ki.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.130
Anyway, he's someone I super-duper respect!

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.550
The rest of the Black Bulls also 
acknowledged me as a part of the squad.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.670
Once I officially became a squad member, 
I went on a mission to explore a dungeon

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.400
and ended up getting my second sword,
 the Demon-Dweller Sword.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.920
During that mission,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.370
we faced off with one of the Diamond 
Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals, Mars,

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.990
an insanely strong guy who
used two magical attributes.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.490
And that was when we 
coincidentally found out...

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.970
I don't have any magic,

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.370
but I've got...

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.950
my friends!

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.660
I borrowed mana from Noelle and released 
it using the Demon-Dweller Sword,

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.440
and was able to break 
through Mars's tough armor.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.400
After that, when we reported 
back about the mission,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.510
we met the Wizard King.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.240
"Gain merit. You can't 
protect anyone with pride,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.100
and trust will come after merit."

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.180
With the Wizard King's words in my heart,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.700
I kept fighting to protect everyone!

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.850
But then we ran into him...

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.950
I guess I haven't introduced myself yet.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.990
I am the leader of the Eye 
of the Midnight Sun...

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.250
Licht.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.890
His light magic was way too fast.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.510
I couldn't react or even track it with my eyes.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.350
But then Captain Yami arrived,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.790
and he faced him head-on. 
The lightning-fast light magic

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.060
didn't bother him at all.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.060
Of course, I already knew 
he was super strong,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.510
but I got to see how powerful 
he was again firsthand.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.980
Hey, brat. Were you watching that?

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.280
Y-Yes, sir!

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.700
Good. Now try the same thing.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.760
Yes, sir!

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.120
Wait... Like I could actually do that!

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.910
Of course I can't!

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.530
Oh? Who do you think you're talking to?

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.370
Huh?

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.990
I told you to do it, so do it.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.180
Ow, ow, ow, that really hurts! Ow, ow, ow!

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.180
That'll make you a bigger man.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.760
Captain Yami said he could react to the attacks 
because he could sense something called "ki."

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.010
People looking at you,
the sound of their breathing,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:14.770
Ki

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.260
their smell, the motions of their muscles,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.900
the vague sense that they're there...

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.770
Ki is the blanket term for all of 
the different types of life energy

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.770
the human body emits.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.490
I read that ki and predicted 
his next move, then made mine.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.660
You've done that before, haven't you?

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.220
Come to think of it...

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.640
The lesson was so intense that 
I could've died doing it,

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.910
but because of that, I learned to sense ki!

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.220
I see.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.490
This "ki" is the best fighting technique 
you could use, since you cannot use magic.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.970
Perhaps he anticipated that it could 
be useful to you as you continue

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.180
to use your anti-magic.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.950
Actually, now that you mention it...

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.330
Holy crap! That's super 
likely with Captain Yami!

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.940
Though I may simply be 
overthinking the matter.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.270
Way to go, Captain Yami!

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.880
By the way, I would like 
to ask another question.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.750
How are you able to put yourself in the 
state in which you bring out the power

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.830
of the devil that is possessing you?

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.080
Oh, that...

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.540
The first time I took on that form was

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.250
when we went to visit the Queen 
of Witches in the Witches' Forest.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.500
I fought that Diamond Kingdom 
guy with the annoying smirk

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.170
when he attacked the forest.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.350
Never giving up...

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.600
is my magic!

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.910
Damn it!

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.430
Why?!

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.780
My magic's supposed to be invincible now!

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:59.190
Back then, I wasn't even 
sure what happened myself.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.350
Shit!

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.170
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! <i>Shit</i>!

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.160
Why?!

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.680
I got this far by kicking everyone else down!

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.930
Why are you...

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.120
You might've kicked people down,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.700
but everyone that helped boost me up

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.910
makes me strong!

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.780
Black Meteorite!

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.580
The first time I was able to 
willfully take that form was

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.260
when we went to the Yultim Volcano in 
a strong magic region for a training camp.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.090
Since I couldn't use Mana Skin, 
a technique to envelop

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.050
your body with mana to protect yourself,

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.320
I couldn't move a step further 
due to the intense heat.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.640
But then I realized that

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.100
if I used the ki technique
 I learned from Captain Yami,

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.030
I could amplify the anti-magic within me

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.710
and possibly pull off an 
effect like Mana Skin.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:10.040
And that was also a way for me 
to get into that state at will.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.940
Thank you so much, Captain Yami!

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.710
I don't know what I would've done if 
you'd never taught me how to use ki!

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.930
My third sword, the Demon-Destroyer Sword,
 is a bit of a wild one,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.970
but the reason I was able to use it 
immediately is because of my ki!

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:33.090
I hear that sword can nullify 
not only magic itself,

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.290
but the effects of a spell, as well.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.980
Yup!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.980
I got my hands on the Demon-Destroyer Sword

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.630
around the time we infiltrated

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.370
the Eye of the Midnight Sun's base
 before our final battle with them!

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.950
But suddenly, that Disloyal guy 
as well as some of our friends

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.700
reincarnated as elves and attacked us.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.500
And then we ended up fighting

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.800
the leader of the elves in 
the center of their base.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.710
This ki...

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.000
There's incredible magic 
coming from that sword.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.100
Oh, crap... My black form
 is reaching its limit.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.300
Please... Just last a little longer.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.740
Asta, be careful.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.260
Yeah, I know!

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.900
Asta!

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.410
The leader of the elves was the 
original owner of my swords,

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.640
so he was able to use them 
to their full capacity.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.750
And above all, he was insanely strong. But...

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.000
Not yet!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.770
Yuno is my...

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.300
Asta is my...

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.610
...rival!

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.850
We couldn't win,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:03.240
but next thing I knew, the Demon-Destroyer 
Sword I took was inside my grimoire.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.400
Because of this, I was able

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.030
to nullify the poison magic that was 
used on the people of Hage Village

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.950
and return everyone who had reincarnated 
into elves back to normal.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.740
After that, in the Shadow Palace,

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.590
the memories that the Demon-Destroyer 
had absorbed flooded into me.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.930
That's when I learned

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.560
why the elves and humans started 
hating each other so long ago.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.420
And the one who had reincarnated the 
elves and caused all this fighting was...

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.340
that devil.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.320
Word Soul Magic...

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.450
"Voizuiinemidoren..."

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.600
His goal was to leave the other world 
where all the other devils were

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.540
and appear in this world 
in his complete form.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.660
I couldn't let that bastard have his way.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.320
If Yuno could evolve, then so could I!

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:00.540
Anti-Magic Demon-Slayer Sword:
 Black Divider!

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.380
Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash ~ Equinox!

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.430
Nero used her Sealing Magic
 to seal the damage I took.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.350
Asta...

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.140
You're going to be...

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.760
You're going to be the Wizard King, right?

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.170
Yeah!

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.530
Right here, right now...

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.500
I'll surpass my limits!

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.550
And, well, you know the rest.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.150
I was put on trial for being devil-possessed,

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.360
and since I was released without indictment,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.970
I came to the Heart Kingdom

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.550
to find clues to prove that I'm innocent.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.310
And that's where I found out 
that Queen Loropechika

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.310
had also been cursed by a devil.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.760
I'm going to get even stronger!

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.450
So that I can protect everyone 
in the Clover Kingdom,

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.450
and everyone in the Heart Kingdom, too!

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.750
I am glad I was able to hear your tale.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.390
I think I may understand why you 
were able to become so powerful,

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.220
even though you have no mana.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.110
Now, let us begin.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.970
The sun will go down soon,

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.100
but I will train with you 
until you are satisfied today.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.210
Right!

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.380
Wow, that was amazing, Noelle!

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.390
Not bad. You've definitely 
improved since you first arrived.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.810
Hmph. O-Of course I have.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.720
I'm royalty, you know.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.390
Squee! Yay! I got praised!

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.650
But you're truly amazing, 
Water Spirit Undine.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.880
You just keep drawing out more 
and more of my water magic.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.610
You're not the only one growing, you know.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.120
Please take a look at this.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.280
It's not just you or Nero.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.480
Asta and the others are also

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.000
growing every day much faster 
than we ever could've imagined.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.120
But still, this is nowhere near enough

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.880
to defeat the devil from the Spade Kingdom.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.140
Right?

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.870
Yes. You are exactly right.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.390
But I believe in all of you.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.310
All of you who are training 
so diligently here,

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:17.380
and everyone back at the Clover 
Kingdom getting ready for battle...

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.030
If we all work together,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.540
I'm sure we will see a ray of hope 
in our fight against the devil

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.160
within the Spade Kingdom.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.910
No, I'm sure we'll win!

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.950
And I'll avenge my mother, too!

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.390
The same trick will not work again.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:01.960
That technique is only good enough to land 
a surprise attack on the enemy right now.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.590
I believe our session has come to an end.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.950
Lightning Magic: Tenjiolia.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:10.620
Not yet!

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:18.750
The three leaves of the clover
 represent faith, hope, and love.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.630
Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.390
Within a fifth leaf...

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.560
resides a devil.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.020
But my swords...

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.650
What's going...

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.530
You continue to surprise me.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.380
In order to see the extent 
of your hidden powers,

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.000
I will attack you with everything I have.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.660
Bring it on!

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.660
Well, things are getting interesting now.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.940
Our training's finished, and it's finally 
time to fight the Spade Kingdom.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.780
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 158: 
"The Beginning of Hope and Despair."

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 158
The Beginning of Hope and Despair

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.440
I'm going to protect everyone 
in the Clover Kingdom,

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.590
and everyone in the Heart Kingdom, too!
