00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.200
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.510
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.390
The forces of the Eye of the Midnight 
Sun attacked the Witches' Forest.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.930
They were after the magic stone 
that lies in the forest.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.040
At the same time, the forces of the Diamond 
Kingdom also attacked the Witches' Forest.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.530
They wanted to take advantage of the chaos

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.610
and steal the Queen of Witches' secret.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.120
Fanzell, a former officer in 
the Diamond Kingdom's army,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.120
ended up facing two of his 
former students, Mars and Ladros.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.000
Million Lasers!

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.210
Don't... You should be using your 
powers to do the right thing...

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.250
Getting to use your power to the max in 
combat... What could be better than that?

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.430
You see, I want to be acknowledged. 
By this country! By this world!

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.690
Guess I'll just have to kill this chick first!

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.320
Don't!

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.780
My powers... exist to protect others.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.540
Your lessons got through to me.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.470
Mars managed to turn the 
tables at the last moment.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.130
Fanzell was troubled because

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.730
he thought there was no way to defeat 
Ladros's absorption and emission power,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.420
but he and Mars came up with a plan.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.930
What are you gossiping about over there?

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.850
No matter what plan you come up with,
it'll be useless against my power!

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.320
I'm not half bad at 
reinforcement magic myself.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.520
Have a nice trip!

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.740
The Promised World

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.340
We have you completely surrounded!

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.200
So just give up already!

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.290
If you do something stupid, your parents 
and friends back home will be sad!

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.840
You filthy humans... Don't you
 dare speak of my friends!

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.760
She still has that much magic left?!

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.680
Oh, damn it!

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.050
Those flames...

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.400
There! They're right over there!

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.900
This overwhelming amount of magic...

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.900
It's Salamander!

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.700
This magic...

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.910
In that situation, Asta's not going 
to have any time to deal with Ladros!

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.460
No, wait a sec...

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.420
Come on, Teach! Mars! Wait up!

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.830
A little reinforcement magic 
won't help you win against me!

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.050
And you'll never win if 
you keep running away!

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.890
Here you go! Million Lasers!

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.310
Asta!

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.810
Old Man Zell!

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.980
Wait, you're with the pale guy?!

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.070
Asta!

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.870
Deflect it over here!

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.040
I don't know what's going on, but okay!

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.420
I'll get us out of the way using the wind

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.920
and aim the fire right at...

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.130
Hey... This is way too big!

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.780
Did it work?

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.140
Ladros's magical powers disappeared.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.970
Hey! Old Man Zell!

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.730
What the heck's going on here?!
Something just fell!

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.610
Well done, Asta.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.340
I see you've grown even stronger.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.330
Aw, shucks. It's nothing.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.280
No, wait! Why are you with the pale guy?!

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.420
He's an enemy!

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.550
Asta, was it?

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.100
I am not your enemy. Trust me.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.060
How am I supposed to believe a 
guy with an evil face like yours?!

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.200
And my name is Mars, you shrimp.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.060
Wait, your mouth's nasty now, too!

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.020
I'll explain everything later.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.820
Huh?

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.070
For now, I'd like you to trust Mars.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.830
Well, if you say so.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.670
Thanks. Now, then...

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.090
I think Ladros has been taken 
care of for now, thanks to Asta.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.130
So we need to do something 
about this monster.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.800
So that's the fire spirit Salamander 
that I've heard so much about.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.550
It appears to be weakened, but it 
still has tremendous magical powers.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.060
But those flames... They're the same as mine?

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.190
And this magic itself feels like...

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.770
Fa...na...

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.800
We have no family... 
so we have no other choice...

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.930
But...

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.220
Mars, is the training painful?

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.280
N-No, it's not.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.940
When things get rough,
remember the faces of those you love.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:51.460
We were born to protect the people 
of this kingdom that we love so much.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.030
The faces of those you love...

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.710
The face that popped into my 
head immediately... was yours,

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.540
Fana.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.790
Once we become strong enough
 to protect this kingdom,

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.380
we'll be allowed to go outside.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.710
You'll probably make it out first, Mars.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.590
Lucky.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.190
I mean, you're the strongest 
out of all of us, Mars.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.600
I'll be waiting for you when that happens.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.720
Huh?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.450
Until you get out, too, Fana.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.730
Sure! Let's go see the 
outside world together.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.660
This is your final test.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.120
Kill each other.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.080
The sole survivor will be allowed to go 
outside as our kingdom's mage warrior.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.110
If you refuse, you'll all be disposed of.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.690
I'm sorry, Mars.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.960
Fana...

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.440
I have no other choice.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.310
Please die.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.280
Why...

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.010
Why?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.410
My wounds...

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.660
If I didn't do that, you wouldn't have...

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.160
tried to kill me...

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.450
Make sure you go see the world outside.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.730
For me... as well.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.900
Fana!

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.810
I thought I killed her with my own hands...

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.310
But Fana's alive?!

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.440
Fana!

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.960
Hey!

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.610
It's me! It's me!

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.530
Don't you recognize me?

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.240
H-H-Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.580
You're going to die, die, die!

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.120
Were you always like this?!

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.020
Fana!

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:45.950
You know each other?!

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.580
Fana! Fana!

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.580
He—

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.750
Fana!

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.250
Fana?

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.050
My student Fana?

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:05.390
After I left, I heard she died in 
Morris's human experiments.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.890
Fana!

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.770
I don't know you!

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.610
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.550
It really is Fana...

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.390
But is that transformation magic?

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.120
No... there'd be no point in that.
 Or there shouldn't be.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.920
That eye is emitting a strange power...

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.620
Is it someone's spell?

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.150
Is the Eye of the Midnight Sun 
controlling Fana with that eye?

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.830
What... is this? My head is...

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.640
Fana!

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.060
Why do all of you insist 
on getting in my way?

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.150
I hate you!

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.860
That's...

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.570
Gah! More self-destruct magic?!

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:06.150
I'm taking you all down with me... No...

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.200
I'll blow this whole temple to smithereens!

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.620
Self-destruct?

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.530
What's wrong with those people?!

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.070
Do they all come with that option installed?!

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.880
This isn't good! In a few minutes,
this whole area's going to be blown away!

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.880
Everything should just... disappear.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.890
Everything should just... disappear.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.440
Sea Dragon's Lair!

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.870
Mars, no!

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.170
What the hell are you doing?!

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.040
Block it with your magic!

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.810
Master, I have no right to block it!

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.430
I killed Fana! I can't—

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.730
This is seriously not the time for that!

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.640
Are you stupid?! Do you wanna die?!

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.860
I don't know the details, 
but do you really know her?

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.520
She's a leader in a terrorist group 
called the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.090
Are you sure she's not just similar-looking?

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.400
Dude, she's got three eyes!

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.070
I would never mistake Fana!

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.660
She's my precious childhood friend!

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.330
Is that right?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.170
Then...

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.890
If she's so important to you,
now's really no time for you to be dying!

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.070
Live and save her for real!

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.180
You're right. I'm sorry.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.930
Were you always this up-front?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.440
Not only does Asta yell at me,
but now he's yelling at you, his senior.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.190
It's all right, Mars.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.940
You'll be able to save her!

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:09.530
Neither Finral's spatial magic nor my 
thread magic work against those flames.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.040
And if we agitate it with Noelle's water 
magic, it might explode immediately!

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.290
I knew it. Only Asta's 
anti-magic sword can stop it!

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.040
All right, let's do this!

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.800
Asta!

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.090
When we fought the hairy gorilla...

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.540
It's no use...

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.800
You humans shall taste despair... Despair!

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.100
My power couldn't stop him, but...

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.230
Back then, I ended up killing her, but...

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.490
This time...

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.490
...I'm not...

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.490
...letting anyone die!

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.540
Stay away from me!

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.530
Mineral Creation Magic: Laevateinn!

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.560
They're both amazing!

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.890
High-powered flame magic even 
at that range isn't fazing them!

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.130
Still, they have only a few minutes left.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.390
Will they make it in time?

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.990
I'll charge in until she's in my sword's 
range and dispel that self-destruct spell!

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.390
This heat is insane!

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.040
If we go any further, 
we'll end up as charcoal!

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.910
Asta?

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.790
No, that's...

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.040
You...

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.840
Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.090
You good to go?

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.150
Heck, yeah!

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.580
So long as I don't turn into charcoal, 
I can go as far as you want me to!

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.610
This guy's amazing.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.360
After I fought him in the dungeon, I battled 
against many other skilled fighters,

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.050
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.660
but I've never met anyone 
who's this bad at giving up.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.870
And... he's also strange.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.020
Even now, he's still not sure whether I'm friend or foe, but he's still talking to me

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.490
and trying to help.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.380
I've fought many of the Magic Knights,

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.380
but no one has tried as hard to 
protect and help people as he does.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.390
He embodies the title in the 
truest sense of the term.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.290
He is...

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.140
a real knight!

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.150
Hey, are you all right?

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.230
I'm fine!

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.900
This pain can't even begin 
to compare to Fana's!

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.230
This guy's completely different 
from when I first fought him.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.910
He was like a killer doll back then.
I didn't know he had such warm feelings.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.740
Enormous, polished power,

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.420
and an unbreakable determination 
to save someone...

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.920
Right now, he's indestructible!

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.510
It's going to blow any second now!

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.690
You guys should evacuate!

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.790
They believe in their friend 
and refuse to move.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.450
I'll believe in those two as well,
 and see this through.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.900
Go forth, my students.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.450
You can do this!

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.110
Just...

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.460
...a little more.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.840
Fana!

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.100
It's all over.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.770
No... Not yet!

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.030
I won't let it end!

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.580
H-He did it!

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.080
Ack! Hot, hot, hot! Hot, hot, hot!

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.460
It's gone.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.970
It is not gone.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.800
Our hatred will never go away!

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.600
Not—

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.110
Fana, it's me! It's me!

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.170
I'm really, truly sorry!

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.360
Back then, I didn't have the 
strength to fight alongside you!

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.130
Please forgive me!

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.870
You're a girl, Fana. You shouldn't 
push yourself too hard.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.350
I'll be waiting for you when that happens.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.130
Until you get out, too, Fana.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.250
Why... Why?!

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.060
Only that human knows where we live!

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.600
He... He must've betrayed us!

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.510
We've met in the outside world,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.360
but nothing's started yet!

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.360
Let's...

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.820
Let's go see the 
outside world together.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.020
Let's go see the world together!

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.880
Okay.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.360
It's a promise, Mars.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.850
Yeah, Fana.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.580
Mars?

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.830
Oh, goodness.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.590
What a relief.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.890
I'm so jealous!

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.410
Petit Clover

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.210
Petit Clover!

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.920
Leave It to Mars

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.680
Leave It to Mars.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.170
Hey, Mars. Tell me what happened after 
you defeated me all those years ago.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.960
Ow!

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:50.280
I'm sorry I defeated you.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.430
Ahem...

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.760
Ta-da! Look at this grimoire!

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.770
Wait, is half of this mine?

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.490
Yes! It's a grimoire with your powers in it!

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.310
I can feel you all the time!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.570
Wow... That's a little scary.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.000
Ow!

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.320
Th-The mage scholar Morris made this!

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.440
I was brainwashed by Morris.
They modified my body,

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.680
and I fought as I was commanded.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.830
But then I regained my memories 
after fighting Asta.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.410
And ever since, Fana,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:27.220
I've been saving lives in secret between 
missions as my way of atoning to you!

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.170
I'm a good boy, right?

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.470
Yes, you're a very good boy.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.890
You may have defeated me,
 but you're a good boy.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.490
Ow!

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.730
I'm so jealous... No, envious!

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.410
No, no. I'm older here, so I 
have to act like I don't care.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.710
I <i>am</i> older than Mars, right?

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.310
Congratulations, Mars and Fana.
I wish you happiness.
