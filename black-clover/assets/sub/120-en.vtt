WEBVTT

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.940
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demon.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.370
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.790
His name was Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.800
He would eventually be called the first 
Wizard King, and he became a legend.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.800
Asta, I'm gonna leave you 
behind if you can't keep up!

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.250
Where do you think you're going, Yuno?!

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.360
You're just a human.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.810
Yet you're using spirit power

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.010
and elven powers...

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.400
To fight my magic...

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.490
Mana Zone...

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.700
Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash ~ Equinox!

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.700
Equinox

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.760
Dark magic can interfere with the other world!

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.020
Right here, right now...

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.020
I'll surpass my limits!

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.730
Dawn

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.530
Impossible...

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.190
Impossible...

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.890
Impossible...

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.640
Impossible...

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:25.800
This can't be...Impossible!

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.540
Inconceivable... I...

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.230
Hey there, chief.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.070
Who...

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.590
Who are you?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.900
Who...

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.560
Like you need to know that.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.960
It doesn't matter how 
strong or amazing you are.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.890
You've lost, and you're about to disappear.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.040
See ya, loser.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.770
We... won...

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.180
Thank you.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.580
The devil's magic... disappeared?

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.420
Did they actually defeat him?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.460
Looks like someone else finished 
him off before I could, but...

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.970
Well done, human.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.720
The name's Yami Sukehiro, 
Prickly Queen 2.0.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.060
The name's Charla, you heathen.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.270
This is...

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.180
The devil's magic hasn't completely disappeared,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.180
and continues to devour this area.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.070
The Shadow Palace is starting to crumble!

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.100
We have to hurry up and get out of here!

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.460
But everyone's still...

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.460
Not good... My body's about to reach its limit.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.220
The light is dimming...

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.220
My body feels all creepy-crawly!

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.730
My connection to Licht is telling me...

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.260
The only way out is on the top floor!

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.030
Hurry!

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.900
We've got no way up there.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.460
Well, this sucks. At this rate...

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.990
That ki...

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.020
Lumiere?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.290
The light is... disappearing...

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.710
La?!

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.550
The light is...

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.720
Guys!

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.160
Asta!

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.070
Noelle! I'm glad you're all okay!

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.190
Why are you clinging to me, Stupidsta?!

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.450
Get off of me!

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.970
What?!

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.080
Both I and the one I believed in 
were nothing but pitiful sinners.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.950
I'm going to atone for my sins.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.010
And this is the first step.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.040
You guys!

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.370
Don't you get the wrong idea.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.630
I've never been wrong.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.420
And you haven't done anything here, either!

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.010
Shut the hell up! I do what I want!

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.510
There's still something that I have to do.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.820
Man, thank goodness there was a 
boneless ham that just happened to pass by.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.530
Even if you go invisible with your magic,
 your ki makes you totally obvious.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.030
Don't even think you can 
get away, you ham bastard.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.900
Captain Yami! And the Captain 
of the Blue Rose Knights!

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.330
And...

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.050
The former Captain of the Purple Orcas?!

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.910
How dare you treat me like
this when I've been weakened?

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.910
And you're... that bastard that stole 
my grimoire, like, who knows when?!

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:30.720
The name's Revchi.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.400
What the heck are you two doing here?!

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.100
What are you doing here
when you have no magic?!

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.270
Wow... So many humans with so 
many different kinds of magic!

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.790
Looks like the Clover
Kingdom is in good hands.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.010
Anyway, we gotta get the heck outta here!

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.130
La! Yuno! I'm never letting 
you go ever again!

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.300
Uh, get your mitts off of 
him right now, Domehead!

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.590
Huh? I guess you returned 
to normal, Miz Charmy.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.420
You turned into this tall, 
slim, older-looking lady.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.170
Not to mention, you were super awesome!

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.970
La? What are you talking about?

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.670
I'm always the sexy older girl.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.890
What?

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.250
Huh? Was that a dream?

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.680
Or rather, what's Charmy doing here anyway?

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.440
I'll appear anywhere there's 
delicious noms and Yuno!

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.440
Hey, woman! Let me slash you later!

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.610
What the heck is wrong with 
this guy? He's creepy!

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.570
You two... It's a bit early for idle chatter.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.500
It's not like everything is over.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.580
We have to stop all the elves 
destroying the kingdom.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.340
They're still being taken 
over by their hatred,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.590
and fighting without souls.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.760
How in the world are we going 
to deal with that many of them?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.260
Let's just knock them all out.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.220
Yeah, she's more dangerous 
than all of us put together.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.310
Damn it!

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.820
I'm not gonna be able to get 
to everyone with just one sword.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.610
Not to mention, I can't use my 
powers that much right now.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.070
With Licht here, there's a way.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.420
With the world tree magic 
that belongs to William,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.150
who's currently asleep inside of me,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.790
we can gather the magic and life force 
from people all over the kingdom.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.500
But for that, we'll need his grimoire.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.670
Take this.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.090
That's William's... Thank you, Valtos.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.110
It doesn't matter who you are.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.100
You're still the one who saved me that day.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.080
Wait, are you saying...

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.230
Yes. Asta, use your Demon-Destroyer Sword
 to undo my reincarnation.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.480
You sure about this?

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.320
This has always been my second life.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.870
I may have some regrets, but no fear.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.740
If I'm just going to disappear after this,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.580
I almost think that's not enough for atonement.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:08.950
Patry...

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.590
I'm gonna head out first.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.340
I'm sorry, Licht. You'll have 
to take care of the rest.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.010
I will.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.160
In the end, I got to fight alongside 
Licht and everyone else.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.420
That made me really happy.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.880
Captain Vangeance...

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.610
Patry...

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.140
The lonely soul that has been 
with me ever since I was little.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.640
It appears that your rage and 
suffering have come to an end.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.040
But it's not over yet.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.390
This time, it's my turn.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.800
This curse that was carved 
upon my face without reason...

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.810
Because of this curse, I'd been 
discriminated against and hated, and so...

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.260
The warped feelings he felt towards 
the kingdom and the suffering he felt

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.390
were undoubtedly real to me.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.010
This battle came about because 
I was weak and could not believe in

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.660
Master Julius or the future 
I should've protected.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.820
That being the case,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.830
I need to be the one who 
brings this battle to an end.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.270
I need to connect to everyone's 
souls and tell them the truth.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.450
We're going to lure the connected 
souls to the world tree

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.950
and tie them all together.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.370
Combo Spell: Demon-Dweller 
Sword Spirit Light Tree.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.380
Anti-magic boy, use the 
Demon-Destroyer Sword on this tree.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.170
The sword's power is reaching 
all of the elves.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.710
That's... The magic of the 
Captain of the Golden Dawn.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.170
How beautiful...

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.900
Did they save the kingdom?

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.990
Figured as much.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.130
Looks like the three of us 
won't be able to go with you.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.540
Our souls are bound to these bodies 
after our second reincarnation,

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.920
so our souls don't belong to 
our original bodies anymore.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.400
I see. That makes things a little lonely.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.180
I wanted to talk to you about this long 
journey filled with pain and hatred.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:59.570
But there might be a good reason for this.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.940
Please continue to live in 
this world for our sakes, too.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.900
Licht...

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.820
See you later.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.890
Guess we're passing each other by again.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.290
Like I have a choice if this 
is your request, Licht.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.580
It'll be a pain, but I'll just have to 
live this life to the fullest, I guess.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.470
I regret not seeing my younger brother again,

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.720
but I had fun fighting 
by your side, Yami Sukehiro.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.180
Well, look at you. Being all nice 
and honest in the end, Charla.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.730
I'm pretty sure I'm not as awkward 
as the owner of this body.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.120
I'm gonna go on ahead, Lumiere.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.880
I've kept Tetia waiting all this time.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.780
Yeah.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.950
I'm glad we got to see a glimpse of the 
ideal future that we'd hoped for.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.040
Yeah.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.750
The one that's in my body...
Is he your...

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.910
Thanks to you, it felt like I 
got to fight alongside my son.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.890
Thank you, the current owner 
of the four-leaf grimoire.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.270
May luck be with you.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.770
This grimoire is yours.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.190
That grimoire belongs to you now.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.780
Please let it accompany you on your journey.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.580
Thank you...

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.990
Mages of the present Clover Kingdom.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.600
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a damn second.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.820
Wraith Magic: Soul Abductor.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.950
I can only use this spell on someone 
who's been with me a long time.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.410
Ironically, you qualify.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.800
The body that contained Licht's 
soul has magic in it again?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.960
But this magic is...

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.230
Patry?!

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.460
Is this... reincarnation?

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.180
No... reanimation?

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:41.230
That body was a copy of yours 
that Sally made, anyway.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.270
I'm sure you'll feel right at home in it.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.060
Hey, what the heck are you doing?!

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.730
Shut up, shut up! I... I...

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.740
I don't really get it either, damn it!

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.030
Anyway, Licht... No, Patry, was it?

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.930
I'm not gonna let you just disappear 
and live happily ever after!

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.170
I'm never gonna forgive you!

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:10.920
You get to keep thinking about all 
those humans you trampled... including me!

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.060
Uh... I'm pretty sure that's gonna
 come back to bite you in the butt.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.220
Shut up!

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.860
Rades... Should I thank you?

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.430
You've given me the opportunity to atone.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.690
Shut up! I'm gonna come for your head!

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.450
I won't let you die easily.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.560
Go on and spend your life trembling in fear!

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.070
Let's go, Valtos!

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.580
For crying out loud...

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.010
So in the end, you didn't even 
get to go back with Licht.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.080
You're such a pain in the ass. 
Talk about just deserts.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.220
Raia...

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.290
To think the day would come where 
I could actually touch you.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:07.980
William...

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.970
My closest friend, who shares my sin.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.940
There was so much that I wanted 
to tell you, and yet...

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.140
More importantly, there's someone 
I need to apologize to right now,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.390
even though he may not forgive me.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.080
I know that this is a 
selfish request. I'm sorry, Yami.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.510
But please take me to Master Julius.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:32.500
Right.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.970
The Wizard King...

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.860
The long battle is finally over.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.050
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Everything's been 
hurting this whole... Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.850
Are you all right, Asta?

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.880
That's what you get for being 
reckless all the time. Deal with it.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.950
I cannot thank all of you enough.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.040
The devil's spell that had been cast 
in my time has finally been lifted.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.780
Ow, ow, ow, ow! When I realized, 
I was just—ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.370
By the power of another devil, oddly enough.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.300
It's been a while since 
the seal has been broken,

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.590
and you're just now feeling the pain?

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.010
That's actually pretty impressive.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.150
Asta, who are these people?

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.200
Is that person made of stone?

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.070
He looks just like the statue 
of the first Wizard King.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.410
Oh, but his eye is...

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.170
Who is he? That's the actual first Wizard King.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.350
What?!

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.850
You were awakened by magic, right?

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.950
I'll be an amazing Wizard King
 just like you someday!

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.200
And you're Nero, right?

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.030
Huh? What are you talking about, 
Asta? How hard did you hit your he—

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.230
I am.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.290
What?!

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.790
You're...

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.210
I always thought you were an amazing bird,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.650
but you can turn into a human now, too?!

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.130
That's freakin' awesome!

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.130
I didn't turn into a human. 
I was a human to begin with.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.590
What?! You should've told me earlier!

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.390
I couldn't even talk until 
the Shadow Palace appeared.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.810
More importantly, how dare you suggest 
that you could be like the prince?

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.440
Hey! Stop doing this really familiar thing!

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.790
The spiteful, adorable Nero is...

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.440
Actually, she's pretty cute, too.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:25.130
To me, "Wizard King" is just a phrase.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:29.070
But thanks to you and your 
childhood friend, I now know

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.530
that our ideals have been carried 
down to this era as well.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.460
Now... I wonder which one of you 
will become the Wizard King.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.380
It's me, sir!

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.700
You and the prince are nothing alike, Asta.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.050
What?!

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.330
I guess it's time.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.310
I don't have the magic to keep 
this body together anymore.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.770
My recovery magic can't help here...

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.110
My prince...

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.300
Secré... Though I guess you might be Nero now.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:08.490
Will you watch their futures and 
ideals play out for me, as well?

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.110
Prince Lumiere! I've always...

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.960
If you're going, I'll go with you!

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.020
I gave everything I had 500 years ago,

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.700
and my life was supposed to end back then.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.340
But thanks to you, I was 
able to protect the future.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.970
That's more than enough.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.930
I don't want you to close 
off your own potential.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.460
I'm looking forward to futures beyond this one.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.310
Both of the Magic Knights, and the 
Clover Kingdom you'll defend.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.140
I was able to meet my own descendants, too.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.360
I couldn't be more satisfied!

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:54.170
I... The fact that I got to 
serve you for all this time...

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.870
made me very happy!

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.130
And I was happy, too.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.540
Five hundred years...

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.990
Thank you so much for waiting 
for me for five hundred years,

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.380
Secré.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.150
What the hell's going on?!

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.460
Julius's body is gone?

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.580
But I know his body was in here.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.290
This magic is...

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.420
Wha—

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.340
What? Don't tell me you're...

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.970
Julius?!

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.810
The long night is finally over.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.560
Look at that beautiful dawn.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.070
It's the new dawn of the Clover Kingdom.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.780
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>,

 Three Problems

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.270
Damn, this old dude's crazy.
