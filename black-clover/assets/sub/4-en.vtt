00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.730
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.600
Asta and Yuno arrived at the royal 
capital of the Clover Kingdom.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.680
Everyone in the kingdom dreams 
of becoming a Magic Knight.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.670
The Magic Knights Entrance Exam
was about to begin.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.460
The Magic Knights Entrance Exam

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.730
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.430
I know, yeah I know

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.650
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.690
I dreamed it all my life

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.480
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.540
Don't care how much I fall

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.010
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.330
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.790
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.880
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.140
Someday I will write the next page

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.640
You are my hope

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.390
Like that page from someday

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.730
I was able to meet you

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.690
I call this a miracle

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.300
The Clover Kingdom

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.080
Castle Town Kikka

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.630
Whoa, this is awesome!

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.470
Awesome!

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.730
They're fresh!

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.220
One sec. It's almost done roasting.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.980
That looks so good!

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.230
Wow! They have so many different 
kinds of staves and items!

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.810
But they're so expensive!

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.940
It's so different from our village.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.870
Is that where the Wizard King is?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.550
And probably the king, too.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.170
So that means that'll be my castle someday.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.920
You mean mine.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.670
Don't worry. I'll let you live there, too.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.210
That's my line.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.860
There, there. Don't cry. Let's hurry 
back and get ready to open up the shop.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.270
Reminds me of everyone back at the church.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.700
I'm sure Sister and the others
are lonely now that I'm gone.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.020
Not a chance.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.290
Hey, Yuno!

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.330
Hey!

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.710
Ah, it's so nice and quiet. 
What a relief to have Asta gone.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.690
Oh, there you go again.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.250
I-I really mean it!

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.950
They've probably reached 
the royal capital by now.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.380
I hope the Magic Knights Exam goes well.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.610
Me, too.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.010
Huh?

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.900
N-Nothing!

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.230
Asta, Yuno...

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.030
Do your best.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.980
So where do they hold the 
Entrance Exam, anyway?

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.370
Probably over there.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.950
What is that?

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.180
Grilled purple snake. It was super cheap.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.810
Anyone want some grilled purple snakes

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.830
that I just happened to 
catch somewhere or other?

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.380
Want some?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.410
No.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.310
It's super nutritious and will 
give you lots of energy!

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.890
Not a chance. Let's go. This way.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.890
Do your best on the exam!

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.170
You are the Clover Kingdom's hope!

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.800
The future of the kingdom is in your hands!

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.680
Stay focused!

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.310
I'll do my best!

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.330
You don't know him... 
You don't know him...

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.300
You're #163. All right, next.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.300
I'm Yuno from Hage Village.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.550
Yuno from Hage...
Could I see your grimoire?

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.390
A f-four-leaf clover...

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.980
So that's who everyone's talking about.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.720
Hey, that grimoire...

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.380
Is it really a four-leaf clover?!

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.810
Wow...

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.820
You're #164. All right, next.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.820
I'm Asta, also from Hage Village!
Here's my grimoire!

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.440
This is pretty filthy.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.080
Is this really a grimoire?

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.860
Huh? Of course it is! Take a good look!

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.830
See? See?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.140
All right, all right...

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.130
You're #165.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.890
Got it!

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.010
All right!

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.030
Bah-ha! He must be a real go-getter if he 
came here all the way from the boonies.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.070
Man, I'm getting really nervous.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.030
Hey, ow! What the heck are these birds?!

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.180
The infamous anti-birds of the exam venue.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.360
Really? These things?

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.450
The weaker your magical powers, 
the more these guys flock to you.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.110
Little pests...

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.210
Hey, look at that guy.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.420
None of the birds are going to him.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.740
Hey! It's the guy from earlier.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.330
From earlier?

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.510
He's from some remote village called Hage,
yet he's got a four-leaf grimoire!

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.550
Wha... A four-leaf? Seriously?

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:05.020
One of us is going to become the Wizard King.
Our legend's beginning now, Yuno!

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.540
Wha...

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.030
Become the Wizard King?

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.530
I'm gonna show you just how much 
I've grown in six months...

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.820
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.370
What the heck are these birds?!

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.580
What's with that kid?

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.780
Talk about a loser!

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.290
That's pretty bad, even for 
someone from the boonies.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.680
Get away from me, you stupid birds!

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.430
They finally flew off somewhere. 
Hey, sorry for bumping into you.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.310
I'll kill you, brat.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.220
What the heck's his problem?!

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.520
Oh, crap. He's got the eyes of a killer.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.230
His neck's so thick! No mage looks like that!

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.020
Talk about an intimidating presence! 
Is he really my age?!

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.020
No, wait, wait... You shouldn't 
judge a book by its cover!

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.780
Be friendly. Just be friendly.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.730
Man, you look old!
You must've had a hard life!

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.430
It appears you're ready to die.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.590
His looks weren't a lie at all!

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.590
Oh, there he is!
What are you doing down here?

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.750
I'm about to end this little twerp's life.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.090
H-Hey... Isn't that...

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.130
Is that the great Finral Roulacase?

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.600
The user of rare spatial magic?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.970
Hey, you're cute.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.570
He's famous for being so girl-crazy
that it gets in the way of his duties!

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.490
And that's... Gordon Agrippa!
The expert on incantation magic!

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.870
I heard that he's impossible 
to talk to... and also scary.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.710
Whoa, cut it out! A Magic Knights Squad 
Captain shouldn't kill an exam candidate.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.070
Why did you even come down here, anyway?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.310
I went to take a dump and got lost.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.470
Squad Captain? You mean he's...

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.340
The Lord of Destruction, Yami Sukehiro?!

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.780
Ten... Nine... Eight...

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.780
What're you counting down to?!

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.380
The end of your life.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.850
Yami?! The Captain of the Black Bulls?

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.030
The Black Bulls...

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.060
The cost they incur in damages exceeds 
the successes they're credited for, right?

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.780
Apparently, there isn't a single 
decent Magic Knight on that squad.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.730
A playboy and a guy who 
can't communicate... I see.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.910
Yeah, I wouldn't want to join that squad.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.180
I picked the wrong guy to mess with!

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.670
My head's seriously going to explode!

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.170
One...

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.770
Come on, the exam is about to start!

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.690
Guess you get to live a little longer, brat.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.600
Better take good care of 
the life you just got back.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.320
Or I'll kill you.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.550
What?!

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.530
Bye!

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.330
I wish the captain would kill me, too.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.960
Man, that sucked.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.830
Bah-ha! You okay?

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.880
Y-Yeah...

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.780
Must've been rough, having Captain Yami
of the Black Bulls in your face like that.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.050
Oh, I'm Sekke. Sekke Bronzazza.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.890
Nice to meet you. Bah-ha!

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.190
I'm Asta! Nice to meet you!

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:52.040
Captain of the Silver Eagles
<font size="30">Nozel Silva</c>

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.260
That's the Captain of the 
Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva!

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.070
That's...

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.340
...one of the captains of 
the Magic Knights Squads.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.590
That's some hairstyle! Isn't it hard 
to see with that thing in his face?

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:09.250
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Fuegoleon Vermillion

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.250
The Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
Fuegoleon Vermillion.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.780
As the name "Crimson" suggests,

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.350
he's a user of flame creation magic.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.400
Whoa...

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.440
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises 
<font size="30">Jack the Ripper</c>

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.440
The Captain of the Green Praying Mantises,
Jack the Ripper.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.580
What's a praying mantis?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.160
You know, a mantis. Like, the bug.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.300
Apparently, Captain Jack's severing 
magic can split the earth in two.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.910
Whoa, that's awesome.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.420
But I don't want to be a mantis.
Bugs are super lame.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:40.670
Captain of the Blue Rose Knights
<font size="30">Charlotte Roselei</c>

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.670
The Captain of the Blue Rose Knights,
Charlotte Roselei.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.660
She's so beautiful.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.850
Yeah, but Sister Lily's prettier.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.850
Captain of the Purple Orcas
<font size="30">Gueldre Poizot</c>

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.850
The Captain of the Purple Orcas,
Gueldre Poizot.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.530
That's all?

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.100
I have no interest in seamy guys like him.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:12:00.280
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
<font size="30">Dorothy Unsworth</c>

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.790
The Captain of the Coral Peacocks,
Dorothy Unsworth.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.280
Is she walking in her sleep?!

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.830
Apparently, all she does is sleep.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.870
Then how'd she become a captain?

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.990
She probably has an amazing power 
you'd never expect her to possess.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:16.170
Captain of the Aqua Deer
<font size="30">Rill Boismortier</c>

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.710
The Captain of the Aqua Deer,
Rill Boismortier.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.170
Isn't he pretty young?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.360
Captain Rill is nineteen, I heard.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.930
Nineteen?! He's only four 
years older than me?

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.820
The path to becoming the Wizard King
might be shorter than I thought!

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.040
Bah-ha! Wizard King, eh? 
That's a pretty big dream.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.020
But for the next Wizard King...

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.900
They say he's the most promising candidate.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.230
The Captain of the most powerful 
Magic Knights Squad, the Golden Dawn,

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:51.290
Captain of the Golden Dawn
William Vangeance

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.450
William Vangeance.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.540
The members of his squad 
have utmost faith in him,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.060
and it's said that in the last battle,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.010
it was Captain William who 
took the enemy general's head.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.040
If only I could get into the Golden Dawn...

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.040
The Silver Eagles would be great, too!

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.770
You idiot. Only royal and noble elites make 
it into the Golden Dawn and Silver Eagles.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.670
Captain of the Black Bulls
Yami Sukehiro

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.650
Pain in the ass... Can't we 
just get this over with?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.600
This is an important exam that will 
decide the futures of these youths.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.240
We need you to take 
this a bit more seriously.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.950
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Serious.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.030
The captains are all gathered in one place.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.790
Wow...

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.570
It is said that each of the Magic Knights

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.630
Captains has the strength 
of a hundred mages.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.720
One of these individuals will 
become the next Wizard King.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.590
Where's the Wizard King?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.010
Bah-ha! The Wizard King wouldn't 
bother coming down to the exam.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.600
It's a miracle in itself that all the 
captains have gathered in one place.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.730
Candidates.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.780
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I will be conducting this exam.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.950
Magic tree, descend!

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.550
That's still amazing.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.940
So this is the man who's 
closest to the Wizard King.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:55.060
We will now begin the Magic 
Knights Entrance Exam.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.740
We will now have you all take several tests.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.920
The nine of us will evaluate 
your performance,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.220
and then we will select the candidates 
that we would like to add to our squads.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.960
If chosen, you will join that squad.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.100
If you're chosen by more than one squad,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.910
you may choose the squad 
you would like to join.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.000
On the other hand, those who 
are not chosen by any captain

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.990
are not qualified to join the Magic Knights.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.950
I'm gonna get into the Magic
Knights, no matter what!

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.580
For the first exam, we will have 
you get on those brooms and fly.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.140
But that's...

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.410
I've never done that before.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.190
Mages who can control their magical powers 
should be able to this instinctively.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.800
It is the most basic way for mages to travel.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.470
If you cannot fly on a broom, 
you shouldn't even be here.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.890
All right, begin.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.420
Just by observing this, we can get a good 
idea of what kind of mages they are.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.240
There are quite a few candidates this year.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.210
For a kid from the boonies, 
he's really amazing.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.620
The genius chosen by the four-leaf...

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.710
What's the meaning of this?

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:36.850
No matter how much one might be lacking
in talent, they should at least float.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.410
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.250
Talk about pathetic.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.640
Guess we're down one rival already.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.230
What is he even doing here?

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.740
Come on, this should be easy.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.530
Loosen up a little bit. Just like this.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.580
That's amazing, damn it!

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.500
Loosen up, all right?

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.530
Hey, you're a decent guy.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.250
I still can't float...

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.510
Okay!

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.590
What are you doing?

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.850
Oh, I'm... um...

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:26.220
I told you. There's no need for royalty 
to take the same exam as the peasants.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.430
But...

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.690
Your destination has already been decided.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.360
Do not take unnecessary action.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.520
Yes, Brother Nozel.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.430
Your existence itself is unnecessary.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:53.300
Magical Ability Exam

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.550
Bah-ha!

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.300
It's okay. Just relax!

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.550
Bah-ha!

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:59.140
Magical Ability Control Exam

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.140
Don't worry about it. Just do your best.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.270
Creation Magic Exam

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.460
Bah-ha!

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.130
I'm not done yet!

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.270
Next, next...

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.070
Developmental Magic Exam

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.920
Bah-ha!

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.070
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.810
All right. The next exam 
shall be the last one.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.450
You will engage in actual combat.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.000
You'll be battling!

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.790
You will pair off and fight with your partner.
You may use your grimoires to attack.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.060
If we lose, it'll severely 
affect our evaluations.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.720
Picking the right opponent will be key.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:44.220
Fighting is our duty.
Show us your true abilities!

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.730
As soon as one of you yields or becomes 
unable to fight, the exam will be over.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.570
There will be mages who can use 
healing magic on standby.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.480
So fight to your heart's content!

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.060
C-Crap! All I've been doing so far is yelling.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.590
I have to stand out by fighting 
someone who looks strong.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.740
Come on... I need to find 
someone to fight me.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.790
Bah-ha! Fight me, Asta.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:15.170
Sekke! You're willing to 
fight a loser like me?

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.180
But of course! Bah-ha!

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.800
You're such a great guy!

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.390
First combatants, come forward.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.130
Yes, sir!

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.470
Bah-ha!

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:34.480
Let's both give it our all and fight fair, 
so we can achieve our goals!

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.240
You don't have to try so hard anymore,

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.370
you filthy little rat that 
wandered into the wrong place.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.100
Thank you for making me 
look even better so far.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.260
I'll get into the Magic Knights and 
do my best for the both of us,

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.580
and have a great time.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.450
Got it, you miserable peasant?

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.170
Hurry back to your village in the boonies

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.980
and continue enjoying your crappy little life.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.220
Bah-ha!

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.050
Sekke chose the weakest-looking guy.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.610
Sekke...

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.150
Begin!

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.430
No holding back, all right?

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.410
Let's do this, Asta! Bah-ha!

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.420
Bronze Creation Magic: 
Sekke Magnum Cannonball!

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.110
How do you like my magic?

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.260
It's bronzified and protects me
as it shoots out magical bullets.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.170
It's offense and defense all in one!

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:48.330
It'll block all of your lame attacks, 
which will show off my defensive powers,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.800
and then I'll finish you off 
once you've worn yourself out.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.160
That's pretty decent for an exam candidate.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.560
Doesn't he look like that spiky bug
from the Mimo Amazon?

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.070
There's no need to hold back.
Come at me! Bah-ha!

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:06.320
Now... Make sure you struggle as much 
as you can to make things exciting!

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.130
Sure thing.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.700
Here I go.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.210
Huh?

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.230
Huh?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.030
Huh?

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:28.030
Huh?

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.080
I'm not joining

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.980
the Magic Knights so I can have a
good time and avoid working hard.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.290
I'm here to work my butt off 
and become the Wizard King!

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:59.540
No one can escape from here

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:06.290
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:14.600
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:20.980
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.480
I've thought many times

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.200
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:35.720
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:42.630
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:49.880
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:56.770
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:01.420
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:20.290
Petit Clover

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.770
Petit Clover!

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.790
Asta
 VS
The Anti-Birds!

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.110
Asta vs. the Anti-Birds.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.580
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.670
Hey! Get away from me! Buzz off!

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.550
Whoa! Hey! What the heck are you guys doing?!

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.140
Unbelievable...

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:38.060
Hey, Yuno! Ow, ow, ow! Help me!

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.770
Oh, crap! I haven't really 
done much up to this point!

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.690
But I'm not done yet! I can still do this!

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.110
I'm going to pass, no matter what!

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.780
