00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.660
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.180
After the Star Festival's main event, the 
announcement of the Squads' achievements,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.670
the king made an important announcement.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.600
The Eye of the Midnight Sun's 
hideout has been located.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.230
To that end,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.060
I have decided to gather an even more select 
group to form the ultimate hand-picked unit.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.110
The Royal Knights!

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.420
The

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.670
The Ro

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.920
The Royal

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.170
The Royal Kni

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.110
The Royal Knights

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.590
Asta and Yuno were unable to 
contain their excitement, but...

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.810
You absolute imbeciles!

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.070
They happened to run into the new 
captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.380
Mereoleona Vermillion, 
scolding her squad in a hellish fury.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.030
The Uncrowned, Undefeated Lioness

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.900
The Crimson Lion Kings have 
only ever placed first or second,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.270
and you had the nerve to 
ruin that by coming in fifth!

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.770
And just because my vacuous younger 
brother ended up bedridden?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.270
What are you, a bunch of infants?!

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.230
What's "vacuous" mean?

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.710
She means "foolish."

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.990
Wait, did she say younger 
brother? Who's that?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.450
Probably Captain Fuegoleon.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.610
Huh?! Then that scary lady is...

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.910
Captain Fuegoleon and Leo's older sister?!

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.580
The nerve of that fool, Fuegoleon!

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.590
How dare he raise a bunch 
of spineless cowards?!

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.630
He has the nerve to stay in bed

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.130
and leave me with a bunch 
of useless fools like you?

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.140
That fool isn't fit to be a captain!

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.020
That's not true! Fuegoleon's a 
better captain than anyone!

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.070
He's right! Captain Fuegoleon taught us 
exactly what a true knight should be!

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.140
Not only is he strict, 
but he's more passionate about us

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.240
and this kingdom than anyone else! 
He's the ultimate Magic Knight!

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.240
You may be my sister, but I will not 
allow you to ridicule our bro—

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.860
Then quit talking and show 
me your true strength!

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.880
Show me that you're the ultimate squad 
that's been led by the ultimate captain!

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.880
That giant fool would never die 
and abandon you or this kingdom!

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.390
Until he returns, you need to show me just 
how strong the proud Crimson Lion Kings are!

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.610
While my vacuous younger brother is gone, 
I'll whip you all into shape myself.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.700
Where's your answer?!

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.150
Yes, ma'am!

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.460
She's so passionate!

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.510
She's smothering.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.710
What kind of intense training 
is waiting for them?

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.960
All right. Let's go to our 
hot springs training camp.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.430
Hot springs?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.890
A training camp like that sounds super fun!

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.180
Sounds easy...

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.300
I heard that.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.480
Then you should come, too.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.480
Uh, something just grabbed me!

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.350
I mean, I belong to a different squad, and I 
shouldn't really be following strangers...

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.490
Asta! You must want to join 
in because you're my rival!

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.390
No!

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.500
Bye, Asta. I'll see you at the exams.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.590
Yuno! Wait, you jerk!

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.250
You're coming, too.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.760
N-No way!

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.900
Hey! That's too out-of-character for Yuno!

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.780
Take your smothering hand off of him!

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.020
I don't care about your character.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.640
Bell, be quiet for now. 
It's even more smothering.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.020
O-Okay...

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.120
There's no escaping once my 
sister has her paws on you.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.900
She's a hidden power

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.030
who stayed behind the scenes only because 
she had no interest in fighting or politics.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.940
But if she were to fight, she'd probably
 be even stronger than Fuegoleon.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.140
She's the Uncrowned, Undefeated Lioness,
 Mereoleona Vermillion!

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.170
Let's see just how strong you two really are,
 Rookie One and Rookie Two.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.950
We've been captured by a lady who's crazy!

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.350
Closed for private party

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.350
Man, the drinks are extra-good tonight,
 don't you think,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.970
captains of the squads that 
placed below the Black Bulls?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.050
You okay, Sis?

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.980
Call me... "Captain."

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.110
You got it, Sis.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.310
Get off your high horse. You've been 
last place every other year, damn it.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.920
And how does it feel to 
be beaten by the squad

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.770
that placed last every other year?
 Tee hee hee!

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.500
If you don't shut that filthy 
mouth, I'll do it for you.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.350
I'm surprised you had 
time to braid your bangs

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.550
after you lost to those
 potty-mouthed Black Bulls.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.260
Aren't you embarrassed? Tee hee hee!

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.140
I'll kill him!

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.720
Oh? You wanna fight?

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.130
Mercury Magic: Silver Spears!

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.660
Kind sir, please refrain from using 
attack spells inside our establishment.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.710
This drink is on the house.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.450
I apologize.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.200
It's good.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.550
He's right, Nozel. This is 
a place to enjoy a drink.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.590
That being said, Yami, 
you shouldn't have been absent.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.920
You've got one crazy 
hairstyle going on yourself.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.250
Kind sir, please refrain from using 
attack spells inside our establishment.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.730
This drink is on the house.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.500
Oh, please do excuse me. I shouldn't 
have let my temper get to me.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.180
Thank you kindly.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.240
My, my...

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.240
Man, what the hell is your problem?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.780
I guess I'll just have to—

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.160
Guess I'll let you off the hook today.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.550
You guys are acting like 
pushovers all of a sudden.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.570
Is there something sketchy 
in those drinks of yours?

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.090
Yami!

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.970
You're amazing, Yami!

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.430
I'm beyond depressed after 
being ranked last just once!

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.130
Yet you looked unfazed for years, 
despite always coming in last!

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.850
Your heart is invincible!

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.490
It's so amazing! Unfathomable!

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.940
Even your heart has chest hairs!

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.850
You are the epitome of insensitivity!
 You're a total weirdo!

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.450
R-Right...

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.950
I can never understand a damn word you say!

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.500
Just wait until next year, Yami!

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.730
What? Going home already?

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.140
I don't mind having a few drinks 
with you tonight, String Bean Scythe!

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.000
Shut it!

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.190
Then I guess I'll just 
have to drink by myself.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.380
Gotta celebrate my ridiculous 
ascent to the top!

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.430
You seem quite pleased with yourself 
for climbing up the ranks just once.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.900
S-Sisgoleon...

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.880
Who are you calling "Sisgoleon"?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.800
Well, you're Fuegoleon's sister, 
so that'd make you Sisgoleon.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.030
We siblings are not referred to 
by such ridiculous nicknames.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.690
What? I thought you just kept 
adding "goleon" to your names,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.030
Grampsgoleon     Gramsgoleon

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.030
Daddygoleon

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.030
Mommygoleon

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.030
Brogoleon

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.030
Sisgoleon

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.970
like some sort of verb conjugation.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.030
Fuegoleon

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.030
Li'l Brogoleon

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.030
Li'l Sisgoleon

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.780
Nonsense.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.580
Oh, heya, Captain Yami.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.780
Looks like she caught you, kid.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.520
How'd that happen?

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.590
I'm not... exactly sure myself.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.830
You're coming, too.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.000
Huh?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.090
You weren't even late to the announcement. 
You just didn't bother showing up.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.140
Uh, wai—

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.140
It appears you need training, 
so I'll help you out with that.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.600
No, wait. I'm already a captain...

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.580
Good. That's what you get, Yami.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.680
You're coming, too.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.480
Huh?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.480
What are you doing to my sis?!

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.790
Who are you?

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.940
I-I don't know what's going on,

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.490
but I'll follow you to the ends of 
the earth, so don't you worry, Sis!

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.820
C-Call me "Captain"...

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.930
There you are, Stupidsta!

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.780
You need to come give Kahono 
and Kiato a proper send-off!

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.370
Also, just so you know, the reason we got 
second isn't because of you or anything!

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.220
L-Lady Mereoleona...

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.550
It's been too long. Have a pleasant evening.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.090
You.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:22.940
Noelle...

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.930
Y-Yes?

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.810
You're coming, too.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.940
Huh? What? Wait, I have 
nothing to do with this!

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.330
We look like grapes dangling 
on a vine right now!

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.260
My character...

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.440
Quiet down.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.930
Hey, where are we going?

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.450
She said something about a hot spring.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.450
H-Hot spring?

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.950
Hey, Noelle. Could you wash my back for me?

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.790
You moron!

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.230
Ow!

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.100
I told you lot to quiet down!

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.390
Thank you for your patronage.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.370
Now, then... This looks like 
it's going to be interesting.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.780
Strong
Magic
Region

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.780
Yultim

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.100
H-Hot spring?

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.110
All right! Let's go, you bloody imbeciles!

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.930
This is a strong magic region 
known as the Yultim Volcano.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.830
There's a volcanic belt laced with 
powerful mana deep underground,

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.020
and it spews lava constantly.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.820
This is a place that no ordinary 
person can set foot in.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:03.490
But at the summit, there's a 
splendid and revitalizing hot spring.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.670
Well? You're getting excited now, aren't you?

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.990
Come! Let us head to the summit!

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.000
I wouldn't say we're excited.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.690
Zoinks! What fresh hell is this?

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.250
But a hot spring...

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.510
Sol, wash my back for me.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.430
Being in a hot spring with Sis! Yes!

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.270
Sol, you didn't have to tag along.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.610
What are you talking about?

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.510
I told you I'd follow you to the ends of the 
earth, Sis! That includes this hot spring!

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.440
Call me "Captain."

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.740
You got it, Sis!

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.240
Let us race to see who can get 
to the summit first, Asta!

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.980
Yeah! Bring it on, damn it!

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.260
I need to work out my aggression!

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.250
You, too, Yuno from the Golden Dawn!

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.050
You can go right ahead.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.440
So this is what "cool" looks like.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.610
I don't like it.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.510
Eh, you get used to it.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.510
Quit dawdling and go!

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.050
Here I go!

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.520
We'll get by somehow with magic!

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.570
What's with this heat?

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.740
The atmospheric mana's going berserk!

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.270
My sweat glands are about to explode!

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.830
It's hard to breathe, too. 
My chest feels like it's on fire!

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.350
We're supposed to climb an erupting 
volcano in this condition?

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.900
That's impossible!

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.300
Tch. If I try to duck out, 
Sisgoleon's probably gonna come after me.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.720
Looks like I'm doing this.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.350
Why did Lady Mereo bring me along, too?

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.270
I have no choice. 
I'm starting to sober up, too.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.090
If I can't cross this mountain, 
I'll disgrace women everywhere.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.570
I'll reach the summit in a blink of an eye!

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.250
The captains are amazing!

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.410
The magma's doing nothing to them!

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.450
More importantly, how are they able to 
move like that in a place like this?!

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.790
That's amazing!

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.450
I've figured it out!

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.460
That's Mana Skin!

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.390
To some extent,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.140
all Magic Knights use mana to boost their 
physical abilities when they fight.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.990
One fundamental spell in which this ability
is polished to perfection is called Mana Skin.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.880
Yami and Charlotte are able to release 
their mana at a constant rate,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.930
even in an environment where 
mana is going berserk.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.940
They are always wearing a layer 
of mana, protecting themselves.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.980
Mana Skin? Sure, every Magic 
Knight uses that technique.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.000
But sustaining it for so long in 
a harsh environment like this...

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.580
We can't figure it out that fast!

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.200
No, it'll work!

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.270
We'll get a feel for it little by little,
adapt to the mana here,

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.940
and reach the summit before 
we use up our magic!

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.300
We've gone soft, so this is the perfect 
environment to retrain ourselves!

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.530
Let's go!

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.850
Yeah!

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.200
It's so hot! What's with this place?!

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.270
Mana Skin, huh?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.780
Yuno, where the heck are we? It's so hot!

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.070
Ah, it's so nice and cool.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.930
Yuno!

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.320
Asta! You'd better get there before 
I overheat from soaking too long.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.850
Asta! I'm going on ahead!

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:37.790
Leo!

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.040
Curse you, Yuno! I demand that you wait!

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.590
I'm gonna be just like Sis!

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.880
Then I'm gonna soak in a hot spring with her!

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.370
Damn that Sisgoleon.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:58.430
She must've brought us along to 
serve as examples for the Crimsons.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.510
Especially Charlotte. Her poor 
affinity with this place makes her

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.320
a prime example of how it should be done.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:16.490
Golden's top rookie, Mister Cool, is here 
to stir up the younger guys his age.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:21.000
Despite how she looks, 
that lady tyrant is pretty sharp.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.260
Quit dawdling and get a move on!

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.000
Or maybe not. I'm not really sure anymore.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.470
Mana Skin...

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.290
I'm terrible at controlling my magic, 
so this is basically impossible for me to do!

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.010
Even though my water attribute should 
be super compatible with this place...

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.420
I haven't seen Lady Mereoleona in ages,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.390
and she brings me straight 
to a place like this!

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.900
What the heck is going on?

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.950
Did you say something, Noelle?

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.490
N-No, nothing at all, ma'am!

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.760
Do you have the resolve
to climb to the summit?

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.120
I asked you if you had the 
resolve to climb to the summit!

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.620
I do!

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.350
I can tell from your mana.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.840
The little girl who was always cowering 
around her siblings has changed.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.560
You're starting to resemble 
your mother a bit.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.360
Not only on the outside, 
but on the inside, too.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:24.050
She didn't just have the physical 
strength of a Magic Knight.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.980
She possessed a strong heart, too.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.940
Thank you. Those flowers are beautiful.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.380
The baby's going to be born soon, right?

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.460
Yes.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.090
Once you give birth, you're going to 
return to the battlefield, aren't you?

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.770
Why are you crying?

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.550
They must've told you.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:09.560
The Magic Knights need you, Lady Acier.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.130
So why are you risking your life to...

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.560
As a Magic Knight, once you decide you're 
going to step out onto the battlefield,

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.830
you fight for the people and your kingdom

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:24.460
without thinking twice about 
risking your life, right?

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.390
In a similar way, once a woman 
has a child in her belly,

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:38.290
she will try to protect that 
baby's life at any cost.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.590
That's what it means to be a mother.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.990
Nothing's stronger than a determined woman.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.510
Just like your mother.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.940
If you've made the decision to climb, 
then hurry up and climb this mountain.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.290
Yes, ma'am!

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:20.390
Damn it... Everyone else went on ahead.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.170
There's nothing I can do about this 
just with guts and my muscles.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.830
I-I can't cut the heat with my sword.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.020
D-Damn it...

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.270
You can head back.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.300
It's impossible for someone with absolutely 
no magic to climb this mountain.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.540
I thought you might have promise since 
you were the number two rookie,

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.630
but apparently your previous 
exploits were all thanks to luck.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:10.130
Your luck is magnificent. With that luck,
 you might be able to become

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.640
the Wizard King even if you 
can't climb this mountain.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.530
If you get the point, go home.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.650
I'm not going back!

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.250
I...

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.700
H-How...

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.710
...do you become the Wizard King?

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.750
What we're striving for isn't something 
that can be obtained just by luck!

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.510
It's merit.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.880
Then go on and climb!

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:51.080
You can't protect others with pride,
and the trust of others comes with merit.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.690
There is only one thing people 
want from the Wizard King...

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.980
There's no way a fool who doesn't 
know himself can manage it.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.700
Merit that proves they are the best.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.780
I'll get to the top!

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.900
Our dream is waiting for us 
at the top, beyond merit!

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.340
Petit Clover

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.530
Petit Clover!

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.840
Let's Talk
 with Dorothy!

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.840
Let's Talk with Dorothy!

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.690
Let's have a chat, Dorothy!

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.050
Do you have any hobbies 
besides sleeping, Dorothy?

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.220
Ooh, let me guess!

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.050
Let's see... Maybe dancin...

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:09.920
...ggh.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.100
Or maybe even cookin...

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.400
...ggh.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.690
I bet you cook a great hambur...

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.650
...gghr.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.080
And I bet dessert is caramel puddin...

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.120
...ggh.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.340
I'd love to eat your 
cooking one day, Dorothy!

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.100
I know! Let's battle, and if 
I win, you'll cook me a meal!

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.310
Here we go! Rock, paper... paper!

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.650
And you call yourselves members 
of the glorious Magic Knights?

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.340
Don't give up until the end!

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.440
And then, we'll go into the hot spring!

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.940
