WEBVTT

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.620
I need to get through this strong magic 
region before my mana runs out.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.120
Back off!

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.200
I can't die in a place like this!

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.160
Not until I tell him.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.230
The Beginning of Hope and Despair

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.840
The giant mobile fortress, Candelo,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.750
created to cross the strong magic region...

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.330
Isn't it just the best?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.600
But this low-stage trash 
sure does run out of mana fast.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.040
We just need half of them to survive until 
we get out of the strong magic region.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.270
There is mana within life energy.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.280
Get every last drop of mana from them,
even if it's from a child.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.290
Thank you for responding 
to the sudden summons.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.100
There's no need for formality, Loropechika.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.300
Noelle Silva

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.300
More importantly, the Spade Kingdom's 
army is drawing nearer, isn't it?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.300
Yes. They will soon reach 
our kingdom's borders.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.980
Within the last six months, 
the Spade Kingdom has

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.670
basically taken over the Diamond Kingdom,

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.260
and is now advancing toward the 
Clover Kingdom and the Heart Kingdom.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.590
Leopold Vermillion

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.010
We were also preparing for an attack,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.020
but it seems they've gotten ahead of us.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.070
Luck Voltia

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.070
I'm ready to fight whenever.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.400
Yes. I'd like all of you to intercept them,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.830
but the Spade Kingdom's forces are 
currently in the strong magic region.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.600
Finral Roulacase

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.270
I guess timing will be really important.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.580
They might be easier to fight 
if we draw them closer to us.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.480
If they're going through 
the strong magic region,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.390
they should be weakened by the 
time they reach the border.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.340
Mimosa Vermillion

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.340
That will be the moment to strike.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.540
Actually, it's rather likely their 
forces will not be weakened.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.350
They are heading here in a mobile fortress.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.600
A mobile fortress?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.110
They use those in their kingdom who 
are at a lower stage in a vile fashion...

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.050
as energy to move this fortress.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.070
Hey!

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.120
We're still in the middle 
of our strategy meeting.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.370
What shall we do? Should we bring 
him back for the time being?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.790
No. Let us have him break 
through the front lines.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.630
I'm quite certain that he 
will not be defeated easily.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.410
The ones who see results from this training

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.470
should only be those loved by mana
and those in the higher stages

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.140
who can use the techniques.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.490
But to think he, someone with no magic,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.900
would get so much stronger 
after training with us.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.900
The fact that he's at the 
arcane stage was surprising,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.650
but even more surprising 
was his hard work, gutsiness,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.890
and strength to never give up.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.430
And done.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.190
All right, so who's next?

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.060
Make sure you carry the fallen to the back.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.090
P-Please! She's still small 
and barely has any mana!

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.930
Please have mercy!

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.680
Oh?

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.440
You have some nerve, trying to talk to us.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.390
You're nothing but low-stage scum.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.300
You low-stage trash who can barely 
manage attack magic can only be useful

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.250
by contributing your measly 
mana to move this fortress!

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.990
If you don't wanna get hurt, 
don't get any funny ideas.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.580
You guys are blessed, really.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.570
You won't be killed until all your mana's gone.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.720
All right.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.280
You get to play a special little role.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.480
N-No!

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.200
Sis!

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.480
Someone as low-class as you will actually 
be of use to me. You should be honored!

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.990
Huh?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.000
Man... what's with this crazy weather?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Well, that's a strong magic region for you.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.510
Guess I don't have full 
control over it yet. Damn!

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.900
Demon-Slayer!

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.370
All right!

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.580
That robe... You must be a Magic Knight
 from the Clover Kingdom.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.000
What are you doing here?

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.370
What's with this guy? 
He doesn't have any mana at all!

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.880
Hey, come on, now!

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.160
He came here by himself? What an idiot.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.670
I don't know why you showed up, 
but you're just wasting your time!

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.170
I'll finish you off in an instant!

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.420
You piece of trash!

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.510
Wha—

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.510
Wasting time? That's my line.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.270
I don't know how many of you there are, 
but I'll take care of you in an instant.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.520
So all of you can come at me at once!

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.950
You brat!

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.020
Who do you think you are?

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.270
I'm one of the Clover Kingdom's Magic Knights,
Asta of the Black Bulls!

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.480
I won't harm any of you!

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.160
Don't worry! You're safe now!

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:14.680
We're only being left alive... so that 
our mana can keep this fortress moving.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.680
Her heart is... frightened?

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.410
We can never leave this place.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:28.910
Even if we were to be freed, 
we couldn't escape this strong magic region.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:35.450
Why did this happen? 
We don't want this war.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.660
Who's the one making these 
people suffer like this?

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:44.460
The captain in charge of this 
fortress has an eerie magic.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.960
He has some otherworldly, frightful power.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.540
All right.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:57.150
In that case, I'm gonna go beat 
down all the bad guys here.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.720
What?! But that's impossible!

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.520
There are still so many soldiers, and...

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.730
Don't worry!

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.480
Are you the intruder?!

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.690
You won't get away!

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.730
Demon-Dweller!

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.240
Black Slash!

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.750
So you're up there, huh?

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.120
What the?!

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.290
Why, you—

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.630
Die!

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.640
Take this!

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.900
Who the hell are you?!

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.400
Hup!

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.900
You must be here.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.910
Well, you sure made a mess of things.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.920
It appears you also have the power of a devil.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.420
How can you do something so 
awful to your own people?

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.420
My people? Something awful?

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.850
They're merely sacrificing themselves 
so that the Spade Kingdom can prosper.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.180
I don't know of anything more honorable 
that the lower-stage filth could do.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.390
Your people aren't filth!

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.330
M-My body—

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.850
I don't know how trash like you
who doesn't have any mana

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.700
managed to get your hands 
on the devil's power.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.700
But you're powerless against 
things you can't evade.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.820
You're no match for someone 
at a higher stage, like myself.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.960
Poison Creation Magic: Basilisk's Breath.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.970
In the end, you're absolutely worthless. 
You won't even serve as food for him.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.470
Demon-Destroyer!

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.230
What?

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.230
He erased... the poison?

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.730
How could scum like you have such a power?

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.100
You may have the devil's power,

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.210
but it looks like you've 
only got a tiny piece of it.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.460
Sacrificing the citizens for the 
prosperity of your kingdom, my ass!

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.000
If you want to fight so badly,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I'll crush all of you!

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.020
He definitely made a mess again...
That Stupidsta.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.490
What?

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.530
How did he...

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.640
Impossible!

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.150
I beat the strongest guy, 
as well as everyone else!

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.530
You don't have to worry anymore!

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:16.290
Hey, it's Noelle and the others! 
Her water armor's always super cool!

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.560
And now she can use the traveling 
water bubble at the same time!

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.320
Man, she's really grown—

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.070
Huh?

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.330
Hmph! Just so you know,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.560
controlling a transport spell while going 
through a strong magic region is super hard!

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.310
Yes, we know, Noelle.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.610
We made it safely, so you did wonderfully.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.320
Excellent work.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.670
Hey, who do you think 
you're talking to, Mimosa?

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.170
I'm royalty.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.650
I am, too...

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.930
Hey, Stupidsta. What's the big idea
of leaving me behind like that?

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.830
He's just being his usual self.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.590
Take me with you, for crying out loud.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.690
I almost died from the excitement of 
being stuck with Noelle and Mimosa.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.670
Wait, that's nonsense! I wasn't excited at all!

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.900
I only get excited over Miss Finnes now—

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.760
Are you all right, miss?! 
Who could have done something so awful?!

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.400
Allow me to gently take care of—

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.530
No, I can't! Not with anyone 
other than Miss Finnes!

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.110
Sis, that guy is really weird.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.280
You're so awesome, Finral! 
You've grown so much!

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.550
Thanks, Asta.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.870
There's nothing awesome 
about this. Are you stupid?

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.280
I still have a hard time believing 
Finral has a fiancée.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.880
Are you sure you didn't just imagine her?

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.920
Noelle, she's totally real!

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.130
What's going on?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.420
Plant Recovery Magic: 
Princess-Healing Flower Paradise.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.890
I cannot recover your mana, 
but I can recover your stamina.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.160
Mimosa's magic totally powered up, too!

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.650
Way to go!

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.650
Thank you very much, Asta.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.200
Wow.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.660
But...

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.660
The place where you live 
was taken over, too, right?

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:18.670
Yes.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.920
Our town...

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.800
One night, without warning, 
that army suddenly showed up.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.180
Anyone who defied them 
was killed on the spot.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:39.870
If we go back there, we'll probably 
be executed for escaping.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.570
You don't need to worry about that.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.820
Huh?

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.320
Luck and Leopold are heading over there.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.830
Honestly, Stupidsta! Who does he think he is?

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.850
We shall follow Asta's lead!

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.760
It's no fun leaving it all to Asta.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.840
Come to think of it, I never see 
her in formal attire anymore...

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.350
No! I have a separate mission 
for you, Leopold and Luck!

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.190
Huh?

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.600
This is the perfect opportunity.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.600
Let's take over the Spade Kingdom's
 outlying base!

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.600
What?!

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.610
Noelle, Mimosa, and Finral, 
please go back Asta up.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.360
U-Um... Do we really want to 
split up our forces like that?

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.860
It'll be all right.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.840
I'm sure all of you will be fine now.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.830
Man, I'm bored. Why do we have to waste 
our time watching over this dumb village?

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.630
Hey! Don't let the captain hear you!

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.070
An intruder!

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.100
Why, you—

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.720
You're mine!

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.150
Is this really...

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.900
all you guys have got?!

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.450
I was told everyone here 
was stage two or lower.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.700
Which means it doesn't matter how many 
there are. They're no match for us!

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.500
Flame Magic: Profound Spiral Flames!

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.410
Huh? Did we beat all of them already?

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.670
Yes! There's no more left for you!

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.170
Boo.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.210
We're all done over here.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.890
That was so fast!

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.460
Asta! You don't get to have all the fun!

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.690
Leo! Man, you sure did grow up!

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.690
I am Fuegoleon and Mereoleona's little brother.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.760
Of course I've grown!

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.690
I'm so jealous!

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.270
I've marked this place, so I'm gonna head out.
 I'll come back for you guys later.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.700
Thanks, Finral!

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.200
Looks like everything went well.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.210
We've received word that they were able 
to take over the base successfully.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.130
I had confidence that 
they were up to the task,

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.920
but they far exceeded my expectations.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.830
Yes. But...

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.220
Yes.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.220
The real battle has yet to begin.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.880
Our town...

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.310
Are the soldiers gone?

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.730
We can go home?

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.300
Really?

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.730
What do you intend to do to our town?

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.240
Huh? What do we intend to do to it?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.610
I mean, the ones who just took it over...

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:42.240
Your friends are from the 
Clover Kingdom, right?

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.250
We can't survive unless we obey the strong.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.250
Isn't that right?

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.920
What are we going to do? 
I mean, it's your town, isn't it?

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.760
We're not gonna do anything to it!

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760
Huh?

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.530
Finral's gonna take all of you 
guys back there with his magic!

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.570
Just hang tight!

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.720
Really?

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.770
They won't take our mana from us?

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.770
We really get to go back home?

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.270
That's great!

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.520
Thank you so much!

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.270
Thanks, mister!

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.530
We just want to defeat the devil 
that's in the Spade Kingdom!

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.690
The devil?

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.680
C-Currently, the Spade Kingdom

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.530
is ruled by sinister mages 
known as the Dark Triad,

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:28.170
along with the Dark Disciples, whom they've 
bestowed powers upon to help them rule.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.060
They are all incredibly powerful.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:39.050
I heard that the Dark Triad are 
as fearsome as devils themselves.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.800
The Dark Triad...

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:56.820
It appears as though you've grown quite 
accustomed to using the devil's power, Zenon.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.320
Yes... For the most part.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.490
We've received reports that Candelo,

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:07.470
the fortress we sent toward the Heart Kingdom, 
and our base on the border have fallen.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.830
Just leave them be.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.340
We need to give our soldiers something 
to do, or they'll get bored.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:19.320
Hey, Big Bro Dante! 
Why does Zenon get all the fun?

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.840
You let him go to the Diamond 
Kingdom all by himself, too!

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.850
I was more suited for that mission.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:31.760
What? But you only used about 
40% of your powers back there!

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.090
I can do about that much too, you know.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.110
Aw... I wanna do something big, too!

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.620
You've grown much yourself, Vanica.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.870
Right?! So come on!

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.620
Yes, you're right. 
It's about time we make our move.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.880
Yay! I'll finally be able to eat

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.880
that delicious treat I've been saving.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.380
Why did we wait half a year?

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.840
All so we could prepare for the time to come.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.390
It'd be no fun if the game ended instantly.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.310
We're going to wipe 
everything from this world.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.700
All order, everything people have 
done, the blessings of nature...

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.400
We're going to make it all meaningless.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.810
The keys we need to open the 
door are within our reach.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.160
The two arcane-stage mages...

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.400
They cannot escape.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:37.000
All life is within the palms of our hands.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.690
Asta's working hard even in other kingdoms.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:49.740
But...

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.430
He wrote, "I think the big 
battle's going to start soon."

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.640
Oh, dear. It's getting cloudy.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.450
O-Oh, no!

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.500
Lord Yuno...

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.510
Petit Clover

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.880
Petit Clover!

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.010
Comparing Heights

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.450
Comparing Heights.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.510
Behold, Asta! See how much I've grown!

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.720
Well, I mean, I've grown, too, 
maybe, I think, somewhat!

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.590
If you look closer, I think you'll 
see we're about the same height!

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.030
Don't be foolish! Then let 
us compare our heights!

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.740
See? I told you!

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.720
Asta's in trouble!

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.320
I must help him!

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.170
See? We <i>are</i> about the same!

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.290
But that's impossible!

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.790
Good for you, Asta.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.290
While I'm at it, I'll just let you win.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.380
How do you like that, Leo!
 I'm taller than you?!

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.810
Uh, even I would notice this.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.160
Leo! Who said you could grow without me?!

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.610
Well, it has been six months.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:47.300
I've also grown these six... 
Hey! Just where are you looking?!

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.350
What?!

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:53.550
