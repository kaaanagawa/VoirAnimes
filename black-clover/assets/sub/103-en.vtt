WEBVTT

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.800
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.760
Let us go, Raia.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.520
Licht and his reincarnated elf comrades 
headed toward the royal capital.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.230
Well, let's go...

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.320
To get our other friends, 
and to destroy the humans.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.370
All right...

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.790
Let's go!

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.290
Asta and Yuno also headed 
toward the royal capital

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.090
to save the Clover Kingdom, but...

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.420
On the way there,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.330
they realized that their hometown, 
Hage Village, was under attack,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.970
so they split off from Nozel 
and the others to head there.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.350
Leave the rest to us!

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.770
How about this, then?

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.270
Poison Plant Magic: Zofnir's Breath...

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.940
and Zofnir's Fingers.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.950
Asta tried to cure the effects 
of the poison plant magic,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.650
which had afflicted the priest.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.500
But even with the Demon-Slayer Sword, 
he was unable to reverse its effects.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.620
Not yet, Father!

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.960
Don't die. You can't die!

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.550
You still... You still need 
to see how much more I...

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.420
how much more we can grow!

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.390
This sword...

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.190
Back at the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's hideout... He...

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.350
It somehow ended up back in my grimoire.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.280
Maybe with this sword, I can...

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.710
Release from Misfortune

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.900
Wait, isn't that the sword 
the evil boss guy was using?

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.580
That sword... Why does he have it?

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.380
What in the world is going on?

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.030
What's wrong, Asta?

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.040
The amount of black power 
flowing into this sword

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.420
is far beyond the other swords...

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.290
Concentrate.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.040
Don't go against this flow. 
Take it in instead.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.690
Make it an extension of myself.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.890
Now!

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.820
Th-This is...

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.070
Huh?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.530
The poison is disappearing.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.750
Please, make it in time!

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.490
Father!

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.380
Wh-What's going...

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.250
Is this a dream? I thought I died.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.450
Asta made you all better!

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.250
Yeah!

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.830
Thank goodness. You're amazing... 
You're amazing, Asta!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.740
All right! But, uh, 
this sword is pretty wild!

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.740
But maybe with this power...

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.410
I'll be able to turn all 
my friends back to normal!

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.210
He managed to take away all 
the effects of the poison.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.050
That sword...

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.030
What are you looking at?

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.930
Mana Zone: Crescent Moon Sickle,
 Four Blades!

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.270
Wh-What's going on?

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.380
You're being affected by the same 
reincarnation spell as us,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.070
so why do you still retain that human's will?

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.810
And doesn't... doesn't the power 
of that sword belong to Licht?

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.120
Why... How can a human with 
absolutely no magical power...

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.660
Wh-What is this?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.830
What are you people?!

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.900
Disgusting... tainted... humans!

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.240
Thank goodness. I think I'll 
make it to Licht's wedding.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.620
Oh, come on.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.520
Are you really giving them those 
creepy flowers as a present?

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.420
A-Are they? But they aren't poisonous, 
and I think they're really pretty.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.630
I'd be happy to have them.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.020
Licht!

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.790
The meaning behind those flowers 
is "kindness hidden within."

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.380
Elves and birds won't go near 
them because they look poisonous.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.300
But since the bugs know that,
 it's their sanctuary.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.070
Don't you think that's just the
same as elves and humans?

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.940
We don't know much about each other,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.810
so we dislike or even hate one another.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.250
I'm sure Tetia will love the flowers, too.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.260
Thank you.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.570
O-Of course!

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.280
We tried to understand them.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.860
And they let us know... 
just how vile they were!

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.710
Humans... I cannot forgive you!

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.930
Stay out of our way!

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.860
This feeling...

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.390
Humans, humans, humans, humans...

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.270
Humans, humans, humans, humans, humans...

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.960
He's not trying to control his magic at all!
 His soul is going out of control!

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.650
Yeah, I can tell from his mana.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.400
The elf's soul inside him is in pain.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.390
It's like the elves are asking for help.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.430
Yuno!

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.410
Let's go, Asta!

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.540
At this rate, he's going to turn 
into something besides an elf.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.160
We have to set him free.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.310
Oh, no!

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.630
He blocked Yuno's attack!

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.690
I've opened a path for you, Asta!

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.870
Just how vile they were!

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.590
Humans... I cannot forgive you!

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.340
Stay out of our way!

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.980
Humans, humans, humans, humans...

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.390
Humans, humans, humans, humans, humans...

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.240
He's not trying to control his magic at all!
 His soul is going out of control!

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.780
Yeah, I can tell from his mana.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.530
The elf's soul inside him is in pain.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.580
It's like the elves are asking for help.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.540
Yuno!

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.540
Let's go, Asta!

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.750
At this rate, he's going to turn 
into something besides an elf.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.290
We have to set him free.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.990
I've opened a path for you, Asta!

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.620
He negated... the reincarnation spell?

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.630
With this sword... 
I'll be able to save everyone!

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.140
The only reason we won is because of Yuno!
You'd better be grateful!

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.890
I wouldn't say he's the <i>only</i> reason!

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.890
All you had to do was hold your sword,
 so it was basically 100% me.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.980
What?! If you were 100%, 
then 500% of it was me!

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.340
You can't be serious. On many levels.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.150
Moron.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.850
Asta!

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.730
Whoa!

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.150
Yuno!

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.740
I thought we were finished... 
You're amazing, Asta!

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.730
Great job protecting Sister, Nash.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.700
Thanks for saving us!

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.160
I was so scared!

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.750
Hey! Get your hands off Yuno!

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.880
Wow! She's so tiny and cute!

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.490
She looks like a doll!

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.710
Let's play dress-up!

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.830
Hey! Stop that!

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.140
Asta... Yuno...

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.490
Father!

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.870
Are you okay?!

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.140
I'm still a bit dizzy, but...

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.760
Looks like the poison's 
left everyone else, too.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.270
Thank you for saving us all.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.900
You two...

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.030
have grown so much!

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.860
Yes! I love you! Please marry m—

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.660
Water Creation Magic: Holy Fist of Love!

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.290
Oh, no! I did that impulsively!

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.230
I've missed this so much!

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.290
Can I get another shot?!

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.710
What?!

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.050
You can't be serious.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.650
Hey, your ears are all pointy, Yuno.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.030
You're right!

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.390
Yeah! He matches me!

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:31.620
Asta, Yuno... What's going
 on in this kingdom?

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.240
One horrifying thing after 
another keeps happening,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.810
and I have no idea what's going on.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.180
We don't have much time, 
but we should probably tell them.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.490
Yeah. Another Magic Knight who's been 
reincarnated as an elf might attack.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.120
Don't worry! When it comes to 
this kingdom and its people...

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.460
...we'll do everything we can to protect them!

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.460
Your Majesty!

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.630
Your Majesty!

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.330
There's trouble, Your Majesty!

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.890
What's all the racket?! You've got
 some nerve to disturb my slumber!

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.340
I-I sincerely apologize! 
But this is an emergency!

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.400
The royal capital is being 
attacked by several mages!

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.400
Just have Julius deal with that.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.910
A-Actually, the Wizard King is missing, 
and we can't seem to reach him.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.290
The Magic Knights' 
headquarters is in chaos!

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.410
Wh-What?! At a time like this?

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.900
But that's fine.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.910
H-Huh?

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.330
This means it's finally my time to shine.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.260
He always... always, always, always...

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.670
<i>always</i> stole the spotlight from me!

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.180
Now I will take command in place of Julius,
 who was always stepping on my toes!

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.490
How lovely, Your Majesty!

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.490
You're the best, Your Majesty!

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.190
Send an order for the Magic Knight 
captains to gather immediately!

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.450
Er, that's already been done.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.280
But most of the captains didn't 
even respond to the summons.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.110
And we've received word that some of

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.600
the captains and Magic Knights 
have turned on us.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.160
Wh-What?!

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.460
Apparently Langris, 
who was detained, has escaped,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.140
and he seems to be leading this attack 
along with the rest of the Golden Dawn.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.250
It appears that our other
 comrades who reincarnated

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.560
have finally made their move.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.560
I hope they save some for us, 
but that might be asking for too much.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.690
I may be a calm man, but even I have trouble 
holding back when I see those humans.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.220
I'm pretty sure you always

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.140
acted calm and collected when 
you were actually pretty feisty.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.090
Honestly though, I can't hold back, either.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.130
We can understand each other.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.080
I mean, we're basically the same as them.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.800
They're mad because something 
precious to them was hurt.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.950
Sorry, kid, but no one can stop us now.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.310
Those two should be waking up soon.
 You should just give up.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.810
I felt immense magical power well up,
 then immediately disappear.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.040
That magic was intense. But I'm 
sure Asta and Yuno are fine!

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.870
They promised to head to the royal capital
 right after they saved their village!

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.620
Yes, we should do our best, too.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.670
They separated from us with resolve.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.460
You need to concentrate on 
what you should be doing right now.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.630
Yes, sir.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:50.540
An den der boss named 
Lich was shuper strong...

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.880
Asta, we have no idea what you're saying.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.220
Look, either talk or eat. Pick one!

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.850
I can't help it! We don't have ti—

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.640
Are you okay, Asta?

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.400
You may be stronger now, 
but nothing else has changed.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.470
So basically, some of your fellow 
Magic Knights reincarnated as elves

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.650
and are attacking us humans. Is that it?

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.540
Yes! Exactly!

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.610
I'm amazed you understood him.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.730
Well, I did raise him, after all.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.860
And to think Asta grew into 
such a fine young man...

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.900
Yuno was always a fine young man, but...

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.030
Father's crying again.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.090
Yeah.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.950
I'm just so happy...

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.820
Excuse me...

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.000
Wh-Who the heck are you?!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.950
Did you forget me already?

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.210
I was the one fighting you a little earlier.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.520
You saved me after my body 
was taken over by an elf.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.660
My name is Digit...

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:54.200
Member of the Purple Orcas
Digit Taliss

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.260
Ah...

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.200
That's what you're actually like?

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.780
Yes! This is what I'm actually like!

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.580
How could this have happened?

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.080
Oh, I'm a Magic Knight belonging 
to the Purple Orcas.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.490
And you know, our former 
captain, Gueldre,

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.500
was accepting bribes and 
had lots of other problems.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.430
So I was patrolling the Forsaken Realm 
to try to help our reputation recover...

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:22.180
Wow! These are endangered horseface berries!

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.420
And these carnivorous plants aren't 
listed in any encyclopedias!

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.060
The Forsaken Realm is

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.660
full of rare plants you can't 
find back in the royal capital!

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.940
As I was traveling, I got lost.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.660
The next thing I knew, I wasn't me anymore,

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.420
and I was attacking this village!

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.270
I still don't know what's going on!

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.030
Seriously, what in the world is going on?!

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.340
You can't be serious.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.340
But there's one thing I'm certain of.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.600
The soul of the elf that had 
reincarnated in me didn't want this.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.210
He didn't want to hate or fight anyone.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.690
Let's go, Yuno!

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.810
We have to save the humans 
and the elves, too!

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:14.610
Yeah.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.620
Huh? You're leaving already?

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.240
But we finally got to see you.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.850
No!

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.320
We wanna hear more stories!

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.910
Come, now. We can't be selfish.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.610
Asta and Yuno have to go protect this kingdom.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.210
There are others in trouble, 
just like we were.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.130
Aw...

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.550
Will you write to us again?

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.350
Yeah.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.550
Of course!

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.130
You better improve your handwriting, Asta!

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.020
Your letters are super hard to read!

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.850
Huh?

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.440
Asta and Yuno... Don't you
dare die, no matter what!

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.710
Yeah!

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.170
Next time, we'll have more 
time to talk, old man!

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.110
Call me "Father" or "Priest," darn it!

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.520
Okay, Old Man Priest!

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.270
You don't need the "old man" part!

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.280
Um... Would you take me with you?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.990
Despite how I look, I am a Magic Knight.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.360
Yeah!

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.750
All right, let's go!

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.580
Well, see ya!

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.340
We're gonna go save the kingdom!

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.580
Asta!

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.310
Yuno!

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.500
We appreciate the letters and the money,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.390
but nothing beats you both coming home safe!

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.430
Be careful!

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.560
Sister! I love you!

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.440
Shut up.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.630
They're going to save the kingdom, eh?

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.160
Our little Asta, who can't 
even use any magic...

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.370
Yuno's the hope of Hage Village now,

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.330
but he used to be so timid 
and would cry all the time.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.590
Honestly, you both grew 
up so unbelievably fast!

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.330
Be careful, you hear me?!

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.790
What the hell is that giant 
boulder-looking thing?

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.890
All right, I guess I'll go have some fun.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.910
We're pretty late after all that happened.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.100
We have to hurry!

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.610
Up ahead, I feel elven magic from 
both the north and the south.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.910
It could be that some of the Magic Knights

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.550
who were reincarnated as elves, 
like me, are attacking humans.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.120
Wh-What should we do? We're hurrying 
to the royal capital, right?

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.190
Even if they're not from 
the royal capital or Hage,

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.310
they're still citizens of this kingdom!

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.340
Guess that settles it.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.980
Since there are two places, it'd be 
better if we split up and helped them.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.800
Um... Who should I go with?

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.760
Go with Yuno!

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.590
I'll be fine alone.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.110
Go with Asta.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.970
Yeah, yeah! Yuno's way stronger than you!

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.020
What the heck? Just take 
him with you, Yuno!

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.230
Go with Asta.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.640
With Yuno!

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:59.480
P-Please calm down! 
Please don't fight over me!

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.530
Asta! Asta! Asta!

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.480
Yuno! Yuno! Yuno!

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:04.380
I can turn our friends who became 
elves back to normal with this sword!

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.620
You can't take anyone down for real,

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.320
so it's better if you have him with you.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.040
As annoying as that is, you're right.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.340
How is that annoying?!

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.580
I guess he can at least incapacitate 
the enemy with paralyzing poison.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.210
I'm not sure if I completely follow, 
but I'm pretty sure that was mean!

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.410
Yuno!

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:22.550
Asta!

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.140
See you at the royal capital!

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.520
Petit Clover

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.690
Petit Clover!

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.020
Splitting Up

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.940
Splitting Up.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.420
Asta, are you sure you want to split 
up and go off on your own?

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.210
Don't mock me! Of course 
I'm fine with that!

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.540
Are you absolutely positive?

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.370
Yeah!

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:17.910
I'll ask you just one more time. 
Are you sure you're okay with splitting up?

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.060
I said yes!

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.510
What? Are you gonna be lonely, Yuno?

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.540
You can't be serious.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.930
Okay, let's split up, then!

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.310
See you at the royal capital!

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.300
Yeah.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.820
See ya.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.640
So mean!

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.930
What the heck?!

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.850
So mean...

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.770
I came because I heard 
the town was being attacked!

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.840
What the hell, Luck?!

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.640
Whoa, hey!

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.900
Why the hell are you attacking me?!

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:51.220

 Lightning of Rage vs. Friends
