00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.940
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.390
Th-There's an emergency!

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.120
Th-The capital!

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.250
The capital is under attack!

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.300
The Clover Kingdom fell under attack
while the Wizard King was absent.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.890
The royal capital was in flames, 
and people fled from the dead.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.530
You're stronger than me, right? Right?!

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.540
Get out here, Magic Knights!

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.620
I get it! There are people 
out there who need our help!

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.310
I'm gonna go!

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.330
Asta!

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.940
Where do you plan to go?

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.380
We don't even know the full situation yet, 
and you can't sense magic at all!

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.130
I'm going to where it's noisiest!

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.260
D-Do you think you're 
an animal or something?!

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.610
Interesting!

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.890
Let's see what you've got!

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.480
Wait for me, Asta, my rival!

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.980
I'm sure you'd rather not take orders 
from me, but listen well, Magic Knights!

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.630
I'll go after Leo and that Black Bulls boy,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.570
and after I've joined them,
we'll head to the north district.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.140
Silver Eagles, I ask that you 
head to the central district,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.070
where the magic is strongest.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.520
Blue Roses, head to the east district!

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.870
I'd rather not take orders from a man, 
but I suppose I don't have a choice.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.750
Golden Dawn, split into two teams and head 
to the west and northwest districts!

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.100
Let us go.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.010
I guess we'll just have 
to save dessert for later.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.480
If we fail to protect the royal capital, 
we'll bring shame upon the Magic Knights!

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.260
Do not let the enemy escape, no matter what!

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.760
Right!

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.570
Little girl... Do you 
like the Clover Kingdom?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.970
I-I love it!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.860
So please... stop this.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.330
Well, I hate it!

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.880
So the town... the people...

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.800
And you, too, little girl...

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.260
I'll destroy you all!

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.970
The members of the Magic Knights moved out,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.350
and when Asta arrived...

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.430
Then I'll protect them!

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.750
I would always close my eyes

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.090
And cower at reality

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.770
I can't stand the idea

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.140
Of just making excuses to give up

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.240
Stand right there

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.400
I don't want to be near you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.540
Any minute now

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.940
Just wait right there

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.940
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.020
Black and blue

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.940
I'll give up on giving up

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.450
And get the world on my side

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.330
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.470
And head where the light shines

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.300
I want to keep my promise

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.850
I'll deliver it to you

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.820
shape of love

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.590
Wild Magic Dance

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.780
Wh-What's going on?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.550
North District

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.850
Someone finally shows up, 
and it's a Black Bull.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.270
And a little kid to boot.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.440
Get away from her, you crazy bastard!

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.390
You fool! You won't be able to stop 
my army with that rusty sword!

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.460
What...?

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.620
I was so scared!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.790
You really acted fast!

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.870
It's dangerous, so stand back.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.840
Okay!

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.680
Ah, I see. You're the one 
with the anti-magic.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.280
You've heard of me?

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.730
Man, gimme a break!

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.670
No one asked the bottom-ranked Black Bulls

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.020
or a piece of trash like you with no magic

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.270
to show up here!

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.780
Do it!

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.370
Central District

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.410
Don't think you're going to get away with...

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.820
What? What do you want?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.250
I'll give it to you, just—

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.390
It's the Silver Eagles!

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.390
Captain of the Silver Eagles
<font size="30">Nozel Silva</c>

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.770
Member of the Silver Eagles
<font size="30">Solid Silva</c>

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.770
The Magic Knights have come to save us!

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.560
The captain is here! We're saved!

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.250
Member of the Silver Eagles
Nebra Silva

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.320
Lord Nozel! Lord Solid!

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.900
Lady Nebra!

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.650
Citizens, fall behind us.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.660
West District

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.720
What are these things?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.690
Every time we knock them down,
they get up again!

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.930
I was planning to have dessert when we 
got back, but I think I've lost my appetite.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.930
East District

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.000
Whoa, these things are gross, Sis!

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.310
Indeed. I feel nauseous just looking at them.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.310
Also, be mindful of your tone.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.820
Oh, I'll be more careful!

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.710
Stay away from me!

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.330
Northwest District

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.550
There are so many!

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.950
Not a chance...

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.920
Do they have some kind of weakness?

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.300
It matters not. There's no point 
in wasting time trying to find it.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.300
North District

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.070
They're disgusting...

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.810
Is my rival safe?

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.540
We can look for the
Black Bulls boy later, Leo.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.440
These things possess magic, 
but they aren't alive.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.850
In that case...

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.950
We'll just have to crush them 
until they can't get back up!

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.320
See if you can take my magic!

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.340
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.210
Flame Magic: Sol Linea!

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.630
A-Amazing...

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.640
Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.780
Goodness, you fight in such a vulgar manner.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.530
You should at least

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.730
die in elegance and beauty!

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.280
Glass Creation Magic: Verre Fleur!

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.980
Shatter before my magic!

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.120
Sand Creation Magic: 
Sand-Armored Heavy Guard!

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.150
Wind Magic: Towering Tornado!

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.550
If you're hurt, please come see me!

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.560
I will heal you with my 
Dream-Healing Flower Cradle.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.930
Filthy creatures, stay away from me.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.810
Quit grossing my Sis out!

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.450
Earth Creation Magic: Raging Mother Goddess!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.300
Call me "Captain."

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.060
I will not allow anyone to touch me.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.450
Briar Creation Magic: 
Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees!

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.520
You're all eyesores!

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.970
Water Creation Magic: Slashing Sea Serpent!

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.990
Mist Magic: Solid Mist Clones!

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.340
Oh, dear. They weren't much fun.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.410
Accept your punishment.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.990
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.330
Punishment for the crime of 
daring to threaten the people

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.210
of this country.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.170
Flame Creation Magic: Leo Rugiens!

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.430
Burn to ashes!

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.140
Th-They're amazing!

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.180
The Magic Knights!

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.570
They're so powerful!

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.090
They're too amazing!

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.340
How'd you like that?

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.370
That voice!

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.580
He...

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.120
Don't tell me he managed to mow down 
that many of them with just a sword!

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.320
He's so strong!

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.460
What a stupidly straightforward 
way of fighting!

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.730
He's just too interesting!

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.820
This is why he's my perfect rival!

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.010
My magic runs my own mana through corpses,

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.020
making them move in any way 
I want. It's wraith magic.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:23.450
That guy's attacks instantly cut through 
the mana in the corpses and erases it!

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.270
I guess that's all of them.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.620
Th-Thank you, mister.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.590
It's too early to thank me.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.880
Why are you attacking 
innocent people, you jerk?!

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.180
I'm going to defeat you, no matter what!

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.940
Number Four, Jimmy...

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.450
"Innocent"?

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.780
Everyone who doesn't understand my magic...

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.610
is a sinner!

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.300
Why are you attacking 
innocent people, you jerk?!

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.600
I'm going to defeat you, no matter what!

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.370
Number Four, Jimmy...

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.870
"Innocent"?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.210
Everyone who doesn't understand my magic...

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.050
is a sinner!

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.250
They keep coming, one after another...

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.230
But they're no match for me.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.150
Just a few more...

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.780
You're okay now.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.580
One after another...

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.500
Are you all right?

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:43.550
Goodness, you saved me.
I'll treat you to some gelato later.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.970
Take that, and that, and that, and that!

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.270
Every rose has its thorns.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.650
Mist Spider's Threads.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.520
Water Creation Magic: Holy Water Bullet!

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.370
That brat's your prey this time, Jimmy!

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.540
Hey! You just keep bringing out these 
creepy things one after another!

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.250
No fair, you jerk!

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.050
My wound opened up even more?

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.820
Jimmy got you with one of his
specially made curse shells.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.890
It's loaded with curse power.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.290
Even scratches won't stop bleeding.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.490
I'd be real careful if I were you.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.450
Jimmy!

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.440
I won't be able to swing 
my big sword fast enough!

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.600
You sure are a pain for a brat 
that doesn't have any magic.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.200
But Jimmy's still got 
lots of curse power left.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.330
Oh, but before we deal with you...

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.260
Jimmy, finish off that eyesore 
of a brat back there first!

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.850
Who are you aiming at?!

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:22.900
Oh, right. I guess you Magic Knights
protect the people.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.200
Just abandon her already!

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.580
Uh-oh. There's no point in getting hurt 
just to protect others, is there?

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.040
Mister...

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:47.750
What do you gain from protecting a little 
brat like that, you hypocritical loser?!

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.380
I'll protect her, even if I 
don't gain anything from it!

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.170
Will you? I see. Then stay right there

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.690
and swing your sword around until 
you bleed to death, you moron!

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.820
Asta!

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.200
I have to help him.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.660
You can't even control your magic. 
You're such an embarrassment.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.810
You've basically been exiled 
from the Silva family.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.260
I'm surprised you had the nerve 
to return to the Noble Realm.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.760
You do not belong here.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.140
Begone,

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.730
failure that killed our mother.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.110
I-I can't... Someone...

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.690
Someone... Please, someone help Asta...

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.830
Thank y—

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.830
Focus!

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.830
Ow! What was that for?!

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.740
Black Bulls girl,

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.470
you're not letting what your 
siblings said get to you, are you?

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.260
There's no time for that on the battlefield!

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.550
One wrong decision and a life could be lost!

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:28.730
You're standing here right now 
as a member of the Magic Knights!

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.930
If you joined the Magic Knights 
of your own free will,

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.670
then steel yourself and get stronger!

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.200
Steel myself?

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.870
Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.870
However, staying weak is!

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.050
He's right...

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.100
He's the one who proved that to me!

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.310
If he can do it, I can also...

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.100
become stronger!

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.780
Mister!

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.190
The weak will always die weak!

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.500
Crap!

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.460
I won't make it in time!

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.710
Who the hell are you?

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.840
Noelle!

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.100
What are you doing, Stupidsta?

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.460
I can't bear to just sit and watch this.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.440
I'll help you, so you'd better be grateful!

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.270
Got it!

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.470
There's no way he can stop 
you if you can move freely.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.580
Go!

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.440
Looks like you're back to normal.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.860
I was never feeling down!

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.910
You stupid brats!

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.870
Don't get so full of yourselves!

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.660
I shall assist you, my rival!

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:20.220
Get that bastard good! 
Show me your true power!

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.140
Uh... Thank you very much!

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.850
There's no need to thank me!

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:30.550
And I was going to do that anyway!

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.120
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.120
Whoops...

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.340
You did it!

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.960
Mister!

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.420
You don't fight like any other mage!
You're just too interesting!

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.620
Huh?

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.690
Don't let that ridiculous 
attack get to you, Jimmy!

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.660
Hey, Jimmy!

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.240
Stop blabbering.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.240
Come at me yourself!

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.940
Wha? Don't get cocky, you little brat!

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.100
Come forth, Alfred.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.760
Number Two, Alfred.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.710
Go, Alfred!

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.580
Asta...

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:37.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.570
And push me forward

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.610
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:47.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:53.390
And change the flow of time

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.630
(Break free yourself)

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:23.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:29.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.340
Petit Clover

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.340
Petit Clover!

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.840
Ra

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.500
Ra!

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.170
Hello.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.410
Hello.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.180
I'm Asta. Nice to meet you.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.110
So, you haven't actually said 
your name in the show yet.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.190
Could you tell us what it is?

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.940
Yes, my name is Rades.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.940
(Hai, ore no namae wa Radesu desu.)

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.450
Radesdes? I see.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.700
So where did you come from, Radesdes?

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.940
No, it's not Radesdes. 
You don't need the "des."

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.840
We don't need the des? 
So your name is just Ra?

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.970
Who're you calling Ra?

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.520
Well, you said there was no "des."

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.500
It's Rades! I just mean 
you don't need the "des."

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.460
It's Radesdes, but you don't need the "des"...

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.150
So if you take out all the "des,"

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.100
It's just Ra?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.510
I'm telling you that's not right!
I'm Rades! Rades!

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:37.990
You better remember that, you useless brats!

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.020
The Magic Knights are no match for me!

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.770
I, Rades, am the strongest of them all!
