WEBVTT

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.820
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.280
a devil.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.330
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.750
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.680
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.660
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.540
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.540
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.050
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.300
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.190
At last, the battle against the devil 
and the Spade Kingdom began.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.230
Asta and the others spent six months 
training in the Heart Kingdom.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.700
They then rescued some citizens
 of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.990
and succeeded in taking
 over one of their bases.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.950
Meanwhile, back in Hage Village,
where Asta and Yuno grew up,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.210
the wheels of fate were beginning to turn.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.210
O-Oh, no!

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.060
Lord Yuno...

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.170
Quiet Lakes and Forest Shadows

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.390
Where are Nash and the others?

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.120
I sent them off to school.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.820
I'm sure this would make 
some of the kids nervous.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.130
Yes.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.280
How is he doing?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.570
He's still asleep.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.290
I used a recovery spell,
 but his wounds are deep.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.390
Maybe he ran into some bandits in the forest.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.350
Depending on the situation, we may 
have to contact the Magic Knights.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.300
Yes.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.370
Who could he be?

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.560
Good work, everyone.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.390
Thanks to you, we were able to make 
one of the Spade Kingdom's bases,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.900
the town of Tolon, our own.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.870
I hear that all the citizens of the 
Spade Kingdom who were captured

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.180
in the mobile fortress are recovering.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.660
Thank you very much.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.030
Are you sure you wanted us to come back?

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.910
You could've just had your 
forces proceed from there.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.750
Stage two guys weren't enough. 
I wanna fight someone stronger.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.370
We're dealing with devils here. 
We can't just go barging into the unknown.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.490
We have to rest and recover.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.090
Will the town be all right 
in terms of its defense?

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.420
You can leave that to us.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.600
I asked Noelle to take one of 
my clones to the town of Tolon.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.110
Through that clone, I've set up the same 
barrier there that the Heart Kingdom has.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.900
Because I have the devil's curse within me,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.120
I can sense the devil's magic immediately.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.950
Let's continue to gain more territory and 
corner the devil in the Spade Kingdom.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.080
Yeah!

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.340
Honestly... You sure are making that 
sound much easier than it's going to be.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.590
That's all for today. 
Please keep up the good work.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.590
But with Loropechika's powers, 
we might just be able to do it.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.630
This queen is insane.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.850
I still haven't had enough yet.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.320
Hey, Gaja. Play with me again today.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.010
The Spirit Guardian of Fire who trained me, 
Floga, is extremely powerful,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.280
but I'd love to know how 
powerful you are, too.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.070
I'd also love to spar with you.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.990
Ooh! Me, too!

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.490
All of you just returned from battle,
 so please get some rest.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.320
No, I'm totally fine! 
You don't need to worry about me!

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.950
Then let's have a bloodbath together!

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.380
I'm getting fired up!

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.800
Ooh, this sounds like fun. 
I'd like to join in, too.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.730
You know you can't do that, 
Loropechika! What are you saying?!

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.230
I'm fi—

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.310
Loropechika!

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.650
Everyone seems well.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.530
Honestly, they're all so stupid.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.570
I got all dirty in the strong magic region,
 so I'm going to take a bath.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.000
I shall join you, Noelle.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.840
You're going too, Loropechika.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.660
You're a queen, so you need to enjoy 
an elegant bath, not a bloodbath.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.770
All right...

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.810
Oh, I just happen to know 
the best place for a bath.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.200
The cuties from the Clover Kingdom are

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.300
going to take a bath with the beautiful 
queen of the Heart Kingdom...

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.700
No, don't, Finral!

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.360
Don't you dare get excited over any 
woman other than Miss Finnes!

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.800
Resist!

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.430
Finral, make up any weird 
fantasies and I'll kill you.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.100
Noelle! I'm doing everything 
I can to resist right now!

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.100
Th-There's trouble!

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.120
In the Polnfrume Forest...

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.610
A wild Charmy has appeared!

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.950
If we don't do something, 
she'll eat up all the fruits in the forest!

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.000
Again?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.070
Wait, again?

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.930
Well, you see, it appears Miz Charmy really took

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.580
a liking to the food in the Heart Kingdom.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.680
And she's been causing trouble everywhere.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.890
In one of the forests, she took 
over a group of monkeys

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.420
La...

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.800
and had them bring her bananas.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.550
And in another forest, she fought 
a bear over some super rare apples.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.450
La...

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.840
Well, the fruits in the Heart 
Kingdom are indeed delicious.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.270
It must be the pure water here.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.240
Good grief. We should go fetch her 
before she causes any more trouble.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.860
I'll go! I'm sure you're pretty tired 
from moving all those people around,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.460
so you should get some rest, Finral.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.720
I think you moved around 
way more than I did, Asta.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.450
But I don't use any magic, so I'm fine!

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.080
I'm talking about your stamina, actually...

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.960
Well, good luck.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.860
We're counting on you.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.880
Yes, ma'am!

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.310
Demon-Slayer!

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.200
I'm going to control my anti-magic...

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.740
and fly!

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.400
The kid without magic who 
couldn't fly on a broom...

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.780
He's turned into an impressive guy.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.720
How lovely.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.670
This is a secret spring that's been 
passed down through the generations

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.960
of the royal family of the Heart Kingdom.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.160
Oh, my. I'm so honored that 
you've brought us here.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.080
I sense some very pure mana.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.060
Elmora Lake has some of the finest 
water in all of the Heart Kingdom.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.060
If you bathe in these waters, 
your skin will be nice and smooth.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.490
Let's go in.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.570
Indeed.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.780
Finally, I feel so much better.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.400
It's so nice and cold.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.760
Oops! I forgot to take these off.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.440
Oh, Loropechika...

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.590
By the way, I've been meaning 
to ask you girls this for a while...

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.170
Which one of you is dating Asta?

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.130
What?!

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.840
Ooh, are we talking about relationships? 
I'd love to know myself!

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.180
W-We're not dating him!

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.430
A-Asta is a very lovely gentleman 
who's very kind and reliable,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.200
but now is not the time for that.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.040
Then how about when the battle 
with the Spade Kingdom ends?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.950
What?

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.220
Well, you obviously don't seem to mind.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.330
Oh, but the one who always 
seems to be with him is Nero.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.720
Is that because you two are dating?!

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.750
His head is nice to perch on.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.540
Is that all it is?

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.840
Yes.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.860
So you're only interested 
in the top of his head.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.430
I-I see.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.670
Nero's saying that now,

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.930
but what if they become closer as
 they spend more time together?

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.790
So what about you, Noelle?

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.440
I'd never date S-S-S-Stupidsta!

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.130
Oh, I see.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.710
I see.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.450
Wh-What about you, Loropechika?

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.200
Y-Yes. Are you seeing Gaja?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.210
Huh? Me and Gaja? Yeah, no.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.950
Really? But you're always together.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.640
You'd make a lovely couple.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.220
That'll never happen. 
I'm sure Gaja feels the same.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.720
Poor Gaja. I'd never tell him that, though.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.310
This is fun!

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.900
No wonder you're the leader 
of the Spirit Guardians.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.690
Your strength knows no bounds.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.460
Because you both managed to 
grow so surprisingly quickly,

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.700
this is excellent training for me, too.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.000
I must also become stronger, just like them.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.140
I will protect the Heart Kingdom, 
even if it costs my life.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.010
I'm so happy that everyone from 
the Clover Kingdom is so nice.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.390
I didn't know what I would do if you 
all turned out to be scary people.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.460
That's our line.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.380
I know it was to check our magic stages, 
but you just suddenly attacked us.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.180
Sorry about that.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.780
We're very grateful that the 
Queen of the Heart Kingdom

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.430
is someone as lovely as you, Loropechika.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.440
Mimosa...

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.240
And everyone in the Heart Kingdom 
has been so kind to us.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.370
Yes.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.920
Well, we're all going to 
face the devil together.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.090
I'm glad you're someone we can trust.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.710
Th-Though it's a shame you're so clumsy.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.750
Hey.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.520
Thank you very much.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.640
Despite appearances, I am trying 
my best to be a proper queen

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.760
in front of the citizens 
of the Heart Kingdom.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.620
Though I'm not good at it.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.770
So I'm happy to have some friends 
I can be so honest with.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.270
I'm so happy we became friends.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.610
You're so cute, Loropechika.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.130
Oh, come on. Now you're making me blush.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.460
We feel the same as you, Loropechika.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.580
It's so great flying through the sky!

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.150
The passing breeze!

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.300
The sweet, fruity scent!

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.680
Hm? Sweet scent?

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.590
She must be there!

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.930
Miz Charmy!

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.640
Hey, Asta.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.690
Want some noms?

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.680
Holy crap, she gained weight!

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.860
Just how much did you eat?!

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.570
It's all because the fruit in the 
Heart Kingdom is so nummy.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.870
You shouldn't eat any more, Miz Charmy!

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.370
La? You tryin' to stop me, Asta?

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.860
Well, yeah! You've obviously 
eaten too much—

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.340
Listen up, Asta.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.880
We don't eat to live.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.600
We live to eat!

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.880
What?!

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.840
So...

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:12.160
People who get in the way of good eatin' 
will get run over by sheep and die.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.270
Uh, what?

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.230
Miz Charmy?!

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.730
What's going on?

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.370
Hey, that's...

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.950
That's Charmy's sheep!

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.330
Charmy's out of control!

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.650
Charmy...

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.210
Golden Dawn Headquarters

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.450
Vice Captain, do you have a moment?

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.510
I'm about to go on a mission.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.260
Is this urgent?

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.190
Well... we've received a message 
from a church in Hage Village,

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.470
out in the boonies.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.670
Tell me at once.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.110
That's Charmy's sheep!

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.440
Charmy's gone wild!

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.650
Cotton! It's using cotton to gather food!

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.040
It's headed this way!

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.090
She's attacking with all 
the hungry forest animals!

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.050
At this rate, all of the food in the 
forest is going to be gobbled up!

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.270
I...

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.100
I may have created a monster.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.860
The Mana Method basically makes recipes... 
and the dishes they create are magic!

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.360
That means I must eat in order
to learn the Mana Method, la!

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.330
I didn't really understand her logic, 
but I decided to support her.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.670
Charmy is a genius Magic Knight.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.710
The best thing I could do for her would 
be to make her talent shine even more.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.130
But she fell in love with all 
the food in the Heart Kingdom,

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.220
and she ended up at the top 
of the forest's food chain.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.510
It's my duty to stop her!

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.850
Plant Magic: Evergreen Vida Valtoria.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.360
I can't stop it! They're just 
going through. In that case...

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.010
Wow!

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.110
Way to go, Sir Potrof!

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.380
W-We're finished!

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.300
Oh, dear.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.680
I thought I was going to suffocate!

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.840
Are you all right, Asta?

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.850
Potrof! Thank you!

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.680
At this rate, everyone's dinners 
are going to be stolen, too!

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.850
Will you help me out, Asta?

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.940
Right back at you!

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.150
Fruits are truly the best.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:17.670
They're delicious, healthy, and mostly water,
so you never gain weight.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.500
So you still haven't given up, Master.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:30.260
But once the flames of my hunger have 
been lit, not even you can stop them!

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.760
Then I'll just have to 
stop you once and for all!

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.860
La?

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.810
All right!

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.360
What?!

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.860
That's not fair!

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.860
Then I'll just have to cut it
somewhere that can't be avoided!

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.860
'Scuse me for a bit!

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.490
What the heck?! I keep cutting,
 but there's no end!

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.540
Oh, crap!

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.290
Even Asta doesn't stand a chance...

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.500
Does this mean all we can do is 
watch as she devours everything?

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.510
Leave this to me, Potrof!

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.720
Rill!

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.430
Charmy... we trained together.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:26.600
As your friend, I cannot allow 
your rampage to continue!

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.610
Picture Magic: Invasion of Heat-Infused Ice!

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.200
You saved me, Rill!

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.160
I see! We can attack it if it's frozen!

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.660
Let's go, Asta!

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:47.500
Yeah!

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.590
La!

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.480
They defeated the Charmy!

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.600
Thank you!

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.870
Goodness, my students caused a mess... 
Though I am happy with how much they've grown.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.350
La...

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.860
Charmy, overeating is bad for you.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.140
Sorry. It's just that the Heart Kingdom's
 fruits are so yummy

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.660
that I couldn't help myself.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.860
You totally saved me back there, Rill.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.030
You got even more insane than before!

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.610
Well, training in the Heart Kingdom
 has been super fun.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.660
And whenever I think of a certain someone,

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.700
my inspiration and need 
to create just won't stop.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.630
A certain someone?

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.880
The goddess who saved me when 
I was possessed by the elf.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.390
She's my soulmate!

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:47.640
I want to become a powerful man worthy 
of her... and a powerful captain.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.770
That goddess...

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.780
is totally Miz Charmy, Rill!

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.730
Huh?

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.510
What are you talking about, Asta? 
They're totally different. She wasn't this fat.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.210
Yeah, I know that, but...

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.140
And what are you talking about, Rill?
 I'm not that fat.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.790
I'm pleasantly plump. 
Obviously, the most popular body type.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.730
You're still eating! Can't you 
do anything besides eat?!

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.550
How rude, Asta! Of course I think of 
something besides eating sometimes.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.060
Something besides eating...

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.060
I wonder how Yuno is doing.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.940
We're almost to Hage Village.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.500
This place is always so dull.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.240
We're finally alone, but it 
doesn't feel like a date at all.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.900
I don't know what they need to tell you,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.250
but we're finally going on a date afterward.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.830
Yuno, are you listening?

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.750
Hey, Yuno!

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.450
Bell, shut up.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:56.780
Yuno!

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.320
Sister.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.260
Welcome home. Sorry, I know you must be busy.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.470
Yeah! Yuno's super busy!

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.760
I'm fine. Did something happen?

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.180
Well... why don't you come in first?

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.900
You're the spitting image of Lord Ciel.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.410
And that necklace... There's no doubt about it!

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.810
Who the heck is this old guy?

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.910
Apparently, he's from the Spade Kingdom.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.420
Guess we need to kick his butt, then!

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.670
I am not your enemy!

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.920
The Spade Kingdom was originally 
a peaceful kingdom.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.760
Despite how bitterly cold it got,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.180
the people lived happily under the 
rule of the House of Grinberryall...

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.880
until the Dark Triad appeared, 
exiled the Grinberryalls,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.440
and ruled over the people with fear.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:00.610
Lord Yuno...

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:06.450
You are our hope. You belong 
to the House of Grinberryall.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.240
Meaning...

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.190
You are the Prince of the Spade Kingdom!

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:48.550
Petit Clover

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.450
Petit Clover!

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.050
The Ultimate Canvas

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.840
The Ultimate Canvas.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.060
I just can't draw her enough!

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.060
Ah, my goddess!

00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:01.730
Munchy, munchy, munchy, 
munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.730
Rill, you don't want to draw 
this version of Miz Charmy?

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.230
I'm too busy trying to get every detail 
of the goddess's beauty perfect right now.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.790
This canvas is so soft and smooth. 
It's as though I'm painting on a cloud!

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.740
This may just become my ultimate masterpiece!

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.330
R-Rill, that's—

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.010
And done! My ideal goddess has descended!

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.540
Wait a minute...

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.170
Just how wrapped up were you in your work?!

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.510
Ack, please don't eat any more, Charmy! 
You're going to stretch my goddess out!

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:34.180
La? Rill, those who get in 
the way of others' meals...

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.690
Please! No more, Miz Charmy!

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.700
You can't be serious.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.080
You can't be serious about me being 
the Prince of the Spade Kingdom.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.400
But I am serious.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:51.380

Page 160
 The Messenger From the Spade Kingdom

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.110
I'm serious.
