00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.050
Asta and Yami face off with the leader 
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.010
and end up in a life or death situation.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.640
Farewell, Yami Sukehiro.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.350
Light Magic: Ray of Divine Punishment.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.400
He came.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.320
But at that moment, Finral and Gauche arrived!

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.280
He's...

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.450
Mirror Magic: Full Reflection!

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.290
Gauche used a miraculous spell, and Licht's 
own spell was reflected right back at him.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.040
No matter how big it is...

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040
Mirrors reflect light!

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.790
Though just barely,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.810
they were finally able to defeat the leader 
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.770
Three Eyes

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.560
That was really something, Gauche.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.400
I'm alive!

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.160
Finral! Gauche! What just happened?!

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.090
I couldn't see it, but...

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.240
It's the speed of light. There's 
no way he could've dodged all of it.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.580
Take that, you bastard!

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.330
Glad you came back, Gauche! 
Way to steal all the glory, jerk!

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.510
Captain...

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.300
I'm only here because you picked 
me up that one day, Captain.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.840
I see. So I guess it's basically my glory.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.270
Captain Yami, you didn't even do 
anything! Gauche did all the work!

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.520
Shut up.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.780
Ow, that hurts, Captain Yami...

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.780
Don't get cocky just because 
you beat the scrawny dude, kid.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.070
Now, now. Captain Yami, Gauche, 
Asta, we all worked hard.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.040
Ow, ow, ow...

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.040
Yeah, except for you.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.520
What?! Wait, wait, wait!

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.130
None of this would've happened 
without my spatial magic!

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.350
Hurry up and get me back to Marie.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.960
Again, I have seniority over you!

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.640
Ow, ow, ow...

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.620
Ah, Marie... Your big brother did it.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.970
I bet you'll hug me and 
tell me how great I am.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.550
I can't wait! Ah, Marie!

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.300
Hurry it up.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.490
Again, I'm your senior...

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.200
And I told you I could only 
use my magic one more time.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.900
I have to recover my 
magic first. Just wait a sec.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.930
Tch...

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.860
Did you really just do that?! 
You, too, Captain?!

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.160
Don't make Marie wait!

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.360
Honestly... You're so useless.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.780
You're too cruel!

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.130
Looks like his own ultimate 
spell did a number on him, too.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.050
Guess he had another archenemy 
besides me. Don't worry 'bout it.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.800
I couldn't...

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.440
risk hurting you...

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.850
What are you talking about?

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.920
What? You know him? 
Sorry I beat the crap out of him.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.020
Of course I don't know this bastard.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.740
You'll understand eventually...

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.530
Yeah, I don't get it at all,

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.140
but we're going to take you back 
to Magic Knights Headquarters.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.700
You'll spill everything there is to know
about the Eye of the Midnight Sun there.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.120
Now that Hot-Blooded King of 
Hardnoses has been avenged.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.330
May he rest in peace.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.630
But he's not dead yet!

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.840
Oh, quit sweatin' the minor details.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.720
Minor?!

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.410
Now, then. Let's see, Dark Binding Magic...

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.140
Where was it again?

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.510
Oh, there it is.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.730
Dark Restraints.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.420
Hey, when are those 
reinforcements getting here?

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.650
Where are the Magic Knights?

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.540
Bah-ha! Black Bulls girl, I already 
contacted your captain quite a while ago.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.000
Captain Yami?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.940
And what a bah-hassle it was.
He wouldn't listen to a word I said.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.900
So where's Captain Yami?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.020
He should've left a while bah-hack. Bah-ha!

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.610
What? Where'd he go?

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.960
He hasn't come here!

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.760
Bah-ha?

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.010
Luca, Marco...

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.290
Bah-ha... My shift's about over.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.170
Guess I'll head home and go to bed.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.650
I wonder if my captain's awake yet. 
Guess I should report this to him.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.570
"Why didn't you report this to me? 
Do you want to get sliced in half? Skree!"

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.850
Yeah, I definitely don't want that.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.620
Man, talk about scary.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.890
Mama!

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.630
Thank goodness!

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.640
I was so scared!

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.520
Are you hurt? Do you feel okay?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.880
Uh-huh. I'm fine.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.880
There, there. You're safe now.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.170
The kids from the town!

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.140
They're all safe.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.090
The Magic Knights came to save us!

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.900
Thank you! We owe you everything!

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.710
Y-Yes, we just fulfilled our 
duty as Magic Knights.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.430
I mean, all I did was contact them, but...

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.620
But why did he go straight over 
there without stopping here first?

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.660
I got left behind.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.070
Sister Theresa also used these 
amazing spells and saved us!

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.170
There was a really scary man. 
He was covered in mud.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.030
Where are Luca and Marco? They're not here.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.180
Asta, Gauche... Say, what 
happened to the Magic Knights?

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.060
Asta?!

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.230
Luca! Marco!

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.610
Rebecca!

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.520
Thank goodness. You're safe.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.980
I was so scared!

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.620
There, there...

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.870
Sister Theresa... A-Are you all right?

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:07.630
Don't worry about me. I've still 
got at least a hundred years to go.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.630
Thank you so much for saving these kids!

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.760
It wasn't just me. Those brats...

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.560
Sister, please don't talk any more.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.080
That robe...

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.050
Asta lent it to me. He said I 
wouldn't be scared if I wore it.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.480
And he was right! I felt so
much braver. I didn't cry at all!

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.730
Well done, Marco.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.450
Wait, where's Asta? What happened to Asta?

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.730
He's still in the cave.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.520
Huh?

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.450
Well... The battle's not over.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.570
Reinforcements showed up.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.750
Sister!

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.170
Reinforcements?

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.420
The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
He called himself Licht.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.220
So Asta's fighting him?

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.520
Along with some captain named Yami and...

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.430
My brother went to help them, along 
with someone who uses spatial magic.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.180
I'm sure everything will be okay!
I believe in my brother!

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.980
Yes, you're right. Everything will be okay.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.190
They won't lose. I'm sure 
they'll come back victorious.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.400
Uh-huh!

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.960
Finral and Gauche

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.700
should've taken me with them if they 
came all the way back to town.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.580
No, that's not it! It's not 
that I'm worried about Asta!

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.960
Magic Knights! It's because 
I'm one of the Magic Knights!

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.210
Oh, jeez. Anyway...

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.740
Who are you?

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.800
U-Um, well.. It's a long story.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.750
Hey, you ready yet?

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.710
Please wait a little longer.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.320
I used a lot of magic. It's not 
going to recover that quickly.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.410
Tch...

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.620
You did it again!

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.800
Tch, tch, tch, tch! Don't let it bother you.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.360
Of course it does!

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.610
Stop making Marie wait.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.700
I didn't get any extra magic, unlike you!

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.890
Hang on... The longer we wait,
the happier she might be to see me.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.550
I guess I wouldn't mind that, either.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.390
Wouldn't mind what?

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.830
I'm not telling you a single thing about Marie!

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.810
Why?!

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.470
Anyone who gets close to Marie is my enemy!

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.730
Enemy?!

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.770
Man, I'm starving.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.440
Can't you at least bring me some 
breakfast with your spatial magic?

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.870
I'm not a delivery service.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.740
Tch...

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.080
What's the matter?

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.590
This mana...

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.980
Who the heck are those guys?

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.260
Looks like reinforcements.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.080
Spatial magic?

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.790
But that guy's passed out... So why?

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.300
Well, this definitely doesn't look good.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.570
Looks like Licht and Val 
are in a bit of trouble.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.630
I'm usually pretty lazy, but...

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.310
I gotta save my friends.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.360
Hey, that's a unique design.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.530
Not that it really matters...

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.490
Tch! He can move at light speed, too!

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.140
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.080
Ow! Man, you're annoying.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.710
But this should be easy to fix, so whatever.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.880
Light Magic: Healing Light Particles.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.220
That magic... It's the 
same as Round Eyebrows's!

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.380
You came...

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.220
I apologize. My strength alone wasn't enough.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.720
Licht, does it hurt?

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.730
Fana, now that you're here...

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.130
It's okay now.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.300
Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.670
I have nothing to worry about,
now that you're here.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.540
Huh? Who do you think you are?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.880
Licht... It's a pain in the butt if you 
try to shoulder everything yourself.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.580
How dare you insects do 
that to my comrades?

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.990
Unforgivable!

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:16.900
I'll stomp you like ants and rip you apart, 
like I'm ripping the wings off a butterfly!

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.150
I hate those who have hurt Licht.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.900
Who are these guys?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.460
Allow me to introduce them.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.410
They are the strongest three 
in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.910
The strongest?

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:39.290
Yes... In combat, they surpass me.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.300
Third Eye

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.480
The Third Eye!

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.420
They're more powerful than you?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.300
Third Eye, eh?

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.100
He has to be bluffing when he says 
they're stronger than him.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.100
It's too much trouble to bluff.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:02.860
Just as the name suggests, your kingdom
takes the clover as its symbol.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:09.720
Within the clover's leaves are 
pleasant words that do not suit you.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.870
Namely: faith, hope, and love.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.370
I've given them names that 
mean the opposite of those.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.380
With a name meaning the opposite
of faith, Raia the Disloyal.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.380
Raia the Disloyal

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.270
With a name meaning the opposite
of hope, Vetto the Despair.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.890
Vetto the Despair

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:35.770
And with a name meaning the opposite
of love, Fana the Hateful.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.770
Fana the Hateful

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.150
I will kill those who have 
hurt Licht. I will kill you.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.090
"Disloyal," "Despair," and "Hateful."

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.250
Those names sound grand and all,

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.410
but your names aren't enough 
to tell us how strong you are.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.650
Well, I guess we'll just 
have to prove it to you,

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.230
even though it's a pain in the butt.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.080
Wha—

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.240
That's...

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.170
The same as Captain Yami's!

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.670
Copy Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.790
Raia the Disloyal, was it?

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.930
Don't go ripping off people's magic!

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.430
I'm gonna sue you for copyright infringement!

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.930
Yami!

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.980
Pay attention!

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.810
Beast Magic: Bear Claw!

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.240
Damn it. My magic hasn't recovered yet.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.550
Stupid mosquitoes and dragonflies!

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.830
He dodged!

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.370
The jerk read my ki?!

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.630
Beast Magic: Bear Claw!

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.020
Now... Let me see the despair 
in your faces, little mice.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.770
That makes you taste best!

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.190
You bastard! This katana was 
custom-made and crazy expensive!

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.490
You better pay for that!

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.990
Yami...

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.280
Tch... I haven't even finished 
paying this thing off.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.970
I hate you... I'll never forgive you.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.290
I'll kill you.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.050
Salamander... That must be spirit magic.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.840
Spirit magic?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.290
The same as... Yuno?

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:44.330
Fana the Hateful, was it? Nobody likes 
hysterical chicks, you know.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.780
Looks like it's not fully 
developed yet, but...

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.770
The fire spirit, one of 
the four great attributes?

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:50.570
You can't be serious.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.030
Now, then...

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.530
Hope you're ready.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.330
I'll return Licht's pain 
hundreds of times over.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.560
You guys stay put.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.330
C-Captain Yami?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.180
Here we go.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.690
Now... Burn them to death.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.690
Well, aren't you working hard? I wonder
how long you can keep it up, though.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.190
It's futile!

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.040
Captain!

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.450
Not good. Because we're here, Yami is...

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.170
But I haven't recovered enough 
to use my spatial magic.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.670
They're on a completely different level!

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.170
Captain Yami, I'll—

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.680
I told you to stay put!

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.650
What? Are you worried about me?

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.040
You're thousands... No, a million 
years too early for that!

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.850
Just sit tight and watch!

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.360
Watch me surpass my limits, 
right here and now!

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.650
As expected, you won't go down easily.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.320
But you're wasting your time.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.740
Each of them is stronger 
than a Magic Knight Captain.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.500
I think it's about time we end this.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.530
Die.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.920
Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.260
Captain!

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.700
What just...

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.640
Looks like you're having fun, Yami.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.220
Let us play, too.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.400
Stronger than a Magic Knight Captain?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.180
Why don't we test out that theory?

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:31.460
Aw, man... Another second or two, 
and something would've awakened in me.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.230
What're you gonna do about this,
you lousy so-called friends?

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.440
I'm amazed you can even say those 
words when you look like that.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.990
I'm going to execute you myself someday, 
so be ready and wait, foreigner.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.200
Look who's talking.
You and your stupid haircut.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.550
Honestly, how pathetic are you that 
you actually have to rely on us?

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.500
Man, harsh as always, I see.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.320
It can't be...

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:57.880
Who are those guys?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.230
What?! They're Magic Knight Captains!

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.030
Oh...

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.250
You need to show more interest 
if you're a Magic Knight!

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.640
I only care about Marie.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.350
I'm surprised you even know my name, then.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:16.400
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises
Jack the Ripper

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:15.030
The captain of the Green Praying Mantises, 
Jack the Ripper, who uses severing magic.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.600
He's super sadistic, has a destruction fetish,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.900
and likes to brag whenever he 
cuts anything and everything.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.360
Apparently he cut down a mountain 
after a squabble with Yami.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.160
Oh.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:31.180
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.700
The warhorse, the royal captain 
of the Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.120
Just look at his sparkly aura. 
Man, is he hot!

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:34.920
Oh.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.670
Captain of the Blue Rose Knights
<font size="30">Charlotte Roselei</c>

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:41.610
The captain of the Blue Rose Knights,
the cool and beautiful Charlotte Roselei!

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.340
You're excited all of a sudden?!

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.010
She's so beautiful! I want 
to get closer to her!

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.150
So, three Magic Knight Captains...

00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.780
Hmph. It doesn't matter how many people...
no, vermin show up. They're no match for us.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.240
I will kill those who 
harm Licht... All of them.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.070
Now, then, let's get things started.
 I'll chop you all up.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.740
The Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.250
We have plenty of questions for you.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:59.270
Petit Clover

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.360
Petit Clover!

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.810
So Tired

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.530
So Tired.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:08.360
So tired. Spring is nice and warm, 
and I can sleep well.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.770
Sleeping on the beach 
in summer is the best.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.830
Autumn is for food, autumn is for art...

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.650
And winter is for hibernation.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.720
He's just sleeping all year round.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.700
I have trouble falling asleep, so I 
hate everyone who can sleep so easily.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.720
Just wish these voices would shut up...

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.440
Man, I'm tired.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.400
But I'm slightly awake now.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.320
Three Magic Knight Captains
showed up, after all.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.740
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 37: 
"The One With No Magic."

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.000
Page 37
The One With No Magic

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.700
I get to fight the prickly lady.
