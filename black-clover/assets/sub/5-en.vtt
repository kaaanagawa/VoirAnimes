00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.660
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.680
At the royal capital of the Clover Kingdom, 
the entrance exam for the Magic Knights,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.680
who protect the kingdom under 
the Wizard King, had begun.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.730
In the final part of the exam, 
the candidates were paired off

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.830
to battle using their grimoires.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.490
Begin!

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.740
No holding back, all right?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.670
Let's do this, Asta! Bah-ha!

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.710
Bronze Creation Magic: 
Sekke Magnum Cannonball!

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.370
How do you like my magic?

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.730
It's bronzified and protects me
as it shoots out magical bullets.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.470
It's offense and defense all in one!

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.600
It'll block all of your lame attacks, 
which will show off my defensive powers,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.480
and then I'll finish you off 
once you've worn yourself out.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.890
There's no need to hold back.
Come at me! Bah-ha!

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.380
The Path to the Wizard King

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.730
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.390
I know, yeah I know

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.650
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.990
I dreamed it all my life

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.520
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.540
Don't care how much I fall

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.010
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.330
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.460
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.840
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.100
Someday I will write the next page

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.600
You are my hope

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.350
Like that page from someday

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.690
I was able to meet you

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.650
I call this a miracle

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.540
Well, we know who's going to win.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.240
There's no way some kid from the 
boonies can break through that.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.630
Man, I wish I was fighting that kid.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.650
What's the deal with that shabby grimoire?

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.300
Can he even use magic?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.860
Stupid hick peasant.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.890
You're never going to make it 
into any of the squads, kid!

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.440
There's no need to hold back.
Come at me! Bah-ha!

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.690
Now... Make sure you struggle as much 
as you can to make things exciting!

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.360
Sure thing.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.070
Here I go.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.250
He's fast. Is he using some kind of 
high-speed movement magic?

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.630
No... He's just physically powerful.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.590
Huh?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.260
Huh?

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.610
Huh?

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.250
I'm not joining

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.730
the Magic Knights so I can have a
good time and avoid working hard.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.570
I'm here to work my butt off 
and become the Wizard King!

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.820
That grimoire...

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.730
Well, well...

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.330
I'm the one who's going to defeat you...

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.030
Asta!

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.540
Is that sword... magic?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.460
Wasn't he just some loser from the boonies?

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.010
What the heck?

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.460
Who is he?

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.180
He just...

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.570
...said something about the Wizard King.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.500
All of you shut up! I told you,
I'm going to become the Wizard King!

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.260
You got a problem with that?!

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.900
Is he stupid?

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.690
What the heck is that peasant 
from the boonies saying?

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.450
Must be embarrassing,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.170
being a completely delusional idiot.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.940
Just get outta here already, you stupid brat!

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.700
Who're you calling a stupid brat?!

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.910
Could it be some kind of creation magic?

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.950
Amazing...

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.350
Judging from the other parts of the exam,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.990
it didn't seem like he had 
that much magical power.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.290
He's not using magic.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.160
Huh?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.930
Actually, maybe it's not 
that he's not using magic...

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.970
It's that he doesn't have any magical power.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.790
Come to think of it, I didn't 
sense any mana from him.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.060
And yet, he wants to become 
the Wizard King, huh?

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.610
Looks like we've got a 
strange one on our hands.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.940
Bah... ha...

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.730
Man, royalty's so strong.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.270
They have way too much magical 
power and talent to begin with.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.060
S-S-S...

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.960
S-So cool!

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.420
On second thought, maybe the shrimp
really is just a small-time lame-o.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.590
No kidding. His opponent must've 
just let his guard down too much.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.340
"Yuno," wasn't it?

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.930
You seem to be having a hard 
time finding an opponent.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.180
Why don't you pair up with me?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.440
Isn't that...

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.680
Salim?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.970
From the famous Hapshass family?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.700
You may have been chosen by the 
four-leaf, but you are no noble.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.950
I'll show you just how far below us nobles
you are, both in status and power.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.450
Oh, and of course, in wealth, too.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.210
Begin!

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.140
You should know that it's an 
honor just to be able to fight

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.890
the great Salim de Hapshass.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.980
You can tell the tale for the rest of your 
life when you go back to your village.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.900
I'll at least treat you to
a noble's ultimate attack:

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.650
The Holy Lightning Rising Salim.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.500
Yuno...

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.540
I'll even pay for your trip back home.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.150
Wind Magic: Towering Tornado.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.460
Salim, a noble, was defeated in an instant!

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.200
Y-You can't be serious!

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.580
That was awesome!

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.160
Oh?

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.230
Amazing. I want to be his friend, too.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.180
Wow, not bad.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.170
Yeah.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.780
This concludes the exam.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.940
Now...

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.990
Candidates whose numbers are 
called, please step forward.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.270
The squad captains will raise their 
hands if they would like you

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.850
to join their squads.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.810
The candidates will decide if 
they would like to accept or decline,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.510
and if they are chosen 
by more than one captain,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.110
they may choose which 
squad they'd like to join.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.490
But if no one raises their hands,

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.370
that candidate will not
 join the Magic Knights.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.370
And you will leave immediately.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.200
Candidate #1, step forward.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.910
Y-Yes, sir!

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.880
Number 32, no offers.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.260
Number 40, no offers.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.260
Number 45, no offers.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.810
Number 67, no offers.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.900
Wow, someone finally raised their hand.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.390
Awesome.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.110
Number 71, the Purple Orcas.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.910
Number 78.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.850
I shall welcome him.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.570
The Crimson Lion Kings.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.830
Number 99, the Coral Peacocks.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.510
Number 116,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.790
no offers.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.330
Damn it!

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.110
Number 141...

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.780
No offers.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.410
Well, I guess I expected that.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.350
I'll just go back to my 
village and till my fields.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.390
Scary...

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.150
Next, #164.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.900
Yes, sir.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.750
Yuno!

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.580
All who wish to offer, please raise your hand.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.420
What?

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.330
Seriously?

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.920
All of the captains...

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.540
...raised their hands?!

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.730
Th-That's amazing.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:43.090
I-I thought that only royalty and 
nobles could join the Golden Dawn.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.690
Even the Silver Eagles? Seriously?

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.970
But he's a kid from the boonies!

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.560
All of them! That's amazing!

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.730
N-Nothing less from my rival!

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.950
I'll take the best path to 
becoming the Wizard King.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.240
Please allow me to join the Golden Dawn.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.160
They took a good one.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.330
But I wanted to be his friend...

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.340
Oh, well. Can't be helped.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.230
Next, #165.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.870
Oh. I guess that kid's next.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.300
I can't let Yuno get ahead of me!

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.100
I'm ready!

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.100
All who wish to offer, please raise your hand.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.320
I don't care which squad it is... 
Someone, please raise your hand!

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.820
Number 165...

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:49.830
No offers.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.630
N-No way...

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.510
Go on, scram! I'm up next!

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.810
Not yet... I'm not done yet!

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.430
You're a disgrace!

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.480
No... I... I'm...

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.280
Well, that's no surprise.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.820
Yami?

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.580
No matter how high your combat skills are,

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.500
if the source of your power is unknown, 
no one wants anything to do with it.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.900
In the end, the only thing 
desired from a Magic Knight

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.470
is their magical powers.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.270
Wh-What's going on?

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.450
Hey, Yami?!

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.330
S-So much pressure!

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.880
This is...

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.710
the magical power of a 
Magic Knights Squad captain?

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.520
And since you have no magical powers,
 no one wants you.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.770
That's the cruel reality.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.320
You said earlier that you wanted to 
become the Wizard King, didn't you?

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:56.200
Which means you're going to surpass 
the nine captains here, right?

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.690
Now that I'm standing before you,
do you still have the nerve

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.870
to say that you're going to be the Wizard King,

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.130
even without any magical powers?

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.390
E-Even if I can't join the Magic Knights today...

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.060
No matter how many times I fall,

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.150
no matter what anyone says to me,

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.650
I'm still going to become 
the Wizard King someday!

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.170
You're funny, kid.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.110
Join my squad.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.180
Huh?

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.980
I'm telling you that I'll let 
you join the Black Bulls.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.130
By the way, declining isn't an option.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.690
What?!

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.370
I'll make life so miserable for you in the
Black Bulls that you'll be torn to shreds,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.450
so be ready for that.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.200
What?!

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.000
And then, someday,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.460
become the Wizard King.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.400
Yes, sir!

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.320
Number 512, no offers.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.410
This concludes the Magic 
Knights Entrance Exam.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.090
Good work!

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.680
Don't worry about it.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.770
Try again next year!

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.420
Asta...

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.450
Yuno! You're Golden! I'm a Bull!

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.930
This is where our true battle begins!

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.970
Yeah. Let's see who'll—

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.990
N-Nature's calling pretty loud!

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:31.070
Was it the grilled purple snake 
I ate to psyche myself up?!

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.450
It's coming! It's ready 
to stick its head out!

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.550
After humiliating me in front of everyone,

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.620
don't think I'm just going 
to let you leave, Asta.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:53.530
Because of you, I was only offered a 
position in one of the lower ranking squads,

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.670
the Green Praying Mantises!

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.530
I'm a frickin' bug!

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:04.220
You're just a hick from the boonies.
You think </i>you<i> can become the Wizard King?

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.970
Life ain't that simple.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:13.020
Bronze Hex Magic: Sekke's Poison Lizard.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.650
I'll test your luck for you.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.860
Eat lizard poison!

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:25.310
If your luck's bad, you'll be 
bedridden for life. Bah-ha!

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.220
Huh?

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.460
What are you doing?

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.960
Four-leaf...

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:44.100
B-Bah-ha! I was just going to give him a 
little scare. You know, as a parting gift.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.600
T-To see who'll make it 
further in this world.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.100
Then get lost.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.110
You're no match for Asta.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.820
Oh, I just remembered! I have somewhere to be.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.470
Tell Asta bye for me. Bah-ha!

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.310
That feels so much better.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:15.250
Man... It all came right out. 
I have no regrets or poop left in me.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.660
All right.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.810
Let's go.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.270
You've got some nerve, making me wait.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.340
How long does it take you to take a dump?

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.030
Actually, it was really something!

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.200
It was long and huge...

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.490
That's not what I meant!

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.910
Who asked you to start talking 
about your turds, you moron?!

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.420
Let's go, Finral.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.570
Right-o.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.170
What's that?

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.200
Since you can't magically fly,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.930
you're going to have to learn 
some transport magic, too.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.090
Oh, wait. You don't have any magical powers!

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.090
Ow! What the heck?!

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:19.040
Er, sorry to bug you, Yami, but it's a 
bit hard to keep a gate this size open,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.490
so could you just go through quickly?

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.130
Who do you think you're ordering around?

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.010
Tough it out, and surpass your limits.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.410
What?!

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.160
Off you go.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.260
So tired...

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.630
Ow...

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:51.470
Black Bulls' Base

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.790
This is the Black Bulls'...

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.690
Well? Pretty magnificent, isn't it?

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.070
It's actually pretty run-down.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.690
Welcome to the Black Bulls.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.910
Starting today, I'm also going to be...

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.210
All right!

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.460
I'm Asta from Hage Village!
 I'll be joining the Black Bulls tod—

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.130
Oh, dear...

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:31.130
Welcome to the absolute worst
Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:45.540
No one can escape from here

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:52.290
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:21:54.010 --> 00:22:00.630
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:06.980
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.510
I've thought many times

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.220
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:21.720
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:28.650
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:35.930
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:42.790
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.420
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.360
Petit Clover

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.810
Petit Clover!

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.860
Hyped Up!

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.860
Hyped Up!

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:15.870
The Guy Yuno Defeated:
<font size="30">Salim</c>

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.840
I'm getting hyped up!

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.050
Sekke! Your Sekke Magnum 
Cannonball has such a cool name!

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:23.880
The Guy Asta Defeated: 
<font size="30">Sekke</c>

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.130
Bah-ha!

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:23.880
Your Holy Lightning Rising Salim
isn't so bad, either. Bah-ha!

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.880
Sekke, I believe we could 
be the best of friends.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.090
Bah-ha!

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.620
Not a chance...

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.390
We did it!

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.890
We're finally the Magic Knights
we always hoped to be!

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.230
B-But what the heck? It looks 
I ended up in some crazy place!

Not giving up is my magic!
