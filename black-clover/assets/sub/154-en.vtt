WEBVTT

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.070
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.660
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.950
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.610
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.970
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.820
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.670
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.380
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.890
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.040
The Magic Knights Squad Captains

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.440
held a meeting to decide who would 
go train in the Heart Kingdom.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.820
From the Black Bulls, Asta, Nero, Luck,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.360
Finral, and Noelle.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.660
From the Golden Dawn, Mimosa.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.950
From the Crimson Lion Kings, Leopold.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.000
From the Blue Rose Knights, 
Charlotte nominated herself.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
And Rill from the Aqua Deer 
also nominated himself.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.750
These were the members who were about 
to train with the Spirit Guardians.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.590
At the special decoration 
ceremony that followed...

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.100
Those who shone brightest in the battle 
against the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.330
Leopold, Sol, and Mimosa, were promoted.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.180
Also...

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.650
Yuno of the Golden Dawn,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.230
you have been promoted to 
1st Class Senior Magic Knight.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.950
Yuno was promoted to 
1st Class Senior Magic Knight.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.740
And then, the king decided 
he had to have his way...

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.740
With my authority as king, I give Sekke...

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.170
the title of 1st Class Senior Magic Knight!

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.300
F-First Class Senior Magic Knight?!

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.510
What the bah-ha?!

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.230
And Sekke was also promoted to 
1st Class Senior Magic Knight.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.280
Meanwhile, there was a 
member of the Black Bulls

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.680
who was fretting over the fact that he 
wasn't picked to go to the Heart Kingdom.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.520
Please! Let me go!

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.030
I'm a true man, 
and I can't be left behind again!

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.030
Even if you tell me not 
to go, I'm going to go!

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.040
You up to that?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.530
Yes, sir!

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.800
Who the hell cares about 
how much mana you have?!

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.040
I'll surpass the limits of a peasant!

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.580
Fine. I'll try asking Julius.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.590
Back at the Golden Dawn's headquarters,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.960
not everyone was happy about 
the fact that Yuno was

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.390
promoted to 1st Class Senior Magic Knight...

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.430
The Golden Dawn's Headquarters

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.430
So Yuno's a 1st Class Senior Magic Knight now.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.530
That's the same rank as Vice Captain Langris.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.660
The kid's only been in our 
squad for about a year.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.890
Yes, but I can't say I'm surprised, 
given how powerful Yuno is.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.260
Vice Captain Langris hasn't been

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.250
on a mission since what happened 
with the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.360
That probably means Yuno's going 
to be the next vice captain.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.430
Everyone in our squad is 
talking about that right now.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.800
I'm sure they are.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.620
Langris and Yuno... 
They're both amazing mages,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.840
but if we're talking about who's 
actually fit to be vice captain...

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.760
V-Vice Captain Langris!

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.410
H-Hello! Are you out for a walk?

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.220
It is a lovely day for a walk, isn't it?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.740
Please enjoy!

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.730
Farewell!

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.980
That probably means Yuno's going 
to be the next vice captain.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.240
Vice Captain Langris Vaude

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.120
Don't you think it's about time?

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.260
Time for?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.850
For you to resume your 
duties as vice captain.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.670
Our battle with the Spade Kingdom draws near.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.280
I'd like you to watch over the squad mem—

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.130
May I just...

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.400
have a little more time?

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.800
Has my brother contacted you lately?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.020
Look at these.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.120
Letters?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.010
Finral could just use his 
spatial magic to come visit.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.440
But he's been regularly 
delivering letters to me.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.050
I'm sure he believes that 
distancing himself from you

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.740
is a part of his training.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.170
What? Did you catch a cold?

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.420
Looking cute again today, Noelle!

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.760
Why don't we get some tea—

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.140
You'll never break your 
curse this way, Finral!

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.890
So what has he been writing in his letters?

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.140
That he'll be going to the 
Heart Kingdom to train soon.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.590
He actually told you that?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.760
If he's having to go to 
another kingdom to train,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.000
does that mean there's another 
big battle drawing near?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.600
Huh?

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.160
I tried asking Finral personally...

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.920
Since, you know, he's terrible
 at keeping secrets.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.370
Langris?

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.390
There's nothing for you to 
worry about, Miss Finnes.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.640
Is something on your mind?

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.540
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.960
You and Finral really are alike.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.610
Please don't compare me to him!

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.320
I'm sorry.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.960
N-No... I should apologize.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.440
Are you all right?

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.490
Yes.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.630
You should head back inside. 
I'll take my leave, as well.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.580
Don't worry. It's just my usual cough.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.030
Well, despite how I may look,
 I am rather busy.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.880
Oh, did you return to your 
duties as vice captain, then?

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.610
Thank you for the tea.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.940
Check.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.000
So that's your play.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.780
See? I told you that you 
should've bet on Shiren.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.880
The game isn't over yet.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.410
Say, Yuno! Isn't today a 
perfect day for a date?

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.900
Where should we go? I'm okay with wherever.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.050
Hey, are you listening?

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.110
Vice Captain Langris...

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.770
Hey, you!

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.440
Just because you're jealous of Yuno and me 
doesn't mean you need to scowl like tha—

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.650
Do you need something?

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.530
I'd like to spar with you.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.830
You're a 1st Class Senior 
Magic Knight now, aren't you?

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:03.490
As another 1st Class Senior Magic Knight,
 let's see if you're qualif—

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.060
All right.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.290
Yuno?

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.150
W-Wait, Yuno!

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.900
Vice Captain Langris, I ask 
that you calm down, too!

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.720
You calm down, Klaus.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.170
I'm not trying to pick a fight.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.400
Come in.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.560
Please excuse me.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.050
Vice Captain Langris has 
asked Yuno to spar with him.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.950
Langris did?

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.970
I have a bad feeling about this.
I hope nothing happens.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.470
You can count on me, Yuno!

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.210
You don't need to hold back!

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.830
A normal sparring session is no fun.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.970
How about we agree that the loser...

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.600
leaves the Golden Dawn?

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.250
Honestly, what a vulgar bunch.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.320
You should be more careful about 
who you associate with, Yuno.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.500
Aren't you embarrassed to be seen with them?

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.800
Why?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.090
I've never thought that, not even once.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.050
I'm proud of Asta, and he's my rival.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.050
Rival? That guy?

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.850
Rival in what? Are you guys 
competing for something?

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.040
Yeah...

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.360
We're both working to 
become the Wizard King!

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.690
What's your problem?! I won't 
allow you to make fun of Yuno—

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.070
There's no rule that says commoners 
can't become the Wizard King.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:20.980
Huh?

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.630
So first, I'll become the 
Captain of the Golden Dawn.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.450
I see. Meaning you're completely 
ignoring my existence as vice captain.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.050
You mentioned that before 
you became the Wizard King,

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.720
you'd become the Captain of 
the Golden Dawn, didn't you?

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.100
If you win, then I, the vice captain, will leave.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.950
Meaning you'll be another 
step closer to captain.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.930
Not a bad deal, right?

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.600
Let's just get started.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.680
That's like adding fuel to the fire.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.020
This probably won't be over quickly.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.820
Yes.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.640
There will definitely be blood.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.920
Who are you betting on?

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.360
Neither!

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.970
We must stop them.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.500
Then let's start... this sparring session!

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.420
The boulder just disappeared.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.170
I guess talking's out of the question.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.640
Vice Captain Langris...

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.180
He's not going to hold back?

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.180
Too bad... I guess you dodged it.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.520
Third time's the charm!

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.020
Wind Creation Magic: Wind Blade Shower!

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.780
Whoops.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.040
What's that look for?

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.790
I don't know what you're thinking, 
but would you stop holding back?

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.990
You think I'm holding back?

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:04.800
If you were fighting seriously, you would've
 been able to dodge that attack.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.300
And if you don't take this seriously,
 you'll get hurt.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.310
Why must you be like that?

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.060
Something tells me that Yuno's 
not just trying to provoke him.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.210
What did you just say?

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.320
Do you really need me to say it again?

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.900
I see. So you do realize that was rude.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.070
In that case, I won't hold back!

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.830
This is what he used back then!

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.080
This is the spatial magic that

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.380
Vice Captain Langris used at the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.090
I'll show you what happens 
when I don't hold back!

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.710
Spirit Assimilation: Spirit Dive!

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.100
Take this!

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.100
Mana Zone: Spirit's Hushed Dance.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.300
Amazing!

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.100
Well done, Yuno!

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.140
Spirit Storm!

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.620
That spell is the one he was using 
when he was possessed by an elf...

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.230
The auto-defense spell!

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.630
But he should've only been able to use 
that spell under the elf's influence.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.300
The feeling of mana from when 
I'd reincarnated as an elf

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.630
is still faintly present.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.140
Now, let's see how long 
you can keep dodging!

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.030
Yuno's crown!

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.160
It was gouged away!

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.590
What's the matter? Are you just 
going to keep running away?!

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.920
This is the end!

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.280
Yuno!

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.390
What?!

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.940
An afterimage?

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.150
You're right. It really is the end.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.410
Yuno...

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.850
He's all right.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.400
But that means the vice captain...

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.500
Who did I bet on again?

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.660
Like I'd know.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.910
I lose.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.380
What's that face for? 
If you want to laugh, then laugh.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.010
I gave it my all, and I still lost to you.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.230
You only got serious in 
the middle of the match.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.040
You intentionally tried to lose at first.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.360
I guess you saw right through me.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.300
That's right. I was going to intentionally 
lose to you and leave the Golden Dawn.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.530
But now what?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.030
I actually tried, and still 
pathetically lost to you.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.030
Who's pathetic?

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.060
Do you really think 
I won that match easily?

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.820
That's true. Yuno...

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.050
...definitely didn't win easily.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.300
What does that matter?!

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.320
You won, and I lost!

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.440
Which just means I'm going 
to leave the Golden Dawn.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.810
As promised.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.230
I don't remember making this prom—

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.810
Maybe you don't, but I do.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.820
You can't be serious!

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.570
Take care of the Golden Dawn for me.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.320
Are you seriously quitting?

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.570
I don't feel like I've won.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.920
Who knows what would've happened 
if you were serious from the start?

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.390
Promise me that one day,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.290
you'll spar with me without holding back.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.230
I'm sorry I did this without 
consulting you first.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.650
I'm not surprised.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:41.550
You didn't need to create an excuse to 
leave the squad right in front of them.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.320
So you saw through me.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.290
That's just how I am.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.800
I know. And I know that 
this isn't the end for you.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:57.210
This doesn't change the fact that 
you're a member of the Golden Dawn.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.300
Thank you very much.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:01.950
Please excuse me.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.390
I'll be waiting for you, Langris.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.890
Langris, why are you dressed like that?

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.960
I'm going on a journey.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.460
Did you really quit the Golden Dawn?

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.290
I did not.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.050
I just happened to make a silly promise.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.490
I see...

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.420
Good morning, Miss Finnes!

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.290
Langris? Why are you dressed like that?

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.940
And did you come here to see Miss Finnes

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.560
one more time before 
leaving for your training?

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.780
Huh? Well, yeah.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.570
I'll be the one who makes Miss Finnes happy!

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.510
I'll become a man worthy of you, 
and then I'll come for you.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.920
Please try not to take too long.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.580
There's something I forgot to tell you both.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.920
I still haven't decided to 
let you have Miss Finnes.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.680
Huh?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.310
Who do you think you are, Brother?

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.310
Brother... The battle's only just begun.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.970
You're about to go training in the 
Heart Kingdom! Eat up! Eat your fill!

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.450
Thanks! Don't mind if I do!

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.960
I can't eat another bite.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:55.920
Is it just you guys?

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.410
Magna and Luck said they were going 
to hold off on eating a bit longer.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.340
I see.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.180
If you guys actually see me,

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.300
I'm sure you'll end up inviting 
me to train with you, too.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.830
You weren't picked, so you're not going to the training

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.060
But I plan to train under my 
father and excel in curse magic,

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.590
so I'm going back home.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.590
It's unfortunate, but I can't go with you.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.020
So I'm going to leave without being noticed.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.130
How can you eat so much?

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.070
I'm going to surpass my digestive limits!

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.600
Did someone just walk by us?

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.990
You're just imagining things.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.940
Yeah?

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.000
Mister Yami! What happened with 
me going to the Heart Kingdom?

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.750
They said they didn't mind 
another one tagging along.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.550
Thank you so much, Mister Yami!

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.550
If you're gonna thank someone, thank Julius.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.430
Hell yeah!

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.560
Congratulations, Magna!

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.440
Thanks, Asta!

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.720
Man, I'm thirsty!

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.310
What's that tasty juice from 
the Heart Kingdom again?

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.400
Tasty?!

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.210
You mean the crimson orange juice?

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.260
I can't wait to try that!

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.820
If you put your mana into it,
 it gets sweeter, right?

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.490
It gets sweeter?!

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.040
Yeah! It's just super sour for me!

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.100
What are you complaining for? 
I used my mana on yours.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.000
Anyway, tomorrow you'll 
be in the Heart Kingdom.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.750
Make sure you give it your all in 
training with the Spirit Guardians.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.050
Right!

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.950
I'm going to become stronger...

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.520
so that I can defeat the devil Megicula.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.490
Petit Clover

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.600
Petit Clover!

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.990
If You're Going to Quit
 Being Vice Captain

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.190
If You're Going to Quit Being Vice Captain.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.000
I'm sorry I did this without 
consulting you first.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.250
If you're going to quit being vice captain, 
you'll be in charge of lunch.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.130
In charge of lunch?!

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.940
If you don't like that, I guess 
you can be the chalkboard eraser.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.510
The chalkboard eraser?!

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.970
Or maybe in charge of the school animals.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.510
In charge of the school animals?!

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.400
I hate you!

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.060
Heck yeah! Training!

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.730
I'm gonna train! I'm gonna train! 
I'm gonna train! I'm gonna train!

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.840
Jeez, shut up, Stupidsta.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.530
I really hope they strengthen your brain, too.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.320
