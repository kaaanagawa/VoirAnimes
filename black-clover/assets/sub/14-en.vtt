00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.680
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.650
In a certain world,
where magic is everything...

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.350
Asta and Yuno were abandoned 
on the same day at

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.300
a church in the village of Hage, 
which lies in the boonies.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.600
They both dreamed of becoming the Wizard 
King, the highest rank among mages,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.530
and worked hard every day.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.950
In the year they turned fifteen,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.370
they both received grimoires,
which enhance the owner's magical powers.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.500
They then took the Magic Knights 
Entrance Exam to join

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.210
the Magic Knights, which are 
led by the Wizard King.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.920
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.390
As a result, because Yuno possesses 
immense magical powers,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.060
out of the nine squads, he chose 
the elite Golden Dawn to join.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.270
As for Asta, who had no magical powers,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.980
he ended up joining the squad 
of rogues, the Black Bulls.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.820
I'm still going to become 
the Wizard King someday!

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.470
Thus the two finally took the first step 
toward becoming the Wizard King.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.140
Wh-What's going on?

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.970
Wh-What the heck is this?!

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.360
Sir, there's trouble. An anomaly—

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.050
An anomaly has occurred, right?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.620
Well... Let's have them work on this mission.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.290
Them?

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.810
I would always close my eyes

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.010
And cower at reality

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.770
I can't stand the idea

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.230
Of just making excuses to give up

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.100
Stand right there

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.400
I don't want to be near you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.350
Any minute now

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.940
Just wait right there

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.940
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.100
Black and blue

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.990
I'll give up on giving up

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.160
And get the world on my side

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.830
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.160
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.470
And head where the light shines

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.300
I want to keep my promise

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.850
I'll deliver it to you

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.820
shape of love

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.570
Dungeon

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.820
Black Bulls' Base

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.840
Hey, Magna. Let's fight. No holding back.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.110
Nine hundred eighty-two...

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.050
Nine hundred eighty-three...

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.830
No way, you battle-obsessed freak.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.650
Nine hundred eighty-four...

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.830
Oh, come on. Let's do it.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.070
Nine hundred eighty-five...

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.060
I'm gonna eat your pudding.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.730
Nine hundred eighty-six...

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.460
If you do that, I'll—

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.890
Nine hundred eighty-seven...

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.410
Will you fight me?!

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.340
Will you?!

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.140
No.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.890
Nine hundred eighty-eight...

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.490
Aw...

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.050
Nine hundred eighty-nine...

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.050
Silvantus Schnauzer.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.420
Nine hundred ninety...

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.890
I think something else would be better.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.850
Nine hundred ninety-one...

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.200
Let's see... Like "Wine"!

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.400
Nine hundred ninety-two...

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.370
Nine hundred ninety-three...

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.650
Wine?

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.100
Nine hundred ninety-four...

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.770
I will allow you to borrow a single letter

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.210
Nine hundred ninety-five...

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.040
from the name of my little sister,
the goddess Marie.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.930
Nine hundred ninety-six...

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.580
I will let you take the "M." Be grateful.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.440
Nine hundred ninety-seven...

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.530
Make it something cooler!

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.200
Nine hundred ninety-eight...

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.200
Like, let's see...

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.180
Nine hundred ninety-nine...

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.920
Magnam Fire!

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.920
One thousand...

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.670
Lame.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.380
One thousand and one...

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.010
You have no taste, Lady Noe.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.920
More like <i>you</i> don't.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.070
One thousand and two...

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.710
Thinking of names looks like fun.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.530
One thousand and three...

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.570
I thought of one, too. I wonder if 
they'll ask. I think it's a good name.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.570
One thousand and four...

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.740
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.740
One thousand and five...

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.940
Can I fatten that bird up? 
He looks really yummy.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.370
One thousand and six...

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.940
One thousand and seven...

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.820
Absolutely not!

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.360
One thousand and eight...

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.820
Does he lay eggs?

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.800
Huh?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.780
Definitely Toritaro!

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.390
No, it's Silvantus Schnauzer.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.360
Toritaro!

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.350
Silvantus Schnauzer!

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.810
Toritaro!

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.680
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.950
The heck was that for, Toritaro?!

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.400
There, you see?

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.220
You prefer Silvantus Schnauzer, don't you?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.090
Right? Right?

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.760
Magnam Fire!

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.760
"M."

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.890
Wine!

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.930
Why not Nero?

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.600
What?!

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.260
Looks like he approves.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.900
"Nero" means "black."

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.020
Nero?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.980
All right, listen up.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.810
Mister Yami! Hello!

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.120
We're back, everyone.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.730
Welcome back.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.760
What did they want at the castle?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.960
If it's a mission, I want 
to go with everyone, too.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.570
Mission? Is it a mission?

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.930
I have an announcement for you all.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.350
A new dungeon has been discovered.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.070
A dungeon?!

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.770
Are you serious, Mister Yami?!

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.480
What the heck is a dungeon?!

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.790
Huh?

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.650
Are you serious? You were surprised, 
and you didn't even know what it is?

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.030
I just went with the flow!

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.870
Talk about predictable!

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.800
Listen up. Dungeons are...

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.680
Kind of like ancient tombs that contain
relics made by the people from back then.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.160
Sometimes they have info 
about powerful ancient magic

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.690
or super rare magical items.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.260
They're absolutely amazing!

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.150
But you know...

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.260
The people back then set 
insane magical traps in them

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.080
so that they wouldn't get misused by anyone.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.310
They're super dangerous and really fun!

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.630
The Magic Knights always investigate them
since they're so dangerous,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.570
and to make sure none of 
the treasures get stolen.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.540
Oh, okay!

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.650
I see.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.180
Which means the Black Bulls are 
supposed to investigate this

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.870
newly discovered dungeon?

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.360
Yes.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:10.380
Clover
Kingdom

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.750
Particularly because this dungeon 
popped up near our enemy's border.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.380
Dungeon

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.800
Enemy?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.380
Diamond
Kingdom

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.380
The Diamond Kingdom.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:17.890
We need to take care of this mission fast 
so Diamond's people won't steal anything.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.620
By the way, there have been instances 
in which someone found a magical item

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.220
that could change civilization
itself in a dungeon,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.120
and someone even learned how 
to use the ultimate magic there.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.160
Me! Me! Please let me go!

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.040
I might be able to use 
the ultimate magic, too!

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.970
You don't have any magic, 
so that's not happening.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.740
You never know!

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.540
Actually, you can go, kid.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.750
In fact, the Wizard King chose you himself.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.250
Huh?

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.020
Huh?!

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.050
The Wizard King?! Why?!

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.710
That's awesome, Asta!

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.960
What the heck? Did you bump 
into the Wizard King somewhere?

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.270
No, never!

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.810
The Wizard King chose me!

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.620
I don't know why, but...

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.940
Great Wizard King!

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.780
Asta the Unworthy will give
his all on this mission!

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.800
Noelle, you're also going with him.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.820
Huh?

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.820
Everything counts as experience.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.090
Oh, and Luck.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.720
You're the leader.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.050
I'm leaving those two to you.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.050
Really?

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.970
Yup.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.680
You'll lose your touch if you 
stay cooped up all the time.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.800
Yay!

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.300
Listen up. Make sure you 
look after the newbies.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.130
Leave it to me!

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.830
I want to go, too. I wish 
they'd take me with them.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.790
Be careful.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.500
Asta! Lady Noe! Give it your all!

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.430
Got it!

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.820
I guess I don't have a choice.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.140
I think I'll go find some cute girls, then.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.290
Huh?

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.620
May I go see my sister?

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.630
If you're prepared to die.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.680
The sunset is beautiful from here.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.950
I recommend this location for dates.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.770
I'll have some nummies ready 
for you when you get back!

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.300
We're counting on you.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.430
Got it.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.440
Okay!

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.420
Let's see... It's this way.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.730
They could've just dropped us off 
right in front of the dungeon.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.960
Finral's only able to go to 
places he's been to before.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.430
But thankfully, it was 
still near the dungeon.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.000
Let's go!

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.730
Why the heck did you come?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.740
I wonder how the Wizard 
King even knew about Asta.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.490
That guy...

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.320
is able to see things we can't.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.500
He's also a weirdo.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.020
It's so dark.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.420
Don't cling to me. It's hard to walk.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.310
Wh-Who's clinging?

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.930
I can't see anything!

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.050
Ow...

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.830
Hey, could you not step on my foot?

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.450
I can't help it! It's pitch black in here!

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.300
Stop being so pissy.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.970
It's all because you broke the lamp!

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.840
Honestly, you have some nerve.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.820
It's your fault for tripping 
and running into me!

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.990
How dare you? I'm royalty!

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.180
So what?!

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.250
Insect.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.510
Is this it?

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.850
W-Wow!

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.640
What the heck's going on with this place?

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.170
What is this?

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.020
Looks like the space is 
warped because of magic.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.570
There's even stronger mana floating 
around here than outside.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.020
Yes. I've never been anywhere 
this full of mana before.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.080
Really?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.270
Are you saying you can't feel all this mana?

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.910
Not at all.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:44.090
Amazing. I guess people who don't 
have magic really are different.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.050
Shut up!

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.400
I want to feel mana, too!

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.250
I want mana!

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.170
Must be nice being one of you royals!

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.560
You have a ridiculous amount of mana!

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.380
In my body, I don't have even an ounce

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.610
of the foundation of magic... Mana!

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.400
God damn!

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.120
Huh?

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.660
T-Trap magic?

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.620
That was dangerous. Be more careful.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.160
My bad.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.180
Here it is, Asta.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.680
This.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.310
Where?

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.500
Hup.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.650
What was that for?!

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.780
That was amazing!

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.590
Listen, you!

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.450
Oh, there's another one.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.830
Hup!

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.930
Whee!

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.050
And another one!

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.190
This is so much fun!

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.690
Isn't this exciting?

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.690
We're going to die if we stay with this guy.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.190
I wonder if those kids are okay.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.410
The more dangerous the mission, the more 
newbies will surpass their limits and grow.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.800
I think.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.360
You <i>think</i>?

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.210
Well, Luck's with them, 
so they should be fine.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:51.400
His ability to detect mana is off the charts.
It's even greater than a noble's.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.840
If his personality wasn't so messed up, 
any other squad would've taken him.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.850
I think it's that personality 
we're worried about.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.490
Yeah.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:10.570
Man... Your anti-magic weapon is amazing.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.860
I wonder if that's why the 
Wizard King chose you.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.060
I'd love to fight you for real 
in about two to three years!

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.910
If you're prepared to keep swinging 
your sword around like that,

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.880
this dungeon won't be any problem.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.790
Got it!

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.610
Now, then...

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.880
I think I'm about to reach my limit.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.240
I knew it.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.610
There are others here.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.300
The strongest looking one is...

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.410
Lightning Creation Magic:

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.330
Holy Lightning Boots.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.330
Something important just came up.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.920
So I'm leaving the dungeon 
exploration to you guys!

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.620
Hey, where are you—

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.680
Wh-What in the world is he thinking?!

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.040
S-So cool!

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.020
This is insane!

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.970
Left turn next...

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.960
I can't wait to see how 
strong this person is!

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.510
Honestly... He's unbelievable.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.710
Captain Yami clearly told him to 
keep an eye on us, and he just left!

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.090
Don't worry.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.230
No matter what kind of traps might spring up,
I'll slice through them with my sword.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.300
Must be nice being as carefree as you.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.270
This dungeon ain't nothin'!

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.820
I'm going to become the 
Wizard King, after all.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.260
Again with that?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.130
I'm gonna become the Wizard King before Yuno.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.200
Yuno?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.880
Yeah. I haven't told you about him before?

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.970
He's a childhood friend
I grew up with in Hage Village.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.580
We took the Magic Knights 
Entrance Exam together,

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.410
and he got into the Golden Dawn.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.650
That's amazing, isn't it?

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.420
He got into the Golden Dawn 
without being a noble.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.170
Yeah! He's amazing!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.200
But I'm not gonna lose to him!

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.850
I guess even he has his own goal.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.680
Come on. Let's go.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.520
Looks like we can cross over there.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.860
Let's hurry!

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.020
We're alone right now.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:56.530
Silvantus... I mean, Nero's with us, but...

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.570
Something wrong?

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.210
It's nothing! Nothing at all!

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.080
Let's hurry.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.100
A trap! Oh, no!

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.210
Noelle!

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.390
S-Such powerful magic...

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.030
Run!

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.240
Asta!

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.820
Oh, no!

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.920
Crap!

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.520
What the heck?

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.210
Such precise and powerful magic...

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.830
Who could it be?

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.100
Oh, come to think of it...

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:42.260
Apparently, a few from the Golden Dawn 
have also been assigned to that dungeon.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.590
Huh? The Golden Dawn?!

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.140
I wonder if they'll be able to get along.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.610
Now...

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.280
I've repaid my debt,

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.280
Asta.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.570
Yuno...

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:34.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.570
And push me forward

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.610
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:44.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:50.390
And change the flow of time

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.620
(Break free yourself)

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:26.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.340
Petit Clover

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.810
Petit Clover!

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.840
What's Mana?

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.840
What's Mana?

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.400
Asta, do you know what mana is?

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.490
Yup!

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.140
Mana

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.140
It's written like this!

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.350
Mana

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.350
It's written with the same 
character for "magic"!

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.580
Serious

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.190
These both mean "serious"!

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:05.820
Yes. Mana is a powerful energy 
that exists in this world.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.820
Yup! And everyone has it...

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.820
Except me!

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.450
Mages use up their mana to use magic.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.430
That's why if they run out of it,

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.460
they might not be able to use 
magic again until they recover.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:22.960
Do you understand?

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.500
Yes!

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.020
What a lovely flower!

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.300
Perfect for giving to a girl.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.340
Finral!

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.000
Wow, you're so aggressive!

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.880
I've never met a flower like you!

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.440
You've got really powerful magic, mister.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.400
Let's fight with everything 
we have, to the death.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.910
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 15:
"The Diamond Mage."

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:55.250
Page 15
The Diamond Mage

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.740
Not giving up is my magic.
