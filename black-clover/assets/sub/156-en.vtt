00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.050
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.530
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.620
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.250
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.960
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.760
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.600
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.280
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.380
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.800
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.890
In order to learn the Mana Method
 and acquire new powers,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.860
Asta and the others train their 
hardest in the Heart Kingdom.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.070
This time, I'll get you!

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.540
The power to nullify magic is unrivaled.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.580
But your vision is so narrow that you can't 
use your powers to their full potential.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.490
Not yet!

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.470
And this man was making his move, too.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.720
Looks like they're all trying 
to surpass their limits.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.220
So I guess I need to work a bit harder, too.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.230
Awakening Powers

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.580
Lightning Magic: Tenjiolia.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.640
I've been sparring with him for days now,
 and I still can't get a hit in!

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.570
If I wasn't holding back, 
you'd be in far worse shape.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.790
The extremely rare power known as anti-magic,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.000
physical strength that you've trained 
to your limit, and your friends

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.030
are what have led you to victory thus far.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.040
But the enemy we're about 
to face is far too powerful.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.290
If you cannot defeat me on your own, 
you will not be able to defeat the devil.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.790
Please let me have another try!

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.800
Is it his unwavering willpower that 
has strengthened him to this point?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.230
No, it's not just him.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.480
Some of the mages who came 
from the Clover Kingdom

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.710
have already started creating 
techniques of their own.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.550
Faster... I need to be faster.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.950
I need to be stronger!

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.410
Leopold...

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.660
I know I should be able to do more... More!

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.380
Those were great moves, Leo.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.800
You're able to use the 
Mana Method faster now, too.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.110
It's just...

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.040
Hmm, how do I put this?

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.730
Every now and then, you seem to 
waver a bit when you're fighting.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.160
It feels like something's making you hesitate.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.830
Is there a reason why?

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.530
I have an older brother and 
an older sister that I look up to.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.140
Their strength is burned into 
my eyes. I cannot unsee it.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.040
The stronger I become,

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.090
the more I realize how much higher 
up my brother and sister are.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.550
Stand up.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.170
Lions should never look so pitiful.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.340
The more powerful I get, the more 
out of reach they seem to become.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.980
No matter how hard I try, I can't help 
but think that they're stronger than me.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.940
Flame Magic: Calidos Brachium!

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.910
Man, it's hot.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.360
Heya, Sisgoleon.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.160
Who are you calling Sisgoleon, you fool?

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.320
Did you come for a dip in the hot springs, too?

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.790
Why not go defeat one of the magical 
beasts around here while you're at it?

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.040
Jeez, were you fighting so you 
could enjoy a nice, long bath?

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.970
You sure are violent, aren't ya?

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.970
Hah. I couldn't even call this a warmup.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.650
I'm sure you couldn't.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.000
So in that case...

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.730
How about fighting me?

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.520
Oh? What brought this on?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.430
Yeah, about that.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.320
In that last battle with the devil,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.360
I was able to use the Mana Zone 
or whatever it's called.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.040
But I still don't really get it, 
and I think I could take it a bit further,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.120
so I wanted to give it a try.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.840
Give it a try? With me?

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.570
Well, you're more experienced 
with Mana Zone, aren't you?

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.840
Help a newbie out, will ya?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.500
Very well. I was just thinking 
I hadn't had enough.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.870
But are you sure about this? 
Before you even get to try,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.310
your body might not even hold up!

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.940
Yikes. Not only is she ready, 
she's ready to kill me.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.570
Yeah, I'm going home. Sorry to bug you.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.810
I guess that's not gonna work, is it?

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.580
Looks like you're ready 
to be devoured by a lion.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.820
Then again, if you don't come at me like that,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.090
I won't be able to surpass my limits, either.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.090
As you wish, I'll burn you to a crisp!

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.960
Black Meteorite!

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.920
Is he tracking my mana?

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.160
In that case...

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.140
Ow...

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.000
If I can figure out how your technique works,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.810
I can figure out many ways to deal with it.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:28.980
Would you like to continue fighting until 
you cannot use your anti-magic anymore?

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.650
What the heck am I supposed to do?

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.780
How do I get my anti-magic to reach him?

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.390
Mana and anti-magic...

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.530
They are fundamentally different,

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.990
but the power to create 
and the power to nullify

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.790
are similar in that they 
are both a form of power.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.240
Which means the way to use them 
shouldn't be that different, either.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.540
The basic technique in using the Mana Method

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.800
is to feel the flow of mana.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.460
Which means the thing you 
need to do right now...

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.100
...is to feel the flow of anti-magic!

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.620
She's faster than my ki can track.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.610
Is that all you've got?

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.230
You can't win if you just keep running away!

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.950
How the hell is she so fast?!

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.200
But if that's also

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.450
thanks to Mana Zone, 
I should be able to do it, too!

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.750
Too slow!

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.300
Here, get an up-close feel for what 
you can really do with Mana Zone!

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.090
Well... what to do?

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.100
Hot! Hot!

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.570
I guess I should've expected 
that from the Mana Zone expert.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.880
She's definitely something else.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.700
I guess you're as crazy as ever,
 you violent lioness.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.450
There's no fun in catching weak prey.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.720
Try struggling more!

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.500
If we're just fighting with speed, 
I'm definitely at a disadvantage.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.460
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade!

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.350
Black Divider!

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.890
He disappeared?!

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.410
So you're trying to make your 
blade longer to reach me.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.480
But you're too slow.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.330
Even if I can sense him with 
my ki, I can't keep up.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.040
As long as I use the Mana Method
 to increase my speed,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.200
I'll have no problem dodging.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.570
The mages of the Heart Kingdom

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.100
borrow power from natural mana.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.960
Depending on the level of their Mana Method,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.470
they will have unlimited use of their mana.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:09.560
Which means that so long as your attacks 
don't reach me, my mana is limitless.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.320
If I keep using up my anti-magic,
 I'm going to lose.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.710
What was that?

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.630
This is pathetic.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.990
Before the devil has a chance to end you,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.460
I wouldn't mind giving you 
your last rites here and now.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.940
I'm already grateful that you're 
helping me out with my training.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.220
There's no need for you to do that, too.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.410
I guess I can't even get in the 
ring with you unless I can use

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.690
that superhuman walking-through-the-air bit.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.770
Think... I need to figure out 
an attack that can reach him,

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.670
but one that's fast enough so he can't dodge!

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.030
I've now seen the powers of the Demon-Slayer
 Sword and the Demon-Destroyer Sword.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.030
Does that sword have some 
special power, too?

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.870
That's right. The Demon-Dweller Sword...

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.140
It must have some power 
that I haven't drawn out yet.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.130
That reminds me. Back then,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.950
I was able to unleash the mana 
that I borrowed from Noelle.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.710
I might be able to do the same 
thing with my anti-magic!

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.810
It appears as though 
you've found your answer.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.270
I'd like another try, please!

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.060
Very well.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.430
I won't be holding back 
as much on this attack.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.320
If you can hit me even once, 
I will declare you the winner.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.160
I'd prefer if you didn't hold back at all!

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.330
If you're not going to 
make a move, then I will!

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.560
And now, I'm gonna kick the air!

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.230
Lions hurl even their young 
into bottomless valleys.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.590
I'll have no problem hurling you into the lava!

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.860
Are you seriously chasing me right now?!

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.350
But, I mean... Sisgoleon's right.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.850
If I lose here...

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.650
I'm not gonna stand a chance against a devil!

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.610
Oh?

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.740
Guess we're finally on equal ground.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.950
Equal ground? What are you babbling about?

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.040
I'm just saying we're in 
the same position now!

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.520
You're a babe who just learned 
how to walk! Know your place!

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.400
I've gotta do something 
about that superhuman punch.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.760
Just like when I borrowed 
Noelle's mana last time...

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.770
I need to infuse the Demon-Dweller 
Sword with my anti-magic!

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.770
Now, as you wish, I will 
show you my true strength.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.490
I just need to keep increasing 
my speed with Mana Zone,

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.120
and not give her a chance to use magic!

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:16.250
I see. Looks like you can 
use Mana Zone somewhat now.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.170
I guess there's no reason for 
me to hold back any longer.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.510
You actually thought you were 
holding back? Seriously?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.040
I'll now thank you for 
showing me a good time.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.010
Try not to die from it.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.760
Can I actually stop all of that?

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.780
Well, I'm gonna have to!

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.910
Don't doubt that you can do this!

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.160
You're just gonna have to!

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.380
Right here, right now... 
I'm gonna surpass my limits!

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.040
Mana Zone: Dark Magic: Black Hole!

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.050
This is...

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.600
Is he nullifying my mana?

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.350
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.380
There!

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.160
Well done.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.660
Heck yeah! I got a hit in!

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.700
Things are finally getting interesting!

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.880
I'll turn you into ash and 
enjoy a nice, long bath!

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.090
Nah, I got the gist of it, so I'm gonna go.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.970
What? Are you scared?

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.190
Anyway, see ya.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.390
Well, that's no fun.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.580
If you'll now begin your reports. Potrof?

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:16.130
Rill and Charmy are getting the 
hang of using the Mana Method.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.910
They're geniuses, to be honest.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.140
The best thing I can do is 
help bring out their potential

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.170
and prepare their meals.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.800
Huh... Charlotte and Mimosa are amazing, too.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.470
They're fighting like, "kaboom," 
and getting better like, "fabam"!

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.640
If we're talking about 
how much they've grown,

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.770
I'd say Noelle and Nero have grown the most.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.380
Of course, they are being trained by the

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.910
Queen of the Heart Kingdom 
and the Water Spirit,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.060
so of course they're going to get stronger.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.070
Looks like you're proud of your students.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.110
Smurik, how is Finral doing?

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.760
For the time being, let the wind guide us

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.940
and help us nurture the storm within him.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.330
You can never just get to the point, can you?

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.100
Did you say something?

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.120
I couldn't hear you over 
the whispers of the wind.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.750
N-Now, now...

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.170
Floga, how about you?

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.980
It appears that Leo is 
doubting his own strength.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.510
Why not concentrate on your strengths?

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.680
My... strengths?

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:31.170
You may not be the most talented, 
but you're patient and don't give up.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.130
Your technique is getting 
more powerful every day.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.740
You have the strength to endure.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.930
You're you, remember, Leo?

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.040
The strength... to endure?

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.600
I want to draw out potential 
that he hasn't realized yet.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.420
That's my idea.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.650
Yes, I'm counting on you.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.880
How's Asta doing?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.630
Since he wields anti-magic, he is 
our trump card against the devil.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.380
It appears as though he's becoming 
stronger in his own way.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.680
We don't have much more time.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.900
Please focus everything 
you have on this training.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.040
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.690
Let us defeat the Spade 
Kingdom and the devil.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.950
Spade Kingdom Garrison

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.900
There are so many of them.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.500
Their preparations for the invasion are almost 
complete. We don't have much more time.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.300
That's...

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:52.810
Rejoice! You will contribute to 
the prosperity of the Spade Kingdom!

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.750
Hey, where are we going?

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.030
Shh! Quiet!

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.990
Come on, now! Get up!

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.570
We can't go out there right now, Ralph.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.730
I know.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:12.510
If we can get through that strong 
magic region, and even one of us

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.990
can reach the Clover Kingdom...

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.550
That's the little hope we have left.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.140
We'll just have to hang on to that!

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.280
Let's go!

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.730
Hello, foolish rebels.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.020
Your friend told us all about you...

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.100
in exchange for their 
precious daughter's life.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.990
Let's make a break for it!

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.770
I'll move up the ranks if 
I bring back your head!

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.930
It's that simple.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.270
Ralph?!

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.260
Ralph!

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.940
What are you—

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.460
We leave you with our mana.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.920
Please, Ralph...

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.320
For him...

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.260
You must follow in your father's footsteps...

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.400
You're not getting away!

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.590
Go!

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.070
I promise I'll get there!

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.540
I'll get to them...

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.870
Just beyond this cliff 
is a strong magic region.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.160
Will I be able to get through?

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.220
No...

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.180
I can't let their sacrifice go to waste.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.930
I am my father's son!

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.050
I will see this through!

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:45.890
There he is!

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.920
Get him!

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.610
I cannot be defeated here.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.280
Lord Yuno!

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.110
Did we do it?

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.510
I'm not sure.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:17.580
But even if he's still alive, 
that's a strong magic region.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.420
It won't be long before he perishes.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.820
Yeah.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.620
Foolish Resistance. Serves them right.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:26.670
Let's head back.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.830
We're too close to the strong magic region.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.540
Who knows what will happen 
if we hang around too long?

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.450
Yeah.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.190
Spade Castle

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.070
The son of the former commander of 
the Mage Defense Force's 1st Division?

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.700
Yes. According to what another 
one of the rebel scum told us,

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.550
apparently his name is Ralph.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.900
His name appears in—

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.880
It doesn't matter.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:22:00.780
A single fly isn't going to 
bring any harm to our plans.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.790
Who am I, you ask? I guess I wouldn't
mind telling you a little about me.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:50.170

Page 157
Five-Leaf Clover

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.670
Within the clover's fifth leaf resides a devil.
