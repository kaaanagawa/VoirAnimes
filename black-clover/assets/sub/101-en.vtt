WEBVTT

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.840
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.340
Bring it on!

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.020
Go, Le Chateau de Verre!

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.560
We won't lose...

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.230
...to you!

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.250
Asta and Yuno worked together to 
defeat Klaus and Hamon, but then...

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.000
Licht?

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.730
The real Licht finally made his move.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.790
The Lives of the Village in the Sticks

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.620
I can't find an opening with him.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.660
In that case, I'll...

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.460
Not yet...

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.760
Not yet...

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.890
Not yet!

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.350
How about this?

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.900
Mana Zone...

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.980
Spirit Storm!

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.500
Not yet!

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.250
What the hell is with those two?!

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.390
Yuno is my...

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.180
Asta is my...

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.010
...rival!

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.020
He blocked our attack with that sword?

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.900
He's condensing a phenomenal 
amount of magic...

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.750
Yuno's wind?

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.180
That's some hole you opened up there, Licht.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.620
You sure that was okay, though?

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.190
You sorta blasted your sword 
and grimoire along with it.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.430
Guess he can't talk just yet.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.870
That grimoire... no longer belongs to me.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.390
Licht...

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.880
Let us go, Raia.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.290
Licht is definitely here. 
That's all that matters right now.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.390
Asta!

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.450
Jeez, what's his problem? 
Yuno's all wet now!

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.600
What if I catch a cold?!

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.550
Next time I see you, 
I'm giving it right back to you!

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.570
Zora...

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.870
This way. The Silver Eagles' 
captain is over here, too.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.130
They're just unconscious.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.930
Hey, Raia.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.050
Hey, Ado.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.500
How have you been?

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.990
Not too bad.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.060
He hasn't awakened yet?

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.820
Yeah... We'll probably just 
have to wait patiently

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.900
until he completely awakens.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.230
Indeed.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.200
How about everyone else?

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.780
One moment.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.270
It's been so long, everyone! 
About 500 years, is it?

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.000
I'm glad you all seem well.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.000
Well, let's go...

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:33.510
To get our other friends, 
and to destroy the humans.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.530
I passed out!

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.900
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! My whole body hurts!

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.470
And I'm soaked! Everything hurts!

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.470
You sure are loud when you wake up.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.040
Ugh! You're making my 
ears go all stupid, stupid!

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.920
Who're you calling stupid—
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.920
Stupid.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.300
Asta... Thank goodness.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.610
Mimosa! I'm glad everyone's 
okay—ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.970
Wait, where the heck 
did their hideout go?!

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.160
This really sucks,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.170
but while you were asleep, it started
 heading toward the royal capital.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.180
Wh-What?! Wait, Zora—ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.470
You actually did come back alive...

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.730
Just how lucky are you, you little shit?

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.570
Where's Mereoleona—ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.320
She's still pleasantly knocked out.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.320
Thank goodness she's okay...

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.140
Doesn't seem like she's 
waking up any time soon.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.410
And she'd probably kill us if we woke her.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.830
Thank goodness we're all okay.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.530
Mushroom guy and the Captain 
of the Silv—ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.340
Well, the other two became our enemies.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.020
With my mushroom smokescreen and

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.100
with Nozel's magic's mobility, 
we somehow made it out.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.600
I see... So others also—ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.100
Asta of the Black Bulls...

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.800
He managed to escape from 
a situation that left

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.860
even Mereoleona unconscious.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.370
I'm gonna recover some stamina 
with these herbs—ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.310
Here, have some!

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.450
Uh, okay.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.700
You can't be serious. 
You're not supposed to eat those raw.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.240
You'll get a tummy ache.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.180
B-But Asta gave these to me... 
I'll eat them, even if they're raw!

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.210
Magic Item: Eilia's Booth.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.650
It's a magic item that explosively heightens 
your body's natural healing ability.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.370
You lot can use it.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.170
Th-Thank you very much!

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.890
I-I can actually feel the 
pain starting to fade!

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.480
Letting us use such a high-level magic item...
Thank you so much, Nozel.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.250
I don't know how he can see past that hair, 
but maybe he's not such a bad guy.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.390
Yuno, may all your owies... 
fly over to that shrimp!

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.870
Don't send them to me!

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.530
Do you hurt anymore? Are you okay?

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.470
Yeah.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.830
Thank goodness!

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.330
Everyone! You're safe!

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.750
Noelle!

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.460
Noelle, and...

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.090
...a really beaten-up Kirsch!

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.110
Mimosa's bro! Get your butt in here!

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.720
I'm still beautiful, 
even when I'm covered in blood.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.350
This is not the time for that!

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.100
I'm even beautiful when I'm being healed.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.690
Who's this guy? Is he stupid, too?!

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.940
Noelle! Where are the others?

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.230
I'm not sure what happened, 
but Luck turned into an enemy.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.620
Even Luck?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.940
The fellow from the Crimson Lion Kings, too.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.540
The same happened to us with Klaus and Hamon.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.740
Same with Rill and some others.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.950
No...

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.210
They're all pathetic.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.580
U-Uh... Look at you! A-Are you okay?

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.370
I'm perfectly fine. I'm overflowing 
with magic right now.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.180
Oh, fine. I'll explain it to you.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.790
Who do you think you are? I'm royalty!

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.950
Who cares?! I'm the Wind Spirit!

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.350
So what?!

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.670
The spatial mage who should've 
been on standby is gone.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.260
So apparently, he also...

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.950
Captain Nozel! Captain Nozel,
 can you hear me?!

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.460
What's the matter?

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.580
Captain Nozel! Thank goodness! 
I finally got through to you!

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.940
What's that?

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.080
It's a special communication magic 
item that all the captains use.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.010
A number of our squad members 
suddenly went berserk

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.830
and started saying strange 
things like, "We're elves!"

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.970
They have way more magic than usual! 
We can't handle them on our own!

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.860
Apparently, similar incidents are 
happening with all of the squads.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.850
There's something going 
on all over the kingdom—

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.140
What's wrong? Come in.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.800
The same thing is happening 
all over the kingdom?!

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.830
Well, this sucks.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.400
We are Magic Knights.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.900
We must save the Clover Kingdom, 
no matter what happens.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.950
Even if we have to kill 
our fellow Magic Knights.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.420
And even if we get killed.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.290
Luck...

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.170
Luck's attacks didn't hit me.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.180
Whoopsie. It's been so long, I missed.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.060
...get up close and personal.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.480
Despite how fast he was, 
we were able to get away.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:37.980
I think...

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.360
Luck made sure that would happen.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.230
He did hit me, though.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.650
Good.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.190
That must mean Luck's soul is fighting, too.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.370
Just as Yuno is doing okay,

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.740
I'm sure the others will be 
able to regain their senses!

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.630
There must be a way.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.670
We, the Magic Knights, are going to save them!

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.130
Both the kingdom and our friends!

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.460
Yeah!

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.130
Yes, let's.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.020
All right...

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.020
Let's go!

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.980
What the heck is going on?

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.410
Just after those swords of light were 
about to fall on us, they disappeared...

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.720
Then the demon's skull started shining.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.090
I'm so scared.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.770
Hey... Over there!

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.590
What?

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.540
What now?

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.550
A golden... dawn?

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.830
No... That's not it!

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.800
Something's coming.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.150
It's flying toward the royal capital.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.800
What the heck is that?

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.270
Those are my friends.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.970
Friends?

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.680
That robe is a Magic Knight's robe.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.650
U-Um... Pardon me, Sir Magic Knight.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.530
It appears that you humans

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.680
have increased your numbers 
tremendously in the past few centuries.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.770
Um...

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.350
This must be the region where the 
ones with weakest magic reside.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.050
And as you move toward 
the center of the kingdom,

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.780
that's where the ones with the 
most powerful magic reside.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.180
It appears that you humans still 
practice this senseless discrimination.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.470
He is a Magic Knight... right?

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.040
I think so.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.410
It appears that you weaklings are the 
ones being discriminated against now.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.050
You truly are selfish creatures.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.680
Wh-Who are you?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.160
We do not discriminate.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.190
We will bring death upon 
all of you humans equally.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.230
Poison Plant Magic: 
Zhovniir's Garden of Lingering Burns.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.620
All right! I'm completely healed!

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.650
Wh-Why did you have to strip?!

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.460
I was just checking to see 
if all my wounds healed!

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.880
Hurry up and put your shirt 
back on! Are you stupid?!

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.610
Now that I've completely healed, 
I'm even more beautiful!

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.130
I wish you hadn't healed.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.570
Her wounds have completely healed, 
but she still shows no sign of waking up.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.850
Let her sleep.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.660
Thank you so much for this!

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.650
It's disposable, so dispose of it.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:08.400
Really?! Well, it's super pretty, 
so I'll just keep it!

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.860
Do as you please.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.530
We should be in the Forsaken Realm soon.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.040
What's wrong?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.870
Looks like some place is 
already being attacked.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.170
That's...

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.210
...Hage Village!

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.250
That's our hometown! We need to save them!

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.050
No.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.460
We have to reach the 
royal capital immediately.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.880
Protecting the kingdom means that 
protecting the royal capital comes first.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.390
My hometown is part of this kingdom, too!

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.830
If you insist on going, 
the two of you can go alone.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.500
But you two are vital in battle.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.940
Deal with this quickly, then head 
straight to the royal capital.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.150
Yes, sir!

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.620
I'll go, too.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.480
You may not go, Noelle.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.210
Nozel?!

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.900
You are royalty.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.240
You're going to come with 
me to protect the castle.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.500
Together with you?

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.880
Your existence itself is unnecessary.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.920
You do not belong here.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.270
Begone.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.560
Understood! I shall accompany you!

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.790
I always thought it was strange... 
that I had this type of magic.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.560
Poisonous plants? Really?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.170
But I finally understand why.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.780
It hurts...

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.930
Help... me... It feels 
like my body is burning...

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:03.680
It was so I could weed out all 
these pointless, unnecessary lives.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.520
Water Creation Magic: Holy Fist of Love!

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.500
There are no unnecessary lives!

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.220
Father...

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.240
You'll be okay!

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.310
It looks like a few of you 
can use decent magic.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.500
Are you what the humans call nobility?

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.670
Then again, <i>all</i> humans 
are powerless before us.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.460
What the heck is that monster?

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.830
How can you do something so awful?

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.220
I don't know what happened to you,

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.470
but what did the people of 
this village ever do to you?

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.980
We're just trying to live 
our lives out here.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.470
S'okay! Owies, owies, go away!

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.570
We cry...

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.140
Ugh! I don't get this at all!

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.240
We face hardships...

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.790
I really don't know how we're going 
to make it through the winter.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.740
We suffer, but still...

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.730
Tatoes again?

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.540
No complaining.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.710
I love tatoes!

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.810
Your tato dishes are delicious, Sister.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.490
If you don't want yours, give 'em here.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.220
Who said I didn't want them?!

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.570
Of course I'm gonna eat them!

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.380
W-Water!

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.790
Still, we laugh and have dreams.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.700
We're living the best we can!

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.440
There's no way we should 
meet such a sad end!

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.420
That's right!

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:40.950
Orphans like us, who are poor... 
aren't allowed to dream like that.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.620
Nash...

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.320
You can't give up right from the get-go!

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.580
Possibilities exist in everyone!

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.410
It doesn't matter if you're 
poor or an orphan.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.850
Anyone in this world can become amazing.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.660
They can do anything.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.380
They can make their dreams come true.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.970
They can make everyone happy!

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.780
And I'll prove that to you!

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.120
If, just if, and it's a very huge if...

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.680
If you get into the Magic Knights...

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.480
Yeah?

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.240
I'll believe in possibilities. 
I'll believe I can become anything.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.320
And then one day, I'll get into 
the Magic Knights, too.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.700
No, never mind.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.270
After we leave, you'll be 
the biggest brother here!

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.570
Make sure you protect everyone. 
We're counting on you, Nash!

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.180
True... No one should have to face a sad end.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.130
That's why I'm going to eliminate 
the root of all sadness: humans.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.100
Poison Plant Magic: 
Zhovniir's Garden of Lingering Burns.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.350
S-Sister! Don't you dare touch her!

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.560
Nash! No!

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.080
Asta... Yuno?

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.730
Father! It's Asta! Asta's here!

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.190
Yuno, too!

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.220
Good job fighting...

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.510
...Nash!

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.010
Yuno... Asta...

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.940
Leave the rest to us!

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.490
Petit Clover

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.610
Petit Clover!

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.990
Kirsch's A-I-U-E-O

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.350
Kirsch's A-I-U-E-O.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.710
A-I-U-E-O, "A."

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.160
Ah, I'm so beautiful.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.590
"I."

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.960
It's great (ii). I'm beautiful, 
and it's great (ii).

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.490
"U."

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.500
I-I'm beautiful (utsukushii)?

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.950
"E."

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.340
Eh? Yes, I'm beautiful.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.380
"O."

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:35.020
Oh... I'm so beautiful. Oh... Oh!

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.700
I wish you'd wilt like your 
stupid cherry blossoms.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.520
Leave the rest to me.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.770
I don't know who you are,

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:47.230
but you'll pay for putting everyone 
in Hage Village in danger.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:51.360
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 102: "Two Miracles."

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 102
 Two Miracles

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.990
Is there some kind of pattern on my face?
