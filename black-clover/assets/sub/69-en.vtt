WEBVTT

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.660
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.880
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.510
The Wizard King gives stars
to the Magic Knights Squads

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.460
for every achievement they accomplish.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.740
The squads compete to obtain the most stars.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.310
The Star Festival is where the
 number of stars each squad

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.780
has accumulated in that year 
is announced to the public.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.780
While the usually peaceful 
Star Festival was going on,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.240
Yami and the captain of the 
Green Praying Mantises, Jack the Ripper,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.830
decide to battle it out 
over something insignificant.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.700
Abra and cadabra.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.500
Their issues were resolved by 
an unexpected turn of events,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.380
and everyone returned to the Star Festival.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.040
The Briar Maiden's Melancholy

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.830
Wow, she's so beautiful.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.730
She's so elegant.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.240
Is she from some wealthy family?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.070
Hey, go talk to her, man.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.730
No way! How could I?

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.980
She is super pretty. I bet 
Finral would love her.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.530
Truly exquisite. I've decided.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.660
You will be my companion tonight.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.330
That's Baron Balmain from 
the House of Bamilton.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.910
First, let us enjoy this festival together.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.550
Come with me.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.140
Ignoring me, are you? You've got some nerve!

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.430
Just who do you think I am? I'm—

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.230
Hey!

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.020
Huh?

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.730
That would be my line.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.820
We don't get to enjoy festivals 
like this every day,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.860
Blue Rose Knights Squad, 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Sol Marron

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.860
so let's doll ourselves up a bit, er...

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.740
Who do you think I am?

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.950
This magic...

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.890
She's the captain of the Blue Rose Knights!

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.330
Blue Rose Knights Captain
Charlotte Roselei

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.920
Whatcha doin', Sis?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.640
Call me "Captain."

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.800
You got it, Sis!

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.670
Come with you?

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.510
Were you planning to use 
me as some accessory?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.310
And without my consent, no less.
What were you thinking?

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.580
The House of Bamilton? I belong 
to the House of Roselei.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.810
Did you think you could approach me 
so casually because I'm a woman?

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.660
Is there a single way in 
which you are superior to me?

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.970
Honestly... where did Asta run off to now?

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.600
Well, he did take quite a flight.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.600
I don't think I've ever seen so many people.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.330
Feel free to take my hand at 
any time so you don't get lost.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.130
What's going on?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.890
What's the matter? Use your magic 
to do something about my briars.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.230
Woohoo! You go, Sis! You're as cool as ever!

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.050
Call me "Captain."

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.320
You got it, Sis!

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.370
Wait, wait, wait! 
You're supposed to stop her!

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.900
That guy's seriously gonna die!

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.280
Is something wrong? Did you find Asta?

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.950
Looks like some drunk is 
dancing naked over there.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.890
It's nothing for royalty to see.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.750
H-H-Hey!

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.140
Hi there.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.450
You're...

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.570
The little runt from the 
distinguished service ceremony!

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.290
Who are you callin' a runt?!

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.080
I mean, you're definitely a little runt.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.140
Shut up, you giant woman!

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.100
Huh? What was that, you little mouse?

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.560
You want me to stomp you?

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.180
Please don't!

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.270
More importantly, Sis!

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.970
Call me "Captain."

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.370
You got it, Sis!

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.280
I found this super awesome dress!

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.450
What I have on right now is fine.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.990
I know you'll look great in it, Sis!

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.240
Come on. Let's go!

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.240
H-Hey!

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.510
Stop it, Sol.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.000
Come on, don't be like that!

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.980
Woohoo! Your skin is as 
lovely and pale as ever!

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.770
It's smoother than marble!

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.500
Hey, stop that!

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.300
Drinking at a festival is 
on a whole 'nother level!

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.580
Yeah! Eating at a festival makes the 
food taste even more delicious, la!

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.000
S-So many people!

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.860
I'm so embarrassed! Nom...

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.190
Oh, wow. It really is delicious.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.650
I wanted to come with Marie.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.340
It tastes special somehow.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.170
Maybe it's because we're at a festival.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.660
Oh, it must be because I'm 
with you, Big Brother!

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.370
Festivals get me so pumped up! 
The inner man in me is raring to get out!

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.960
I know, right? Wanna fight?

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.460
Hell no!

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.150
Festivals...

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.700
By being able to enjoy a different environment
than we ordinarily experience in our lives,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.490
our bonds become even stronger...

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.740
It's such a special day.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.640
An unforgettable page in
 our book of memories...

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.030
I'm zero for five today. 
I'm doing worse than usual.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.150
Sniffity, sniffity, sniff-sniff...

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.820
I smell an extremely beautiful lady.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.030
Pardon me!

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.110
What's his problem? There are plenty 
of pretty girls right here.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.900
Talk about rude!

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.490
More importantly, 
what's taking the captain so long?

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.210
You look awesome, Sis!

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.550
That helmet you always wear looks 
great on you, but so does this!

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.550
A goddess... I'm truly in the 
presence of a goddess right now.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.810
Wow, she's super pretty!

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.270
Quiet down, men. This isn't a show!

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.440
Huh?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.970
The only ones allowed to get all excited 
about Sis's beauty are the Blue Rose Knights!

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.690
What?!

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.950
Still, I can't let the other 
captains see me like this.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.200
Especially not </i>him<i>...

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.130
Seems pretty rowdy over here.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.210
Y'all enjoying the festival?

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.670
Raging Bull

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.670
Festival

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.890
Hey, kid. You still in one piece?

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.170
Hey, come on! I almost got hurt!

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.340
Huh? Like that's enough to hurt <i>you</i>.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.470
Y-Y-Yami!

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.350
Why in the world did he have to show up?

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.230
You're such a goddess, Sis!

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.250
No... I cannot lose my 
composure in front of Sol.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.580
Calm down... Calm down, me.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.700
Just wait. He might not even 
recognize me in this dress.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.990
Hey, it's Her Cold and Prickly Majesty.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.450
Badump!

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.870
What the hell's with the sparkly outfit?!

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.870
Breathe. Stay calm... Stay calm.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.630
And what about you? What are those 
strange clothes you're wearing?

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.130
Festival

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.130
Raging Bull

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.130
Especially your lower half! 
What in the world is that?!

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:58.100
Hey! You're the dirtiest, 
macho-est guy out there!

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.850
The Captain of the Black Bulls!

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.400
Huh? What's your problem?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.370
Looks like you aren't training your 
squad members properly, rose girl.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.610
Shut up! Don't you dare come any closer 
to Sis dressed in that weird outfit!

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.110
Sol, stop...

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.100
There you are, Captain! What are you doing?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.450
Come drink with me!

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.120
Oh. Hey, Vanessa.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.160
Who's this woman?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.970
I'm not sure why... but I feel like 
I can't afford to lose to her.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.420
She's the Captain of the Blue Rose Knights.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.340
Huh?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.670
This woman... She's so incredibly 
friendly with Yami.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.820
Is she a member of the Black Bulls?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.890
I'm so jealous!

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.940
Who do you think you are, glaring at Sis 
like that? You're just a Black Bull!

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.620
I'm not glaring!

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.610
A Black Bull couldn't beat Sis 
in a billion, trillion years!

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.700
A billion, trillion years, eh? Ouch.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.680
I can't let the Blue Rose Knights 
keep talking to us like that!

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.460
I can't embarrass Captain Yami any further.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.230
Hey, you!

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.670
I challenge you!

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.610
Ridiculous. There's little time left before
 our achievements are announced.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.800
Why would anyone bother to—

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.010
Huh?! There's no way Sis would lose!

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.810
Let's do this, Sis!

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.810
You're actually doing it?!

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.490
What kind of battle shall it be?

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.580
Just so you know, I'm more powerful 
now than I've ever been before!

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.370
You fool.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.710
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.130
I'm the Captain of the Blue Rose Knights.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.480
Th-This is turning into a huge mess!

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.040
What are we gonna do, Captain?

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.930
Hell if I know.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.730
Now, now, now, now, my lovely ladies...

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.430
We're at a festival, so why 
don't we all just get along?

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.720
You're a man. Stay out of this!

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.440
Huh?

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.190
You only know how to flirt 
with girls. Shut up.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.650
So mean.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.460
Then how about this?

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.440
It's perfect for a festival night! 
A battle befitting two gorgeous ladies!

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.660
A cosplay contest!

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.330
You can't be serious.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.540
What? Scared of losing?

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.710
Of course not! There's nothing in this 
world that Sis can't look good in!

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.370
Things seem rather lively over there.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.040
Well, we are at a festival.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.440
There doesn't seem to be any trouble,
 so I'm sure it's fine.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.940
Let us head to where they will announce 
the achievements. We mustn't be late.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.330
Right.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.200
The announcement of our achievements...
 I'm so nervous.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.540
There's nothing to be nervous about.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.530
We will undoubtedly come out on top.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:06.370
Right. But I think the Black Bulls 
worked rather hard, too.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.680
Indeed, they might have. 
Actually, I know they have.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.910
We must especially keep an eye 
on all of Asta's achievements.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.300
B-But he's still just a Black Bull!

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.510
They're full of problems, 
regardless of their achievements!

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.380
They are no match for us, the Golden Dawn!

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.410
Right, Yuno?

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.700
The Black Bulls are the lowest 
of the low. Them, beat us?

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.890
You can't be serious.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.640
First up, we have the Captain of the 
Blue Rose Knights, Charlotte Roselei!

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.730
The cosplay she chose is...

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.300
A sexy little witchie!

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.740
Talk about super rare! Yee-haw!

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.870
We chose the same outfit as that one witch 
just to show how much better Sis is!

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.580
The difference is super clear! 
Sexy little witchie Sis is awesome!

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.640
Of course. There's no way 
I'd lose to that woman.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.090
Also, call me "Captain."

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.840
Raging Bull

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.060
I-I'm so embarrassed!

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.930
Why must I wear something like this?!

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.810
Don't look! Don't look at me, Yami!

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.290
Actually, maybe there's a part 
of me that wants you to look.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.940
Maybe he'd be a little 
friendlier to me if I dressed

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.090
like that girl who's way 
too friendly with him.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.290
But it's too embarrassing! Don't look!

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.860
Actually, look at me!

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.340
The Blue Rose Knights' captain 
looks pretty good in that, too.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.830
This is pretty hilarious.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.010
Next up, we have a member of the 
Black Bulls, Vanessa Enoteca!

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.870
The cosplay she chose is...

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.790
No one saw this coming! 
She's dressed as a sister of the cloth!

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.880
Look at her slay!

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.630
Apparently, you don't know 
anything about guys.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.850
Guys like this sort of contrast.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.350
She's usually exposing so much 
that this is actually sexy, too!

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.140
May God watch over you all.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.620
Miz Vanessa is glowing more than usual!

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.070
This is pretty hilarious.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.320
All right, everyone! Send your magic 
powers to the girl you like best!

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.660
I'm definitely voting for the 
sexy little witchie, Charlotte!

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.700
The sister's good, too, though!

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.750
Man, I don't know which to choose!

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.000
And let's stop right there!

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.370
As for the results...

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.900
Unbelievable! They received 
the same amount of points!

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.760
It's a draw!

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.370
What?!

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.100
Hmph. This doesn't matter anyway.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.220
A draw? After I bothered to dress like this? 
I've shamed the House of Roselei.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.060
But...

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.270
I wonder what Y-Yami thinks.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.070
Does he see me in a different light now?

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.910
Then my embarrassment might be worth it.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.630
There's no way Sis got a draw!

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.530
Let's settle this once and for all!

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.830
Bring it on!

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.150
All right! Round two will 
be a swimsuit competition!

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.130
All right, you two, stri—

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.840
I think I kinda like this... 
I mean... I-I'm kidding.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.840
Anyone who agrees with him 
will endure the same fate.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.590
Our Clover Premium Beer uses ingredients 
from right here in the Clover Kingdom!

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.740
It's rich and smooth, but you can 
still taste some fruity undertones!

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.230
Try a sip!

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.240
C-Captain, you like a girl who 
can hold her liquor, right?

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.780
Huh? Where'd that come from?

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.070
Badump, badump...

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.710
Well, I guess so.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.080
Then we can drink together. Why?

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.330
R-Really?

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.080
Looks like I'm gonna win.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.840
We're going to have a drinking contest next!

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.300
This is nonsense.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.520
I've entertained you this long,
 but that's enough.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.840
They're going to announce 
our achievements soon.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.180
We're ready to go, Sis!

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.600
Let's bring her down and show 
that insolent girl who's boss!

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.970
The rules are simple!

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.580
The winner will be decided by who 
can drink the most booze in an hour!

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.790
The beer we'll be drinking is 
this special Clover Premium.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.990
One of the Clover Kingdom's best!

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.210
No chugging allowed, though!

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.890
We can't have any little ones copying us,

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.870
and we need to savor the flavor 
out of respect to the brewers!

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.120
Why is this happening?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.880
All right, let the games begin!

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.690
You got this, Sis!

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.880
I have no idea what's going on, 
but you can do it, Miz Vanessa!

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.140
It appears that this woman 
is a pretty heavy drinker.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.180
This may be a difficult match.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.730
Come at me anytime!

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.600
What?!

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.290
It looks like she already 
drank herself under the table!

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.190
I'm not drunk at all!

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.770
I can't believe she proposed 
this battle in that condition.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.610
I'm still good to go.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.110
I can win this!

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.380
S-Sis?!

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.050
Yo! She can't hold her liquor at all!

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.620
But that's another thing 
that's so cute about her!

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.500
The hell are those two doing?

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:16.650
I lost my cool because this was over Yami.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.510
What was I thinking?

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.700
A curse... I place a curse 
upon the House of Roselei!

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:31.560
When your daughter turns eighteen, 
the curse will activate.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.240
It will engulf you all and trap 
you within a cage of time!

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.060
Oh, how can this be, Charlotte?

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.210
If only we could figure out 
how to break the spell.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.070
Please don't cry, Mother and Father.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.390
I'll become stronger. Stronger than anyone else!

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.710
And I will overcome this curse!

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.310
Apparently, she raised her rank again.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.420
That newbie from the 
Blue Rose Knights is so powerful!

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.230
Not to mention beautiful!

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.620
Lady Charlotte, please marry me.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.130
No, marry me!

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.120
If you cannot defeat me, 
you could never accept my curse.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.620
I'm surrounded by weak men who are all talk.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.420
I will overcome this myself!

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.410
The curse!

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.170
The curse upon the House 
of Roselei has activated!

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.180
It's no use. We can't stop it! Ru—

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.860
It won't... stop...

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.150
At this rate, the town...

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.660
Curses! How pathetic... I'm so pathetic!

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:09.660
I'm so sorry... Mother and Father...

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.220
What the hell's the big idea, you jerk?

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.150
You flung the pasta soup 
I was eating everywhere.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.010
Yami Sukehiro? To think I'd let him see 
me in such a disgraceful situation!

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.150
What a failure I am.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:46.230
On missions, you're as cool as a cucumber 
and always raring to go. So what gives?

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.660
I like tough girls.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.170
But it probably wouldn't hurt to ask
someone for help once in a while.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:05.390
Our Magic Knights Squads are full 
of strong people you can rely on.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.510
To have my heart stolen by a man...

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.480
That was the way to break the curse.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.360
Oh, sweet. It's disappearing. Lucky for us.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.670
He's such a barbarian. 
He's so aggravating, and yet...

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.030
You can't finish it, can you?

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.580
Didn't I tell you not to push 
yourself too much before?

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.050
A-An indirect ki—

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.950
Looks like we have another draw!

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.030
Well done! Well done, Sis!

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.350
Great job, Miz Vanessa!

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.060
Festival

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.060
What the hell was this battle, 
besides a waste of time?

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.770
They're about to announce the 
Magic Knights Squad achievements!

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.260
All the captains are gonna be there!

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.460
I hear that includes the new captains of 
the Crimson Lion Kings and the Purple Orcas!

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.950
I wonder what they're like!

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.620
Uh... All the captains?

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.250
Raging Bull

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.250
Festival

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.420
We're late.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.130
Crap. What are we gonna do?

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.350
Petit Clover

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.990
Petit Clover!

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.850
Charlotte's
 Seven Transformations

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.850
Charlotte's Seven Transformations.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.350
The sexy little witchie 
getup just isn't enough!

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.980
I wanna see Sis dressed 
up as all kinds of things!

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:08.320
1. Sister Charlotte

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.330
Transformation number one! Sister Charlotte!

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.320
She's going to save us all!

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.310
Transformation number two! Bride Charlotte!

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.370
2. Bride Charlotte

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.370
Marry me, Sis!

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.210
Transformation number three!
 Samurai Charlotte!

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:17.660
3. Samurai Charlotte

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.660
Slay me!

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.790
Transformation number four! 
Schoolteacher Charlotte!

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.670
4. Schoolteacher Charlotte

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.670
Teach me all the things!

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:27.170
5. Policewoman Charlotte

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.630
Transformation number five! 
Policewoman Charlotte!

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.170
Arrest me!

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.940
Transformation number six! 
Kunoichi Charlotte, nin!

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:31.950
6. Kunoichi Charlotte

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.100
Sneak up on me!

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.050
I don't have time for this! Boom!

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.180
I thought there were seven transformations.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.060
They're finally going to announce 
the Magic Knights Squad achievements.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.020
You can look forward to 
the Black Bulls' results this year.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.800
I know because I've watched 
everything you've done without blinking.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.810

Page 70
 Two New Stars

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.740
We're friends forever.
