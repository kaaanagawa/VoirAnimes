00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.720
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.580
The Eye of the Midnight Sun 
arrived at the Witches' Forest,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.220
searching for a magic stone.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.350
Wanting to take advantage of 
the chaos they were causing,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.020
the Diamond Kingdom came to steal 
the Queen of Witches' secret.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.020
Million Lasers!

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.900
Guess I'll just have to kill this chick first!

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.400
Don't!

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.580
Your lessons got through to me.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.470
Fanzell's former student Mars, who was 
still in the Diamond Kingdom's army,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.580
decided he would side with him.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.290
Why are you protecting us?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.900
As Ladros said, we're traitors.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.170
And you lost your memory...

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.640
Don't worry. I'm on your side, Master.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.310
Deflect it over here!

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.470
I don't know what's going on, but okay!

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.030
By taking advantage of Asta's anti-magic, 
they successfully defeated Ladros.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.780
But the moment they tried to finish off Fana
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun's Third Eye,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.950
who was weakened by Noelle's spell...

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.950
Fana!

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.080
It's me! It's me!

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.040
Don't you recognize me?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.410
My student Fana?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.170
Fana, who had lost her memories,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.000
fell into a deeper state of confusion 
and tried to self-destruct, but...

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.010
Everything should just... disappear.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.340
Asta and Mars risked their lives to stop her.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.520
Let's go see the world together!

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.650
Okay.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.110
It's a promise, Mars.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.870
Fana regained her memories.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.710
Those Who Boost Each Other Up

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.960
All right!

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.890
Asta.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.060
I couldn't have done it without you.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.070
Thank you.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.520
There is no reason for the weak 
to stand on the battlefield.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.370
I was born to break people like you.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.690
You're in my way...

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.980
Begone!

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.490
The weak will perish,
 and only the strong will remain.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.870
Someone as naïve as you 
cannot win against me!

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.250
That was all your strength!

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.880
I'm glad you were able to 
save your childhood friend!

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.180
Is he your friend, Mars?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.380
Wow! So you made a friend 
in the outside world!

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.390
No, I wouldn't say he's—

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.270
Yeah, he's totally my friend! 
We did fight once, though.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.140
Ow...

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.610
So hard!

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.250
I'm glad you calmed down, too.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.900
But what the heck happened?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.030
You stupid dummy! Why do you have to do 
such drastic things every single time?!

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.540
Were you born just to try to kill yourself?!

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.660
You barely have any clothes on!

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.840
You're a magnificent student.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.050
Thank you, Master.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.090
Master Fanzell!

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.800
Your powers exist to protect others.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.180
Don't ever forget that.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.210
Yes, sir!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.150
I'm so glad you're both alive.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.840
So you barely remember anything?

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.680
Yes.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.950
After the final training, I...

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.420
I can hardly believe she's 
started breathing again.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.210
Is this the power of the magic that bears 
the Phoenix's name? Or could it be...

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.290
How fascinating.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.920
We'll fit Fana with a mage stone, too.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.460
What a disappointment.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.450
Not only did it fail to increase her 
magic, but she hardly has any left.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.480
I guess that was the last dying ember of it.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.960
Get rid of her. She's of 
no interest to me anymore.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.080
You poor thing.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.130
My old friend...

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.120
It's just as it was long ago.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.410
Humans even hurt other humans.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.260
As you wish, I shall destroy them.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.510
But... I need your body.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.880
You will live on!

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.780
I don't have any memories after that.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.000
It felt as though someone 
else entered my body.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.650
Like I was being controlled...

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.650
All I remember is that 
person's fierce hatred.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.400
What about the third eye 
and pointy ears you had?

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.410
I'm really sorry. 
I don't know anything about them.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.110
You went through all that?

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.060
I had no idea, and I...

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.740
Mars, you don't need to 
feel bad about anything.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.420
I mean, we got to meet again.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.850
Right. I'll never let you go again.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.800
Yeah... Let's stay together forever.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.050
Y-Yeah...

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.920
My, my! Aren't things heating up over there?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.430
He's stiffened up as hard as a 
chunk of ore. How adorable.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.400
Childhood friends tragically torn 
apart and reunited by destiny...

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.690
That's really great!

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.440
Whoa, he's bawling over there!

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.690
What's the matter, Finral?

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.080
I'm jealous and envious and bummed out!

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.700
Huh? You don't have any childhood friends?

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.440
No! I don't have any cute 
childhood friends like that!

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.080
Nope! Nope! Nope! Not one, damn it!

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.080
I have childhood friends!

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.660
Lots of them, actually!

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.410
Just so you know, I'm not jealous!

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.340
Why'd I just get slapped?!

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.840
I'm royalty!

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:18.350
Anyway, why did the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun come to the Witches' Forest?

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:27.900
I still feel a strong desire in my head 
to retrieve the magic stone.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.320
Magic stone?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.830
So that means there's a 
magic stone in this forest?

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.870
Let's hurry and go see the Queen of Witches!

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:44.020
No, before that, we need to save Domina, 
Mariella, and the wounded witches.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.630
What is this ki?

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.630
Impossible! His magical power should be gone...

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.890
Everyone, run!

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.280
Man, that was some intense magic.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.820
It took forever to absorb it all. 
Thanks for the meal!

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.540
I must admit, I thought I was going to die.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.920
Ladros... But your magic 
power should've been depleted.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.320
I emitted it all, and then took it back in.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.760
You rely too much on your 
magic detection, Teach.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.500
Really, though, why do all of you

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.200
keep putting your own lives 
in danger to protect others?

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.110
M-Mars...

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.150
That's exactly why I'm
 gonna end up killing you!

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.340
Well, well, some weirdo just showed up.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.870
This doesn't concern you,
so could you get lost?

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.550
It's got lots to do with me!

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.470
He's my...

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.880
friend!

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.600
Why do all of you

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.140
keep putting your own lives 
in danger to protect others?

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.190
M-Mars...

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.190
That's exactly why I'm
 gonna end up killing you!

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.410
Well, well, some weirdo just showed up.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.910
This doesn't concern you,
so could you get lost?

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.660
It's got lots to do with me!

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.700
He's my...

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.370
friend!

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.330
Asta...

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.240
Mars!

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.670
I need to use a recovery spell!

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.550
I can't cast anything?

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.930
What happened to my body? Is my magic gone?

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.180
Just hang on! I'm gonna pound this guy!

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.300
Whoa, wait a sec! You're that one guy, right?

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.520
The anti-magic knight or whatever.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.060
I totally feel your pain, man.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.020
I was born without a magic attribute myself.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:24.780
Even when I was a kid, everybody made
 fun of me and called me bland.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.990
But hey, you're even more worthless than me.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.040
What'd you say, you bastard?!

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.800
I kinda feel bad for you.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.290
Give me some of your magic, then!

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.610
I would if I could.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.340
Oh, I know.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.490
Here. All yours if you can reach.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.430
What a great reaction! I think 
we'd make great partners.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.600
Wanna team up?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.110
You can be my right-hand man.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.650
I'll talk to the Diamond Army for you.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.360
Let's rise up through the 
royal army's ranks together!

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.490
We'll teach the guys who get all cocky 
just because they've got talent a lesson!

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:11.790
Just kidding. I'm gonna make his 
anti-magic powers all mine, too!

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.120
I refuse.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.430
Huh?

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.710
I'm gonna become the Wizard King
 of the Clover Kingdom!

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.670
Wizard King? Seriously?

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:28.680
This is why I hate idiots! Million Lasers!

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.690
I heard about how you fight.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.430
Without that spatial magic guy over there,

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.440
you can't do a thing about 
long-distance spells, can you?

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.450
You make the perfect target!

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.870
That ricochet trick won't work on me, either.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.970
Recycle, recycle!

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.770
There's no way you can win! Just give up!

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.510
Who's gonna give up?

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.220
You hurt my friends.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.720
And you won't get away with that!

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.430
Friends?

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.680
There's no such thing.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.870
There are only two kinds of people
 in this world: the users and the used.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.310
I won my way to the top by 
using the people around me.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.690
I'm gonna use Mars over there

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.950
and the girl next to him to 
get myself even further ahead.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:35.460
Maybe I'll let the military use them 
for magic research until they die!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.110
What's the matter? You're not 
letting me get away with this, right?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.140
You can be my stepping stone, too!

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.540
Huh?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.520
What is this?

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.740
N-Not good! My magic's draining away!

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.740
I-It won't come out!

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.550
Huh? Wait... You're kidding me!

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.370
From this? Really?

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.370
Crap! Everything I've worked for...

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.340
Crap! All I did was take my 
eyes off of him for a second!

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.730
I'd made it to the rank of 
the Eight Shining Generals!

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.880
This is bad! Bad! Bad!

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.250
No way! No way! No way!

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:38.600
Did he really just throw this stupidly 
heavy sword all the way up there?!

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.500
What kind of decision was that?

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.680
What the hell were you thinking?!

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.770
Shit! Shit! This is crazy!

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.790
Are you telling me I'm gonna be 
taken out by a dumbass attack like this?

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.240
Damn it! Stay back! Stay away!

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.500
I couldn't have made it this far on my own.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.040
People taught me how to use 
my power and how to fight.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.760
We got through life or death 
situations together.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.780
We helped each other out 
while improving how we fight.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.590
The reason I've been able 
to react to the attacks

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:17.180
is because of something called "ki" 
from back in my homeland.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.430
Ki?

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.840
Where I come from, we've got this saying...

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.190
"A warrior never goes back on his word."

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.130
You said you were going to 
become the Wizard King, didn't you?

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.670
Surpass your limits. Right here, right now.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.370
There's no other way.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.530
Yes, sir!

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.920
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.670
What are you guys doing?!

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.000
Noelle!

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.630
I'll bet everything

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.550
on this one attack!

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.720
I'm not a failure anymore!

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.040
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.050
We did it!

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.480
Let us help!

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.700
Here we go!

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.070
That attack of yours...

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.450
will end up being incredibly powerful!

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.450
Too late!

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.550
I won't let you kill anyone!

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.100
Bull Thrust!

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.100
He did it!

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.250
All right!

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.930
My special move was a complete success!

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.980
Friends are only meant to be used?

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.780
Not my friends! My friends and I...

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.780
We boost each other up!

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.710
I-I was wrong!

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:03.500
I'll stop hurting people! Please spare me!

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.920
Please! Take out this sword!

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.750
I can't get it out on my own!

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.130
No!

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.430
Huh?

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.390
I know how strong you are,
so I'm not gonna get careless!

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.580
If I take it out and you attack me,
I have no chance of winning!

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.140
Besides, if I'd missed when I 
threw it at you, I would've lost!

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.560
I'm an idiot, so I can't afford 
to mess up to begin with!

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.580
No, please... I-I'm begging you!

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.920
If it doesn't come out, I'm gonna die!

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.810
That's not enough to kill anybody!

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.650
I missed your vital points on purpose!

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.360
Damn it! I thought I'd be able 
to trick an idiot like him if I

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.340
tugged at his heartstrings, 
but he's not buying it!

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.730
Shit! Shit! Shit!

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.350
This twerp's been through 
his share of battles!

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:49.590
So I'm gonna whack you 
again and knock you out!

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.300
Damn it all!

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.370
This is all of my remaining magic.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.300
If I attack him and he blocks it,
I'm really finished!

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:06.140
I'll just have to use reinforcement 
magic and force it out!

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.020
Ow!

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.400
I've got enough left for two magic bullets...

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.950
That bastard!

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.210
You're Fana, right?

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.520
Ladros!

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.370
I don't know how you got those powers,

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.960
but use that huge magic of yours right now!

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.590
Huh? Huge magic? What are you talking about?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.920
Quit playing dumb, and hurry it up!

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.970
Do it or I'll kill...

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.420
him!

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.430
Mars!

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.930
The next shot will really kill him.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.850
Stop!

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.610
And there it is!

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.410
Okay, then...

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.320
Time for the ultimate gamble!

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.260
This magic's insane!

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.200
I feel like my body's gonna burst!

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:34.520
This is the greatest magic I've ever eaten.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.610
Impossible! This power 
surpasses the spirit's!

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.450
It's not an amount a human can emit!

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.780
Ladros, you...

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.040
You bastard!

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.660
Payback time.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.790
I tracked it with ki, but it was still 
so fast that I couldn't dodge it.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.470
I've obtained the ultimate power!

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.070
If I use this, the other Eight Shining 
Generals don't stand a chance!

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.770
Forget them! I can take 
over the whole kingdom!

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.810
Woohoo!

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.600
I'll murder everyone who 
ever looked down on me!

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.190
But before that, I guess 
I'd better finish you off.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.000
I won't get careless again.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.490
I'll keep hitting you with ranged 
attacks that you can't block...

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:30.370
until you're in pieces!

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:33.750
Asta!

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.630
He's turned the tables.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:46.450
Since he can use that sword, I thought 
he might be their descendant, but...

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.410
Show me who you really are!

00:20:54.890 --> 00:21:01.250
Now, then, how many more shots can 
that body you're so proud of take?

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.320
Huh?

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.430
Petit Clover

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.270
Petit Clover!

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.930
How Does It Taste?

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.220
How Does It Taste?

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:10.570
This is the greatest magic I've ever eaten.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:11.820
Take that!

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.840
Ah, that tastes very regal.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.080
That's royalty for you.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.490
Take that!

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.080
Ah, yes. Yours tastes a little mature.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.190
Take that!

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.940
This tastes really nostalgic.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.770
Ladros!

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.720
It tastes like pickles!

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.780
So you're saying that not only do I look 
old, but my magic tastes old, too?!

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.750
You got it, Teach!

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:36.930
Tee-hee!

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.080
Queen of Witches, what did you do to Asta?!

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.980
Asta's grimoire is giving off an eerie light.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.690
You almost look like... a demon!

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.650
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 63: "It's Nothing."

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 63
 It's Nothing

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.820
A black meteor shoots across the sky.
