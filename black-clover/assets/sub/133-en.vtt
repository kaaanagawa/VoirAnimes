WEBVTT

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.060
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.400
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.970
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.320
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.890
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.790
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.630
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.800
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.410
Mereoleona showed up at the 
Black Bulls' hideout without warning,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.420
stealing away Asta and the others.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.340
Their destination was the strong 
magic region, the Yultim Volcano.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.090
This was where Asta and Noelle

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.630
had trained with the 
Crimson Lion Kings before.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.470
Mereoleona and Fuegoleon announced that 
they would be training here yet again,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.970
in order to prepare to fight the devil.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.060
Let's haul ass to the hot springs at the top!

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.890
Hold it.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.080
Wha?!

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.310
You won't be climbing the volcano this time.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
You'll be heading underneath the volcano...

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.320
Into the Yultim Underground Cave!

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.570
They ended up facing an intensely fiery 
mana unlike any they faced before

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.700
as they headed toward their goal,
 the hot springs.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.560
But...

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.550
Take this!

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.560
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.400
Leopold's powerful attack was enough 
to make the spider monster back down,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.710
but then they discovered 
the cave's surprising secret.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.270
Don't tell me that's...

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.870
A dungeon, eh? Things are getting exciting.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.880
The Lion Awakens, Continued

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.410
Lady Mereoleona, what is that?

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.630
You're late!

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.610
Did you enjoy your nice little stroll with 
the Black Bulls, you pathetic fools?!

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.890
And you call yourselves Crimson Lion Kings?!

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.310
We're terribly sorry.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.920
If it were just just Vice Captain Randall 
and me, we could've gotten here faster.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.150
We are unworthy.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.830
And... who gave you permission to eat?

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.830
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.070
Watch it, Miz Charmy! 
You gotta read the room!

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.580
We've already reported to the royal 
capital that we found a dungeon.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.960
Stand by for further instructions.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.990
Yes, sir!

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.880
Huh?

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.380
You guys were attacked by 
that giant spider, too?

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.180
Yup.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.660
Who would've thought it'd 
run away into a dungeon?

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.110
Isn't it exciting?

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.140
How?!

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.490
I was a fool to let that spider escape.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.310
I cannot let it end like this!

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.910
Sister!

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.900
Let us explore the dungeon!

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.700
Don't get cocky!

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.980
You're the foolish, inexperienced 
weakling who let that bug escape!

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.080
You have some nerve saying that to me!

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.500
I promise that I will succeed next time!

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.160
There is no next time in battle!

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.630
Go whip yourself back into 
shape in that dungeon!

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.930
Yes, ma'am!

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.550
I see she's still as fired up as ever!

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.810
So she's letting him go
into the dungeon after all.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.810
Eyes up here!

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.040
Captain Fuegoleon filled me in on the situation.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.320
It appears that a rather powerful magic 
item lies deep within that dungeon.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.420
According to a book that Master 
Julius found in the library,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.010
that magic item was sealed away deep in

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.540
the Yultim Volcano by those who 
feared it would be used for evil.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.640
Otherwise, it's shrouded in mystery.
 Little is known about it.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.470
Yes, that's right!

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.750
Honestly!

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.270
Could you please be quiet?!

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.920
Oh, sorry about that. But won't it be exciting 
to find out what the magic item is?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.720
Shh!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Let me head over there, too.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.470
Absolutely not!

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.310
What? But I'll wear a disguise!

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.470
That's not the issue here.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.970
Who's he talking to?

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.870
No idea...

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.380
It's the Wizard King!

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.520
It sure is.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.040
A-Anyway, the magic item and any other 
treasure you happen to find in the dungeon

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.570
will be essential to getting 
this kingdom back on its feet.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.910
I'm counting on all of you to investigate it.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.510
Understood.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.620
Now, then—

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.390
Listen up, you fools!

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.530
You will carry out this investigation 
with your pride as the Magic Knights

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.090
who protect this kingdom on the line!

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.420
Yes, ma'am!

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.300
Sister, as the current Captain of the 
Crimson Lion Kings, I'll tell them the rest.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.150
Right. Hurry up and tell them the plan.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.700
The first group to go in will be

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.960
Asta, Noelle,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.190
Leo, Randall,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.940
Luck, and Magna. You will search for 
the location where the magic item sleeps.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.190
The rest of you will rendezvous with the 
first group as soon as your mana has recovered.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.800
And I'm going to sneak a peek...

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.610
You absolutely will not.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.640
All right, let's go!

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.620
Yeah!

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.710
So hot...

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.140
It's so damn hot! It's nothing 
like the heat from earlier.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.960
I still don't sense that spider's mana.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.810
But...

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.160
Well done, my rival!

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.150
I see you've already taken out the first one!

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.080
That wasn't my intention at all!

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.620
We'll be in trouble if we get 
stalled here for too long.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.290
He held back just enough so that 
the trap spells wouldn't activate.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.390
I can't believe he pulled off such 
a high-level spell so easily.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.640
He's definitely the Vice Captain 
of the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.060
Now we can clearly see where all the traps are!

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.270
Catch you guys later!

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.280
Lightning Creation Magic: Holy Lightning Boots!

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.820
Now, hold on a second!

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.320
Flame Reinforcement Magic: Risky Stolen Base!

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.120
Hey! Stop stepping on those on purpose!

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.030
Only two more paths remain!

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.320
My rival, let us compete to see which 
one of us finds the magic item first!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.720
Heck yeah!

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.320
How can he move so well in this 
space that's filled with so much mana?

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.700
Vice Captain Randall, let us hurry!

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.770
Sure.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.010
But I must say,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.860
I guess it's obvious that you've trained 
harder than any other member of our squad.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.680
This is still not enough to catch 
up to and someday exceed my rival!

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:07.500
In the last battle, Asta not only 
fought with a devil, but defeated it!

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.520
I heard that the other Black Bulls also 
fought valiantly in the last battle.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.940
This is not enough.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.970
I see now.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.080
So that's why Captain Fuegoleon 
and Lady Mereoleona

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.470
invited the Black Bulls to this training.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:26.730
Leo! I think you came close to a 
realization in that last battle yourself.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.420
When you fought against me after 
my body was taken over by an elf.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.510
What in the world is this 
incredibly violent mana?

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.100
Let's go see.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.910
Noelle! This is only going to get worse!

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.410
Let's just break through!

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.920
We're in a dungeon! That might 
be easy for a meathead like you,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.570
but you're asking me for the impossible!

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.310
Then let me carry you!

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.230
Huh?!

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.880
I'll carry you on my back to get us 
outta here, so just back me up!

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.730
C-C-C-Carry me on your back?! 
Wh-What are you saying?!

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.280
I'm royalty!

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.330
Noelle!

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.990
A-Asta?

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.310
Wait, why are we turning around?

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.790
We're pulling back for now!

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.530
This is...

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.350
Look.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.390
Those must be the golems that 
were guarding this place.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.090
Be careful.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.400
That shock wave almost made it seem 
as if it was telling us where it is.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.590
It might actually be trying to lure us in.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.750
There you are! I won't let you escape again!

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.170
That conniving little...

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.640
Well, this is interesting.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.120
I will burn them all to ashes 
with my raging inferno!

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.010
We've neutralized all of the 
trap spells by the entrance.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.410
All right. Recover your mana, 
and then widen the search.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.240
Yes, ma'am.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.830
Go on, eat up!

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.510
Did you find anything?

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.480
Not a thing.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.800
Because of Asta, we ended up having 
to run away from lava. It was awful.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.000
That's <i>my</i> fault?!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.360
We came up empty-handed, too. Though we 
did find a bunch of weird-ass treasure chests.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.300
Here you go!

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.180
What in the world?

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.850
Why the hell did you bring that 
back?! Don't you dare open it!

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.270
Close that thing already!

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.880
Is that yummy?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.870
Y-You probably shouldn't find out.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.860
What was that?

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.960
The only ones from the first group who 
haven't returned are Randall and Leo.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.700
Sounds like they hit the jackpot.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.350
Let's do this, Leo!

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.170
Right!

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.180
Go up in flames!

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.080
There are just too many.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.830
We are the proud Crimson Lion Kings! 
Running from our enemies is not an option!

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.320
Wait!

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.960
Leo!

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.130
Randall!

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.140
Leo, fall back.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.420
You have to survive this.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.880
Leo, you're going to lead this squad one day.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.490
We'll buy you some time.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.700
Take everyone who can't 
fight right now and survive!

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.780
It's just like last time.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.790
Why did I bother to train so hard?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.480
This is...

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.220
Leo! I think you came close to a 
realization in that last battle yourself.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.390
That's right... I was fighting 
within the powerful mana

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.470
that Randall created during that fight.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.140
None of my attacks seemed to work,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.950
but I learned to read his mana and 
calmly control my flames!

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.320
Leo!

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.480
Are you okay?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.570
Asta!

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.190
All right, let's get a little wild!

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.830
Hope you guys are ready, because 
I'm killing you even if you're not!

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.120
One never forgets their grudge 
when it comes to food!

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.610
You will pay for eating all those 
never-before-seen ingredients!

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.720
How dare you do that to my friend?

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.720
All right, let's begin our counterattack!

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.220
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.730
My spell seems more powerful... 
Could it be from all my training?

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:09.490
Eat this! Flame Magic: 
Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.590
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.490
Poison Curse Magic: 
Dwelling of the Poison Cloud!

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.630
Cotton Creation Magic: 
Strike of the Sleeping Sheep!

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.000
Secure Leopold and Randall!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Roger!

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.220
There are even more of them?

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.010
We've gotta do something about that 
spider controlling them with its web!

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.510
Let's do this one more time!

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.970
No.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.340
I'll go.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.100
I'm going to use what I realized 
then, right here and now.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.280
By heightening his senses to their limits 
and calmly reading the flow of mana,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.950
Leopold can momentarily use 
the mana around him in his favor,

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.960
which allows him to
explosively increase his mana!

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.720
Th-That was amazing!

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.670
Leo!

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.380
So this is the spider's original form.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:48.190
It appears that the magic item here 
makes the user's life force go berserk,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.900
and turns them into a monster.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.310
Excellent work finding the treasure room.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.770
All of the hardships you dealt with here

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.840
will surely aid you in the 
fight against the devil!

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.640
Yes, sir!

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.990
I think I'm starting to get the 
hang of this Mana Skin thing!

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.820
And I could actually see that 
my spells were more powerful.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:19.460
Speaking of spells, that last spell 
Leo used was frickin' insane!

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.150
I was preoccupied with 
what was going on.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.830
What </i>was<i> that spell?

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:26.150
If I can learn to use that spell at will...

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.960
Praise me even more, my rival!

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.420
I will learn how to fully use that 
spell and become stronger than you!

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.170
In that case, I'll become 
even stronger than that!

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.240
That only means I'll become 
even stronger yet again!

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.420
And then, I'll get even more 
and more and more stronger!

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.950
Then I'll become even more and 
more and more and more stronger!

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.260
More, more, more, more, more...

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.240
Quit your shouting!

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.310
Yes, ma'am!

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.740
This discussion isn't over yet.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.820
Show me the magic item that you acquired.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.690
Oh, here you go.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.240
What is that garbage?

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.370
Huh? It's the magic item we were after.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.830
You absolute fools!

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.550
Retrieving the magic item was the 
number one goal of this mission!

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.380
How dare you reduce it to cinders?!

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.590
Right...

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.680
We're terribly sorry.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.220
You two are going to go search every 
corner of that dungeon on your own.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.570
I will not allow you to return empty-handed!

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.390
Yes, ma'am!

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.480
Uh, wait. You're joking, right?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.370
She's serious.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.390
She's completely serious.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.080
Pretty sure she's dead serious.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.490
The rest of you fools head to the hot springs!

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.730
Yes, ma'am!

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.900
Have a drink.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.430
Go on, down the hatch.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.150
A special drink that'll quench any thirst,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:49.580
made from the extracts of every single 
ingredient I found in that dungeon.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.490
I guess I get to enjoy this nice bath again.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.620
Looks like you've gotten closer.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.440
Huh?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.750
To your mother, that is.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.630
Your form in our last battle...

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.470
It reminded me of Lady Acier, who was 
called the Steel Warrior Princess.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.620
But you've still got a ways to go.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.140
Your magic is not up to par yet.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.540
Er, right.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:22.910
Your mother, Acier Silva, lost her
 life due to a devil's curse.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.910
Because those who speak of 
it will share the same fate.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.030
That's the nature of the curse 
that befell your mother.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.430
But I want to become even stronger.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.760
I must become stronger!

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.200
I see.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.680
U-Um... Would you tell me more about my mother?

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.690
That might take a while.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.520
That's fine!

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.680
Doesn't this feel great?

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.280
You know, the Captain of the Crimson 
Lion Kings is the total opposite

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.880
of Captain Yami. Way too uptight.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.240
Listen well! Hot springs are far 
more profound than you realize!

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.070
Yes, sir!

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.660
Stay calm, even if you become overheated.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.490
Learn to determine when 
you have warmed up enough,

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:12.580
discipline your body and soul with cold water,
 and then return to the bath.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.070
Consider this an opportunity 
to train in facing yourself!

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.050
Yes, sir!

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.880
You must never forget to cleanse 
your body before soaking.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.090
Never let your towel touch the water.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.400
When you're done using 
the shower and bathing area,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.320
I-I'm at my limit...

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.640
make sure to rinse them off with hot water.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.350
How much longer is he going to keep talking?

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.350
Make sure you leave things as you found them.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.680
I wonder if Asta and Leopold are back yet.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.140
Nothing beats washing each other's backs 
to deepen your friendship at a hot spring.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.950
So we kept looking until morning 
and still didn't find anything.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.150
Was the bath that nice?

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.280
I managed to sweat all my exhaustion away.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.450
All the collagen from the ingredients 
I found made my skin silky smooth!

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.420
True. If the place wasn't in a strong 
magic region, I'd like to visit every day.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.540
Your skin's all silky smooth, too, Noelle.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.050
Y-You're way too close!

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.340
That was a lot of fun, wasn't it? I wonder 
when our next training session will be!

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.460
The hell are you talking about?

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.980
She just dragged us away 
outta nowhere. It totally sucked.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.970
I hope I don't even see her face for a while.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.000
Wouldn't it be funny if she was waiting inside?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.730
Like that'd ever happ—

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.660
You're late!

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.140
She's actually here!

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:58.450
Petit Clover

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.780
Petit Clover!

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.960
Reinvestigation

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.780
Reinvestigation!

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.210
Where the heck is the treasure?!

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.870
There's nothing but super-weird treasure chests!

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.130
Behold, my rival! I have 
found an amazing treasure!

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.340
Look at how long its legs are!

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.260
Whoa, holy crap! In that case...

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.860
I found one that's all buff and hairy!

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.660
What?!

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.120
<i>And</i> it'll even do squats with me!

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:28.440
Impressive, my rival. Let us compete to see 
who can find the ultimate treasure chest!

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.390
Bring it on!

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.590
Where is it?! Where is it?! 
Where is it?! Where is it?!

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.590
Forgetting the reason they went in,

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.780
Asta and Leopold ran around 
the dungeon until morning.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.080
Today is such an important day 
for the House of Vermillion that

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.170
it may mean life or death!

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.120
Yes! We will be welcoming <i>her</i>!

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.210
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 134: 
"Those Who Have Been Gathered."

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:54.270
Page 134
Those Who Have Been Gathered

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.470
Let us welcome her with everything we have!
