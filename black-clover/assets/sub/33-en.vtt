00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.820
To Help Somebody Someday

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.580
What the heck's going on?!

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.780
We can't handle something that big!

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.380
First of all, we have to 
get the kids out of here.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.480
Kids, take turns riding out of here on that!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.540
Okay!

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.100
This is cool!

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.540
It's so warm!

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.380
It'll take at least ten or twenty 
minutes to get them all out of here.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.800
We have to hold this thing back until then.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.930
I won't let you get near them!

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.400
Die... All of you...

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.530
B-Baro? What's wrong?

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.410
Y-You don't know who I am?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.510
Why... did you save me?

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.050
You haven't taken responsibility 
for any of this yet!

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.850
I'm not letting you die until you do!

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.540
Also, what's your problem? 
You're trying to kill your own brother?!

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.290
You moron!

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.530
Looks like my sword's working, 
so I'm just gonna quickly take care of—

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.170
Now your anti-magic won't be 
able to defeat him so easily!

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.460
The dark magic item I just injected 
him with eats the subject's life force

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.380
and produces an explosion of magical power!

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.290
How could you do that?!

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.470
There's no end to this!

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.780
You're wide open, Asta!

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.940
Take that!

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.410
No!

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.540
Granny?

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.740
Aw, you got in the way again! 
Quit butting in, would ya?

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.870
I'm not interested in an old 
lady whose magic's all dried up.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.080
Looks like you've got a mouth 
on you, whippersnapper.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.030
It's true that as you get older, the magic 
you can generate internally weakens.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.530
But the power to work with 
the mana that dwells

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.710
in nature can be increased at any age.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.720
I have years of experience and technique. 
I won't lose to a youngster like you!

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.100
Don't you dare underestimate us old hags!

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.970
Jeez, you're an annoying 
old lady, aren't you?

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.650
Don't blame me if you kick the bucket today.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.150
Go ahead and try it!

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.270
That being said,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.890
I can't fight well while protecting 
the kids as they escape.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.160
Damn it. This is only going to get worse.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.910
Curse that Gauche! How could 
he run off like that?!

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.680
That fool!

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.900
Brother, go back!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.720
No! I'm taking you back into town.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.030
Please, go back!

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.790
No! Not only does my magic 
not work on that woman,

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.810
but an insanely powerful 
magical monster appeared, too.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.040
You'll be in danger if I fight that thing!

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.360
But everyone else...

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.930
I don't care what happens to the others, 
as long as you're all right.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.730
Yeah... Who cares about anyone else?

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.530
The House of Adlai is a distinguished 
noble family that anyone would envy.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.450
Little Gauche looks as 
dignified as his father!

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.020
And little Marie is as 
beautiful as her mother!

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.230
So, about you helping me with my business...

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.550
What? Mother and Father are dead?

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.910
Yes. They were attacked by some 
robbers after leaving my office.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.560
It's written in their will that they left

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.620
their fortune and everything 
they owned to me.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.190
Every last thing.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.020
You're lying!

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.400
Wait, did you guys—

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.570
Silence!

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.210
What's that look for?

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.370
What an impudent brat.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.080
Get out.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.890
Bubby...

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.920
Don't worry, Marie.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.710
I'll protect Marie, no matter what it takes!

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.880
So as I was saying...

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.880
Hey! You again?!

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.000
Marie is everything to me!

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.480
Is it good?

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.050
Yup!

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.440
As long as Marie is smiling,
I don't need anything else.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.770
Give me all the cash you have.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.530
I-I'm a noble!

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.650
And? Nobles should help out the needy.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.700
Only Marie...

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.740
Stop right there!

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.770
You'll be paying for all of your crimes!

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.920
You think I care?!

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.640
You punk!

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.730
Marie...

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.560
Like I care about other people!

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.750
Hi-yah!

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.570
I hate having a big brother who's so pathetic!

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.390
D'oh!

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.060
It's true that a lot of people 
did some awful things to us.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.830
But Sister and the kids at 
the church are different!

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:11.340
The only reason I wasn't lonely when you 
weren't with me was because of them!

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.700
That's how you became a Magic Knight, too!

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.500
Everyone's lives are connected!

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.980
We're who we are because they're here!

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.530
Brother!

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.070
Besides, it's your job as a 
Magic Knight to protect everyone.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.080
I'm really proud that you're a Magic Knight!

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.080
Please just be the cool 
big brother I'm proud of!

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.270
Marie...

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.870
Hey! Over here!

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.710
Marco!

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.670
Thank goodness! You're okay!

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.470
Sister and Asta saved me.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.880
That's so like them!

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.010
Brat, that robe...

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.350
Asta lent it to me so I wouldn't feel lonely 
while he went to go save everyone else.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.650
He said it had the courage 
of a Magic Knight in it.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:13.040
Brother, I'll wait here with Marco.
Please go save everyone else!

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.200
I'll protect Marie! Leave it to me!

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.300
You'd better mean that,
you stupid little brat.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.120
I'll make you pay if anything happens to Marie.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.530
Um...

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.210
Brother!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.970
Marco!

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.970
Marie!

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.920
Everyone!

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.370
I'm so glad you're safe!

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.340
Yeah!

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.900
We managed to get away with Sister's magic.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.090
Asta protected us, but that 
monster's really strong!

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.970
It'll be okay! My brother's 
going to fight with them.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.440
My brother's a Magic Knight 
just like Asta, after all.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.620
Just like Asta?

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.540
So he must be really strong!

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.650
Yeah!

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.660
Marie, make sure you stay hidden.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.700
Yup!

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.730
Brother, do your best!

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.730
Do your best!

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.540
Asta this, Asta that...

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.170
What's so great about that shrimp, anyway?

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.340
The captain and the other squad 
members wouldn't shut up about him,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.920
but he immediately got caught by that woman!

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.730
Whatever. I'm sure he and that 
old hag gave up and ran away.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.600
When you get down to it,
people only care about themselves!

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.120
Not yet... I'm not done yet!

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.440
Jeez, you're so stubborn.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.960
Why don't you stop protecting them 
and let me catch you already?

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:58.720
Stop protecting them? I'm a Magic Knight!

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.970
Not a chance! Even if it kills me!

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.850
Is he... actually that stupid?

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:15.610
Stop protecting them? I'm a Magic Knight!

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.860
Not a chance! Even if it kills me!

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:24.320
And I'm not going to die until 
I become the Wizard King!

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.440
Asta! On your right!

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.240
Crap!

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.490
You yelled something stupid 
like "I'm not going to die,"

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.370
and then you actually almost died.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:37.170
Gauche! Why'd you run off like that?

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.650
Shut up!

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.180
I didn't run. I only helped Marie escape.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.310
He finally came back, that fool.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.640
I'll deal with you myself!

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.230
Wait!

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.650
You joining in isn't going to help!

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.070
Whatever. I'm going to fight... 
for the sake of Marie's love!

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.050
And so she'll say I'm cool!

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.340
Real Double!

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.950
Double Refrain!

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.170
Whoa, cool!

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.770
This monster... Magic keeps bubbling up 
from it, and it regenerates immediately.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.950
It's no use!

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.190
My magic isn't even touching that woman.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.690
I haven't been this incompatible 
with an opponent since the captain.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.000
Should I use my trump card?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.130
No... No matter how strong my 
mirror magic becomes, it won't help.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.000
Gauche!

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.930
How lame...

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.060
I thought you came to help! What are
you doing charging in all by yourself?!

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.740
We're supposed to be a team!

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.040
I protect you! You protect me!

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.320
Then we'll be able to fight forever!

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.820
An epic strategy, if I do say so myself!

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.950
What kind of half-baked strategy is that?

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.570
This guy really is an idiot.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.380
Come to think of it, </i>he<i> was 
pretty half-baked, too.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.090
You really want to keep going? 
You're not gonna be able to run.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.690
My sister's waiting for me...

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.890
Oh, yeah?

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.670
Well, if she's that important, 
join my squad and support her.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.430
What are you talking about?

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.180
I'm an escaped convict!

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.350
Yeah? And?

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:09.170
And? I don't trust others, 
and I only think about my sister.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.690
That's fine.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.290
You just protect what you want to protect.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.620
Someday, that'll help somebody out.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.420
Captain, did you know this 
would happen someday?

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.880
Take that!

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.420
Granny, how many kids are left?

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.760
Just a few more!

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.530
I guess I don't have a choice.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.490
Marie will be sad if you all die.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.940
I'll protect you.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.070
Did Gauche just...

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.760
What are you acting all tough for?

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.950
We're teammates! What else would we do?

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:58.210
You stupid little brat! You need to 
learn how to talk to your seniors!

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.020
And something's shining over there.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.970
Huh?

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.880
This is...

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.350
Just like that one time!

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.770
There it is!

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.530
Aw, man! Even that didn't work?

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.880
Wait, what was that? A flying 
anti-magic slash attack?

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.690
How did you do it? How did you do it?

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.520
The only way to defeat that monster

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.760
is to hit it with so many attacks at once
that it doesn't have time to regenerate.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.530
The most effective strike was 
the slash Asta just hit it with,

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.720
but he can't launch enough of them.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.460
What would happen if I used
my magic on someone else?

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.950
Because Gauche had always preferred 
to act alone and didn't trust others,

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.240
he'd never thought of using his 
magic to support someone else.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:17.240
But due to his past failures and his 
reluctant acknowledgment of Asta,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.470
he was able to create a spell that was

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.790
fundamentally similar, 
yet completely different,

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.040
and engraved a new page in his grimoire.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.500
But I won't be able to activate this 
spell with the magic I have now.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.090
Hey, old hag!

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.260
Buy me a little time!

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.600
Please!

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.910
You need to learn how to treat old hags.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.770
I'll only last a minute, so make it fast!

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.000
Leftover magic like that 
isn't going to work at all.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.450
Anyway, Asta! Do that thing again!

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.530
You don't have to tell me! 
If I could, I would!

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.510
Aw. How boring.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.420
I have no choice. I've been hiding 
this, but I'll have to use it now.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.710
Asta!

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:14.510
Yes?

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.760
Look at me!

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:23.020
I'll use the magic accumulated in 
the mirror magic item in my left eye

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.570
to activate the new spell.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.100
Mirror Magic:

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.220
Mirage Brigade!

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.820
Go!

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.970
Mirror Slash!

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.620
Not yet! Not yet!

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.260
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.810
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.280
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.930
I'm not done yet!

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.360
All right!

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.050
Wh-What a spell...

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:27.370
It appears that he had all 
of his life force sucked out.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.710
Baro...

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.150
Jeez, you're so annoying.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.490
How long are you gonna keep crying, Neige?

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.470
Here, you can have this.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.970
Thanks, Baro.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.260
Baro, I won't forgive her for 
turning you into this monster.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.450
But the one I can't forgive most of all

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:05.620
is myself for leaving everything to 
him and just doing what he said!

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.610
Just as you said, I haven't taken 
responsibility for anything.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:17.260
So I'm going to pay for both of our crimes.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.680
Yeah. And when you're done 
with that, let's be buddies.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.390
You can use really cool magic, 
so you'd be really popular!

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.930
Thank—

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.410
That light...

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.580
What is this immense magic?

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.790
I've never felt something this huge—

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.040
I didn't... see a thing...

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:58.820
Gauche!

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.340
A new enemy? Are they attacking 
everything in sight?

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.220
Asta!

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:19.610
Old hag!

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.280
Granny!

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.990
They hurt my comrade.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.990
They got what they deserved.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.750
He's the one that appeared 
at the enemy's hideout.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.430
I guess I haven't introduced myself yet.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.250
I am the leader of the Eye 
of the Midnight Sun...

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.250
Leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun
<font size="30">Licht</c>

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.250
Licht.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.460
No way...

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.830
A four-leaf clover grimoire... 
Just like Yuno's?

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.360
Petit Clover

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.810
Petit Clover!

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.820
Marie's in Danger

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.490
Marie's in Danger.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.790
All right, one, two, three!

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.420
Marie! Are you an angel?!

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.250
I can do anything when Marie's around!

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:43.720
But there are times where I must steel 
my heart and decline Marie's wishes.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.760
For example!

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.270
Brother, go back and save 
Asta and the others!

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.680
No! Going back would put you in danger!

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.050
Brother! I want to eat some 
hot, extra-cheesy doria!

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.140
No! Eating that would put 
your tongue in danger!

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.940
You'll burn it.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.090
Brother, doesn't lying 
out in the sun feel nice?

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.970
No! If you're in the sun too long, 
your skin will be in danger!

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.030
UV rays are a fearsome enemy!

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.240
Brother, show me a really cool spell!

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.900
No... Just kidding.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.210
Marie, look at me.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.480
Mirage Brigade!

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.130
You're amazing, Brother!

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.580
No... Now I'm... in danger.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.070
Brother? Brother? Brother?

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.350
That's the guy who was at the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun hideout!

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.980
You're the one who attacked the Clover 
Kingdom and did that to Captain Fuegoleon...

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.730
I'll make you regret that!
