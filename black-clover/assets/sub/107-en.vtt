WEBVTT

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.780
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.950
The Raging Black Bull

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.100
charged for the royal capital
with the Black Bulls on its back.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770
Rescue!

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.900
La!

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.860
Magic Conversion!

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.900
They rescued the townspeople...

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.200
Asta Cannon!

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.570
...and freed the Magic Knights 
who had reincarnated into elves.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.290
Heck yeah!

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.380
And then,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.780
returning thanks to their hatred for Licht,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.630
Rades, Sally, and Valtos appeared 
before them once more.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.890
You guys want to hurry to the 
royal capital, too, don't you?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.800
Then we have the same goal.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.720
Lend me your strength.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.720
You're so annoying!

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.970
What?!

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.640
"Revenge," my ass, you stupid jerk!

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.020
From now on, you're going 
to help save the kingdom!

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.360
Huh?! You can't be serious, you bastard!

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.150
I'm totally serious!

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.990
After some convincing from Asta,
 they became allies.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.890
Fine!

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.370
I'll go to the royal capital with you!

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.750
Meanwhile...

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.330
Langris appeared before the 
members of the Golden Dawn,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.380
who had reincarnated as elves.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.000
I guess that's why we get along 
so well. We're both twisted.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.180
I can't wait to kill all these royals myself.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.710
The white night is over.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.020
Let us show the humans the golden dawn!

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.930
It won't be much longer, you vile pests.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.690
The Battle for Clover Castle

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.000
Kira Residence – Central Tower

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.250
So what's the meaning of this, Vaude?

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.250
King of the Clover Kingdom
Augustus Kira Clover XIII

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.890
I hear that your son,
 who engaged in violent acts

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.210
at my Royal Knights Selection Exam,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.550
is now under suspicion of treason.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.240
Your Majesty, there must be
 some kind of mistake!

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.070
Ledior Vaude

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.070
There's no way someone from the 
House of Vaude would do such a thing!

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.060
Th-That's right! My little Langris 
could never be a traitor!

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.060
Liliane Vaude

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.260
Regardless, I cannot allow 
someone of my bloodline

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.670
to marry someone with a reputation like that.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.550
Great Uncle...

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.540
Finnes Calmreich

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.600
I'm not troubled by Lord Langris.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.540
Please be lenient with him.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.540
Finnes, this matter does not concern you!

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.330
And you should be ashamed that Finnes 
is even trying to protect you!

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.810
This is Lady Finnes, the fiancée of 
the next head of the House of Vaude.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.520
Good day to you.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.730
Your Majesty, I have an urgent report!

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.690
It's regarding the mage attacks...

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.990
Silence!

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.150
I'm sure the Magic Knights
 have gathered by now!

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.620
They can do whatever they 
want until I get over there!

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.750
What are so many members of 
the Golden Dawn doing here?

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.210
This area is protected by us,
 the Castle Knights.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.610
You need to hurry and go help the citizens.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.910
We have business with the 
humans beyond that door.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.140
What kind of sick joke is 
that at a time like this?

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.130
The castles where the three great royal 
families live lie beyond this gate.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.780
Even Magic Knights may not 
enter without permission.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.900
That's just a stupid rule 
that you humans made up.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.030
Wh-What are you...

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.530
Like I care about it.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.530
This is treason! Capture them!

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.420
Compass Magic: Willful Compass.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.670
D-Do not falter!

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.450
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.300
Understood.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.100
My group will go right.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.850
Then we'll go left.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.020
I'll continue straight forward
 and rip them apart!

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.610
Hey, wait!

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.030
You're the ones who will wait, humans.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.870
So that hole in the castle 
gate really was Langris!

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.280
I could honestly care less about 
the royals, but this ki...

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.680
Looks like a bunch of pretty tough 
characters got into the castle.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.990
We'll have to let the other guys handle 
the town. We're going in, Finral!

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.790
Yes, sir!

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.430
Yami!

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.560
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked 
Lightless Blunt Strike!

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.930
All of these guys are 
brimming with magical power!

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.090
And there are, like, dozens of them!

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.400
This is terribad!

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.940
You aren't going to try to kill us? How naïve.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.370
Nah, I have plenty of reasons to kill you.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.910
At least, the you that had the nerve to 
take that body, as if it belongs to you.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.440
Such nonsense!

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.330
Dark Magic: Black Hole!

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.670
In the end, there are four of them.
 This is going to be tough.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.810
It doesn't matter how many of you 
humans try and attack us! You cannot wi—

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.720
This crazy magic is...

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.210
Damn it, you stupid bastards! 
Getting your bodies taken over...

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.610
Talk about entertainment!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.240
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises
Jack the Ripper

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.530
Of course the ones who 
are most worth slicing up

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.240
would show up at the castle, huh?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.400
The Captain of the Green Praying Mantises,
 Jack the Ripper!

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.750
Geh. Did our reinforcements 
really have to be this weirdo?

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.420
What? You wanna get sliced open first, Yami?

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.490
Actually, you already almost got me.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.180
Welp, I'm glad you didn't turn 
on us, you giant string bean!

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.430
Who'd get taken over with this much 
fun to be had, you stupid meathead?!

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:25.400
We won't let any of you leave alive, humans!

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.150
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.330
Corundum Magic: Ideal Closer!

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.060
You won't be able to cut 
through my magic with that.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.010
Death Scythe!

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.840
I told you, it's useless.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.470
Your moves are totally obvious.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.170
This is such a pain in the ass.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.480
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Blade Storm!

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.150
It's taking all I have to read 
their ki and dodge their attacks.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.610
Watch what you're doing, 
you giant string bean!

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.690
Death Scythe! Death Scythe!

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.620
I'm getting excited!

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.580
The crazy dude's being even crazier than usual.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.630
Two captains are struggling this much?

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.140
Hey, you get it by now, don't you,
you giant string bean weirdo?

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.900
Hell yeah, I do.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.310
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.270
Your magic won't work on m—

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.610
There's nothing I can't sever.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.110
All right, now show me 
you're worth slashing apart!

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.240
Impossible... The property 
of the magic itself changed?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.240
Found someone who let down his guard.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.380
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked 
Lightless Blunt Strike!

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.000
I think you're starting to see it, too...

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.750
Finral!

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.120
Yes, sir!

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.220
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.050
What?

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.060
Heck yeah! Great job, you two!

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.580
Looks like you're finally 
starting to get it, Finral.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.210
You've got some skill if you can 
support me in combat, you bastard.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.090
Th-Thanks...

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.820
Holy crap, he's scary!

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.820
Hey, he's my ride.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.580
He's terrifying, too!

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.310
Don't be stingy. 
Let me borrow him sometime.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.540
Like hell I will, string bean man.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.750
C-Come on, you two... We have to hurry.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.780
That's—

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.760
Silva Residence

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.270
What in the world are you doing, Golden Dawn?!

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.750
You Magic Knights exist to protect 
those of us in the upper classes!

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.710
Why?! What's going on?

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.500
This is the royal palace!

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.730
We'd only gather here to curry 
favor with the House of Silva,

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.180
to see if they'd grant us 
a share of their power.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.570
Why in the world is this happening?!

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.920
Be my shield, you common servant!

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.660
You lower classes only exist for us—

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.600
No!

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.590
There's no point in seeking out a decoy.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.040
My needles will only pierce 
their intended targets.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.180
They'll pursue you, no matter how 
far you go, until they hit you.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.780
Of course, we're killing all the humans 
anyway, so I guess that didn't matter much.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.850
Damn it... Damn it!

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.240
I can't quell my rage!

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.240
You lost to Noelle? How pathetic, Solid.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.240
I'm sure you just let your guard down.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.210
You can't be serious! 
Noelle couldn't cast a spell like that!

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.460
Solid...

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.670
It's all right if I hit you, right?

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.970
Just go ahead and try it!

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.470
You complete failure!

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.390
Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.400
Curse that Noelle!

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.690
I'll make her pay for this!

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.440
What's this presence I sense?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.820
I feel a bit uneasy.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.240
A Golden Dawn member?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.310
Do you know where you are?!

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.250
What do you think you're doing?!

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.470
This magical power... You must be royals.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.800
Descendants of that tainted bloodline...

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.130
I've come to kill you.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.300
This immense power...

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.140
It looks like we need to 
teach you some manners.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.680
Mist Magic: Solid Mist Clones!

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.100
I guess I'll play with you for a bit.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.520
Mist Spider's Threads!

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.340
You can taste how powerful 
a royal's magic is yourself!

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.950
The lowly shall always be lowly.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.500
Compass Magic: Useless North.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.250
Impossible...

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.130
She was able to find my location 
without even trying to hit my clones?

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.710
What an underhanded spell. 
It's perfect for you humans.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.720
Nebra!

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.060
How dare you?! Don't think you're 
going to get away with this!

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.060
Oh? You're royalty, but you can't tell?

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.440
What? I sense an even more 
immense power outside.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.950
You humans are about to be destroyed.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.340
There's something crazy in there!

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.510
Looks like this is gonna 
be even more fun now.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.850
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.490
There's absolutely nothing fun 
about this! Not in the least!

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.350
That's probably the enemy's hideout, 
isn't it? That's super bad!

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.600
Why are there even more crazy enemies now?!

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.910
Damn it...

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.140
Who the hell invited that giant rock?

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.240
But look. A pretty little 
bird just showed up, too.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.240
We will not let the castle fall,
 no matter what.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.250
Welcome home, royals.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.910
Hey, Noelle!

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.210
That's... Captain Yami?

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.830
Over here!

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:09.420
I'm with Captain Yami! Do you see me?

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.730
And... Finral?!

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.420
And Captain Jack...

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.370
I'm so sorry to make you worry, Noelle!

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.810
I'm sure it was rough without me around—

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.560
You've got at least a hundred years

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.690
before I start worrying 
about you, wimpy Finral!

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:24.770
Wimpy

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.770
You'd better start making up for all 
that carefree sleep you got to have!

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.770
Carefree

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.890
Honestly...

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:30.070
Jeez... I'm so glad he's okay!

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.930
Were you waiting

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:37.350
in anticipation for my beautiful 
self to make my beautiful entrance?

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.960
Brother, that's just painful...

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.370
That's...

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.220
It's been a while, Psycho Captain.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:52.130
I finally joined the Magic Knights, 
since the rest of you are all so damn useless.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.230
Wait, who are you again?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.750
Quit messing with me!

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.890
I'm a member of your squad! 
The one that's filled with troublemakers!

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.790
You'd better take responsibility 
for giving me this robe,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.480
you random-ass captain!

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.270
Took you long enough, dumbass.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.990
How long were you going to make me wait?

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.150
You better work hard to make 
up for being so late, Zora!

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.200
So, where the hell have 
you been, Captain Royalty?

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.300
Your house is a huge mess right now.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:26.670
If you waste too much time, 
we're gonna beat you into the castle!

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.330
Foreigners and former commoners...

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.590
Fear not. You're one of the few 
that I actually consider beautiful.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.220
And you can shut your mouth.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.170
We're gonna go to the king,

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.980
so you guys can figure out what 
to do about your house!

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.200
The enemy's powerful. Don't try 
to take them down recklessly.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.070
Your only goal is to rescue and retreat!

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.070
Who the hell died and 
made you the boss, Yami?!

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.070
None of you bastards better die, got it?!

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.330
You're the last person 
I need to hear that from.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:07.620
My home... I never thought I'd come
back to it under these circumstances.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:12.450
This is so cruel.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.050
How dare they taint our castle like this?

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.640
They will pay for this.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.470
Hup!

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.180
Just a reminder that I don't 
give a shit about you royals.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.220
I'm gonna do whatever I want.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.690
We've gotta move smart, 
given the number of enemies we have.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.720
Hey! Who said you could leave?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.820
Leave him be.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.880
He was selected to be a Royal Knight.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.110
I'm sure he has his own way of fighting.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.570
Here they come.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.500
There you are, royals!

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.090
I shall mete out your punishment!

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.720
To think you'd lose your 
composure in front of me...

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.130
Using fine mana control to use

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.560
free-transforming mercury magic 
for both attack and defense...

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.310
Nozel is truly amazing.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.870
Mother...

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.820
We're going to take down 
the strongest first!

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.330
That's—

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.960
Her stupidly huge magical powers are 
getting in the way! I can't hit her!

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.340
This... This can't be happening!

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.260
Water Creation Magic: Sea Serpent's Coils!

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.820
Damn it... Damn it, damn it, damn it!

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.100
Solid...

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.400
I'm royalty, damn it!

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.830
How pathetic.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.030
You can die now.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.110
Damn it!

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.490
Nozel!

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.230
Noelle!

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.500
Mana Skin!

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.130
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.370
I've got her!

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:23.010
Compass Magic: Willful Compass!

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.830
She deflected it!

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.520
Noelle managed to get a spell 
through the enemy's mana?!

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.530
Nozel... Thank you... very much.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.470
Noelle managed to cast that incredible spell?

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.820
But that didn't work, either.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.970
I hate to admit it, but I'd 
just hold them back right now.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.330
I should probably retreat.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.050
Mist Magic: Bewildering Forest of Mist!

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.050
I won't let any of you get away.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.760
Compass Magic: Another Atlas!

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.390
You won't be able to escape this 
place unless you defeat me!

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.260
This is...

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.650
I can't control my magic!

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:21.030
This spell forcibly disturbs 
the mana in this area.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:27.590
No matter how powerful your magic, 
 your spells won't hit me now.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:28.660
However...

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.750
My spells won't fail to hit you.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.140
Nozel!

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.220
Calm down.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.340
You can no longer fight.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.970
Worry about your own—

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.390
It's okay... It's okay...

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.390
I did all that training.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.340
I can do this... I can do this!

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.860
I can still fight!

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.810
Come, Noelle. Let's show her the true power

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.340
of the royal House of Silva!

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.510
Petit Clover

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.980
Petit Clover!

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.010
Jack the Amazing (Rippa)

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.130
Jack the Amazing (Rippa).

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.260
There's nothing I can't sever.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.520
All right, now show me 
you're worth slashing apart!

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.770
So with these... you gotta 
cut them just the right size.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.270
Death Scythe.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.520
All right, now show me 
you're worth slashing apart!

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.780
So for this, you gotta dice it all up.
 Dicing things up is great.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.620
Gotta love how that sounds.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.120
Death Scythe.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.870
All right, now show me 
you're worth slashing apart!

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:22.670
They said bite-size, but isn't that pretty 
big when you're considering my mouth?

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.170
Death Scythe.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.170
You need to make sure it doesn't 
boil over once you put the miso in.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.810
It's done!

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.930
Look at this amazing pork miso soup!

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.860
I forgot the dashi! Damn it!

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.060
There was once a warrior called 
the Steel Warrior Princess.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.770
She would dance across the battlefield.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.940

 Battlefield Dancer

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.990
Time has passed, and now Noelle Silva 
will dance across the battlefield.
