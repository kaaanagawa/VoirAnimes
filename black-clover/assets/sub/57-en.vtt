00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.320
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.480
In order to heal Asta's arms,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.370
which were rendered useless 
after the battle with Vetto,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.680
Noelle and Finral went 
to visit certain exiles...

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.350
I'm coming in!

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.190
Oh, hey. I just got out of the bath—

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.860
You worthless husband! Would you fix 
your bad habit of getting naked already?!

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.280
Former Diamond Kingdom Military Commander
<font size="30">Fanzell Kruger</c>

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.280
A former Diamond Kingdom 
military commander, Fanzell Kruger,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.290
Brilliant Magic Item Artisan
<font size="30">Dominante Code</c>

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.290
his fiancée and brilliant magic 
item artisan, Dominante Code,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.830
Former Assassin
<font size="30">Mariella</c>

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.830
and the former assassin, Mariella.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.290
Do you have any ideas on how to fix 
Asta's arms? Even if it's just a rumor?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.250
An ancient curse, huh?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.430
There's one thing I can think of.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.470
My home, the Witches' Forest.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.970
The Witches' Forest?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.610
With the magic of the queen there...

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.520
Meanwhile, at the Witches' Forest...

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.150
Hey!

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.980
The smartest witch to ever grace this world

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.400
since the creation of the 
land of witches is back!

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.820
I need something, so open up!

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.710
Infiltration

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.860
Domina, what's the Witches' Forest?

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.470
It's an autonomous region that lies east

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.790
of the Clover Kingdom, near the 
border of the Diamond Kingdom.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.240
Clover Kingdom

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.240
Diamond Kingdom

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.240
Witches' Forest

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.440
All of the inhabitants are women,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.920
and they're essentially witches 
who are skilled in

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.610
special magic such as curses and familiars.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.370
All women?! What is this magical place?

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.820
Don't forget, we're talking 
about witches here.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.120
I've known of men who got too close

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.620
and got turned into stink bugs or softshell
 turtles, then dropped into toilets.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.970
What?

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.330
Wait... Speaking of witches...

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.200
Oh, right.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.120
Could it be that Vanessa suddenly disappeared

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.370
to try and get their queen to fix Asta's arms?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.670
There's a rule stating that witches 
can only live in the Witches' Forest.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.350
Which means that witches like Vanessa and 
myself who left our home are fugitives.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.880
Fugitives?

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.070
She'd need great resolve to 
even consider going back.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.770
But...

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.740
I fell head over heels in love with 
my soulmate Zell, so what can I do?

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.780
Yup. We both dove head-first into 
the bottomless swamp called love.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.770
My sweet Zell...

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.670
My sweet Domina...

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.160
Darling!

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.160
You guys are so in love... I'm so jealous!

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.640
So I believed in you and followed you,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.630
so how long are you gonna make me live 
in this hovel, you worthless husband?!

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.170
She's continuously aiming 
at his vital points.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.010
Maybe she should've been the assassin here.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.210
Y-Yikes...

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.870
Maybe I'm not so jealous after all.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.600
Why don't we get back on track?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.910
Yeah, that would be great.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.730
Yeah.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.690
If Vanessa went back into 
that forest... I'm worried.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.110
I don't know all the details, but apparently 
Vanessa was very important to the queen.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.800
If the rumors are true and she returns,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.960
she'll never be able to 
leave the forest again.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.160
To be blunt, the queen is supreme.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.050
She's so powerful that even the 
Diamond Kingdom won't try to deal with her.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.470
Not to mention that it's impossible 
to reason with her.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.570
Let me warn you, if you're also planning 
to go to the Witches' Forest...

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.180
If you anger the queen,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.970
you won't be able to come back alive.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.690
We're going.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.890
If there's a clue to healing
 Asta's arms there...

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.900
Yeah.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.740
Please... Tell us how to get there.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.530
I'll go, too.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.330
B-But...

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.930
Don't worry.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.300
I won't let anyone lay 
a finger on my beloved.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.340
Asta helped me out a lot and 
showed me the way I needed to go.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.100
I owe him bigtime.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.320
It doesn't feel great to let 
that debt keep growing, either.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.760
Let us repay it.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.560
Yeah.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.320
Besides, I can't leave my 
last student hanging like this.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.740
For now, I'm just gonna strengthen 
my lower body a heck of a lot!

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.280
Not yet! I'm not done yet, damn it!

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.280
My goal is to look like this!

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.290
Ow!

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.040
I got a cramp!

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.540
What?!

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.290
Heya, Asta.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.400
O-Old Man Zell?!

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.210
Wait, what the heck is going on?!

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.260
We can talk about this later.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.180
If we tell him why we're here...

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.020
I can't let all of you go to such 
a dangerous place for my sake!

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.980
...is what he'll probably say, 
so we'll avoid that for now.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.770
Come on, let's go to the W's Forest.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.570
What the heck is "W"?! Is it a size? 
Is it an extra-wide forest or something?!

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.070
I can't talk!

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.100
I shut him up.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.080
Good job, Zell.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.090
Excellent work, Master.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.210
The only method I could think of for 
shutting someone up was killing them.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.000
Um... You might want to 
rethink your priorities.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.090
Let's hurry.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.620
Fhats fwoing on?!

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.480
The other day, this guy in front 
of the forest tried to talk to me

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.140
and kept breathing really hard!
 Talk about gross!

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.370
Seriously? Like, ew.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.320
By the way, I thought I saw 
Vanessa a little while ago...

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.640
What? No way.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.630
I don't even want to imagine 
what the queen would do if

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.200
a witch who broke the rules was found.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.460
Imperfect.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.880
Vanessa, ever since you left this forest,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.470
my plans strayed far from perfection.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.930
If you master your thread 
magic as I told you to,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.020
you'll be able to control destiny itself.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.100
And yet you let that man tempt you away...

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:38.620
Queen of Witches

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.620
A man... A mere human, at that.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.870
We are perfect witches, 
and yet you let him use you...

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.140
Aren't you ashamed?!

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.260
Oh, dear...

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.500
What an imperfect room.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.230
You're the one who's imperfect.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.690
Listen up. I'll only come 
back on one condition.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:13.280
Teach me ancient dispelling magic!

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.280
A little girl who doesn't understand 
her place needs to be disciplined.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.750
That's the Witches' Forest.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.900
Witches' Forest?!

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.090
What the heck is that?! Where are we?

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.010
Shh! We need to be extra 
careful from here on out!

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.280
What? What's going on?

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.760
We seem to be in "Let's begin
 the operation!" mode now...

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.000
I'll explain later.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.630
When the heck is later?!

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.270
We're already here!
You're dragging this out too much!

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.200
Just shut up for a while.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.020
Otherwise...

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.930
...we'll shut you up again.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.570
Really?!

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.930
Domina, please continue.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.360
The queen runs her overwhelming 
magic throughout the forest,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.790
so if we give off even a little magic, 
they'll know we're here immediately.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.690
Which means we won't be able 
to use my spatial magic.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.520
You don't even have to use it.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.340
If anyone with magic so much as 
enters here, they'll immediately know.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.550
And what happens if they find us?

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.100
Have you ever seen a honeycomb?

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.710
Uh, I don't have any magic, 
so I should be fine.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.720
Shh!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.050
But then how are we supposed to get inside?

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.960
And that's where

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.280
these cloaks I made come in!

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.410
I call them Vanishawls!

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.640
Put one of these babies on, and ta-da!

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.910
Your magic, your presence, and 
your body will all disappear!

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.660
Wow, that's amazing! But it 
must be expensive, right?

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.520
Oh, not at all! If you order right now, 
you can get one for just 30,000 yuls!

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.170
Wow, that's so cheap! Way too cheap!

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.640
And today, we have a one-time special offer!
 I'll throw in another one for free!

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:07.640
The best of the best! Get your magic 
items from Domina's Magic Items!

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.930
Buy your "Vanishawl" now for 30,000 yuls
and get another one absolutely free!

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.130
Yay!

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.380
Is this enough?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.950
Whoa, that's way too much!

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.190
Hey, I was kidding! Of course, 
they're free of charge.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.150
That's also a lie. You looked 
rather hopeful for a moment.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.380
I'm sure she was startled by 
how much Noelle offered her.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.490
Oh, hey! There's another way in over there!

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.850
Let's go in from there!

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.240
Woohoo! Onward to witchy paradise!

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.860
Seriously, what are we doing?!

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.520
Just shut up, Asta!

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.400
What?!

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.180
I hate them. I hate all humans.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.060
They hurt us

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.280
and steal everything from us.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.860
Lady Fana.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.530
It appears that the Black Bulls we were 
monitoring are up to something strange.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.870
I will burn them all.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.290
They hurt Licht and took Vetto's life.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.920
I will... make them pay!

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.330
And then, when I went to the city,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.690
this guy who kept breathing hard 
gave me a bouquet of a hundred roses!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.590
Ew, gross!

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.210
Th-This is really cramped.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.100
I could kill someone right now.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.570
I'm really sorry.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.730
This Vanishawl was originally 
made to fit just one person.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.670
But this is better than being caught 
and becoming a human honeycomb, right?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.240
I guess we'll just have to deal 
until we get to the queen.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.090
I mean, we're better off than them, at least.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.070
Sorry about the sausage fest.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.810
Apparently she only made 
two of these cloaks.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.450
And to think there are some cute little 
witchies right over there, giggling away...

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.850
Could you please tell me 
what we're doing here now?

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.200
Hey, couldn't you sell this 
love potion a little cheaper?

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.820
I can't go any lower.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.320
L-Love potion?!

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.890
Did you hear a man's voice just now?

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.620
You must be hearing things. There's no 
way a man could get into this forest.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.940
You're right.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.890
Man, I panicked...

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.270
Sorry. I only ever imagined love 
potions in my wildest dreams.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.170
Gole!

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.840
Wh-What the heck is that? It's sorta cute.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.870
That's a security golem.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.200
They're small, but if they find intruders,
 they become a pain.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.570
They'll call their friends and 
start firing magic bullets.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.670
Then what you said earlier 
about honeycombs...

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.470
Yes. If they spot us, we're finished.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.820
They'll fill us with 
holes until we drop dead.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.160
They get under your guard with their cute appearance, then they ruthlessly attack.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.950
They're perfect assassins.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.360
It's heading toward us.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.750
Don't worry. They won't find us 
as long as we're under this cloak.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.670
Okay, now it's our turn.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.550
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.060
How?!

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.150
Gole?

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.070
Heya... Nice place you got here.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.900
Gole...

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.550
You worthless husband!

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.210
Gah! A naked old man is clinging to me!

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.550
What the heck are you doing, Old Man Zell?!

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.090
I promise this isn't on purpose. I'm sorry!

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.310
He can't help it. That's the 
kind of thing Master is into.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.530
You couldn't hold back, could you?

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.790
No, I just...

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.310
A cold glare from my own student...

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.420
Huh?

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.900
What's going on?

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.150
Men?!

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.500
Intruders!

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.010
Jeez! We'll just have to blast our way 
through to the queen's manor!

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.330
Right! Might as well use my spatial magic, 
then! We'll take the shortest route!

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.420
The most handsome member of the Black Bulls: Finral Roulacase
My contact info is written on the back!!

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.420
Hello, ladies!

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.780
Why are we stopping?!

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.310
A naked old man!

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.430
The most handsome member of the Black Bulls: Finral Roulacase
My contact info is written on the back!!

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.430
Why don't we have some tea later?

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.850
Seriously, Finral!

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.820
You freak!

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.060
The most handsome member of the Black Bulls: Finral Roulacase
My contact info is written on the back!!

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.060
I'll be waiting for your reply.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.950
Are we going to the place or what?!

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.790
Hey, you pervert...

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.730
What are you staring at?!

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.240
This isn't the shortest route at all!

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.990
None of them are giving me the time of day.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.650
I still haven't recovered from the shock.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.500
Crap! We're surrounded!

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.980
Special Magic Item: Spew-Smoke.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.760
The name tells you exactly what it does, huh?

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.290
This smoke has traces of magic in it.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.980
It'll work as a smokescreen 
for just a short while.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.980
This is our chance to head 
straight to the queen's manor!

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.670
Yeah!

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.860
There it is!

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.900
What the heck? Is it under construction?

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.260
Perfect! Let's dive right in!

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.930
I scraped my back because 
I wasn't wearing a shirt.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.300
That's your own fault for 
being into that sort of thing.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.880
You've got it all wrong! This was 
seriously just a coincidence!

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.660
Ow...

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.260
Imperfect...

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.360
Miz Vanessa!

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.180
Vanessa!

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.540
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.190
I don't know who you think you are,
 but get your foot off of her right now!

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.690
How dare an intruder like yourself 
address me in such a way?

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.630
I am the queen of this forest,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.370
the mother of all witches.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.910
That girl over there,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.930
as well as Vanessa, are 
my descendants. My children.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.900
A child who doesn't listen to her mother 
needs a little discipline, don't you think?

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.920
What?!

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.660
This is a family matter.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.120
Outsiders should stay out of it.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.200
I am free to do whatever 
I want to my daughters.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.390
You may be the Queen of Witches or whatever...

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.150
But that's got nothing to do with what I said.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.780
I told you to get your foot off of her!

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.410
Imperfect.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.780
Asta!

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.310
What is this? You have no magic?

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.550
What a vile, imperfect little brat.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.010
That's right... I've got no magic.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.680
And right now, I can't 
even fight with my swords.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.000
But I'm still better than anyone 
who'd step on their own family!

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.330
You must be the brat 
Vanessa was talking about.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.480
Why does she want to fix trash like you?

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.440
Even sacrificing herself...

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.050
This foolish little thing

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:04.020
told me she'd become my slave and 
live out the rest of her days here

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.300
in exchange for healing your arms.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.750
Miz Vanessa...

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.340
Wait... Is that why they're here, too?

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.690
You told me that you'd become 
the Wizard King someday, didn't you?

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.670
I want you to make that dream come true.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.090
Me, too.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.920
"When people care for you,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.350
none of your problems are 
just your own anymore."

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.690
Right, Noelle?

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.440
Yes.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.190
Guys...

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.730
And with that...

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.660
Impressive. Especially since 
I hid any intent to harm you.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.660
But...

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.350
Old man!

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.680
Yes. I was able to distract you 
while the old man saved Asta.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.850
Yup. This old man worked hard.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.520
So can we stop calling me that now?

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.850
Now, then...

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:17.650
Wind Creation Magic: 
Emperor of Slashing Winds.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.950
Now get your foot off of her!

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.410
Miz Vanessa is one of us!

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.370
You fools.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:33.250
What could imperfect creatures 
such as yourselves possibly do?

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.500
This little girl,

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.170
as well as all of you, 
cannot escape your fates.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:44.840
All that waits for you is the end 
seen in my divination here.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.190
They were much faster than I expected.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.230
I knew they would be coming,

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.150
but to think they'd choose a 
time like this to show up.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.470
The Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.340
Petit Clover

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.310
Petit Clover!

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.840
The Forest of G

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.620
The Forest of G.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:53.100
Bah-ha! I bought an amazing magic item 
through the Magic Shopping Network.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.100
Bah-ha!

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.650
This is an amazing item that makes 
you and your magic disappear!

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.900
It cost me five million yuls, 
but if I can finally enter the garden

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.390
of beautiful women known as the 
Witches' Forest, it's a bah-hargain.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.900
It'll only take twelve years to pay it off!

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.370
But this is bah-hazzare...

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.680
The Witches' Forest should be around here.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.620
What's wrong?

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.770
Bah-ha?!

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.040
What was that?!

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.790
Let's be friends.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.130
Ha-bah?!

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.540
Who's there?! You're giving me the creeps!

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:22.810
I'm Gordon.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.810
I'm also Gordon.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.560
Heya, I'm Gordon.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.050
We're all Gordon.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.030
Call us "Donnie."

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.430
Bah-ha!

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.990
The Forest of G

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.540
This is the Forest of Gordons!

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.200
The Forest of Gordons

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.400
The Eye of the Midnight Sun is 
attacking the Witches' Forest.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.730
What? Apparently another force 
is also trying to attack.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:50.160

 The Battlefield Decision

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.740
Yes. Stripping instantly 
is my master's magic.
