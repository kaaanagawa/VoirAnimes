00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.040
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.580
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.970
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.630
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.920
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.800
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.600
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.800
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.740
In order to defeat Megicula, the devil 
who inhabits the Spade Kingdom,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.270
the Magic Knights have been training hard.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.950
Meanwhile, deep within the sea,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.350
another problem was arising.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.710
Kiato! Kahono! You two make a run for it.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.850
But...

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.060
Go ask the Magic Knights for help.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.820
What? But we've gotten this far!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.800
Father!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.800
Dad!

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.550
Let's fall back for now, Kahono!

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.660
Okay.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.860
A Black Deep-Sea Story

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.440
Raquey is hot all year round due to 
the strong mana that surrounds it,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.800
making it a popular resort location.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.060
It's also an excellent training ground 
for those who use water magic.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.320
If I can only maintain this force...

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.380
It's not enough to just be able to split them.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.420
I need to make sure there's 
more mana in both of them.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.220
A song? Or is that crying?

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.160
I'm not sure why, but it 
feels sort of... nostalgic.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.230
Wait, why did I just see my mother?

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.660
Black Bulls, fight!

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.940
Push harder!

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.670
Harder! Even harder!

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.670
Fight... Fight...

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.900
I'll get you this time!

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.130
You out of steam already?

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.540
Well, I mean... It's not like 
I usually run this much.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.140
And what's the point of 
training like this, anyway?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.650
You know how much Mr. Yami and Asta 
did in that battle with the elves.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.650
The stronger your body is, 
the stronger your magic will be.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.440
That's right, Finral! If you get as buff as 
Captain Yami, you'll be unstoppable!

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.160
Isn't that hurdle a bit high?

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.840
We should all get super buff, and then
 you should all try to fight me!

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.680
All right! We need to be 
even louder this time!

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.600
Whoa, there!

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.170
Ow...

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.170
Tch. Damn, I missed one.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.110
Zora, you bastard! What the hell was that for?!

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.300
Well, I specialize in traps, so I'm 
training with traps, you moron.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.440
Train together, my ass.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.100
I didn't join the squad so I could 
be all buddy-buddy with you guys.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.500
What'd you say?!

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.230
Luck, you bastard! 
Are you trying to bury us?!

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.240
Sure am!

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.240
Here you go!

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.910
Ugh. They're all so noisy.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.560
I-I can't hide my face while doing this pose!

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.210
I-I'm so embarrassed!

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.050
I've been eating so much of Charmy's 
cooking that my weight's not going back down.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.520
Gonna lose weight, gonna lose weight,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.920
gonna lose weight, gonna lose weight...

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.720
In order to bulk up, you need 
to stress your muscles.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.190
It's said that it's effective when 
weight training to do three sets,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.350
and it's important to monitor your 
protein amounts and timing—

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.250
Who knew that the deltoids and trapezius 
were connected this way?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.650
I'm going to learn even more

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.160
about human anatomy, and create 
an even more accurate Marie doll.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.320
By the way, Gordon,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.780
I thought you mentioned that you 
don't handle sunlight very well.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.080
Were you able to get over that?

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.410
Yeah, I'm fine now.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.240
It's all thanks to this sunblock.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.710
You can try some if you'd like.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.590
Ah, thank you.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.380
You need to be meticulous 
when dealing with UV rays.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.760
Here you go.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.320
That's cold! What the hell 
do you think you're doing?!

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.260
Huh?! Uh... What?!

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.230
Hey... Here... you... go.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.750
Drinking first thing in 
the morning's not so bad.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.820
Here you go.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.670
So aren't you gonna train 
like the rest of them?

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.240
You're just gonna ignore me?

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.990
Guys! Food's ready!

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.260
Thanks for the meal!

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.420
Man, that was great!

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.520
It's that sound again.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.440
Noelle?

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.080
I think I heard it for the first 
time somewhere around here.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.620
Hey!

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.160
Asta...

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.290
Is something wrong?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.050
Do you hear that strange sound?

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.320
Sound?

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.560
Huh?

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.330
Kahono!

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.310
Kiato!

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.490
What are you doing here?

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.590
Kahono

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.890
I could ask you the same thing,
 but this is great.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.240
We were just about to go find you.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.070
Kiato

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.070
The sea goddess is as beautiful as ever.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.880
Did something happen at
the Underwater Temple?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.790
Oh, right. We wanted to ask you guys for help.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.420
Please come with us.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.420
Underwater Temple

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.440
They were attacked by a monster?!

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.630
It was probably a guardian of the sea.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.140
They've been around since time immemorial, 
and are said to be the sea god's servants.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.100
But why would a creature like that attack 
people from the Underwater Temple?

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.610
Gifso

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.670
Something has disturbed the 
underwater mana these past few days.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.230
Some of the creatures around 
here have become violent.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.230
I decided to dig into this a 
little further, then I saw it...

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.240
I couldn't see it clearly because 
of the disturbance in the mana,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.510
but south of the Underwater Temple, 
there is a place called the Void of No Return.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.420
That's where I saw the guardian 
of the sea letting its rage

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.250
overtake it, going berserk.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.680
I'm sure the disturbance in the mana 
here is due to the guardian's rage.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.560
The shrine mages tried to 
quell the guardian's rage

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.560
with their song and dance, but...

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.890
They all got hurt trying to defend us.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.650
Kahono...

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.410
What I'd like to ask from you 
is to protect Kiato and Kahono.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.780
Please get them to the Void of No Return safely.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.570
Why the hell are you asking us, though?

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.060
We're pretty busy with our training, you know.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.040
You were just drinking booze, Yami!

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040
I beg of you!

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.520
I ask this knowing how 
powerful the Black Bulls are!

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.350
You're among the few 
Magic Knights who can reach this

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.120
Underwater Temple safely 
despite being land dwellers.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.300
Because of the sea goddess's protection.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.120
This may sound harsh, 
but you got any proof that

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.390
this song and dance can calm 
down that guardian of yours?

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.440
Well...

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.610
We're not protecting this 
kingdom as volunteers.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:22.910
I can't just loan out some of my squad 
members when your resolve's that weak.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.500
So basically, you just need to 
know there's a chance, right?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.350
Huh?

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.170
Noelle?

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.610
The disturbance in the mana that's 
affecting this whole underwater area...

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.040
Maybe a devil's behind this, too.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.510
It's the Magic Knights' job to protect people.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.930
I'll get those two there safely, no matter what.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.270
Noelle...

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.660
Sea Goddess...

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.560
We...

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.490
We'll definitely quell the guardian's rage!

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.360
We've sung and danced solely for the sea god!

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.320
We'll make sure the guardian 
hears our prayers, too!

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.340
I guess I'll acknowledge your resolve.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.160
So, what's this chance you mentioned?

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.080
I... have an idea.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.800
It's right over there, Noelle.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.310
The Void of No Return.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.300
Just as the name suggests,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.060
it's said that any creature that 
wanders in there can never return.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.100
I thought the stories about 
the guardian of the sea

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.320
and the Void of No Return were 
just fairy tales when I was a kid.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.320
H-How deep does that thing go?

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.540
So, what's your plan?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.960
I'm going to make the Sea Dragon's Cradle
 smaller and more powerful.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.750
That's going to limit who 
I can take with me, though.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.040
Which means other than you, Kahono, and Kiato,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.260
we need one more—

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.640
Me, me! Me, me, me, me, me!

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.580
Me! I'll go!

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.530
Let's hurry up and kill that guardian!

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.330
I wonder how strong it is. 
I can't wait to find out!

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.710
Let's just finish off the stupid thing so 
I can work ou... I mean, so I can go see Marie.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.020
How can you say something 
like that right now?!

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.680
Don't worry! Life is an endless cycle!

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.610
To taste noms that have been 
aged since time immemorial...

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.270
Yeah, you guys aren't going.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.560
What?!

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.380
Tch!

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.850
And you're not going, either.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.250
What?!

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.000
But why?! Is it because I can't swim?!

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.800
Oh, right. No way in hell you're going, then.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.470
Crap!

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.630
How stupid can you be?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.840
Finral.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.550
You go.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.640
Huh?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.960
If things get dangerous, get everyone back 
here safe, even if it costs your life.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.220
Got it?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.990
Yes, sir!

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.110
Oh, and Noelle.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.730
You decided to do this, so make sure 
you see it all the way through.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.390
Yes, sir!

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.340
Such violent mana!

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.240
If I let my guard down for 
even a second, we're finished.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.540
Look!

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.670
What the heck are those guys?!

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.250
I don't know. We've never 
seen them before, either.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:25.630
Kahono!

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.790
Leave it to me!

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.700
Song Magic: Mother Lullaby!

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.490
It could be that the 
powerful mana in the area

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.790
caused the fish here to turn into monsters.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.980
Is that even...

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.660
There are so many of them!

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.730
There's no end to them.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.140
We'll just have to keep going.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:59.880
Noelle!

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.750
Leave this to us.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.760
Song Magic: Destructive Beat!

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.510
Wait! Kahono! Kiato!

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.930
Big Brother!

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.310
Got it!

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.940
Combo Spell: Sea God's Descent!

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.910
There are too many of them!

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.160
Noelle...

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.560
What am I even doing? I'm supposed 
to protect Kahono and Kiato,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.170
and yet I'm just watching 
while they do all the fighting.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.420
Noelle, run!

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.490
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.580
If I leave, you're going to 
be thrown into the ocean!

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.560
Don't worry. I promise to take those 
two and meet back with you safely.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.730
But how...

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.500
Well, our captain did say to bring everyone 
back even if it costs my life.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.630
And I'm not so much of a failure 
that I'd leave a girl behind

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.120
in such a dangerous place.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.990
So go on! Quickly!

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.240
Finral...

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Noelle!

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.510
Kahono!

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.280
Everyone...

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.520
I can't just...

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.020
That's right. If I let this stop me,

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.320
I'll never be able to defeat 
the devil and avenge my mother!

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.270
The Spirit Guardians borrow some power 
from natural mana to use powerful magic,

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.330
but they still cannot defeat devils.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.790
Natural mana...

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.830
If I can somehow get all this chaotic 
underwater mana on my side...

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.480
Please... lend me your strength!

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.600
What?

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.460
This is...

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.640
Huh?

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.640
It's so powerful!

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:30.400
It requires so much magic control 
just to protect all of us, let alone this...

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.060
This is amazing! I always knew 
you were amazing, Noelle!

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.410
Sorry for putting you in danger like that.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.410
Now, we're heading right to 
the guardian of the sea!

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.410
Wh-What's that?

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.930
That's a kraken!

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.680
The kraken is the protector of the sea. 
It protects all the creatures within the sea.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.930
So right now, it's protecting the guardian?

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.940
Ooh, a squid leg!

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.700
Not bad, Finral!

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.740
Here it comes!

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.980
This ink isn't just to obstruct our vision.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.260
It's disturbing the mana 
around us. At this rate...

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.340
Water Creation Magic:

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.760
Valkyrie Armor!

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.060
Noelle!

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.780
Sorry, but I need you to take a little nap.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.120
Now's our chance!

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.370
Right!

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.000
Ruins?

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.980
I had no idea there was a place like 
this at the bottom of that hole.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.480
I wonder if people used to live down here, too.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.870
Is that... the guardian?

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.550
Such powerful mana...

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.250
It's as though it's just unleashing pure rage.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.170
Are we being threatened?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.930
I see. The guardian was 
uneasy because of its baby.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.320
And the creatures of the sea were

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.680
just trying to protect the 
guardian and its baby.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.360
This is...

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.690
So that sound I've been 
hearing was your lullaby.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.720
Wait! Was that...

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.790
Thank you, Sea Godde—

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.330
A-Are you hurt?

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.020
Huh?

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.840
No, I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:08.790
Maybe my mother came here once, too.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.100
Though I'm sure I took much 
longer and was far clumsier.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.100
Even so, I made it here.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.590
I'm growing, too.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.150
Thank you all so much!

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.700
But are you sure this is 
all the thanks you need?

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.180
Gramps was super excited about holding a feast.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.320
This is the best, la!

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.030
F-Feast?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.000
Kahono, Kiato! Tell Gramps hi for me.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.220
Sure!

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.340
Come visit again once 
things have calmed down.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.100
Then I'll give the sea goddess 
the best welcome ev—

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.430
Let's go on another double 
date, Asta and Noelle!

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.020
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha...

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.830
Sure thing!

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.660
H-H-H-How could you agree to that?!

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.360
Kahono's so forward. I love it!

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.220
Damn it, no! I have Miss Finnes!

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.530
Good work.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.530
Yami...

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:13.340
Come to think of it, it was also here 
that a good-for-nothing like you

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.550
decided to willingly join a 
battle for the first time.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.290
Yeah, I guess that also happened.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.800
Do you remember what I told you when 
you were still a good-for-nothing?

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.560
You've probably got your own 
way of fighting, right?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.140
Yes. And I've already found it.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:39.060
Now, I'm working hard toward my 
next goal... or at least, I'm trying.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:41.820
I see.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.260
That's great and all, but...

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.060
Yes?

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.990
You totally brought a squid leg over here 
with your spatial magic, didn't you?!

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.440
I-It was a spur-of-the-moment thing! I'm sorry!

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.080
I don't want to hear your lame excuses.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.740
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:00.160
Welcome... back... everyone!

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.220
Thanks, Henry!

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.130
Right. Guess it's chow time.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.050
I'm starving!

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.000
What are you making for us?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.360
We'll start simple with a seafood barbecue

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.870
and enjoy its natural yumminess!

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.320
Plenty of protein!

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.640
A gift for Marie!

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.630
I want to eat squid.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.230
A squid almost finished... I mean, 
I'm done with squid for now.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.540
Just watch, Mother.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.520
I'm going to become even stronger.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.120
Noelle! Asta! Let's continue to do our best!

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.250
I'm going to become an idol! Just you watch!

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.860
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 137:

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:54.270
Page 137
Charmy's Century of Hunger, Gordon's Millennium of Loneliness

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.560
"Charmy's Century of Hunger, 
Gordon's Millennium of Loneliness."

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.010
I hope you'll cheer me on!
