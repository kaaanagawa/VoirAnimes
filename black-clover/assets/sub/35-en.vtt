00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.670
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.550
The leader of the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun, Licht.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.020
Asta was no match for his 
overwhelming magical powers.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.810
The one who came to Asta's rescue

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.210
was none other than the captain 
of the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.440
In a breathless battle between 
light magic and dark magic,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.360
Asta went beyond his limits and 
closed in for his counterattack.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.530
But...

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.330
How dare you... harm Valtos?!

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.040
I cannot allow people like 
you to harm my comrades

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.420
ever again!

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.130
Light Creation Magic: Light Whip of Judgment!

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.640
It's useless to struggle!

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.310
The cave!

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.940
That nutcase has gone ballistic!

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.990
Oh, dear... I held back most of my magic,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.330
but it's all really too fragile...

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.660
Both this world and you fools.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.630
You're amazing, Master Licht!
Your strength is practically divine!

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.300
If you felt like it, Master Licht, the Magic 
Knights would be no more than infants!

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.450
What?!

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.820
The Light of Judgment

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.610
If you concentrate like that, you can 
sense the ki of natural objects, too.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.570
That way, you'll never get killed
by stuff like falling rocks.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.630
Ki is awesome! Hooray for ki!

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.080
Ki is the best!

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.080
Who do you think you are?

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.620
All right!

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.420
Now take it up a notch and go after the 
white-haired dude with the round eyebrows!

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.760
What?!

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.710
Actually, I think I could do that right now.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.340
All right! Because of my ki,
I'm enthusiastic, energetic, and confident!

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.620
Hope you're ready, Round Brows!

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.250
Actually, scratch that.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.230
What?!

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.440
I told him that I'd show him the 
power of a captain, so I'll do it.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.080
Plus, if you did it, you'd die.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.840
But then what am I supposed to 
do with all this extra energy?!

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.740
Not my problem.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.490
You can tackle that scrawny line-faced dude.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.540
Now, then...

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.790
It's been a while since I've let loose.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.800
Dark Magic:

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.890
Dark Cloaked

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.820
Lightless Slash!

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.310
As I thought...

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.560
My magic is being drawn in.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.940
So this is the power of dark magic.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.190
But...

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.950
Now that I know that, it'll be 
impossible for you to get me.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.280
Hey, you were in the middle 
of some weird story,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.660
but that wasn't the end of it, was it?

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.510
That grimoire means you're a citizen 
of the Clover Kingdom, right?

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.510
Why attack your own country?

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.980
You're wide open.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.780
He left himself wide open 
so I'd let my guard down...

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.490
Yami Sukehiro.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.330
You are a worthy foe.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.880
Answer me. What's your real goal here?

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.590
Since you're a foreigner, I'm sure 
you've noticed them, too.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.650
The distortions in this country.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.400
Some are on the brink of 
death from starvation,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.910
but others have so much excess 
food that they throw it away.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.000
People are ranked by how much 
or how little magic they have,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.180
but some have great magic, yet are 
discriminated against for reasons of birth.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.430
Some are hurt in the name of justice 
because they were born in another country.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.660
We were born from these distortions...

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.420
In order to correct them.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.330
I'm not seeing the point here.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.720
Aren't you trying to do the same 
thing these distorted people do?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.720
Are you sane?

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.200
Perfectly sane.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.970
Let me answer your sins with sin.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.020
So you're gonna have it 
your way, no matter what.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.480
I like guys like that.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.860
But...

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.900
I hate your guts!

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.090
Wh-What's with this battle?

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.520
So this is the captain's

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.950
full power...

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.610
I don't have any magic. Can I 
surpass them, even if I train?

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.060
This guy, Yuno, and the Wizard King...

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.170
To think that he has enough power to 
go head to head with Master Licht...

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.920
Master Licht! Please allow me to assist you!

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.050
Hey, brat.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.760
That was close!

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.600
Why are you wimping out, you dumbass?

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.600
I left that scrawny guy to you.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.310
I don't give guys jobs they can't do.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.320
Do something about him in your own way.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.740
Yes, sir!

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.540
That's right... I'm going to become 
the Wizard King, no matter what.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.270
I don't have time to get depressed.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.440
All right, let's do this!

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.550
First, I'll become the guy who beats you!

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.170
You won't get me twice.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.680
Spatial Magic: Myriad Black.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.330
You may be able to see what's coming, 
but can you block all of these?

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.360
One of them got through...

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.870
This will go on forever...

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.870
Until you can't move anymore!

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.340
You dared defy Master Licht 
despite having no magic.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.240
You will pay with your life!

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.230
Damn it... I don't think I'm going 
to last until he runs out of magic.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.080
Even if I manage to repel his attacks, 
at this rate, he's going to beat me.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.280
Calm down and think... Do this my own way...

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.620
You threw away your only weapons?

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.870
Have you lost your mind?!

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.880
In that case, I'll take you 
out with an extra-big one!

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.640
He jumped into my space?!

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.810
You just punched him in the face!
You're hilarious, kid!

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.050
You let your guard down again.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.850
That'd be you.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.170
My attack was absorbed?

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.260
And I can't move...

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.260
Dark Magic: Black Hole, and then...

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.760
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.890
Black Blade!

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.080
Captain Yami!

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.330
Well done, brat!

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.080
You got me.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.970
It's probably within five meters. 
The range is definitely limited,

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.970
but to think there was a magic

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.440
that could absorb my own magic 
and stop me from moving...

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.660
Dark magic is amazing.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.640
The one attribute that's the 
natural enemy of my light magic.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.660
However, dark magic is extremely slow.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.630
Light has absolute speed, making them
polar opposites there, as well.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.740
That's why you cloaked 
your weapon in darkness

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.120
and created a combat style that uses 
reinforcement magic to compensate.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.990
Correct!

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.130
Why does it sound like he's bragging?!

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.710
By the way, what's up? You can 
use recovery magic, can't you?

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.630
So hurry up and heal.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.330
But while you're healing yourself, 
I'm going to get real close

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.310
and chop you up even more.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:16.350
I'll admit it. You're the second person 
I've met with the power to defeat me.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.110
But I sadly cannot waste my time with you.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.580
Huh? What was that, punk?

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.320
And whaddaya mean, the second?

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:31.020
I still have an ultimate enemy left who 
inflicted this unhealable wound on me,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.070
the Wizard King, Julius Novachrono.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.250
This is currently my greatest magic.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.370
Speed you cannot avoid...

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.680
A spell with such a wide range and 
high output that pulling it in

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.660
with that spell you used won't do any good.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:57.310
You will meet your end the moment I 
release this, Captain of the Black Bulls.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.430
Like hell he will!

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.110
Quit underestimating Captain Yami!

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.030
Your face is stupid!

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.530
Yeah, that's not good. 
That's some insane magic.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.320
What?!

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:17.080
Boy. You will also be punished for
hurting Valtos, and return that grimoire.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.340
That's definitely a four-leaf for you... 
His magical abilities are off the charts.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.030
Unless I catch him by surprise, 
he'll just dodge any slash at light speed.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.090
What should I do?

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.020
I'll leave that up to the me 
of five seconds from now!

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.850
Papa!

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.810
Mama!

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.750
I was so scared!

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.770
There, there...

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.560
Are you hurt?

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.570
That should be everybody.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.740
Don't you dare die, you old hag!

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.950
Hey, wake up, old hag!

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.680
You're supposed to be some 
immortal monster hag!

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.370
Sister!

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.750
N-No... Why?

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:07.510
Gauche, you're hurt really badly, too, 
so you should worry about your own—

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.720
Shut up!

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.860
Uh... I'm the one with
seniority here, you know!

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.520
Gauche's treatments will be done soon.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.500
Huh?

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:25.230
Well, all of his wounds just 
barely missed his vital points.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.490
So he was lucky?

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.240
I'm not sure. That just seems...

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.520
Then hurry up and treat the old hag, not me!

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.030
O-Of course.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.210
Old hag! Wake up already! Old hag—

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.090
Tone it down...

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.960
I can hear you, idiot.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.460
Old hag!

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.090
Sister!

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.970
Take my magic...

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.660
You're going to save them, aren't you?

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.850
Asta and the others...

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.600
I never said I'd...

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.990
You changed... after meeting him.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.960
I'm counting on you, Gauche.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.340
Old hag!

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.830
You're joking, right?

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.130
You said you could die?

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.190
Bring her back to life!

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.160
B-But...

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.100
Do something!

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.300
But...

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.800
Marie's going to be sad, damn it!

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.380
She's alive.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.800
Huh?

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.220
She's not dead.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.810
You old hag! Stop being so misleading!

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.240
I'm a monster hag, remember?

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.570
I won't kick the bucket so easily.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.390
Relax and get over there, 
you sister complex freak.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.310
Take my magic, too!

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.480
Mine, too!

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.640
Mine, too!

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.580
Please save Asta!

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.170
Please use my magic, too.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.480
You...

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.340
I'm very sorry for being 
violent toward your sister.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.330
I wouldn't be of any help if I went.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.360
Please take care of Asta.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.900
Brother.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.110
See? Everyone lives by supporting each other.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.540
Marie...

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.140
You just protect what you want to protect.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.920
Someday, that'll help somebody out.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.580
I know what I have to do now.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.490
Finral!

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.420
Erk...

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.550
Take me back to that cave!

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.600
S-Seriously?

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.810
And I'm your senior, damn it!

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.570
Actually, even if we go back,

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.370
are you going to be able to do anything 
about that blinding magic guy?

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.310
You didn't stand a chance earlier,

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.320
so it's probably better to
wait for reinforcements.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.150
I thought of something.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.150
Huh?

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.160
Unless I'm wrong...

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.250
We've got a chance!

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.290
We won't be able to surprise 
attack him with my spatial magic.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:30.210
People with powerful magic have force 
fields of magic that appear around them.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.200
I won't be able to get that close.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.340
Not to mention, I moved way too 
many people really far today.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.750
I may only be able to use 
my magic one more time.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.770
That's fine.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.970
Huh?

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:43.880
Finral...

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.360
Please!

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.870
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.300
This is the end.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.940
Dark Magic:

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.880
Black Cocoon.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.910
This magic...

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.710
I've gone into defensive mode, but...

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.660
It's hopeless. He's gonna kill us.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.770
What?! How are you so calm?!

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.270
Okay, then! I'll just deflect it!

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.070
Nah. The swords will probably 
be all that's left of you.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.800
No!

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.290
Then what should we do?!

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.930
Uh... Not give up until the end?

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.810
Now you're just trying to act cool!

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.810
To be completely honest,
there's nothing we can do right now.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.820
Grit your teeth and stand firm.
That's all we can do right now.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.820
Farewell, Yami Sukehiro.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.120
Whoa, what the hell?! 
Did we come to the wrong place?

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.710
Look!

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.830
That's Yami's magic!

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.840
Gah! This has gotten way out of hand!

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.590
Light Magic: Ray of Divine Punishment.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.780
He came.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.200
He's...

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.230
Mirror Magic: Full Reflection!

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.620
No matter how big or strong it is...

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.170
Mirrors reflect light!

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.280
To think someone could wound Sally this badly.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.860
I hate them. This is unforgivable.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.510
This is annoying, but it
looks like it's our turn.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.350
Petit Clover

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.780
Petit Clover!

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.850
Voice Change

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.260
Voice Change.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.460
M-Marie's coughing?!

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.120
Did you catch a cold?

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.520
It was pretty cold in the cave! 
Are you all right, Marie?

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.070
Yeah, my throat's just a little sore.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.060
Huh?

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.280
My voice sounds strange.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.490
M-My angel Marie's voice 
sounds like Captain Yami's!

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.660
More importantly, Brother, 
go save Asta and the others!

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.710
Take my magic.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.730
The old hag's voice is weird, too?

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.250
I may only be able to use 
my magic one more time.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.670
You, too, Finral?!

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.890
Wait, now my throat is...

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.700
Your voice is cute!

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.270
I did it, Marie! Your big 
brother defeated the enemy!

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.360
I need to hurry back to Marie... 
Who the hell are you guys?

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.570
No one said anything about reinforcements!

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.610
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 36: "Three Eyes."

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 36
 Three Eyes

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.950
I might not be able to 
go back just yet, Marie.
