00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.800
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.850
Burning with rage toward humans, the Magic 
Knights who reincarnated as elves attacked.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.310
Asta and the others headed toward 
the royal capital to stop them

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.620
and encountered Rades, Valtos, and Sally,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.490
who had been sacrificed in order to 
reincarnate the elves, and almost died.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.530
You guys piss me off, too, but right now,
 I want to kill that bastard Licht.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.450
The three former Eye of 
the Midnight Sun members

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.120
joined them, and they 
all hurried to the capital.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.580
Meanwhile, at the royal capital...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.250
To save her brother Nozel 
and protect the capital,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.590
Noelle awakened a new spell.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.840
You're mine!

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.310
Langris!

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100
As for Finral...

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.560
I'm your older brother!

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.900
Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.820
This is... my last chance!

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.860
Your big brother's pretty confident 
when it comes to agility and accuracy.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.790
I'm going to stop you, no matter what!

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.980
Come here...

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.970
Langris!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.700
He finally stopped his younger brother
 Langris's destructive rampage,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.850
which began when Langris
 reincarnated as an elf.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.140
But now, Patry, who had 
returned to the hideout,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.590
was about to set a 
terrifying plan in motion.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.210
Now all we have to do is fit the final

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.700
magic stone into the pedestal in the castle,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.480
and activate the spell that 
uses the entire kingdom.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.280
We'll wipe out all of the humans,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.300
and we'll take back this world, 
making it a peaceful world for elves alone.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.990
Now, then...

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.990
As soon as those two wake up, 
we'll have all the actors in place.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.700
The Raging Bull
 Joins the Showdown!!

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.140
Morning. How do you feel 
after that long nap...

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.250
Fana? Vetto?

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.480
Do you remember your previous incarnations?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.250
Yeah. We were the Third Eye, weren't we?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.500
Vetto the Despair

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.500
Fana the Hateful

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.430
Fana the Hateful, Vetto the Despair,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.990
and Raia the Disloyal, was it? How hilarious.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.390
Vetto and Fana were previously part 
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun's

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.410
elite three, known as the Third Eye,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.370
where they fought against Asta and the others.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.880
Vetto lost his life, and Fana's soul 
left the body it had inhabited,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.010
allowing that body to start a new life.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.660
Raia incubated the general traits of 
the human bodies they had inhabited

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.630
and prepared new bodies 
for their souls to inhabit.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.800
Welcome back.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.170
Since we're short on time,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.620
I could only incubate your bodies long 
enough for you to be about fifteen.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.610
Now you're smaller than me, Vetto.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.060
Well, I've died twice now. 
I can't exactly be picky.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.860
Yeah.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.100
Creating duplicate bodies 
with the exact same mana...

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.580
I've really gotta hand it to Sally 
and her research on this one.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.050
Too bad she's probably dead by now.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.340
My mind is much clearer this time.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.820
We used the evil eye

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.260
to force your previous incarnation, 
so your malice was probably stronger.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.970
Evil eye?

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:42.500
True, I did feel half-asleep last time...
 like I was having a nightmare.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.980
Salamander!

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.220
No response.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.530
I guess Salamander's gone.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.070
So someone else who was qualified 
showed up while Fana's soul was away?

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.160
Well, you're strong enough right now,
 even without Salamander.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.590
Guess you're right. If nothing else, 
there's no way I'd lose to those stupid humans.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.730
All right, I'm gonna take 
you to the Grimoire Tower,

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.840
so hurry up and let one pick you.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.350
Actually, before that, we need some clothes.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.830
Especially Fana.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.860
They <i>do</i> seem a bit bigger than they 
were the last time you were fifteen.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.420
Soon this false royal capital created 
by the humans will be no more.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.540
It appears they've finally gathered up above.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.520
Come to think of it,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.890
they must've received the revelation 
in preparation for this moment.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.060
Those who guide the elves... 
The Apostles of Sephira!

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.310
The Apostles of Sephira

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.610
Licht!

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.610
He may seem like that right now, 
but I'm certain Licht is actually in there.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.630
Once the reincarnation is fully complete,
 he'll be back to the same old Licht.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.550
Right...

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.120
Wait, where's that one boy?

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.590
Well, the weird thing is...

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.630
He was reincarnated, but somehow, 
his personality was still the human's.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.340
Wait, what?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.610
Don't worry. He'll be with us 
once everything is complete.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.580
Let's go wait over there.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.850
Right.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.750
Man, look at this view.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.820
The party's in full swing.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.820
All right. Let's get started.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.960
By infusing Gravito Stones with magic,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.380
we will open the door to the underworld

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.330
that was sealed under Clover Castle!

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.710
The hell is that?

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.880
What's going on?

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.300
Nozel, the castle...

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.350
What in the world is that?

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.730
It's a magic space that acts as the 
border between this world and the next.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.000
The elves of antiquity entrusted it 
to the humans in an ancient pact.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.360
It's called the Shadow Palace.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.570
Only the Apostles of Sephira, 
ten elves who are able

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.510
to receive divine revelations, can open it.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.370
See?

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.970
When we put the final magic stone 
in its pedestal inside the palace,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.620
the elves' reincarnation 
will be complete!

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.000
In exchange, the souls of the 
humans who owned these bodies

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.970
will be sent to the underworld!

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.730
And because I am so beautiful... 
I shall not allow that to happen!

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.830
David's dice magic acquires effects

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.170
that give him an advantage

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.480
depending on his roll.
 Better rolls mean more advantage.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.020
But getting this much power from a two...

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.490
This is absurd!

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.580
I mean, it probably won't do you 
much good, but give it your all.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.000
What in the world was that about?

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.510
So basically, there's a magical 
space spreading over there.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.010
I don't know what the hell's over there,
 but this looks pretty bad.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.340
Well, why don't we head on over?

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.350
We will not let you get in the 
way of the Apostles of Sephira!

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.580
Guess they're not just 
gonna let us go over there.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.390
Bring it on!

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.360
I'll slash you all up!

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.470
Uh, fighting those numbers without Finral's 
spatial magic is gonna be a bit rough.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.360
Damn it!

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.610
It's just one thing after another... 
Give us a break already, damn it!

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.700
What should we do?

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.800
That's...

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.800
Everyone!

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.580
Are you okay?!

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.620
So basically, there's a magical 
space spreading over there.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.070
I don't know what the hell's over there,
 but this looks pretty bad.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.310
Well, why don't we head on over?

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.410
We will not let you get in the 
way of the Apostles of Sephira!

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.650
Guess they're not just 
gonna let us go over there.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.450
Bring it on!

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.420
I'll slash you all up!

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.530
Uh, fighting those numbers without Finral's 
spatial magic is gonna be a bit rough.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.430
Damn it!

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:04.650
It's just one thing after another... 
Give us a break already, damn it!

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.760
What should we do?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.860
That's...

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.890
Don't worry, everyone! We're no one suspicious!

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.260
We're the Black Bulls,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.080
here with some other guys who 
ended up joining us for reasons!

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.750
What... is... that... black... castle... back... there?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.770
Looks like Gauche is chilling
on top of the enemy base.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.500
We're coming to save you, Gauche!

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.850
P-P-Please wait!

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.720
Where the hell is Licht?!

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.300
A stupidly huge... bull?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.930
So you've finally shown yourself, Henry.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.590
What kind of entrance was that?

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.440
Welcome, you dumbasses!

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.810
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mister Yami!

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.460
Hey, Finral's passed out behind the captain.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.090
What?! Are you okay, Finral?!

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.660
Wait! You already woke up once?!

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.080
Really?! Then you should've woken up faster!

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.370
La! Eat my cooking and feel all better!

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.090
All of you, eat!

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.210
You guys are way too late!

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.730
You should thank me for keeping things 
smoothed over until you got here!

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.330
Oh, gosh, I felt so helpless without them!

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.610
What the heck, Noelle?! What even 
is that outfit?! You look so cool!

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.900
You were the ones in trouble!

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.350
You're the one who should 
be thankful to us, Lady Noe!

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.010
Hey, now... What the hell is that mess?

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.490
It's not exactly clear to me either,

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.360
but they've always been a mess.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.370
They're our teammates, the other Black Bulls!

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.700
Curse you, humans! It doesn't 
matter how many of you show up!

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.750
You're no match for us elves!

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.460
Here they come!

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.730
Luck's High Mana Detection

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.340
High

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:02.590
High Mana

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.840
High Mana De

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.090
High Mana Detect

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.010
High Mana Detection

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.150
It gauges the magic attack's affinity

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.010
and uses balls of our magic...

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.930
...to intercept it!

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.860
That's so cool!

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.610
Where the hell is Licht?!

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.070
Curse you! Take this!

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.140
Rouge!

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.660
Our attacks are missing them?!

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.080
Take... this.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.610
La! All of you who used magic, 
eat up and recover your mana!

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.120
I can't use magic, but I'm 
sure the heck gonna eat!

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.850
Where the hell is Licht?!

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.220
Y'all are crazy!

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.850
So, beanpole, what do you think of my team?

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.650
I wanna slash 'em.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.860
Well, don't, dumbass!

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.780
The Black Bulls...

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.460
Even here, you intend to get in my way?

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.300
That one is troublesome.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.250
Magic that interferes with natural laws...

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.520
A witch, eh?

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.880
That's the cornerstone of their defense.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.090
I'll go.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.750
Reve!

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:27.800
Ah, guess you're finally awake. 
You somehow sleep even more than Raia.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.750
This will be your first spell in several 
centuries, counting your past life.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.050
Are you gonna be okay?

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.560
There's no problem.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.750
Members of the Black Bulls!

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.560
Mimosa! Mimosa's big brother
 and Mushroom Guy, too!

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.110
Asta! We have to hurry,

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:50.360
or everyone's who's been taken over by 
elves will be taken over completely!

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.820
What?!

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.040
This beautiful magic...

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.670
Oh, come on. Don't tell me this ki is...

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.290
Isn't that...

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.800
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
Dorothy Unsworth

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.800
The Captain of the Coral Peacocks,
 Dorothy Unsworth?!

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.310
Dream Magic: Glamour World.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.290
Wha...

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.820
What the heck just happened?!

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.310
I can sense the magic of the vanished pieces,

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.860
but they don't exist anywhere.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.200
Miz Vanessa... and Magna and Luck...

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.530
and Miz Charmy and Sally... are all gone?!

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.180
How beautiful!

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.460
The moment Captain Dorothy's 
magic activates, it's over.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.140
Its targets are taken to the World of Dreams,

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.880
and there's not a thing they can do about it.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.250
The World of Dreams?

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.120
Now the cornerstone of their defense is gone.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.010
Guess we should wrap things up, then.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.520
Combo Spell: Storm of Light Swords
 of Imperial Conviction.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.440
There you are, Licht!

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.700
Gauche!

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.800
G-G-G-G-Gordon!

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.280
Okay!

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.580
Poison Curse Magic: 
Dwelling of the Poison Cloud!

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.000
What's the big idea, Gordon?!

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.630
Conversion Magic: Poison to Cotton!

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.340
We're saved! Thanks, Miz Grey!

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.340
Were you trying to kill us, Gordon?!

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.350
Uh, that was teamwork, Asta.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.940
Leave the rest to us.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.820
You go on ahead with your precious Licht.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.290
Please don't say it like that.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.850
I'm counting on you, Droit.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.110
Sure. Get going.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.630
Tch.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.200
Valtos, open up a path!

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.230
Hey, those jerks!

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.790
Everyone...

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:16.560
Get... away... from... me.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.050
Henry!

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.670
It's because he left the Raging Black Bull.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.060
And without Miz Charmy here, 
the others can't recover their mana!

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.290
Everyone!

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.610
No... My body...

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.930
That was one hell of a spell, 
and it doesn't look like

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.130
your body can keep up yet.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.120
Though I don't have much magic 
left right now, either.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.550
Asta...

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.210
Are you all right, 
Shriveled Little Mushroom?

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.490
Things aren't looking too good over there,

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.460
but I can't just let Licht go like this.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.470
I'm sure you dumbasses can handle this!
 Surpass your damn limits!

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.510
Yes, sir!

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.530
All right. We'll leave this to you.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.020
Let's go, beanpole!

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.020
Who died and made you boss, meathead?!

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.600
Big Brother, some of them left.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.190
Then we need to quickly 
kill the ones that are here

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.280
so we can hurry after them.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.560
Now... it's time for hide and seek.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.820
Find all of them, Eclat.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.040
Okay.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.580
Willpower's not gonna help you now, humans.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.610
I found them.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.800
Look at me.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.890
Mirror Magic...

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:42.800
Eye Magic...

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.140
Combo Spell: Reflect Iris.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.530
Wha...

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.310
Th-This...

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.270
I-I can't...

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.820
...move!

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.540
And...

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.900
...my magic's...

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.930
Eclat's magic allows her to immobilize 
anyone who looks into her eyes.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.290
It binds them physically, 
but also blocks their magic.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.790
Marie doesn't even have her grimoire yet!

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.300
I guess she's awesome, too!

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.300
Now you can just die, completely helpless.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.110
Not yet...

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.810
Not... yet!

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.310
I'm not going to give up...

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:37.330
I'm going to turn Gauche 
and Marie back to normal.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.820
I'm going to...

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.820
stop you, no matter what!

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.830
My body can move again?

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.340
He nullified the magical effects?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.170
Asta...

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.010
Can all three of you move now?

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.010
Yeah!

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.010
That's Licht's...

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.270
Demon-Destroyer Sword?

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.520
Why does he have it?

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.520
That weapon's too good for you!

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.290
Die and give it back!

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.970
I'll use transformation magic...

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.020
Take that!

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.040
...to make more mirrors!

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.530
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.630
Even though it's more powerful... 
I know Gauche's magic really well!

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.840
Actually, he kind of pisses me off.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.100
Always attacking me unfairly 
with those weird beams...

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.350
He hasn't actually changed much 
after getting his body taken over!

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:56.600
Yeah... And when he comes back, 
he'll insult us even more.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.370
And he'll keep showing us 
the photo of his little sister,

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.860
and making figures of his little sister,
 and always having nose bleeds...

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:10.120
He's... very... creepy.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.290
We'll get him back to normal,
 even if it hurts us,

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.040
so we can complain directly to his face!

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.600
Petit Clover

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.620
Petit Clover!

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.060
Revival

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.910
Revival.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.110
Part 1

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.110
Part 1.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:14.370
You guys are smaller now, 
since we didn't have time.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.220
Yeah, I definitely jumped the gun.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.880
Part 2

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:21.900
Part 2.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.130
I had a little too much time on my hands,
 so I incubated them too long.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.970
Vetto and Fana are way older now.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.340
Yeah, I definitely took too long.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.350
My best friend, Gauche Adlai.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.740
Your little sister is basically my little sister.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.150
Yes. Marie is my actual little sister!

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.200
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 111: "The Eyes in the Mirror."

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:54.120
Page 111
 The Eyes in the Mirror

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.120
Ah, little sister, I cry for you.
