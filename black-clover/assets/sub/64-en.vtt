00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.940
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.860
Show me who you really are!

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.070
Never giving up...

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.780
is my magic!

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.810
The Queen of Witches released Asta's 
limiter suppressing his anti-magic

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.960
and awakened his full powers.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.250
What is this?

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.460
It feels like I'm in a cold lake.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.340
It feels cool...

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.760
My mind is unbelievably clear.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.290
And I can feel...

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.510
the power overflowing!

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.530
I assumed that you might be one of their kin,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.110
but apparently I was wrong.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.320
A sudden mutation kept 
mana from dwelling in you.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.360
You're merely defective.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.910
But because of that,
you are able to wield that sword.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.910
You aren't special. Not in the slightest.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.790
But that's exactly what makes you special.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.670
Black Meteorite!

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.140
Asta was able to defeat Ladros, 
thanks to this newly awakened power,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.280
and Ladros turned over a new leaf.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.470
However...

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.690
Controlling blood. That is my magic.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.400
From now on, you'll spend your life 
in my employ, working as my blade.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.900
The Queen of Witches was after 
Asta's anti-magic all along.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.160
She then took control of Asta...

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.410
Now, for your first task...

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.870
I shall force you to kill everyone 
here with your own two hands.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.720
The Red Thread of Fate

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.520
No... way...

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.570
Asta, stop!

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.520
Asta!

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.530
Now, then... Which one of you shall I kill first?

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.530
I know.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.290
I'll start with you, little royal.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.850
Go.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.010
Stop!

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.730
No! Wake up!

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.300
Snap out of it, Asta!

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.840
It's no use. He can't hear us.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.720
Asta, stop! Don't you recognize me?

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.230
It must be fate...

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.730
To think that a royal of the 
Clover Kingdom shall die by his sword.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.740
Asta...

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.000
Asta...

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.830
Wake up!

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.090
Asta...

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.340
This is farewell.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.470
No!

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.970
Asta, don't!

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.300
Do it.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.290
This boy... He's unconscious, and yet...

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.580
Asta...

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.580
So he's not completely under her control.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.130
I won't let you kill me.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.840
I'm not going to let you kill me!

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.720
Just you wait!

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.970
I'll shake this flimsy spell 
off right this instant!

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.980
These stupid things!

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.730
Puppet's Blood binds itself with the 
blood in your body and takes hold.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.780
No matter how much you struggle, 
you will never undo it.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.990
That goes for you as well, 
even if you don't have any magic.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.750
Asta...

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.000
You are stubborn. However...

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.220
Asta!

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.220
Please! Make him stop!

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.750
I swear that I'll never 
leave this forest again!

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.230
I'll never disobey you again... So please...

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.480
No.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.660
I will kill them here, perfectly,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.410
to keep you from having any 
more foolish notions ever again.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.090
My divinations told me,
"Vanessa will summon what you want

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.420
and return to the forest alive someday."

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.310
That is why I didn't 
search very hard for you.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:33.050
Granted, I didn't think that what I wanted 
would be a human with anti-magic swords.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.260
But what did you gain by going outside?

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.160
You formed trivial bonds with 
imperfect fools, and as a result,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.640
you only brought about their deaths.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.660
You cannot escape me.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.780
You cannot sever this bond.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.280
Bond?

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.280
After all, you are my daughter. My family.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.790
I'm... part of your family?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.290
You belong to me.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.040
No way!

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.550
No, really!

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.400
Oh, yeah! That town had 
really delicious cake.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.310
I want to go, too.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.970
Hey, please! Help me!

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.320
I want to leave!

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.570
Hey, please! Please, don't go!

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.210
Vanessa.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.040
Your Majesty...

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.050
Please let me out of here! 
I don't want to be in here anymore!

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.960
I'm so lonely all by myself! 
How long do I have to stay in here?

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.450
Your Majesty!

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.610
This thread magic doesn't have the sort 
of incredible power you say it does!

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.850
Please, let me out of here!

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.720
No. You will one day have the 
power to control destiny.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.430
It clearly says so in my divinations.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.460
But—

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.610
You asked how long you must stay in there,
and I shall give you an answer.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.440
I won't let you out of there

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.350
until you invoke the magic that 
allows you to control destiny.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.630
You are my family.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.250
If I'm your family, let me out of here!

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.840
I cannot do that.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.260
I will be the one to choose your destiny.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.760
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.640
Please, wait! Please let me out of here!

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.170
I don't have... powers like that.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.590
Oh, yeah. That cake shop 
ended up closing down.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:00.910
That's a shame.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.540
Hey, did you know?

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.110
There's a big town outside this forest,

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.540
and there are a lot of people 
who aren't witches living there.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.550
Vanessa... We've heard that 
story hundreds of times.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.410
All the other witches go 
there to have fun, right?

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.330
Some even have boyfriends.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.060
Why don't you escape from this 
cage and go out there, too?

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.610
What? B-But I can't...

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.810
I mean...

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.270
I can't defy the Queen of Witches.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.350
C-Come on, cheer up.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.980
Do you want me to ask the 
Queen of Witches for you?

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.180
That's impossible. You're a doll 
that I created with my own magic.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.710
If I can't do it, neither can you.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.090
You have a point.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.660
This whole conversation is just you 
talking to yourself to begin with.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.470
Hopefully you'll be able to 
make some real friends someday.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.440
That's impossible... There's no way.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.530
I'm going to be stuck like this 
forever... I'll never be free.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.090
It seems a bit noisy outside...

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.650
There's a man!

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.120
Intruder!

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.300
Intruder?

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.640
Jeez... Come on now. I'm just 
doing some warrior training.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.850
A man?

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.840
Why am I being chased around this 
forest just for being a guy?

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.840
I've never seen one before. A man...

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.350
And that hysterical old hag
 is a tough cookie, damn it.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.850
He fought the Queen?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.740
What the hell is this place, anyway?

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.850
Huh? Who're you? What are you 
doing in a place like this?

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.340
U-Um, w-well, you see...

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.650
The Queen has me locked up in here.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.770
You're locked up in here?

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.850
So you're literally like a bird in a cage.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.870
I've never been outside.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.120
Seriously? Well, that sucks.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.870
But, hey. You're in luck.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.620
There's a huge hole in it now, 
so you can get out that way.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.130
I-I can't! I'll never be 
able to escape the Queen.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.490
I'm fated to stay here.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.680
Huh? "I'm fated to stay here"?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.140
Oh, right. Good ol' Mr. Fate.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.760
I hate that bastard.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.940
Like hell I'm gonna listen to 'im.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.400
I'll do what I want, even if 
I have to crush fate myself.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.210
I'm pretty sure I can't beat that 
hysterical old hag right now, though.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.890
So I'm getting the hell outta here.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.110
See ya, little birdie.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.330
W-Wait! What should I do?

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.340
Hell if I know. Choose for yourself.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.470
I'm a bird trapped in a cage...

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.850
Which means that I should have wings.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.100
I can fly through that big, blue sky.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.360
I will choose...

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.360
for myself!

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.010
What I obtained in the outside world was...

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.070
No, it's not you.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.400
What?

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.600
You're not my family!

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.330
The Black Bulls are!

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:04.920
And right now, that family is about to 
be taken from me, right before my eyes!

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.090
If I can't stop this, why do I even exist?!

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:15.100
Please! If I truly have this power...

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.790
My magic, I implore you...

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.650
Change destiny!

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.360
What is this?

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.630
The red thread... of fate.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.160
Is that what this is?

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.250
I didn't visualize it taking this shape.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.170
Why?

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.850
Did she finally discover 
the power to control fate?

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.910
Well, then... Let us find out.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.920
No!

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.130
It only touched him?

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.430
Nothing is happening?

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.690
Rue your sin in having underestimated 
the Queen of Witches.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.070
No!

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.280
So it was still incomplete.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.720
But have no fear.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.000
I am perfection, and I shall ensure that it
is fostered properly under my supervision.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.660
No!

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.620
What?

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.090
What in the world? I could've sworn 
that he cut down the royal girl.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.810
Rue your sin in having underestimated 
the Queen of Witches.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.600
Didn't I just speak those 
words a few moments ago?

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.970
What?

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.880
Was there some kind of mistake?

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.310
Stop!

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.120
It's over.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.520
Stop!

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.100
This... It cannot be...

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.230
Then how about him?

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.530
Then how about the cat itself?

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.390
Puppet's Blood has come undone?

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.900
Are you telling me my manipulation failed?

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.290
This... This truly is the 
power to control destiny.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.860
In all likelihood, this magic changes

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:04.910
the destinies of the people the cat 
touches to the caster's advantage.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.110
Vanessa herself probably didn't see the 
fates where her companions were killed.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.920
She's only seeing the attacks 
continue to miss against all odds.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.170
This cat is both harmless and unavoidable.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.180
So you've awakened. Well done, Vanessa.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.940
I've been waiting for this moment.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.550
I've waited so, so long.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.490
Blood Magic: Puppet's Blood!

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.070
Vanessa!

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.790
Now both you and your magic belong to me.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.740
That power best suits 
me because I am perfect.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.500
Now, fate, align yourself with me!

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.010
What was...

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.250
What just happened?

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.030
Darling!

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.040
Domina! Mariella!

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.690
You're safe...

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.550
Impossible...

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.570
Impossible. Impossible!

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.640
There's nothing that my 
perfect magic cannot control!

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.600
So why?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.570
So this is the power to control destiny 
that you were talking about.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.820
I don't know much about this power yet,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.530
but there is one thing I do know.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:14.340
This magic only takes the side of myself 
and those I have a family bond with.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.760
You and I have no bond.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.430
Petit Clover

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.600
Petit Clover!

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.890
Vanessa Saw...!

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.700
Vanessa Saw...!

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.860
Oh, my lovely princess, please marry me.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.810
Oh, my prince! I'm so happy!

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.440
Do you really choose me?

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.910
Yes, it has to be you. You're almost 
as beautiful as the Queen of Witches!

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.170
Oh, I could never compare to her!

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:21.400
The Queen of Witches is <i>so</i> beautiful, 
kind, and beloved by all!

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.820
No, you truly are.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.700
You're so elegant, kind, and proud, 
just like the great Queen of Witches.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.570
Oh, I'm so happy, my prince!

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.920
Oh, my princess.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.820
Man, it's so quiet around here 
without those knuckleheads around.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.640
That means I can take a dump in peace.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.050
But it's a little too quiet. 
They'd better get back soon.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.950
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 65: "I'm Home."

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 65
 I'm Home

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.820
Yeah, welcome back.
