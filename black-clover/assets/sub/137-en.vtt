00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.060
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.530
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.970
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.630
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.920
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.790
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.700
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.840
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.550
The Black Bulls visited 
Raquey to do some training.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.090
Asta and Noelle reunited with 
Kahono and Kiato there,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.220
but under the sea, trouble was brewing.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.230
An underwater creature they called 
the guardian was wreaking havoc,

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.270
causing trouble even for the Underwater Temple.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.360
In order to quell the guardian, Noelle and
 a few others headed into the water.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.650
Just watch, Mother.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.180
I'm going to become even stronger.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.990
But it wasn't only Noelle who 
vowed to become stronger.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.340
So this is...

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.550
The food that's going to explosively 
enhance our mana just by eating it.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.820
You can do that just by eating food?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.640
I guess I'll dig in.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.960
You don't have any magic, so it's not like 
anything's going to change for you.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.810
Who knows?! I might get more anti-magic!

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.320
Let's eat!

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.860
Holy crap! I can feel it instantly!

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.670
It feels like my mana's 
overflowing from within me.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.120
The hell is this?!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.750
My body's just...

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.600
This is so much fun!

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.010
You guys!

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.030
What's going—huh?!

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.390
She's in trouble, too?!

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.650
M-Miz Charmy! You need to 
do something about this!

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.030
No... This food isn't good enough.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.230
No, wait! Stop!

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.230
I know! I'll have to go see him!

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.930
Charmy's Century of Hunger,
 Gordon's Millennium of Loneliness

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.250
Magic Knights Headquarters

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.000
Jamo

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.000
You want to be my student?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.140
Her fiery, glistening eyes...

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.630
Her fiery, glistening drool...

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.570
And...

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.560
Her fiery, glistening forehead!

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.110
As always...

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.560
She's really something else!

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.160
All right, you got it! You're my 
student starting today, shrimp!

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.070
Thanks!

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.070
Food that'll enhance mana, eh?

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.140
I can make food that will 
recover mana with my magic.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.580
But what I need right now is food that 
will explosively enhance my friends' mana!

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.800
I see. That's not gonna be a simple task.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.840
Are you ready for this, shrimp?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.090
Sure am!

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.590
La!

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.350
La!

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.100
La!

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.690
La!

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:25.360
986, 987, 988, 989, 990...

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.720
The sheep cooks are your magic.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.360
But just leveling up your 
magic won't be enough.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.360
991, 992...

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.660
993, 994, 995...

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.510
You need to seal away your magic and 
train yourself past your physical limits,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.070
so that not only the Sheep Cooks
 but also you, shrimp,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.170
996, 997, 998...

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.750
can acquire the food that will enhance mana.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.420
999... 1,000!

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.510
We've got your stamina up now.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.580
According to this book, the next 
thing you need to do is acquire three

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.140
unknown ingredients that 
even I've never seen before.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.110
Three unknown ingredients?

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.490
The first is the bulb of a
 mentanpin mandoradora!

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.990
Got it!

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.410
The second is the noonesheardofthis coelacanth!

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.210
The third is the butt hide 
of a surprisesquatch!

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.180
La!

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.380
Say what?!

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.630
The shrimp did what?!

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.310
La... La... La...

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.510
You didn't have to push yourself that hard!

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.480
Just as you said, Master.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.940
Now... I...

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.950
Tonight I, Charmy Pappitson, will serve

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.740
the best mana enhancement dishes ever.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.260
So these are true mana enhancement dishes?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.230
Uh, why did I get called in all of a sudden?

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.760
You're insurance if things go south, duh.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.890
Wait, when what goes south?!

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.230
Miz Charmy... You pushed yourself so hard.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.850
Eat up!

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.500
I-I'm gonna pass.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.860
I think I will, too.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.740
We should get going.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.610
Please eat it!

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.080
Please show Miz Charmy 
her efforts weren't in vain!

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.220
I beg of you!

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.160
These dishes were created by the shri...

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.620
by Charmy for her friends, and she 
risked her life for these ingredients!

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.550
Who the heck are you?

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.260
Master... Asta...

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.980
Oh, fine.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.140
C-Could it be...

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.570
Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going on?!

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.200
This isn't good. Everyone!

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.840
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.430
Ow...

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.220
The hell are you guys doing?

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.040
Captain Yami?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.160
You thinking about using 
my wheels to go somewhere?

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.280
Now's not the time for that, Yami!

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.670
The hell is that?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.170
That's... demon food!

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.550
Demon food?!

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.490
You just now thought that up, didn't you?

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.050
Quit making random shit up, you jerk!

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.560
Who the hell is that?

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.470
This is the first time I'm 
seeing it with my own eyes,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.870
but the combination of pure devotion and mana

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.840
sometimes gives life to food.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.950
Uh, that doesn't happen!

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.100
Then how would you explain 
what we're seeing right now?!

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.080
All the feelings that Charmy put toward 
enhancing mana were the real deal!

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.520
And that's exactly how the food ended 
up with an explosive amount of mana!

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.440
The food has life now?

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.210
Huh?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.270
Miz Charmy, what's wrong?!

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.110
The hell?!

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.070
Magna?

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.050
I dunno why, but I don't have any strength.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.070
Luck?!

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.000
It's stealing away our mana!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.980
What's going on?

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.550
The demon food is absorbing all of our mana

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.280
so it can become even more powerful!

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.740
No, really. Who are you?

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.360
The noms I made...

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.410
Hey, kid. What the hell are you zoning out for?

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.170
Don't you think your sword 
can do something about that

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.910
stupidly big food monster?

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.560
Well...

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.480
Tch. Okay, fine.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.430
I'll go out on a limb and—

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.430
You can't!

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.180
What do you mean?

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.690
That food is filled with 
Miz Charmy's feelings...

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.190
Yes! It's food!

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.100
The hell are you talking about?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.540
Asta...

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.570
Please put a stop to it!

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.990
Okay!

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.620
Wait, are you seriously...

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.760
I'll gobble up all of Miz Charmy's food!

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.620
Don't blame me if you get a stomachache.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.600
Our mana's gradually coming back.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.570
Mana's flowing out of the 
part the kid's eating?

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.880
I'm not gonna let Asta have all the noms!

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.870
We can't just leave this to those two!

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.160
I guess not.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.170
Well, now that that's settled, 
this shouldn't take too long.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.700
Eat every last bit of that 
stupidly big food monster.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.320
Wait! Me, too?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.670
Absolutely not!

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.630
Again...

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.970
Who are you?

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.610
Good job, you guys.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.450
This looks like a scene right out of hell.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.440
Miz Charmy...

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.370
La?

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.690
I feel like that food was 
different from your usual food.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.500
Huh?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.360
I can't really put it into words,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.610
but it seems like it was 
solely made to enhance mana.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.120
Your food is usually filled with your desire 
to make the people eating it happy,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.960
but that seemed to be missing...

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.010
Wait! I'm sorry for being out of line!

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.660
Master!

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.520
We might've forgotten the most 
important thing as chefs.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.780
Charmy... no, shrimp! Back to square one!

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.190
Yes, Master!

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.330
One more time!

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.130
One more time!

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.700
My days now are spent 
surrounded by many friends.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.520
I might be happier now than I've ever been.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.570
We have to win in this fight against the devil.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.470
If we don't, our happy days will come to an end.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.040
I think that last one was pretty good.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.080
Asta...

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.710
Do you think I could join in on your training?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.350
Of course!

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.530
Noelle, go ahead and take a break!

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.960
Uh, sure.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.550
Come at me with everything you've got!

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.800
O-Okay...

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.460
With everything I've got...

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.950
That wasn't my intention, 
but I'm sure Asta will be okay.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.980
Okay, here I go.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.030
Poison Curse Magic: 
Dwelling of the Poison Cloud.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.200
Gordon! Are you okay?!

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.320
As expected.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.110
I'm no match for you.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.720
I was fighting with everything I had.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.710
Maybe I've gotten weaker.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.620
When I first came to the 
Black Bulls, I was truly alone.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:17.930
But I was sharp as a knife and had the 
strength to not let anyone near me.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.940
And yet, now I'm...

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.240
Please don't try to find me.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.020
I can't just stay complacent, 
surrounded by my friends.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.510
In order to defeat the devil, and to 
regain my strength from before...

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.740
I must be alone once more.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.300
The Forest of Poisonous Magical Beasts

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:58.680
In the past, Lady Mereoleona walked 
through a strong magic region alone

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.420
and became as powerful as she is now.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.170
That's why I'm going to go through the 
Forest of Poisonous Magical Beasts

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.820
that lies right before the Witches' Forest.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.320
Noble Realm

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.360
Common Realm

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.230
I'd go to the strong magic region...
but that's a bit scary,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.360
Forsaken Realm

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.360
Strong Magic Region

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.620
so I'll do my best in this forest.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.620
Common Realm

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.620
Forsaken Realm

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.960
Things seem to be going well.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.620
Probably because I'm all alone again.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.990
Okay, I'll take a break now.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.550
I <i>am</i> pretty hungry.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.510
Huh?

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.480
My week's worth of food!

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.600
Wait!

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.520
3 Days Later

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.070
I can't find my backpack. 
Maybe I'll head back...

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.080
I think I've gotten a good 
taste of being alone again.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.580
Huh?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.180
I don't know how to get home.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.380
Eating all alone never tastes good.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.480
Eating with everyone was pretty rowdy, but fun.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.080
If my friends were here at a time like this...

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.740
Gordon! I'll go get you some yummy food, stat!

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.450
Get a grip, Gordon. As your partner 
in the G-G duo, I'll be by your side.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.180
Gordon, are you tired? Eek!

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.330
I know you've got more to you than that!

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.040
I'm done trying to kill Magna, 
so you're next, Gordon!

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.820
What the hell am I doing?

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.270
Now's my chance to test out the strength

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.910
I've regained by being alone.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.990
Poison Curse Magic: 
Dwelling of the Poison Cloud.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.160
One more time!

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.910
But why?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.970
My poison curse magic didn't work.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.820
I really must be weaker.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.230
Thank goodness... This is the 
first water I've had in three days.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.180
I'll live here on my own for a while.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.480
I'll find food on my own and sleep alone.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.980
And wash my face alone, like this...

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.790
Back at the Black Bulls' hideout, Asta and 
I would always wash each other's backs.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.990
There were nights I'd drink with 
Vanessa as we talked about our dreams.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.080
There were times I helped Gauche 
take care of his Marie doll.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.580
There were even times Luck and I 
risked our lives fighting each other.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.930
I must get stronger.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.480
But to think that being alone is so painful...

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.930
Even though this was normal for 
me before joining the Black Bulls...

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.150
I wonder what everyone's up to right now.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.190
This is...

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.480
We've got to hurry!

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.870
All right, let's get moving!

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.200
Right!

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.080
They're going to come find me, right?

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.460
You guys are here already?

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.460
The... mother of that
 magical beast from earlier?

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.470
This is...

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.670
We've got to hurry!

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.500
All right, let's get moving!

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.350
Right!

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.950
Poison Curse Magic: Aufwachen Dachs!

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.750
It's no use... My magic is having no effect at all.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.710
I'm finished... I'm going to die here all alone.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.430
I see...

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.560
So they didn't abandon me.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.230
I finally see that it wasn't 
loneliness that I needed.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.400
I became stronger because I had friends!

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.370
This loneliness is poison itself.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.830
And the antidote for this poison...

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.330
is my friendship with my teammates!

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.360
I'm sorry...

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.020
I panicked, and I ended up hurting you.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:37.010
That's unforgivable for a Magic Knight who's 
tasked with protecting this kingdom...

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.680
You're my fellow comrades
living in the Clover Kingdom.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.830
No... You're my friends.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.130
Thanks for leading the way.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.630
I see. You both have immunity to poison magic.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.620
So that's why my magic didn't work.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.520
I'm home.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.270
Ah...

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.530
Everyone must've gone looking for me.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.490
They might all be in danger somewhere.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.680
Now it's my turn to go find them.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.750
I'll never leave my friends again.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.170
This is great!

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.010
Listen up! Surpass your limits! 
Eat and drink all you can!

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.300
I've definitely surpassed them!

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.800
Mister Yami, the workers 
here sure are staring at us.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.420
Hell if I care!

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.880
They're doing an inventory count and 
selling off all their ingredients,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.930
and this says...

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.940
we get 90% off our bill for 
an unlimited time period!

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.290
I'm not going to lose!

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.360
No matter how much food there is,

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.870
I'm going to eat all of it!

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.680
In the name of my tummy!

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.170
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 138: "In Zara's Footsteps."

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:54.270
Page 138
In Zara's Footsteps

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.000
Who's Zara, la?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.010
Huh? Zora's dad?
