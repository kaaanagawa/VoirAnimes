00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.730
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.790
The Royal Knights arrived at the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.820
They headed for its center,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.950
where they believed the leader 
Licht was, with no opposition.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.850
But...

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.350
We seriously have nothing to do!

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.690
Who gave you permission to 
make another one of you?

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.740
Uh, it's not like I wanted another me!

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.420
You're the fake!

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.320
No, that's you!

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.160
Knock it off.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.450
She just set them both on fire.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.540
What are you doing?! 
Are you trying to kill me?!

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.620
I don't remember bringing along someone

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.190
weak enough to be killed by that.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.100
The true identity of the fake Asta 
was the last member of the Third Eye,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.900
Raia the Disloyal.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.640
The all-incinerating spell 
of total destruction...

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.770
Flame Magic:

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.850
Calidos Brachium!

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.900
Thus began an intense fight between 
flame magic and copy magic.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.740
Eventually, Mereoleona's magic and 
attack power began to overtake Raia.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.870
Meanwhile, Yuno and his team 
continued to the center.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.050
Sorry, but people at your 
level can't stop me anymore.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.180
That sound...

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.760
We heard it earlier, too.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.520
A heartbeat?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.850
The feel of this mana... I've felt it before.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.980
Also during that time...

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.650
Back at the Black Bulls' hideout,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.800
which had been attacked by 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.980
W-We somehow managed to chase them off,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.050
but something awful still happened!

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.640
I hope they never come back.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.540
U-Um... Could you turn the 
hideout back to normal now?

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.420
I can't... I have no magic.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.030
So he says, Gauche.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.340
Where is it? Where is it, damn it?!

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.340
Where's all my Marie merchandise?!

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.970
Probably smashed to bits...
Squishy, squish...

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.380
Stop saying such awful things so slowly!

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.890
Get down here and help me, damn it!

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.690
But I...

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.820
Just shut up and get down here, 
you slow-ass, long-haired jerk!

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.260
U-Um, Gauche...

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.250
I wouldn't do that.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.360
Come down here!

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.530
But I...

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.520
Don't "But I..." me! 
Get down here or I'll kill you!

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.070
Okay, then...

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.660
Tch. Took you long eno—

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.970
H-Henry absorbs your magic 
if he gets too close!

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.710
We tried to stop you.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.940
I found it!

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.310
Thank goodness! It's safe!

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.900
Nothing inside got smashed,
and nothing's dirt—

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.780
M-Marie's... cheek...

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.450
I'll kill you! I'm going to murder 
all of you, Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.150
But they're gone now...

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.660
Shut up! I'll kill you, too, while I'm at it!

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.740
Sorry about that...

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.380
Give me back my magic, damn it!

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.420
I can't...

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.400
I said give it back!

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.680
I can't...

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.310
Anyway... Why did the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun attack?

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.480
They said they "obtained" something.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.540
They were probably just bluffing.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.380
Nothing here is more important 
than my Marie merchandise.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.030
Were they after my dolls?

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.410
I don't think so...

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.770
Well, if there's anything 
else that's important...

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.660
What is it?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.040
Is it me?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.090
Tch. It's nothing!

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.660
More importantly, why isn't Captain 
Yami back yet at a time like this?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.130
Indeed...

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.230
He told us not to let the hideout be taken over

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.140
Golden Dawn Headquarters

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.140
by bandits while he was gone, too...

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.340
What is he, a prophet?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.090
The Wizard King vs.
 The Leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.650
Hey, isn't he from the Black Bulls?

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.050
Why is he here?

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.180
Apparently, he's waiting 
for Captain Vangeance.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.700
He's been here for quite a while now.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.560
Should we say something to him?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.260
But he seems sorta angry.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.370
You go talk to him!

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.220
No, you!

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.290
What the hell are you looking at, huh?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.510
Sir Yami...

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.850
W-Would you like more tea?

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.020
Sure... But just how much tea 
are you gonna make me drink?!

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.270
There's so much tea sloshing 
around in my stomach,

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.860
I've been running to the bathroom constantly!

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.900
You wanna literally detox the shit out of me?!

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.260
I don't feel refreshed at all, damn it!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.890
I-I'm terribly sorry!

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.650
Hey, how long is that golden 
weird mask guy captain of yours

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.900
going to make me wait after he 
said he wanted to apologize?

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.910
H-He should be here any second.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.980
P-Please, have some more tea.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.940
Sure.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.730
Didn't I just say there's enough tea 
sloshing around in my stomach?!

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.590
I-I'm terribly sorry!

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.040
Damn it... My ride's in the shop right now,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.820
so it was a pain in the 
ass to get here, too.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:43.810
You know, your vice captain was 
the one who put my ride in the shop

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.420
after the Royal Knights Selection Exam.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.320
Finral's still in the hospital 
and hasn't woken up.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.350
I also hear that the questioning of your 
vice captain isn't getting far, either.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:03.580
Shouldn't your golden weird mask 
captain come to me to apologize?

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.840
Are you Golden Dawn jerks messing with me?

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.590
Such pressure...

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.590
W-We sincerely apologize for 
what Vice Captain Langris did.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.760
But I ask that you have faith 
in Captain Vangeance.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.740
He is a wonderful person.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.940
He would never knowingly insult you.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.480
Who the hell are you?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.940
I'm no one suspicious.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.450
Everything about you is suspicious!

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.490
Yami, was it?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.580
I'm counting on you to watch my back.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.000
This guy moves like he can read my mind.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.250
Our ki goes together.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.960
How many years has it been since then?

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.470
We both became captains.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.970
I'm someone who believes his gut instincts.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.760
Vangeance...

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.600
Could you take off that mask?

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:11.690
You suspect that I may be the leader of 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun, don't you?

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.400
I feel something similar in you...

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.240
So just let me see your face, all right?

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.120
I was born with it.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.170
They called me a cursed child.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.190
I'm glad I was able to tell you and 
show you things as they really are.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.300
Thank you, Yami.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.380
It didn't feel like he was lying.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.240
Sir Yami, please just wait a little longer.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.260
He would never...

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.060
Tch.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.930
I know that, you dumbasses.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.900
Lord Julius, are you here? Lord Julius?

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.190
Honestly, the moment I 
take my eyes off of him...

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.990
He needs to realize that 
he's the Wizard King.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.450
Work just keeps piling up.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.540
I can't even get through to 
him with communication magic.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.010
Right about now...

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.970
The Royal Knights are having

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.350
the last battle with the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun at their hideout.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:32.230
I wish I could join in, but I've watched
 over them this whole time, so I know...

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.070
Their strength and

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.860
their desire to protect the citizens 
of this kingdom are real.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.530
It'll be all right... 
I know they can do this.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.420
Not to mention, Marx will get mad at me.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:50.000
I must do what I'm meant to do.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.110
It's not often you to ask to 
discuss something with me.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.510
What's on your mind, William?

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.890
Thank you for making time 
for me, Lord Julius.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.260
You never cared about how I looked,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.270
and were the first person to ever 
acknowledge my strength.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.250
The path to my future 
opened once I met you.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:26.100
I grew up as a cursed child in a 
small village in the Forsaken Realm,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.650
and though I was welcomed into 
a noble family as its heir,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.490
I was treated terribly.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.710
But...

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.720
Little boy, what kind of magic is that?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.670
You were different.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.980
You truly acknowledged my power and 
invited me into the Magic Knights.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.890
It really is nothing to worry about, 
but if you <i>are</i> so worried about it...

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.710
In that case...

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:58.070
When you gave me this mask... 
When you invited into the Magic Knights...

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:03.420
I decided that I would dedicate 
my grimoire to your service.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.250
It's been eleven years since then,

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.570
and my feelings have not 
changed in the least.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.960
I have always respected you, Lord Julius.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.510
Jeez, what brought all this on?
 You're making me blush.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.970
That is why I climbed up the ranks to 
become a Magic Knights Squad captain,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.300
chose highly capable squad members 
that my mana pointed out to me,

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.490
and created the Golden Dawn.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.720
I believed that making the ultimate

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.900
Magic Knights Squad would be 
the best way to repay you.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.030
And that was also...

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.740
for the sake of the other person
who is deeply important to me.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.940
My friend who has always been with me, 
even before I met you, Lord Julius.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.670
From here on out, you two will wish 
to walk completely different paths.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.260
Both of you are very dear to me.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.830
I cannot choose between you.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.030
And so...

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.810
You two will have to choose for me.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.260
His scar...

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:27.320
Thank you, William... 
My one and only human friend.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.080
Good day to you, 
Wizard King Julius Novachrono.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.080
I am the leader of the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.590
I had really hoped that wasn't the case.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:56.000
William... I always knew that 
you were hiding something.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.790
That there was a side of you that 
you didn't want to be known.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.480
I'm sure Yami realized this, too.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.770
It could be that Fuegoleon was also

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.700
caught off-guard when he 
saw who you really were.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:16.040
The day that the royal capital was 
attacked by the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.880
The uneasy feeling I felt when 
I faced their leader, Licht...

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.780
That somewhat familiar mana...

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.040
And right around the time I injured his arm,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.620
I started seeing you only rarely.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.740
I couldn't help but harbor my doubts,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.630
though I couldn't bring myself 
to believe that it was true.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.450
But...

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.560
Who would've thought that there 
were two souls in one body?

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.820
So it was you, but at the 
same time, it wasn't you.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.320
How did you get rid of that scar?
It doesn't seem to be the work of magic.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:57.350
That scar is a curse cast upon 
the clan of this body's mother.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.930
No curse cast upon humans 
has anything to do with me.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.510
I despise humans.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.650
But William... He was the 
only one that was different.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.070
We were able to share the 
same body, after all.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.570
Despite being human, he accepted 
my feeling and understood them.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.110
This uncontrollable rage, 
sadness, and hatred.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.480
We're just like this bird.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.770
Because it can fly,
like we can use special magic,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.310
they envy and want to hurt us.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:42.130
But I believe that one day, we and the humans
will be able to understand each other.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.690
But I was wrong.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.220
I was surprised that your brother 
felt the same way I do.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.670
I also feel the same way.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.970
I hope that elves and humans can 
live together peacefully someday.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.310
Because if that doesn't happen...

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.210
Tetia...

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.470
I'm sure we'll all understand 
each other someday.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.470
Yes!

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.300
If I had never met those humans,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.860
we would've never...

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.910
There is only one way to be rid of

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.240
these overflowing emotions.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.500
We shall collect all of the magic 
stones and fulfill our hearts' desire!

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.310
So their motive is to get 
revenge against the humans.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.280
And having all of the magic stones 
will make that possible?

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.860
William understood, too.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.010
That's why he let me see you.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.710
You have the remaining two, don't you?

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.940
Yes, because that's the safest option.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.190
I shall obtain those magic stones, 
and we shall fulfill our hearts' desire.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.550
William... You are a kind person.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.090
The fact that there was 
another in your body

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.200
and you treasured him 
so well this whole time

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.010
is also part of your kindness.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:12.410
And it is my job, as someone who's 
also important to you, to stop him.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.530
You support me, which means I'll win.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.140
No... His heart is with me.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.580
Wizard King, I'm afraid 
you're going to die.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.900
As the Wizard King, the most 
powerful mage in this land,

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.400
you will take responsibility for all the sins

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.950
the humans in the Clover Kingdom
 have committed.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.930
Light Creation Magic: 
Light Swords of Conviction.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.770
Mana Zone: Chrono Stasis Grigora.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.260
Light magic is the fastest 
among all magical attributes.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
But that doesn't mean it's unstoppable.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:04.770
I see.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.770
But I wonder how long that can last.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.740
This man's magic is a type 
that controls the flow of time.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.340
He can slow time down to 
almost a complete halt,

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.290
bind it, speed it up tremendously, 
or even destroy it...

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.910
A single attack can be lethal.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.770
But I sense a sort of destiny

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.920
in that, ironic though it is, 
I was born with light magic.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.670
The only thing that can oppose time...

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.680
is light.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.180
Light Creation Magic: 
Light Whip of Judgment!

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.980
He uses a combination of Mana Zone
 and time acceleration.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.090
By accelerating time for 
the mana around him,

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.110
he can read the flow of 
the mana in the future,

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.280
which lets him sense the very near future

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.650
and anticipate attacks.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.670
But don't think...

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.650
that you can actually outdo me.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.300
Too slow.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.840
Even if you can see what's ahead,
there are limits to how quickly you can evade.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.840
Has it been a while since you 
were last wounded, Wizard King?

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.950
It has. I've taken the 
futures of many people,

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.350
but it's been a while since 
I've seen my own blood.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.810
Your time-controlling magic 
isn't so invincible anymore.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:17.100
The true nature of my magic is 
to steal time from my target.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.650
That time gets stockpiled, 
and I can use it at any time,

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.240
though it takes a lot out of me.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.240
He reversed time and healed his wound?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.070
As someone who was born with 
magic that steals futures,

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.670
my goal as the Wizard King is to create 
a future without discrimination.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.630
Until that future happens, I cannot die.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.860
A future without discrimination, 
but with humans? That's an impossible dream!

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.140
At that speed, it's taking everything 
you have to evade this attack.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.770
You cannot fight back, 
or even get close to me.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.040
I have you now!

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.500
Wha—

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.900
He's anticipating even faster!

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.150
I can already see your future.

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.790
You cannot defeat me.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.460
Petit Clover

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.230
Petit Clover!

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.970
Anticipation

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.580
Anticipation.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.220
I've already read all of your moves.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.220
So you can anticipate what'll 
happen in the near future...

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.520
In that case, guess what 
I'm about to do next.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.520
Very well. Mana Zone: 
Chrono Stasis Grigora.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.230
You're about to break into a nimble dance.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.030
And then...

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:08.830
There!

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.410
A dove will fly out of your hat...

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.210
Hup!

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.820
You'll spin a ball on an umbrella,

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.160
quickly remove a tablecloth without 
spilling what's in the glasses...

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.190
And then you'll mimic the sounds 
that various animals make.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.380
Well? You can't do that, now, can you?

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.230
Who knew that you were so talented?

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.510
I had really hoped that wasn't the case.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.480
You cannot defeat me.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.230
I am the Wizard King.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.290
It is my duty to protect this 
kingdom and all of its people.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.150
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>,

 Julius Novachrono

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.950
You shall be defeated by my time magic.
