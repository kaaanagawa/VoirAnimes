00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.770
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.930
So you two finally showed up,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.980
but why the hell are you all 
shiny and attacking our comrades?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.900
Marx! Old Man Owen!

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.450
Yami was attacked by Marx and Owen, 
who had been reincarnated as elves.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.130
Memory Magic: Torment Canceller!

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.630
Dark Cloaked Lightless Blunt Slash!

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.220
He managed to incapacitate 
them both, but...

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.220
Red roses?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.620
Charlotte Roselei, who had also 
been reincarnated as an elf,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.890
appeared before Yami.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.220
I don't know who you are, but you 
seem quite skilled for a human.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.790
Overwhelming Disadvantage

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.620
Okay...

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.130
That should take care of that.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.670
The Black Bulls' captain seemed 
pretty protective of it.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.350
I wonder what's inside.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.180
Dark Magic...

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.180
Briar Magic...

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.890
Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.350
Crimson Vine Spear!

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.660
Sis!

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.180
Our attacks just now...

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.350
My magical power definitely 
overpowered his.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.290
And yet his spell managed 
to cut through mine,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.260
softening the blow, 
which protected the town.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.770
Though it only damaged my arm 
guard, he managed to reach me.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.560
Regardless of whose magic was stronger, 
he turned the tide of the battle.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.280
So there are humans who have managed 
to master skills such as that one?

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.530
If that were not the case, those two 
wouldn't have been defeated, either.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.460
It appears as though we've 
underestimated the humans.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.040
I used more magic than I intended. 
I should retreat for now.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.880
I'll wait for Licht and the others to arrive

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.790
and take every precaution 
necessary before proceeding.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.420
Sis!

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.430
What happened to the Black Bulls' captain?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.870
D-Don't tell me that Sis defeated
 the Black Bulls' captain...

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.280
Come back here, you jackass! 
You didn't finish me off yet, you bitch!

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.070
Watch what you're doing! 
I thought I was gonna die!

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.660
Where the hell'd she go?!

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.410
He's alive. I mean, I'm glad he's alive, but...

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.260
I'm gonna slap you back to your senses,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.830
Spiny Prickly Queen, 
a.k.a. Prickly Queen for short!

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.500
Hey, rowdy girl!

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.170
Rowdy girl?

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.180
What are you doing back here? 
Where's the thing I gave you?

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.780
I hid it somewhere safe.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.850
You'd better have! 
I'm trusting you, you jerk!

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.350
A-And you'd better take care of my sis!

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.560
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.940
Right now, I can't save Sis.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.360
I'm trusting you!

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.610
Yeah, you do that.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.540
So what are you going to do?

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.450
I'm trying to figure that out right now.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.280
Actually...

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.200
Rowdy girl! You go save the citizens!

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.830
I'm sure there are other Magic Knights around,
 so save all the people you can!

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.950
Yes, sir!

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.940
And as for me...

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.860
What has happened?

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.690
What is this overwhelming magical 
power I feel coming from outside?

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.240
And the commotion was great enough to 
break open this magically sealed prison.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:42.250
Former Captain of the Purple Orcas
Gueldre Poizot

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.260
Whatever this may be, 
it's the chance of a lifetime!

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.250
I'm going to use this chance to escape.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.260
Well, well, look who it is.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.010
If it isn't the former captain of 
the Purple Orcas, the great Gueldre.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.520
Well, well... I never thought 
I'd see your face again,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.380
Revchi of Chain Magic.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.770
Revchi Salik

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.560
I do beg your pardon, but I'm in quite a hurry.
We'll have to catch up some other time.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.780
That may be convenient for you, 
but it's definitely not for me.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:18.660
Because two years ago, you did this 
number to my face during a mission,

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.370
blamed the mission going wrong on me,

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.790
then kicked me out of the Purple Orcas!

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.610
You brought that upon yourself.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.290
Everyone in the squad hated you.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.810
Not a single person took your side.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.350
I believe that goes for you, too.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.080
Isn't that why the great former 
captain of the Purple Orcas

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.570
was trapped down here?

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.740
This has nothing to do with a pathetic loser who avoided dangerous missions

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.260
out of fear for his life,
who never aimed for the top,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.580
and who kept getting outdone by his juniors.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.580
Pretty pathetic for Mister Transparency Magic,
 who's immune to all attacks.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.090
Your chain magic was able to 
seal any mage's magical power,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.590
so my heart bleeds for you.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.400
That's right! I'm invincible!

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.590
If it hadn't been for that ridiculous 
brat and his anti-magic...

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.770
Hm?

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.350
You, too?

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.020
The same thing happened to you?

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.320
I don't even need my chains 
to touch him. I can tell.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.990
His magical power is off the charts!

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.740
Humans located.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.050
There are guys like him wreaking havoc outside?

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.270
So the commotion outside is 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun?

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.300
Looks like I might've 
aided some real monsters.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.640
All humans are to be killed on sight.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.110
Wait! I'm not your enemy!

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.100
Depending on the circumstances, 
I don't mind helping you out!

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.100
Let me speak with your leader.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.630
We will never be tricked 
by you humans ever again.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.860
It doesn't matter who you are. 
All humans shall be slain.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.830
It appears we have no choice 
here, Mister Revchi.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.080
This sucks, but you're right, Gueldre.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.140
Transparency Magic: Invincible Seeker 
plus Invisible Traveling Companion.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.170
They disappeared?

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.300
Impossible... Even their 
magic disappeared?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.800
In that case, I'll just have 
to destroy this whole area!

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.940
Chain Creation Magic: 
Magic-Binding Iron Chain Formation!

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.110
My magic has been sealed?

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.200
But my magical powers were 
far superior to theirs.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.050
What in the world is their magic?

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.940
You can pose no problem once we've caught you.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.960
Is this my ticket out of obscurity?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.790
Yes... My legend won't end here.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.010
Come, let us retake our greatness,
 Mister Revchi.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.470
Indeed, Gueldre.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.810
Luck? Ben?

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.150
Such menacing magic...

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.590
It's the same as Vetto and the others.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.360
Why is that magic coming from you two?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.540
Why is that magic coming from you two?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.270
Noelle's right. What's mixed in 
with their magic seems to be...

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.590
the same as the one from 
the House of Vaude.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.140
A tremendously menacing magic...

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.150
It appears we've made it back.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.860
Let me do this.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.240
You sure have a lot of energy, 
for one who just awakened.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.870
It's <i>because</i> I just awakened. I have more 
energy than I know what to do with.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.500
This is in the way.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.220
W-Wait, Luck. What are you talking about?

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.100
I'm sure they won't amount
to much as opponents,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.850
since they're human.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.360
Whoopsie. It's been so long, I missed.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.160
Let's try that again.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.660
Cherry Blossom Magic: 
Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.260
I'm not sure what happened,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.960
but it appears those two 
aren't who they used to be.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.340
Beautifully prepare for combat, Noelle!

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.800
B-But Luck is one of the Black Bulls...
 He's my friend...

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800
Noelle!

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.310
Aw, I can't see.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.490
I won't be able to aim like this.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.690
Then I'll have to...

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.690
get up close and personal.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.650
His magic is swelling...

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.280
He's coming! Defend!

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.530
Luck... Why? Why?!

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.790
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.400
Were they brainwashed? No, the very 
nature of their magic has changed!

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.010
Luck's magical power is on a completely 
different level than usual!

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.480
That feel of your magic a 
second ago... Are you royals?

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.360
What if I were to tell you that my 
beautiful self is indeed royalty?

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.610
That just gives me even 
more reason to kill you.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.110
Come on, you can't be serious.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.450
This guy was already a monster, 
and now he's even worse.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.460
Maybe it's because I'm a liar myself,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.710
but I've always been able to 
tell when someone is lying.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.880
Anti-magic shrimp...

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.970
What you said earlier...

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.010
A free kingdom

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.960
where everyone can acknowledge 
each other and smile...

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.220
That's the kind of kingdom I want to create

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.730
when I become the Wizard King.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.230
You were actually serious about that.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.740
I hate to admit it, 
but it moved my heart a bit.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.030
The same thing happened back then...

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.540
We can come to understand each other.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.950
He wasn't lying, either.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.710
That's why I believed him.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.850
But because I believed him, </i>that<i> happened.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.920
That's why I'll never trust them again.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.930
I'm going to kill you so I can 
get over any hesitation.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.210
Copy Light Magic: 
Light Swords of Conviction!

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.190
Copy Dark Magic: Lightless Slash!

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.900
He's casting spells with different 
attributes at the same time?!

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.510
Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium Barrage!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.090
Do you see now, you fool?

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.570
No matter how much you want to understand,

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.450
that's not an option for them!

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.260
They're trying to kill us based 
on feelings they can't negotiate.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.530
In that case, I'm going to win

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.600
and create a path to 
understanding each other!

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.350
That path has long been closed.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.850
Then I'll just open it up again!

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.340
Very well, you fool.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.380
You should probably hurry up, though.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.860
Otherwise, I'm going to defeat him.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.110
Yes, ma'am!

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.360
Calidos Brachium!

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.020
That spell of hers is a trap 
and hold move that I won't

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.500
be able to break free from if she hits me.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.630
Which means...

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.840
I'm not letting you hit me again!

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.590
A combination of spatial 
and light magic...

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.590
He's using light magic to speed up even faster.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:01.090
When you can use it with something else,
 Li'l Val's magic is awesome.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:05.020
Though I'm pretty sure he's dead by now.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.610
Copy Spatial Magic: Myriad Black!

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.150
Copy Light Magic: Sky-Rending Flash!

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.700
Seriously, how the hell are 
we supposed to deal with him?

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.920
Oh?

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.510
Rill...?

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.510
Oh, hey, it's Raia. Heya, how've you been?

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.130
Hey, Lira. I see you're as crazy as ever.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.230
And I see that your face 
is as droll as ever, Raia.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.610
Shut it.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.450
Raia, Raia, Raia!

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.830
Stop it! You're so annoying!

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.790
I'm so happy to see you!

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.330
Come on!

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.210
Hey! What are you doing, Rill?!

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.720
My magic has a stylish name now! 
It's called picture magic.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.950
Oh?

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.100
He's a blockhead who's determined to kill us!

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.480
What's his problem? He's so loud.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.360
We're in the middle of fighting him right 
now! When'd you get all buddy-buddy?!

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.110
Who are you?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.780
Huh? Wha... Rill?

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.620
Rill? My name is Lira.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.280
Huh?! What are you talking about?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.990
The Captain of the Aqua Deer...

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.790
That huge mana of his is even bigger, 
and now he feels like that copy bastard.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.010
The way that space-gouging guy,
the Golden Dawn's vice captain, felt...

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.880
Was that a sign that this was coming?

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.530
An enemy spell... Was it that light?

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.230
From the feel of their magic, 
this isn't a form of brainwashing.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.800
He apparently doesn't 
recognize the brat, either.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.810
Does that mean someone 
different is inside?

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.070
I'm a fellow Magic Knight 
and your friend, Asta!

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.980
I'm not gonna let you say that you 
forgot someone this loud, you jerk!

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.660
Jeez, you're so persistent and loud.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.330
I don't have any human friends.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:31.420
I'll just have to shut you up with my 
Picture Magic: Four-Headed Lindworm.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.290
He's basically being controlled 
by the enemy's magic.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.690
Go smack him with your anti-magic!

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.310
G-Got it!

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:57.990
Sorry, but your magic won't 
be able to reach us anymore!

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.380
Oh, I don't know about that.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.300
It's not like I was just watching two 
monsters duke it out this whole time.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.370
Ash Trap Spell: Total Activation!

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:12.070
Ah, so you secretly planted some trap magic.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.880
But paralysis on this level 
does next to nothing to us.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.710
Whoa, I can't see!

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:22.760
But our mana detection is on point,
 so we're perfectly fine!

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.060
Too bad, because what's heading your way

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.890
is a monster with no magic.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.320
He's circulating anti-magic 
throughout his body?

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.940
Wake up, Rill!

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.240
I only grazed him!

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.160
But I did hit him. That should break the spe—

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.170
Jeez, that hurt. What'd you do that for?

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.110
He's still not normal?

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.010
Tch. Guess anti-magic didn't work, either.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.630
This isn't a simple little spell.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.930
It's a reincarnation spell that brings the 
souls of elves to dwell in human bodies.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.930
A reincarnation spell?

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.310
The spell that summons the souls is complete.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.270
These bodies belong to us now.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.950
Reincarnation? Elves?

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.030
You can't be serious! Change Rill back to nor—

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.700
Them, too?

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.820
This is some kind of joke, right?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.970
All these bastards' magical 
power is off the charts now.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.380
How are we supposed to win against them?

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.100
Hey, we're retreating.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.740
Wh-What are you talking about?!

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.680
We can't just leave everyone!

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.340
Not yet! We can't leave yet!

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.750
You dumbass.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:50.850
There's no way to save them right now, 
so we're retreating to figure that out!

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.020
You stupid little shit.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.520
I guess you're right, 
you cool masked jerk!

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.280
Besides, we both know that you can't 
kill them. They're your comrades.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.050
Neither can you.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.240
Anyway, do you really think 
you can get away from us?

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.830
Okay, kiddos.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.090
You can head home first,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.060
you fools.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.050
Captain Mereo—

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.810
What?

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.650
You're going to stay behind and try to 
stall all of us so those two can escape?

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.650
Well, aren't you nice to 
your friends, Miss Royalty?

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.910
You seem to have the wrong idea.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.530
Those kiddos would've just been in my way.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.420
Stall you? Don't make me laugh.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.300
I intend to kill all of you!

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.230
Crimson Lion Kings, let the
 flames within you rage!

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.290
No matter how dire the situation 
may be, never give up!

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:51.230

Page 98
 The Sleeping Lion

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.030
How long do you plan on sleeping,
 my foolish brother?!
