00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.060
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.580
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.970
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.630
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.930
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.790
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.620
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.820
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.540
Tolsa Village

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.040
Those flowers are for me?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.540
Yes. You like them, don't you?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.460
Aren't you supposed to be selling them, though?

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.970
It's fine. You're my hero, Zara.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.650
Dad.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.740
Zora! Come here a sec!

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.370
Well, I'll be going now.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.830
What was that about?

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.420
Don't these smell great, Zora?
 I love this scent.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.740
Yeah, I know.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.620
In Zara's Footsteps

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.540
What a pain. Like I have time for that.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.700
Train together, my ass.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.450
I didn't join the squad so I could 
be all buddy-buddy with you guys.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.990
I left on a journey to train 
since I didn't have time

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.590
to bother with the rest of the Black Bulls,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.690
but how long am I going to keep doing this?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.950
Right, Dad?

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.580
Could it have been someone from 
the village? Yeah, no way.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.850
It's true that Dad was called the pride of

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.170
Tolsa Village because he was 
the first peasant Magic Knight.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.230
But that's all in the past.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.550
Damn it!

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.730
He's not even using a grimoire?

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.130
Guess he has potential. 
Well, do your best, I gues—

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.220
Who's there?!

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.680
Whoops, my bad.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.160
Wow! You hit the target all the way from here!

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.950
Your flame magic is amazing, Kaito!

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.230
I can't wait for you to take 
the Magic Knights Entrance Exam!

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.570
Oh, stop. This isn't the time for that.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.030
I'm guessing that brat's some rich kid who
came to a summer resort for some R&amp;R.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.220
What's that look for?

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.530
Apologize!

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.000
Did you just tell Kaito to apologize?!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.020
Watch your tongue!

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.840
Oh, stop. He's just a child who doesn't even 
have a grimoire yet, and a peasant at that.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.440
Here you go.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.300
That should settle things, right?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.780
Let's go.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.610
I'm sorry I'm a peasant.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.600
What?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.480
But when I turn fifteen and get my grimoire...

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.950
I hope you're not about to say you're 
going to join the Magic Knights.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.600
I am! I'm joining the Magic Knights!

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.610
Don't bother. It's impossible for peasants.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.610
But there are peasants in the Magic Knights!

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.150
Are there?

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.550
They've made quite the buzz lately.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.290
I'm sure they only got in because they had 
dirt on a current Magic Knight or something.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.710
I know for a fact that Zara 
Ideale didn't join that way!

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.520
Zara Ideale?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.330
I've never heard of him.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.330
What squad?

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.640
The Purple Orcas!

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.410
The Purple Orcas?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.300
The squad at the center of 
all the unsavory rumors after

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.090
their captain got replaced 
because of a scandal?

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.260
Zara's an amazing Magic Knight!

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.330
Yeah?

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.600
How? If he's that amazing, 
he must be renowned for something.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.170
Well? Isn't he?

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.720
H-He died during a mission.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.700
See? This is exactly my point.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.670
Peasants should know their place and 
just stay in their villages until they die.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.750
Shut up!

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.410
What's that magic?

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.220
Teach him a lesson.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.970
Okay.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.070
You stupid peasant!

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.870
Apologize to Kaito!

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.060
No!

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.440
Apologize!

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.730
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.360
I see...

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.780
That's enough.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.320
Wh-Who are you?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.170
That reeks!

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.170
Hold it!

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.590
That power...

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.590
Y-You'll regret this, you peasant!

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.050
Are you stupid?

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.100
Don't pick fights when you're 
up against three guys like that.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.000
You don't even have a grimoire. 
There's no way you would've won.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.860
Try using that tiny little brain of yours.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.680
Though... what you said about Zara Ideale 
being an amazing Magic Knight

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.620
isn't exactly wrong.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.620
Ina? Is that you?

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.120
Dad!

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.120
Ina, what happened to you? Don't tell me...

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.760
This masked guy... saved me.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.970
What? I-I'm sorry for any 
trouble my son caused you.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.410
Ina, what happened? Tell me.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.190
Did you do something you can't tell me about?

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.780
Peasants should know their place and 
just stay in their villages until they die.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.190
Why was I born to peasants?

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.310
If I wasn't born into a peasant family, 
I would've had greater magic powers.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.620
If only you weren't my father!

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.530
Hey!

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.190
Wait!

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.120
He's exactly right.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.920
What?

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.240
If I weren't in this state, he wouldn't 
have to help me with my work.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.390
I could've given him more 
time to train with magic.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.140
I'm a failure as a father.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.080
L-Let go of me!

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.280
Wh-Where are you going?

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.660
Wait, have I seen that 
young man somewhere before?

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.030
What the hell are you doing?!

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.610
Cool Mask Guy.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.410
Huh?

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.370
That's what you'll call me.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.620
What the hell are you talking about?

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.170
Listen up, you shitty little shrimp...

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.640
No, you snot-nosed shrimp.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.130
Who're you calling a snot-nosed shrimp?!

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.730
You probably know this, 
but I'll remind you anyway.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.510
The amazing Magic Knight you were 
just praising was also a peasant.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.070
So what if he was?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.130
Are you trying to say he's 
way different than me?

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:32.220
It's true that Zara Ideale never 
lamented his upbringing,

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.800
and never said anything bad about anyone.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.410
You knew Zara, Mask Guy?!

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.490
That's <i>Cool</i> Mask Guy to you.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.030
But as you said, he's way different than you.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.580
I know... that I'm aiming too high.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.840
I'm aiming too high?

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.060
Yeah. You're a peasant, yet you 
want to join the Magic Knights.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.180
I don't remember how many times I've failed 
the Magic Knights Entrance Exam, Zora.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.640
But I don't believe I'm aiming too high, either.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.580
I'm always telling you that I'm gonna 
join the Magic Knights, aren't I?

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.450
That's because I really believe I can!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.780
You said you were gonna join 
the Magic Knights, didn't you?

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.690
So you heard me. You got a problem with that?

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.800
I never said I did.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:39.970
But if you're able to say that, doesn't that 
mean you really believe you can do it?

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.750
That's not what you'd call aiming too high.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.390
Zara Ideale said the same thing.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.400
I really believe I can do it?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.180
Let me give you some advice, snot-nosed shrimp.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.200
Stop calling me a snot-nosed shrimp!

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.640
Wait, what's that?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.930
Isn't that doll... you?

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.830
This is the envoy of justice,
 the Super Magic Knight Zora.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.400
I'm twelve years old, you know...

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.700
He has a mouth on him, 
but he's as good as his word.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.880
He's a warrior who protects 
the country behind the scenes.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.770
What the hell kind of backstory is that?

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.130
You look like that, but you're
 into dolls? Really?

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:25.650
Zora was also the child of a peasant, 
but he didn't idolize nobles or royalty.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.890
That's because he could do something 
nobles and royalty couldn't.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:35.810
Stop ignoring me! Wait, something 
nobles and royalty couldn't do?

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.630
Now, I wonder what that could be?

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.280
How the hell would I know?

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.400
I'm sure you wouldn't.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.240
But if you don't know that, 
you'll never be able to join

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.330
the Magic Knights.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:15.100
Zora was also the child of a peasant, 
but he didn't idolize nobles or royalty.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.210
That's because he could do something 
nobles and royalty couldn't.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.660
Now, I wonder what that could be?

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.990
Ina, let's take a lunch break.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.730
I'll take care of the afternoon work.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.650
You can go practice your magic if you want.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.640
You got lucky yesterday,

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.640
but you'll pay for embarrassing me.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.810
I've come to collect.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.270
Do you know what this is, peasant?

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.940
A magic item?

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.490
Now that I have this...

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.450
Whoa, now... A kid shouldn't 
be playing with that.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.680
Apologize. That's not too difficult, is it?

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.020
You just need to grovel right there.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.290
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.960
What did you just say?

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.300
You're not going to get off with just 
a few scratches. Hurry up and—

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.380
You dumbass!

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.400
That's the second time. Stick to
 your usual toys, you brat.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.140
You're really strong, huh?

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.460
You're not a Magic Knight... are you?

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:56.750
Who knows?

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.350
Ina...

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.360
So you must be the little thief.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.740
May I help you?

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.910
What do you think you're doing to my son?!

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.080
See for yourself.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.370
That's... a magic item!

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.410
Your son stole it from my villa.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.950
I-I did not!

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.010
What are you talking about? 
You clearly had the magic item.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.350
Your son took it! I just picked 
it up after he dropped it!

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.510
Is that true, Kaito?

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:03.760
Don't let him fool you. 
You can never trust a peasant.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.520
You taught me that yourself, Father.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.300
That I did. You're coming with me!

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.720
I'm taking you to the royal capital
 so they can arrest you

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.070
as the burglar that you are!

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:13.870
Ina!

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.490
Let go of me! I'm not a thief!

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.460
Let go of my son!

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.220
And what if I refuse?

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.090
I believe my son!

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.840
I won't let you take him!

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.280
Dad...

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.020
You filthy peasant... 
You'll pay for your insolence!

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.560
Dad!

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.560
What?!

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.160
Dad! The flowers!

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.290
Don't worry.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.790
You wouldn't have to get hurt 
if you just knew your place.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.700
That magic...

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.430
You'll be wiping off that smug look soon enough!

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.500
I have proof that your son is a thief!

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.360
I'll just ask the Magic Knights to deal with it!

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.540
Then let's see this so-called proof.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.450
Wh-Who are you?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.660
That robe...

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.660
You're a Black Bull!

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.200
So he really is...

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:48.260
Perfect timing! I need you to 
capture these thieves for me!

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.720
And I'm telling you to show me proof.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.900
O-Of course!

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.760
You saw him take it from the villa, didn't you?

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.580
U-Um...

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.950
I just happened to be present 
when your precious little boy

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.930
used a magic item to mess 
with the snot-nosed shrimp here.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:11.270
After I interceded, I saw him 
drop it and run off like a coward.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.700
I'm guessing your dad found 
out the magic item was missing,

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.670
so you tried to place the blame 
on the snot-nosed shrimp.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.630
You're the only thief here.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.600
They say lying is the first 
step to becoming a thief,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.240
but I guess it was the other way around for you.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.540
You're just the stupid son 
of a worthless noble.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.250
Is this true, Kaito?

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.470
Here's your proof.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.300
Wh-What happened?!

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.690
You took it, didn't you?

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.060
Y-Yes! I'm really sorry!

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.500
W-Wait, Kaito!

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.370
I'll let you off the hook today!

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.560
Let them off the hook, my ass!

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.690
They say a child is the 
reflection of his parents.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.780
Clearly, you two are the 
dictionary definition of that.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:05.160
I've been sick of nobles for a long time, 
but you have no right to raise a child!

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.850
You're a worthless noble 
and a failure as a father.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.670
This item is too good for you.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.380
Get moving, or I'll kill you.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.890
Yes, sir!

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.800
They even run away the same way.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.590
Dad...

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.310
I never knew you could use such powerful magic.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.810
I've failed the Magic Knights 
Entrance Exam numerous times.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:41.320
It's embarrassing to say, but this 
injury came from one of those failures.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.580
But still, I can't give up.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.580
Even while I do my usual work, 
I constantly train with my magic.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.150
Because I want to be like my hero.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.290
He also failed numerous times, 
but ultimately, he joined the Magic Knights.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.090
I'm sure he worked really hard for it.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:09.490
Zora was also the child of a peasant, 
but he didn't idolize nobles or royalty.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.100
That's because he could do something 
nobles and royalty couldn't.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.730
Now, I wonder what that could be?

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.070
I figured it out, Cool Mask Guy.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.350
Cool Mask Guy?

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.000
The thing Zora was able to do.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.020
Then you should know what you 
need to say to your dad, too.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.140
I'm sorry, Dad... for what I said to you.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.900
Ina...

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.710
I'm sure you'll be able to join 
the Magic Knights someday!

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.190
I won't be joining alone.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.070
Huh?

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.470
Let's both do our best together, Ina!

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.860
Yeah!

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.890
By the way...

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.180
Why did you even bother with me?

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.680
No particular reason.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.730
I see.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.280
I guess you really are a Super Magic Knight.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.740
What?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.510
You're a Magic Knight. 
You're wearing a robe, aren't you?

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.210
I never got as far as 
becoming a Super Magic Knight.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.150
Now, I'm just striving to 
become a true Magic Knight.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.880
Just like you.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.010
Yeah! I'll join the Magic Knights someday!

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.950
Well, do your best, snot-nosed shrimp.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.420
Yeah!

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.280
A rainbow stinkbug!

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.680
It reeks!

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.280
I'm the one who'll become the Wizard King.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.990
Nope, it's me!

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:52.500
They're only able to say that because 
they truly believe they can.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.690
Just watch, Dad.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:59.500
I'll make it to this zero stage.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.930
Guess whipping the other Black Bulls 
into shape would help with that.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.010
Those jerks are such a handful.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.570
Petit Clover

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.330
Petit Clover!

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.070
Super Magic Knight Zora

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.190
Super Magic Knight Zora!

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.080
Boom! The envoy of justice, 
the Super Magic Knight Zora!

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.630
I'm twelve years old, you know...

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.930
And now, I'm 25!

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.580
I now have something more 
suitable for my age!

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.440
Newly sculpted, painted, and fully articulated!

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.260
The envoy of justice, Super Magic Knight Zora!

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.290
Hey.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.310
Gulp.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.910
So you really do like playing with dolls!

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.720
W-Wait, I can explain...

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.300
He has a mouth on him, 
but he's as good as his word.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.240
This delusion of a warrior who 
protects the land from the shadows...

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.060
Did you really think that up at your age?

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.480
No, that was my dad, Zara Ideale.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.170
Lying is the first step to becoming a thief!

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.130
Zara's an amazing Magic Knight!

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.070
He'd never think up something so dumb!

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.840
I'm not lying!

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.080
Well, that was totally out of character.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.500
I'm rather delicate, so I guess I got a 
bit sentimental when I went back home.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.610

Page 138
 A Witch's Homecoming

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.050
That drunk's going home, too?
