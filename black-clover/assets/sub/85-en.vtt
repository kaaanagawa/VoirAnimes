WEBVTT

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.800
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.050
I'm going to win

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.140
against a Magic Knights Squad captain!

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.050
I'm going to win!

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.430
The Royal Knights Selection Exam

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.020
was conducted to counter 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.610
Good...

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.190
Good, good!

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.900
Huh?

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.370
In the end, Yuno, Noelle, and En's team won.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.750
As for the mysterious mage who called himself 
Xerx, we found out his real name was...

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.000
Your trap magic and knowledge are vital.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.580
You will probably pass the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.420
so I'll be counting on you.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.560
I think it's about time you put on the 
robe from your own squad, don't you,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.180
Zora Ideale?

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.890
Zora Ideale?

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.190
Who the hell is that jerk?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.470
I'm just a guy passing through 
who couldn't become a super mage.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.020
Together in the Bath

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.140
Asta hasn't moved at all, huh?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.550
He's like a doll.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.670
I-Is he breathing?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.250
He's breathing, but his 
soul's definitely gone.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.310
It must've been a real 
shock that he couldn't win.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.430
After the battle was over...

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.380
I'm going to catch up to you!

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.440
I'm the one who's going 
to become the Wizard King!

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.540
Or so he said. I can't 
really blame him, though.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.320
That pretty boy gave him a clear show of 
just how different their ability levels are.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.800
The shock of realizing his rival had surpassed
him over time must've been huge.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.580
I know exactly how he feels.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.580
Ah, my little sister... The goddess Marie...

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.830
The longer I go without seeing you,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.580
the more damaged my soul becomes.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.050
I-I'm pretty sure that's 
not the same thing.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.030
Yeah...

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.290
I know! I'm gonna ambush him!

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.100
I'm sure he'll feel better after 
risking his life in battle.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.330
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruc—

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.660
Hold on a second! Fighting's not going
 to make him feel better right now!

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.850
We'll never know unless we try!

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.620
We most certainly do know!

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.730
He'll die!

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.140
Well, if I can't use magic, 
can I hit him with some bricks?

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.800
No!

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.090
My bestest friend in the whole world,
 I know exactly how you feel.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.140
It's time that I, Gordon Agrippa,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.600
go over there and gently pat you 
on the head to cheer you up.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.000
Why do you look so out of it?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.390
Who cares if you couldn't fight your 
rival in the finals? Right, Rouge?

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.360
You kicked plenty of butt!

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.590
You passed! You definitely passed!

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.680
Come on, smile. Smile for me.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.210
I'm telling you to smile. Come on!

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.570
What the hell, Vanessa?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.340
Vanessa... She's pushing herself so hard 
to be cheerful just to cheer Asta up.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.380
Huh?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.650
Yeah, she's just putting on a brave face.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.830
I also put on a brave face when 
I can't see my precious Marie.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.790
W-We should also put on our 
brave faces and act chipper!

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.510
You're right. Let's cheer Stupidsta up.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.580
Yay! That means I can attack him, right?

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.380
No!

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.180
Hi-yah!

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.180
Oh, dear...

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.190
I just told you not to do that!

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.090
A-Are you alive, Stupidsta?

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.320
Hey, I think it's about time.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.120
Huh?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.040
For the results of the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam!

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.730
I'm sure the messenger owl 
will be by any minute.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.980
Oh... Right.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.410
Yeah! It should be any time now.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.790
Asta! If you pass, you'll catch up 
to that cool pretty boy in no time!

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.800
Catch up to him and surpass him!

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.980
Do you really think I passed, though?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.790
I mean, I ended up withdrawing.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.330
I'm sure you'll be fine.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.800
Yeah, Stupidsta. 
Believe in yourself a little more.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.150
Noelle...

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.060
I mean, my team won, so I definitely passed.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.090
You saw how talented I am.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.860
Wha? The only reason you guys won 
is because of that cool pretty boy.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.450
What did you say, you stupid delinquent 
who lost because of your own magic?!

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.940
The hell did you say?!

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.100
You've got some nerve, 
talking like that to your senior!

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.570
And who're you calling a delinquent?!

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.400
I'm royalty!

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.450
That doesn't matter!

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.000
It most certainly does!

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.990
Please don't fight...

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.990
No, it doesn't!

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.540
You're the one who should be worried
 about whether you passed, not Asta.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.900
I'm not worried at all!

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.450
I'm sure I passed! No doubt about it!

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.880
Magna, you're super nervous, huh?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.140
I-I am not, gosh darn it! How rude!

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.990
I can tell.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.950
Your heart rate and body temperature 
have gone up, and you're sweating.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.290
You're definitely nervous right now.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.620
Oh, fine. I feel like being nice.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.180
I'll show you Marie's picture for 
3.5 seconds to cheer you up.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.200
I have a better idea, Asta! Let's fight!

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.110
Huh?

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.250
You're feeling better now, aren't you?

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.830
Of course he isn't!

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.160
Can I attack you with 
everything I've got? Can I?!

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.490
No, you can't!

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.790
Huh? Charmy?

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.770
What's the matter, Charmy?

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.250
Just thinking about how cool Yuno was

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.790
makes my heart feel so full 
that I can't even eat...

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.090
I only ate a fifth of my usual.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.600
That's still plenty.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.310
Asta's not calling her out.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.060
Guess he's still out of it.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.510
My meal-saving prince...

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.320
My chest hurts, la...

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.820
You probably just ate too much.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.980
She's also a goner.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.750
Yeah... What should we do?

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.250
All right, bath time!

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.510
Mister Yami?

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.000
Bath time?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.940
Sweating off your stress in the 
bath will perk you right up.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.250
Come on, let's go!

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.840
Nah, I'm gonna pass.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.590
Captain's orders, brat. 
Shut your trap and go!

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.660
Man... The water feels great, doesn't it?

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.010
Y-Yeah...

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.570
Stop that, you little shit!

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.170
Don't make me boil you!

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.920
We're all in the bath.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.760
We're undoubtedly connected right now.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.800
Ah, I'm so happy.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.790
How's everything over there? 
Is the water too cold?

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.070
Nope, it's just fine!

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.940
Being in the bath with 
everyone... With everyone...

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.750
It's so embar...

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.920
Gondola...

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.920
Hey!

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.180
Why, though?!

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.430
Sure is noisy over there.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.570
This makes me think about the past.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.740
Mister Yami?

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.820
Just shut up and listen.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:15.170
This was when I first joined the Gray Deer.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.420
It's the Aqua Deer now, though.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.400
When Julius was the captain, 
it was known as the Gray Deer.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.540
Right...

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.830
So back when I joined them,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.130
I went out on a journey to train myself.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.790
He just launched into story time.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.340
One day, I got pretty hungry,
 so I was fishing.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.600
And then...

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.770
Man, I'm hungry.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.020
Hurry up and give me a bite. One bite...

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.020
Take the bait, damn it.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.030
Looks like a dine and dash.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.220
I can catch the real deal out on the shore,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.750
but I'm just not cut out for 
a small-time place like this.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.900
My gut's gonna touch my back soon.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.600
You guys thieves?

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.190
If you want a fight, 
I don't mind giving you one.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.940
But I'm kinda pissy right now 
because I'm starving,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.940
so I might not be able to hold back.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.830
P-Please, have these.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.470
S-Sir Magic Knight, you seemed rather hungry.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.270
These things had better not be poisoned.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:55.030
O-Of course they aren't! 
Please, help yourself.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.070
All right, don't mind if I do.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.570
Sir Magic Knight, if you would be 
willing to listen to our request,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.640
we could prepare even more for you.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.810
Request?

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.650
Okay, sure.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.970
It's almost harvest season.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.820
Thankfully, we foresee 
a good harvest this year.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.950
Well, that's good.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.940
But...

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.690
Despite our good harvest, 
they're going to come around.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.620
Who's "they"?

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.630
Bandits.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.980
As soon as the harvest's done, they show up

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.180
to steal the precious crops that we spent 
so much time nurturing and harvesting.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.550
We sent a petition to the royal capital,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.060
but apparently the bandits 
are hitting other towns, too,

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.140
so they just can't afford to send 
help to our remote little village.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.770
So you want me to deal with the bandits.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.970
W-We'll be happy to feed 
you while you stay with us.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:01.780
Three meals a day!

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.760
To hell with that!

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.490
You want to hire a Magic Knight, 
and all you're offering is food?

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.270
W-We don't have any money.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.000
Our harvest was stolen last year, too,
 so we barely made any money.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.710
The bread I gave you earlier had been 
hidden in one of our storerooms.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.510
Naps!

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.790
I won't work for food alone.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.340
Add naps to it. That's my final offer.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.260
Do that, and I wouldn't mind 
fighting off these bandits for you.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.130
Guess that seals the deal.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.360
And now that I'm full, 
I'm going to take a nap.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.520
S-Sir Magic Knight...

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.610
Could you tell us your name?

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.710
I'm Yami.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.870
Yami Sukehiro.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.080
What are we going to do?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.800
About what, boss?

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.710
Looks like they had a good harvest this year.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.470
I wonder if we're going to 
be able to steal all of it.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.220
It might be too heavy for us to carry back.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.010
Not to worry. Some of our 
guys can use spatial magic.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.480
We can just send it all back to the hideout.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.420
Then I guess we don't have to worry.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.670
Right. Now, I'm sure the guys 
in the village are on their guard.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.010
Take them down if they get in our way.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.250
Steal every last crop, boys!

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.460
Yeah!

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.380
Let's see. Where to start...

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.260
Guess I should hit up their 
storehouse first. Where is it?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.810
It's the building to the right there.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.640
Thank you.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.130
Huh?

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.610
If I just scare you off, 
you'll probably come back again,

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.150
so I need to make extra sure 
you don't come back.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.250
That's one.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.910
Two.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.040
Three.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.630
Nineteen, twenty... Damn, 
how many of you are there?

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.340
There's no end to this.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.730
Good grief.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.040
To think they had a small fry
 Magic Knight protecting them.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.360
You the boss of these bandits?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.120
I'm surprised you were able 
to find all these losers.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.130
Get enough losers together and 
you can even defeat a whale.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.360
Even a small leak will sink 
a giant ship, as they say.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.800
Get him, boys!

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.140
The one who takes him out gets a reward!

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.420
Yeah!

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.140
Individually, they're not that strong, 
but there are too many of them.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.020
What am I gonna do?

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.350
Guess all I can do is kick your asses!

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.260
You're mine!

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.000
Shut up.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.350
Who the hell are you?

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.730
I'm no one suspicious.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.230
Weird boots.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.600
Weird pants.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.110
Weird clothes.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.610
A weird cape.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.980
And to top it off...

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.990
A weird mask.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.710
Everything about you is suspicious!

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.000
Yami, was it?

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.490
I'm counting on you to watch my back.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.180
Huh? How do you know who I am?

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.440
This guy moves like he can read my mind.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.530
Our ki goes together.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.820
Th-That's impossible...

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.830
The two of them defeated all my men?

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.080
The only ones left...

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.080
...are you bastards!

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.740
Hurry! We're retreating!

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.970
Y-Yes, sir!

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.420
Hey! Who do you think you are, 
letting your boss escape like that?!

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.920
Looks like the bandits' boss got away,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.370
but we managed to round up the rest of them.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.220
Now this village and the ones nearby 
probably won't be attacked for a while.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.780
Yeah, probably.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.220
By the way, you still haven't answered me.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.150
I asked you earlier. How the 
hell do you know who I am?

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.270
Oh, that.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.180
You're quite famous.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.350
The wild guy from a foreign country 
who was chosen to be a Gray Deer.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.420
Oh?

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.310
And who the hell are you?

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.750
I'm a member of the Gray Deer, too.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:06.850
Huh?

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.870
Though most of my missions 
are within the royal capital,

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.570
so this is the first time we've met.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.750
I happened to be nearby 
on another mission today.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:23.010
Oh, yeah. I guess I did hear about some guy 
with a weird mask who joined the squad.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.330
I guess that's you.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.980
Calling it weird is quite mean.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.870
A very special person gave me this mask.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.630
A special person, eh?

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.360
Special or not, it's definitely weird.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.060
Who gave you that thing?

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.760
Who, indeed?

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.370
Thank you for everything, Sir Yami.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.620
Thank you very much.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.910
Now our village is safe.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.220
It's no big deal.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.530
You guys fed me plenty.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:10.420
Well, see ya!

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.680
You want one?

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:27.210
I'll pass. You're the one 
that village hired, not me.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.790
All right, then.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.660
What are you going to do now?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.440
Continue my training.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.590
Wanna tag along?

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.100
I'm sure a lot of interesting things 
would happen if I went with you.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.830
But I'll pass.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.860
I have my own mission.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.880
I will follow my own path.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.780
Farewell.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.550
Sure.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.790
You and I...

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.510
Though our paths may differ now,

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.710
I'm sure we'll eventually 
end up on the same path.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.220
The same path?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.220
In that case...

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.230
I guess that makes you my rival.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.190
First, I'm going to become a 
Magic Knights Squad captain...

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.290
before you do.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.190
Please. Like I'd lose to you.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.330
Looks like the challenge is on. 
Let's see who can do it first.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.940
Hey, weird mask guy.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.690
You never told me your name.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.210
Vangeance.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.020
William Vangeance.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.910
Vangeance?

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.710
Even your name is weird.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.470
Let's meet again,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:44.620
Yami.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.470
Yeah.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.620
Well, guess I should get going, too.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:09.390
That was the first time that golden weird 
mask guy and I fought together.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:19.060
And for many years after, the two 
would continue their friendly rivalry.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:55.520
Petit Clover

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.490
Petit Clover!

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:59.020
"Vangeance" Is Hard to Say

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:59.020
"Vangeance" Is Hard to Say.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.240
Hey, weird mask guy.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.110
You never told me your name.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.530
Vangeance.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.780
William Vangeance.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.860
Geangeance?

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.220
Vangeance.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.720
Vangeance, zansu?

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.840
Just "Vangeance."

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.100
Chowchowce?

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.160
That's even farther off.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.390
Oh, maybe it's this.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:21.490
No, not a fan (sensu).

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.740
This is a hand fan (uchiwa).

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.170
Ah, you tricked me.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.630
I'll say it one last time. It's Vangeance.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.500
Shampoo and cream rinse?

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.800
Daily treatment for your hair is important.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.510
And for many years after, 
the two would continue their—

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.590
Just stop!

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.790
My apologies.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.310
Well, that was a bit embarrassing,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.330
telling my squad about my past like that.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.610
Man, I was a young'un back then.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.820
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 86: "Yami and Vangeance."

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 86
 Yami and Vangeance

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.990
Actually, I'm still young. I'm only 28!
