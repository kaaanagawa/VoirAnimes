00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.780
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.480
Yami was visiting the 
Golden Dawn's headquarters

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.760
in order to meet with Vangeance, but...

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.930
How long is that golden 
weird mask guy captain of yours

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.240
going to make me wait after he 
said he wanted to apologize?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.770
H-He should be here any second.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.360
Are you Golden Dawn jerks messing with me?

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.550
Yami continued to wait for Vangeance,
whom he trusted

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.570
because they had fought for this kingdom

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.580
and become Magic Knights 
Squad captains together.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.050
But at that time...

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.970
Vangeance revealed his other self, which 
he had kept hidden, to the Wizard King.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.740
He was the Captain of the Golden Dawn,
 William Vangeance,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.640
but also the leader of the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.680
Thank you, William... 
My one and only human friend.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.440
Good day to you, 
Wizard King Julius Novachrono.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.440
I am the leader of the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.030
I had really hoped that wasn't the case.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.890
Licht fought Julius so he 
could steal the magic stones

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.120
that Julius had and exact his 
revenge against the humans.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.700
Julius was able to anticipate Licht's attacks

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.500
with his time magic and fight back.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.540
I have you now!

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.560
Wha—

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.210
He's anticipating even faster!

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.840
I can already see your future.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.570
You cannot defeat me.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.090
Julius Novachrono

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.830
Look over there!

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.950
The castle tower...

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.140
S-Something's shining...

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.770
What in the world is going on?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.580
This way!

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.450
Over there!

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.940
This magic... It's Lord Julius.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.050
He's battling with someone.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.950
Someone who uses light magic and 
can keep up with Lord Julius...

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.020
Could it be...

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.520
The leader of the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun, Licht?

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:23.020
But the Royal Knights should be working 
on eliminating them as we speak.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.000
How did he get into the castle?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.950
Was he also the one who shut down my 
communication magic with Lord Julius?

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.680
There are too many unknowns...

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.820
Wh-What's going on?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.350
Is Lord Julius fighting?

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.140
What should we do?

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.590
Please, calm down.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.950
This is the moment our strength 
will be put to the test.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.120
We cannot protect this kingdom 
if we're panicking like this!

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.920
Yes. Calm down.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.240
It's my job to remain 
calm at times like this.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.810
Even if we were to assist in the fight,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.400
we're nowhere near their level. 
We'd only get in the way.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.960
There's no way Lord Julius should lose,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.790
but if all else fails, the only ones 
who could keep up in this battle are

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.680
Magic Knights Squad captains or their equals!

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.380
I need to send a message to all the 
Magic Knights Squad headquarters I've marked!

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.300
What?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.920
Sis!

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.430
Communication magic?

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.960
It's a message from the royal capital, bah-ha.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.310
This is an urgent message to all 
Magic Knights Squad captains!

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.960
The Wizard King is fighting a 
man believed to be the leader

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.630
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun 
right now at Clover Castle!

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.240
They might be putting 
some plan into motion,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.950
like the previous attack 
on the royal capital.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.870
All Magic Knights should follow orders from
 their captains and guard their districts.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.430
Captains, as soon as your 
districts are secure,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.350
please meet at the royal 
capital immediately!

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.200
Wh-What's going on?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.140
Captain Mereoleona should be attacking 
their hideout as we speak.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.890
The leader of the Eye of the Midnight 
Sun is at the royal capital?

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.280
This could be my only chance
to avenge my brother.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.280
But...

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.300
What's with those pathetic 
looks on your faces?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.480
And you call yourselves members 
of the proud Crimson Lion Kings?!

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.280
Yes, sir!

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.170
Remember the words of my brother!

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.690
Remain calm at all times!

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.690
While my sister is gone,

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.230
we will prepare for a possible attack

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.030
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 as we were ordered!

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.750
H-He's right!

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.540
This is no time to panic!

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.940
We're the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.850
How could this have happened? 
How did they get into the royal capital?

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.110
Please hurry and return, 
Captain Vangeance.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.680
It couldn't be...

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.470
Please let me be wrong.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.930
Your individual blows 
are becoming a bit dull.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.700
At this rate, I won't even have to 
anticipate your moves to dodge them.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.520
He can keep up with 
me even at this speed?

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.450
Just how far into the future 
can he anticipate?

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.820
You can have this back.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.740
He sped up my spell.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.640
Well, you certainly came close.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.140
You're pretty fast.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.380
Even reading your moves, I still 
haven't been able to capture you.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.280
What is behind this man's strength?

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.830
He's just an ordinary human. So why...

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.520
I'd really appreciate it 
if you'd just give up now.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.100
I'd rather not wound Vangeance's body.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.610
The reason he isn't fighting back is
because he wants to capture me alive.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.380
He still has plenty of strength.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.380
To fight against me,
despite my four-leaf grimoire...

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.840
Where is it? Where is his grimoire?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.670
What kind of...

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.100
Are you curious about my grimoire?

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.170
My grimoire is right up there.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.220
Why does it look like that?

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.490
It doesn't even have a cover!
 That grimoire is...

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.420
Time magic and a grimoire 
without a cover...

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.650
I didn't know if it was good or bad 
at the time, but I was special.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.700
So I thought about it a lot.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.590
I'm just like this coverless grimoire.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.020
I couldn't be classified.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.450
Who am I? What is my purpose in life?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.660
I kept asking myself that over and over.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.210
And as I did, I gained 
more and more recognition.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.710
And once I finally got here, I thought...

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.390
The path that I've walked 
makes me who I am.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.560
I am the Wizard King.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.690
I just figured it out.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.230
We are about to use the 
power of the magic stones

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.820
in an attempt to defy the 
natural order of this world.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.160
This man...

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.230
This human...

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.340
He is an existence that the world and 
fate created in order to stop us.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.670
The last bastion of order.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.300
As the Wizard King,

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.420
I will protect this kingdom

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.670
and its people.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.110
Then I suppose... No.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.220
This is exactly why I have to defeat him!

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.730
In that case... just try to protect them now!

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.930
Sealing Magic Released!

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.820
His power is swelling...

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.330
H-Hey...

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.650
What is that?

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.250
Wh-What's going on?

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.420
This tremendous magic power is...

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.440
You humans stole everything from me.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.370
My friends... my days of 
happiness... all in an instant.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.450
Even if it means violating the natural order...

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.850
You humans shall pay!

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.340
To think he had enough magic power 
to overwhelm this entire kingdom...

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.970
This isn't good. Is he planning to 
unleash that power upon the people?

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.140
Even if I can't kill you alone,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.390
I can kill everyone else.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.760
I-Is this a spell?

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.100
Countless swords of light?

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.100
Mommy, the sky's all white!

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.400
It's so bright!

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.610
I-Is this the end of the world?

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.500
What's going on?

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.030
Town in the Common Realm: Nean

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.030
It's so empyreal...

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.490
A Village Out in the Boonies: Hage

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.490
What the heck is that?

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.230
We can see it from way out here?

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.370
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.090
Don't worry. Even if that 
light is something ominous,

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.170
this kingdom has Magic Knights.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.350
The size of that light spell 
is ridiculous... damn it!

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.600
What the hell's going on, Julius?

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.610
Please let me make it in time!

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.780
It's already enveloped the 
whole kingdom. At this rate...

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.290
Now... Accept your judgment, humans!

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.550
Light Magic: Arrows of Judgment!

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.310
I had doubts.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.750
Honestly, why do those commoners 
have such poor magic?

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.510
I honestly don't know how 
peasants are even alive.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.140
It makes me sick just being 
in the same kingdom as them.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.780
Indeed!

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.700
Is that really the case?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.410
What are you looking at?

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.120
Nothing.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.120
Despite having high levels of magic power,

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.360
they only used it to line their own 
pockets and weren't of any use to anyone.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.130
Why were they even alive?

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.220
Ah, you must be the Magic 
Knight I heard about.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.620
The one with the bizarre grimoire.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.360
Well, that aside, there's a merchant

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.190
who has requested our 
accommodation of his business.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.130
Oh, really?

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.460
You see...

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.830
Ah, well, well...

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.990
I kept searching for my purpose in life 
while fighting as a Magic Knight.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.900
And then...

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.200
Hurry up and give me all your money!

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.210
Hold it!

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.240
You evil villain who threatens 
the peace in this kingdom...

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.960
I won't let you get away with this!

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.900
I encountered a man named Zara,

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.800
who was the first peasant to 
be chosen as a Magic Knight.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.150
Come at me with all you've got!

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:17.970
Just so you know, my magic is a hundred 
times stronger than yours, you fat-ass!

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.640
A Magic Knight, eh?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.630
Like that scares me!

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.730
You fell for it.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.370
All right!

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.500
Everyone, get someplace safe!

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.390
Heya! Could you come down here a sec?

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.970
He didn't have much magic power,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.570
but he cleverly used his trap spells in battle.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.520
Observation of his magic made 
it clear how hard he worked.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.560
Hey, what the heck is that magic?

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.450
It's almost like you're 
reversing the flow of time.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.820
Close, but not quite.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.940
Time magic, eh? That's way too awesome.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.070
But I'd say there won't be any casualties now.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.930
Zara, was it? Looks like 
you're quite hurt yourself.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:21.740
Let me have a look.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.830
I'm fine.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.730
As a Magic Knight,

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.300
we need to prioritize the lives 
of the people, after all!

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.710
Don't you feel the same way, Julius?

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.780
Well, I'll leave this to you.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.840
While other Magic Knights were blinded 
by personal achievements and glory,

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:41.100
he always prioritized helping out 
the people above everything else.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.380
Back then, even though I didn't really 
know what it meant to be a Magic Knight,

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.300
I thought he was what a true 
Magic Knight should be.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.360
A little while later...

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.110
I heard that Zara had died.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.350
Whoa, there.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:02.870
Oh?

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.370
You're...

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.410
Zara had carried out his 
duty as a Magic Knight.

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.020
That's how I wanted to be... 
a Magic Knight like Zara.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.020
And right around the time 
I started thinking that...

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.860
I heard that he was killed by 
another member of his own squad.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.920
No way! He must've been 
one hell of an annoyance

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.650
if there are rumors like that going around.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.740
He probably showed off too much.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.790
Well, it doesn't matter. 
This just means another peasant died.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.050
This cannot be okay.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.730
It wasn't just happening 
with the Magic Knights.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.180
In this kingdom, because of 
the class they were born into,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.060
the ones on top grew arrogant while 
the ones at the bottom gave up.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.060
Even though both sides 
should've had more potential.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.560
I thought it was a waste.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.810
The potential of magic 
and of humans is infinite.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.320
For your voice to be widely 
heard, you need power,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.820
rank,

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.570
and trust.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.330
I built up a record of achievements 
and became the Wizard King.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.580
Magic and humans should be freer.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.630
The change won't be dramatic.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.260
However, slowly but surely...

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.590
The people of this kingdom are 
finally starting to change.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.560
Through the strength of the people 
I believe in and acknowledge...

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.520
Through the strength of the 
people they acknowledge.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.100
I can't let that end now.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.610
Not while I am the Wizard King!

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.110
Time Reversal Magic: Chrono Anastasis.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.790
Wh-What's going on?

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.620
A time spell tremendous enough to save 
all the people of this kingdom...

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.580
Impressive.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.050
But it appears that you've 
used up all the time and magic

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.580
that you had accumulated.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.330
I'm sure you saw my attack.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.420
But you couldn't cancel that time spell

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.380
in order to evade.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.510
Because...

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.760
you are the Wizard King.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.150
The fact that you are the Wizard King...

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.650
That is your one and only weakness.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.190
What the hell's going on here...

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.180
Vangeance?!

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.500
Petit Clover

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.300
Petit Clover!

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.000
Please, Calm Down!

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.230
Please, Calm Down!

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.980
What's going on?

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.560
Is Lord Julius fighting?

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.460
What should we do?

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.970
Please, calm down.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.110
Yes. Calm down.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.430
It's my job to remain 
calm at times like this.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.270
There's no way Lord Julius should lose,

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.470
but if all else fails, the only ones 
who could keep up in this battle are

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.530
Magic Knights Squad captains or their equals!

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.150
I need to send a message to all the 
Magic Knights Squad headquarters I've marked!

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.210
Hello, you've reached the restaurant 
Not Done Yet. You ordering takeout?

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.240
I'm sorry, I've called the wrong number!

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.990
This time, I'll get through to each of 
the Magic Knights Squad headquarters!

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.220
Hello, you've reached the hot 
springs hot spot, My Hot Station.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.750
Do you want to make a reservation?

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.870
Wrong number!

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.620
I'll definitely get it this time!

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.130
Who the heck are you?

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.760
Um... Is this one of the 
Magic Knights Squad headquarters?

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.630
Say what?! I used to be—

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.880
Damn it!

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.970
What in the world is going on?! 
I can't get through to them at all!

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.710
Let's calm down a bit.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.750
Right...

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.040
What the hell's going on here, Vangeance?!

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.730
The crime of betraying Julius's trust 
and my friendship deserves death!
