00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.800
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.760
The fifth round of the Royal Knights 
Selection Exam finally concluded.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.890
Crystal magic stoppage confirmed.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.180
B Team wins!

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.600
Fully bloom!

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.180
Full bloom!

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.860
C Team wins!

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.690
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.490
Crystal destroyed! E Team wins!

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.210
The crystal's been destroyed. G Team wins!

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.710
Picture Magic: Twin Storms of Fire and Water!

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.220
Sandstone Magic: Rock Storm!

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.850
The crystal has been destroyed.
 I Team wins!

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.410
You guys were pretty good.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.460
But I haven't quite managed 
the ultimate painting yet.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.110
The sixth round was about to begin.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.110
It's finally our turn! I can't wait!

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.200
Make sure you don't go 
running off on your own.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.700
Let's hit 'em with our best performances!

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.830
Yeah!

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.640
And now, for the sixth round of stage one!

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.750
And... begin!

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.010
Bad Blood

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.450
Things are getting pretty intense.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.420
Both teams are concentrating 
their attacks at the center

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.230
of the battlefield for a magic slugfest.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.490
Steel Creation Magic: Full Metal Fortress!

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.980
Take this!

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.620
His spell changed shape! That's awesome!

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.000
He added a page to his grimoire 
and evolved the spell.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.260
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.840
How is his spell so destructive?

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.470
As I thought... This isn't a junior-level fight.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.360
Luck and I have done tons of 
missions over the last few months,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.180
and we've gotten tougher every time!

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.900
Ain't no way we're still junior-level!

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.060
He's always had intermediate skills,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.650
but apparently, he's gotten stronger.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.840
But that goes for me, too.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.250
Following Asta's example, I trained 
my magic, my body, and my spirit!

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.250
Even if my hard work may betray me...

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.850
I will not betray my hard work!

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.220
Steel Creation Magic: Blazing Spiral Lance!

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.970
Way to go, four-eyes!

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.990
Fantastic, Klaus!

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.480
I guess you're not just some four-eyes 
who's too serious and worries too much!

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.170
Nice! After this fight is over,
 you should fight me!

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.530
Don't be stupid! Concentrate on this match!

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.000
Here he comes... Rob Vitesse.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.790
He's left the crystal behind him.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.420
We'll bust through our three opponents 
and destroy the crystal in a single rush!

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.800
You got it!

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.060
You know... You two are pretty good.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.510
Wing Magic...

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.640
She's actually flying!

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.390
Angel Flapping!

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.640
That's an attack for the enemy...

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.810
Go, Luck!

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.600
And a tailwind for my allies!

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.900
This is so much fun!

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.070
All right! Break through!

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.920
In the end,

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.830
it's individual power differences
that separate victory and defeat.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.130
My spell didn't even faze him.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.500
Not good... Crazy boy!

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.460
More...

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.960
He's fast.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.800
Let's play some more!

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.560
In a single blow?!

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.740
The crystal has been destroyed. K Team wins!

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.090
Yes!

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.690
They did it!

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.590
Yay, yay...

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.190
Man, that was so much fun.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.550
Luck! Y-You actually...

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.050
Boom, boom! You two are fantastic!

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.710
Yay!

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.000
Luck!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.250
That bastard! You're getting 
way too damn strong!

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.590
Our next opponent...

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.420
...seems even more fun.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.430
...seems like they'll help me make 
an even better picture!

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.970
Next up, the eighth and 
final round of stage one...

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.350
O Team and P Team, step forward.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.020
Which means it's finally...

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.860
La!

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.690
...time for Yuno and Noelle's team!

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.340
Finally, it's our turn.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.270
After we're done here, 
you're going on a date with me!

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.620
Whatever.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.140
The other guy....

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.770
Let's... do our best.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.150
The Green Praying Mantises 4th Class Senior Magic Knight
En Ringard

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.130
Everything will be okay 
if we work together.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.380
Are <i>you</i> okay?!

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.870
Let's win... no matter what.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.180
Hey, is he going to be okay?

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.380
No idea.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.210
And I heard that you grew up with Stupidsta.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.970
I hope you're not as reckless as he is, too.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.100
Look who's talking. You can't 
control your magic well, can you?

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.770
It looked like it took all 
you had to maintain

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.360
your Mana Skin at the volcano.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.570
Can you actually fight?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.170
Huh?! I'm royalty!

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:58.580
Can you actually think and fight, you violent
 peasant who's Asta's childhood friend?!

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.310
What a noisy woman.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.640
That wasn't even an argument.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.290
That lame comeback... 
Is Asta rubbing off on you?

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.990
What?! Why would I ever 
be influenced by him?!

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.300
See?! You're just like Shtupidshta!

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.460
Calm down. Guess I was right.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.930
I'm perfectly calm!

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.270
Come on, you two, grow up.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.320
Learn to get along already.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.940
I think you might be the 
cause of this, Asta.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.190
Who cares about you, Asta?!

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.700
More importantly... Why don't 
we come up with a plan?

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.620
Who said you could touch me?!

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.540
I see you're having a friendly chat.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.540
It's as though you think you 
actually have the upper hand.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.750
The Black Bulls just happened to 
make a good showing for once,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.630
and you really believe it was thanks to you?

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.430
Solid...

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.010
You can't control your magic,
and despite being from the House of Silva,

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.020
you couldn't even make it 
into the Silver Eagles.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.930
And you're going to fight <i>me</i>?

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.770
You're back again, shaggy bangs?!

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.780
You failure!

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:18.030
Why can't you do the same things 
as us when you're also royalty?

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.560
Trash! How dare you eat before me?

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.550
Please stop, Solid. Please give that back.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:36.510
You can't protect what's important 
to you because you're weak.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.510
Please stop!

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.230
If you're upset, then get back at me.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.520
If you can actually hit me 
with your spells, I mean.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.990
There you are, you thieving raccoon!

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.950
The fairy dust! The fairy dust!

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.100
Don't worry. You can do it. 
We all worked so hard together.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.850
We're basically family.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.480
We know you way better than 
that brother of yours.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.240
Now, believe in your friends 
and yourself! Believe yourself!

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.930
What's he mumbling about over there?

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.970
Maybe he's cursing that 
annoying brother of hers.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.000
Hey, what are you doing?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.260
We're up. Let's go.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.730
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.980
Make sure you do your 
best to run away, Noelle.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.250
Nyah, nyah, nyah!

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.240
Let's finally end this!

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.250
We will now begin the 
eighth round of stage one.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:02.290
O Team: Sandler, Dimitri, and Solid 
versus P Team: En, Noelle, and Yuno.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.510
Sandler

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.510
Dimitri

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.510
Solid

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.510
O Team

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.510
En   Noelle   Yuno

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.510
P Team

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.510
Begin!

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.840
You've got this, Yuno and Noelle!

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.760
Noelle! Show them what the 
Black Bulls' women are made of!

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.530
Noelle! No need to hold back 
just because he's your brother!

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.610
I'll attack. You two support me.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.220
I'll attack.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.030
No, me.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.070
No, me!

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:24.920
Me.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.210
Me!

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.700
Then I'll support...

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.110
This fast?

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.420
Wait, what?

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.170
This is an annoying way to do it, but it's 
a shortcut with a simplified version

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.420
of that compound magic from before.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.220
We'll end this instantly!

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.740
They haven't moved their crystal.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.940
This isn't good. They closed the 
distance to our crystal in one sprint.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.280
Wind Magic: Crescent Moon Sickle!

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.110
Flame Magic: Combo Eruption!

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.530
Water Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.660
Look at you, learning a defense spell.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.170
Sand Magic: Suppressing Sand Mass!

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.420
It's sucking up the water.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.430
At this rate, we'll spend the 
whole match on the defensive.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.270
Hey! Who gave you permission 
to cling to him like that?!

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.060
I'm probably the fastest on this team.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.650
I'll take advantage of that 
and go destroy their crystal.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:43.930
While I'm doing that, you two 
somehow protect our crystal.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.200
Wait.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.940
Let me go.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.870
Please.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.580
None of you will be going.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.880
You go, Noelle!

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.410
She's been fighting alongside Asta.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.890
I'm sure she can do it.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.850
It's safer if I'm the one 
protecting the crystal, anyway.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.850
If I go...

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.380
Hold it right there, Noelle!

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.150
Solid's bound to come after me.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.070
Don't go off on your own!

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.080
I'll be your opponent.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.920
Hey, did you hear about the 
newbie with the four-leaf clover?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.080
He actually defeated one of the
 Eight Shining Generals from Diamond!

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.840
Seriously? That's insane for his first year!

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.070
Not only that, but when he did it,

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.560
he told the vice captain that he was going 
to become the Captain of the Golden Dawn.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.710
Wow, that's wild!

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.970
I guess you have to be on a different 
level when the Wind Spirit chooses you.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.690
It looks like Captain Vangeance 
has high hopes for him, too.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:04.110
You're saying you're going to guard 
the crystal while dealing with me?

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.990
That attitude is sheer insolence!

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.990
Please come at me with everything you've got.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.400
Why you?

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.520
Several Years Ago

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.260
I wasn't expecting an ambush.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.670
As I was running, I fell deep into this cave.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.890
No one will be able to rescue me here.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.950
This is the end.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.520
Are you all right, Alecdora?

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.800
He looked just like

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.940
the figure in a painting 
I saw when I was little.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.210
The figure of a god.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.950
I sensed you here.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.180
There's nothing to worry about now.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.220
Master Vangeance has some other 
mysterious power besides magic.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.180
A warm power that seems to connect 
him to his squad members.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.530
I swore that I'd devote my 
grimoire to his service.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:25.170
I worked hard to ensure that the 
Golden Dawn remained the strongest squad.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:32.470
We are an elite team of nobles 
chosen by Master Vangeance.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.790
So why...

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.420
Why is that peasant in our midst?

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.540
Not only that...

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.780
I can tell.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.800
Master Vangeance always interacted with 
all his squad members equally, and yet...

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.300
With that boy... With him...

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.740
Yuno...

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.470
He's called him by name five times today!

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.810
Even though he hasn't even 
spoken to me once yet!

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.310
Why him?

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.820
Is it because of his four-leaf clover?

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.810
And that boy...

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.730
The one Master Vangeance 
expects great things from

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.320
said that he would become captain himself.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.080
He's mocking Master Vangeance!

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.580
Don't get full of yourself just because 
you lucked into getting spirit magic!

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.960
Getting chosen by me was 
part of Yuno's power!

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.000
That guy's pissing me off!
 Let's get him, Yuno!

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.810
Step back, Bell.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.590
Are you planning on fighting 
without my powers?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.490
You can't just keep defending, Noelle!

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.150
What are you doing?

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.610
You're ruining our strategy! Both of us
 are supposed to hit the crystal together!

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.780
Shut up! Don't boss me around!

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.280
Fine. I'll join you,
and we'll defeat her in one—

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.950
Heya.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.450
What the heck is this?!

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.230
Fungus Magic: Running Mister Mushroom.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.210
I put some spores on you a little earlier.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.930
I won't let you get in Noelle's way.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.680
Too bad, Noelle.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.530
Now that I've caught up with you,

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.440
you don't have a chance in hell 
of scratching our crystal.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.160
I wouldn't be too sure about that!

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.340
Relax. I's me, En.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.450
This is Talking Mushroom. 
It lets you hear my voice.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.040
Who gave you permission to 
stick this thing on me?!

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.660
Now, now. More importantly...

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.920
I heard Solid's remarks before the match.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.050
A big brother should never say 
such things to his little sister.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.250
I have ten younger brothers and sisters.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.980
They're the ones I'm fighting for.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:06.560
Big brothers exist to protect the younger, 
weaker siblings born after them.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.440
And yet you've only said 
hurtful things to her!

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.820
Get him, Noelle! Thrash your brother!

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:19.140
Don't just give him an ordinary thrashing! 
Make sure he never defies you again!

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.350
R-Right... You sure are energetic.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:27.620
Humans are animals, too! Once you put 
them in their place, they won't turn on you.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.560
Who's going to thrash whom, now?

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:39.620
There's no way a failure 
like you could beat me!

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.180
That's right. I was weak.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.950
You've always been strong, so you probably 
can't understand how weak people feel.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.080
At this point, I don't care if 
you ever acknowledge me or not.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.740
Because even greater people
 have acknowledged me!

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.060
I used to be really scared 
of your magic, Solid.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.910
But now, it feels really flimsy.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.710
Just keep running your mouth, 
you embarrassment to the House of Silva!

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.030
Water Creation Magic: Slashing Sea Serpent!

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.130
How much more do you intend to insult me?

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.890
Sand Creation Magic: 
Sand-Armored Heavy Guard!

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.490
This spell contains all the attack 
and defense powers that I have!

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.900
You think you can stop it 
without your spirit magic?!

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.400
I'm the one who will make 
Master Vangeance's dream come true!

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.950
Wind Magic: Towering Tornado!

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.410
From the inside?

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.560
What was that? He activated his 
spell inside his opponent's spell?

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.800
He can even do that? That's what 
separates us from hot guys, dang it!

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.180
I don't know anything about 
other people's dreams.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.480
The only dreams I see are my own.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.120
Impossible...

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.540
Impossible! You can't be serious!

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.690
This can't be real!

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.500
What's that spell?!

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.410
You can't be serious! 
Noelle couldn't cast a spell like that!

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.410
Solid...

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.040
It's all right if I hit you, right?

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.760
Just go ahead and try it!

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.840
It won't hit me! There's no way 
her spell could actually hit me!

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.100
You complete failure!

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.850
Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.540
Noelle!

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.610
She destroyed the crystal in a single blow!

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.300
The crystal has been destroyed! P Team wins!

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.930
I'm not weak anymore!

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.510
Petit Clover

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.460
Petit Clover!

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.020
Charmy's
Seven Transformations,
Part II

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.020
Charmy's Seven Transformations, Part II!

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.810
In response to the incredible 
number of requests we got from

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.780
Charmy fans across the universe 
saying the seven transformations

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.760
from last time just weren't enough,

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.530
we bring you its sequel!

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.810
Transformation one...

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.270
Christmas Tree Charmy.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.280
La la la, la la la, la la la la laa...

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.690
Transformation two...

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.040
Noms 

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.150
Charmy the Ninja!

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.040
La! Nin nin!

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.200
Transformation three...

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.040
Lion Dancer Charmy!

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.170
Transformation four...

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.170
Noms

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.370
Foot Soldier Charmy!

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.170
La!

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.370
Transformation five...

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.550
Samba Charmy!

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.170
And to finish things off...

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.420
Transformation six...

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.080
Buddha Charmy!

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.650
Right. So we have six again.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.540
It's finally our turn.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.520
I'll show you that I can fight properly!

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.640
Wh-Where are you looking, Stupidsta?!

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.030
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 78: "Peasant Trap."

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 78
 Peasant Trap

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.990
On the name of the Black Bulls,
I'm going to win, no matter what!
