WEBVTT

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.990
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.570
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.600
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.240
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.060
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.770
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.600
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.380
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.810
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.020
I can't leave things the way they are.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.030
Finral is becoming more reliable, 
and Gordon's become more upbeat.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.070
Both Magna and Luck have gotten stronger,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.780
and Noelle's learning one 
powerful spell after another.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.160
Asta has always been moving forward.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.780
I think Gauche has become a bit 
more approachable... maybe.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.850
Everyone's moving forward, but I'm still 
embarrassed about anyone seeing me.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.590
I'm still scared.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.260
I'm better now than I was then,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.100
but I want to stop feeling 
embarrassed in my true form.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.910
I have to change!

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.230
The Maidens' Challenge

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.680
Wh-What?

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.790
What is it? Do you need something?

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.380
U-Um! Um!

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.920
Are you not feeling well?

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.010
Um!

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.630
Please make me your student!

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.890
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.480
I want to get over my shyness.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.470
Why?

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.940
When we fight the Spade Kingdom or the devil, 
I can't help anyone if I'm like this.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.980
Why don't you just transform and fight?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.780
That's not good enough!

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.740
I have to be the real me.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.760
Why me, though?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.620
Basically everyone on our 
team is pretty confident.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.810
You're the only one who can help me with this!

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.110
You're always so confident and refined,
 because you're royalty.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.790
I want to be like you, Noelle!

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.260
Ah, you have excellent judgment.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.030
Well, if you insist, I guess I don't 
mind helping you out as a royal.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.510
Thank you very much!

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.390
Just so you know, I don't hold back.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.640
Okay! Th-Thank you!

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.530
If being looked at embarrasses you, 
we'll just have to get you over that.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.420
O-Okay!

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.150
I'm going to look at you, so just act normal.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.570
Show me your face!

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.160
I can't!

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.370
Okay... There, I closed my eyes. How about now?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.500
I-I'm okay.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.130
Okay, again.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.390
This is pretty bad.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.230
Okay, how about this?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.970
You're fine if I'm not that close, right?

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.020
No... As long as you're looking at me...

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.920
Looks like this is going to take a while.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.030
I'll help, too.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.570
Gordon!

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.820
I'm always very aware of what 
my precious friends are doing.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.410
So I've been watching you two 
from here this whole time.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.060
This whole time?

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.750
I-I'm so embarrassed!

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.250
I hope you'll let me help 
with my best friend's growth.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.260
It's probably hard having a real 
person look at you right away.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.850
You should get used to 
being around my dolls first.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.710
So we're taking this in steps.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.260
That's not a bad idea.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.270
We'll do our best not to 
look at you, so give it a try.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.600
O-Okay!

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.070
Hey, Grey!

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.980
Act normally! You shouldn't 
be embarrassed around a doll!

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.450
G-Good morning...

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.650
With more energy!

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.400
B-But...

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.570
He's still looking at me!

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.330
Buck up! You want to be like me, don't you?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.040
Just like Noelle...

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.190
This doll's no big deal.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.710
There's no point if you transform!

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.290
Y-You're right!

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.300
But don't forget how you felt just now.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.930
Yes, you <i>will</i> transform... but only your mind.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.010
Th-That sounds difficult.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.160
I-I have nothing to be embarrassed about.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.090
Jumping straight to my level will 
be difficult. I'm royalty, after all.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.780
Then what should I do?!

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.240
Maybe you can start with Asta.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.150
He's really easy to understand.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.710
Asta... Asta...

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.900
Heya, Miz Charmy! What's for lunch today?!

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.580
Perfect! Just keep that up!

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.970
She sounds a lot like him.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.610
Thanks for always helping me out, Noelle!

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.330
It's great to know you're on my side in battle!

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.910
We're gonna have to fight 
some really strong guys soon,

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.820
but I know we can win if I'm with you!

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.680
I don't know why you can 
win with me, but fine.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.860
U-Um, I look forward to working with you!

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.930
It's difficult getting over your weakness.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.490
Sorry, I don't know what other kind 
of advice I can give you right now.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.630
Especially since I can't understand 
feeling embarrassed just by

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.500
having someone look at me.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.960
I'm sorry I couldn't help out.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.780
I hope you'll be able to find a good teacher.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.470
Hey.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.350
Is that you, Grey?

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.480
What do you want, and why are you in my form?

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.540
I want to ask a favor.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.960
What?

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.710
Be my mentor.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.770
What am I supposed to teach you?

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.320
Our magic attributes are 
completely different.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.070
If I undo my transformation, I become 
embarrassed whenever someone sees me.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.660
Tell me how I can be more confident.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.030
Tch! Why do I have to do that?

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.220
Ask someone else. I'm busy.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.370
Don't be so stingy. Just tell me.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.740
I won't get anything out of helping you.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.360
I guess you're right. Then I guess 
I'll do one thing you ask me to.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.540
What's all this?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.040
Turn into Marie and say 
the lines I've written here.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.730
We'll start with...

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.150
I love you, Big Brother!

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.310
That's a must!

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.130
Also...

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.330
I worked really hard to make this 
for you, Big Brother! Eat up!

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.150
And this is also absolutely necessary.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.900
Let's be together forever, Big Brother!

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.930
There's plenty more, but say 
those like you mean them.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.560
I'm not actually Marie. 
Will that still make you happy?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.450
I only get to see the 
real Marie once a month.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.330
I'll be able to get by as long 
as you look and sound like her.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.190
O-Oh, I see...

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.900
Okay, follow me.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.400
You just want to be okay 
with being seen, right?

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.200
Yeah.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.790
First, undo your transformation.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.800
I-I'm being seen! I'm being 
seen from every possible angle!

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800
Try to survive this.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.240
S-S-S-S-Survive...

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.690
Um... U-Use what I learned earlier...

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.180
J-J-J-J-Just transform my mind to Asta's...

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.060
H-H-Hey... G-G-Gauche...

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.140
I can't!

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.440
I guess it's no use.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.290
Hey. Stand up and open your eyes.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.320
I-I can't!

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.120
Calm down. I'm not looking at you anymore.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:20.930
Huh?

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.900
Well, what do we do about this?

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.850
Wait, is this...

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.970
Hey, can you hear my voice?

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.210
Stand up.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.300
Raise your right hand.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.620
Now raise your left leg.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.400
She fell into a trance as she 
watched the butterfly pass by.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.820
This should work!

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.490
Now, how do I get her to not worry 
about people looking at her?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.520
A turtle.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.430
From now on, you're going to 
be a turtle. A very big turtle.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.160
Whether it's windy, rainy, or people are 
staring at you, you just don't care.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.400
You are a turtle!

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.260
I'm...

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.140
looking at you.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.640
All right! It worked!

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.150
Hey, say something!

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.530
Oh, right. Turtles don't talk.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.650
Well, that's not good.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.860
You're now going to turn back into a human.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.700
But your mind will remain a turtle.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.370
You'll be a human who's never fazed 
by anything, just like a turtle.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.560
I'm... a human.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.420
I'm looking at you.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.880
I don't have to hide my face.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.880
I can bear it!

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.880
Perfect.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.230
How are you doing?

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:13.050
I'm still a little anxious, 
but I feel completely different... now.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.580
I'm sure you do. You have 
the mind of a turtle now.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.730
Eventually, you won't care about 
people looking at you at all.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.110
Yes...

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.970
If you're fine on this crowded street,

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.120
you should be fine being surrounded 
by your friends at the hideout.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.120
I owe it all to you, Gauche. Thank you.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.870
In that case...

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.170
I'll need you to keep your promise now.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.550
Huh?

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.370
Don't tell me you actually forgot.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.220
Turn into Marie and say 
those lines I wrote for you.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.360
Oh... Right.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.930
I love you, Big Brother!

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.680
I love you too, Marie!

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.970
Why did you turn back?

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.860
I-I-I mean, this is a bit much...

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.780
Transform.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.630
I-I'm too embarrassed...

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.560
You turned back to normal!

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.100
Well, that was a big waste of time.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.950
I-I'm really sorry!

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.960
I mean, if you're not embarrassed 
when you're transformed,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.500
then why don't you just stay 
in that form like you used to?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.510
But then it wouldn't be the real me.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.380
What are you talking about?

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.010
It doesn't matter what form 
you take. You're always Grey.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.130
Gauche...

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.080
You're so amazing, Sis!

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.670
You can activate your spells 
way faster than before!

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.720
It's still not enough.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:06.450
This isn't enough to face the threat of 
the Spade Kingdom, let alone the devil!

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.100
Next! All five of you come at me at onc—

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.480
I guess I can't even call 
this training anymore.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.480
All right, let's take a break.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.560
It's rough not having any time off,

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.240
but we definitely need to train for this 
upcoming battle with the Spade Kingdom.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.250
We need to do our best right now 
to protect the Clover Kingdom.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.630
Captain! We look forward to you whipping 
us into shape in the afternoon, too!

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.560
I intend to do just that.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.520
Just be careful not to injure yourselves.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.010
Yes, ma'am!

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.750
Everyone is enthusiastic 
about their training.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.600
They may be livelier now that I've eased the 
restrictions on their interactions with men.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.840
I can't wait to go out on dates with 
my boyfriend as soon as this whole mess

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.600
with the Spade Kingdom and the devil is done.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.240
Me, too! We're gonna go 
out on dates every day!

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.360
I guess we'll just have 
to get stronger first.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.450
Aw, no fair. I broke up 
with my boyfriend recently.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.800
What? Did you dump him,
or did he dump you?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.330
He dumped me...

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.950
I see... Well, you've both been busy.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.650
Yeah, that's rough.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.560
But nothing good comes of dwelling on 
the past, so move on to the next one!

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.250
Yeah! One of my boyfriend's friends is single,
 so let's all go drinking together soon.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.050
I can't get over it that quickly...

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:27.150
W-Well, regardless of their motives,
 their enthusiasm is good.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.250
Don't worry!

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.470
Yeah, it's no big deal.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.470
I must lead them.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.730
You guys talking about romance again?
 You're all helpless!

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.060
What's so good about hanging out with men?

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.000
Of course, Captain Charlotte,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.540
you'll be going out with Captain Yami 
once this is all over, right?

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.570
What's wrong, Captain?

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.810
E-Er, it's nothing.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.190
By the way, Captain, have there 
been any developments since?

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.360
What do you mean by developments?

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.620
Oh, come on! I'm talking about your 
romance with Captain Yami, of course!

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.920
Yeah! Were you able to go on 
any dates after our mixer?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.580
M-Mixer...

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.120
That was so much fun!

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.510
I think Captain Yami just 
needed one more push!

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.400
Don't be absurd!

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.810
No, no, you were going in the 
right direction, Captain.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.300
If the Angel of Love, Puli Angel, says so,
 then it must be true, Captain!

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.310
Yeah.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.730
Really? Is that true?

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.360
So, Captain, you are going out on 
dates with Captain Yami, aren't you?

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.970
Of course I'm not!

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.280
What?!

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.280
Though, in truth...

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.780
After our last captains' meeting,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.670
I wanted to ask him to dinner, 
and prepared a little gift to give him.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.230
But I just couldn't give it to him.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.290
Well, duh! Sis shines more on the 
battlefield than in any dumb relationship!

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.170
We need to prepare for the threat of 
the Spade Kingdom and the devil right now.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.220
Non, non! This is the perfect time to strike!

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.950
Everyone is on edge because 
of the upcoming battle.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.230
That's why everyone needs 
a little extra love.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.230
I know I mentioned that 
I want to go out on a date

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.290
with my boyfriend once this is all over,

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.170
but we go on dates occasionally anyway.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.840
I haven't seen mine, 
but we've been chatting through our

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.320
magic communication items every night.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.740
Seriously...

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.530
And now is a once in a lifetime chance.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.210
What's that supposed to mean?

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.030
When a man and a woman share a 
sense of impending danger together,

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.430
they become closer!

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.800
Now that we're facing the impending 
danger of the Spade Kingdom

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.540
and the devil, it's the perfect chance.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.340
You can't be serious.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.450
Anyway, this is the 
opportune chance for love!

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.840
If you use it wisely...

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.680
I can't let a man save me.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.090
What are you talking about? 
You save me all the time.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:42.890
Huh?

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.740
My love for you is what 
keeps me going all the time.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.150
Yami...

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.900
Charlotte, I want...

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.710
to start a family with you.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.700
Of course!

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.590
And then the two get 
married and lived happ—

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.870
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.690
That's not happening!

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.250
But it could!

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.500
Even so, losing our next battle wouldn't mean
 facing mere anxiety or a sense of danger.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.940
We would be dead.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.050
To avoid that, we must train!

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.050
I'm sure you're all plenty rested now!

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.380
Captain Charlotte is amazing.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.890
I guess she doesn't let love get in the way.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.350
We need to work hard so this 
danger can pass quicker!

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.150
Sol, Puli, Selena, Galgaria...

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.480
All of you, attack me at once!

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.780
All right! Here we go, Sis!

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.070
Stone Creation Magic: Stone Rain!

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.840
Water Creation Magic: Cascade Destroyer!

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.210
Earth Magic: Mud Wall Partition!

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.680
No!

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.050
Galgar—

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.430
Crap! I won't make it in ti—

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.530
Our captain is so dazzling. 
She fights so elegantly.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.270
I'm sure Captain Yami loves this, too.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:12.900
Huh?

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.410
Damn it! I thought I had a chance!

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.590
Everything must be according to her plans!

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.970
Our captain is amazing.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.290
Let's do our best not to hold her back.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.460
The four of you can rest a while. 
The other seven of you, attack me at once.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.260
What do you think?

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.220
What?! We can't do that!

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.770
No, we totally can.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.810
It'll serve as training for us, too.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.360
And we'll be supporting 
Captain Charlotte, too.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.390
It's two birds with one stone!

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.950
What in the world are they discussing?

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.110
Are they coming up with a strategy 
for attacking me all at once?

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.680
Say, Captain. We have a suggestion.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.010
What is it?

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.910
This is difficult to say,

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:06.300
but we don't think we can be worthy 
training partners for you.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.910
I wouldn't say that.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:14.380
Even when the whole group of us attack, 
we still aren't any match for you.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.840
Stop being so pathetic in front of Sis!

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.260
But it's true.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.340
So we were wondering if we should 
maybe train with another squad.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.140
Train with another squad?

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.210
For example, if we were to 
train with the Black Bulls,

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.930
I think we could all find 
worthy training partners.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:31.730
Whut?!

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.160
They seem to have a mix 
of the best and the worst,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.730
so they should be worthy opponents.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.570
Captain, could you officially 
request a joint training session?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:45.370
I-I see... Well, I don't know 
if they'll accept, but...

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.700
I'll find the right moment to ask.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.920
Captain Charlotte, do you have a moment?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.290
I'm free.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.130
If you're busy training, 
I can call at another time.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.690
Well, we were just 
discussing the possibility

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.160
of a joint training session 
with the Black Bulls.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.430
What did you need?

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.880
I'd like to confirm the date 
for the next captains' meeting.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.730
I'm assuming your plans haven't changed?

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.640
Correct.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.000
Understood. Please excuse me.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.710
All right. For now, we're going 
to continue doing what we can.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.840
We can worry about the joint 
training session later.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.770
Right!

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.310
Joint training with the Black Bulls...

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.660
I wonder if he'll be suspicious... 
No, this is merely training.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.880
Yes, this is for survival. 
To help us defeat the enemy...

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.530
Why're you just standing there?

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.760
Ya—

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.010
This is it, Charlotte. Ask Yami if he'd 
agree to the joint training session.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.450
I guess even the Spiny Prickly Queen
 trips sometimes, huh?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.230
I got to see something rare today.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.560
Seriously? Again?

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.160
You're shattering my sensitive, 
fragile heart of glass here.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.370
Other than the Captain of the
 Blue Rose Knights, everyone is present.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.410
So Charlotte's late?

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.930
She arrived late to the 
Star Festival with Yami.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.630
I wonder what happened this time.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.710
By the way, it seems the Blue Rose Knights are

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.850
trying to plan a joint training 
session with the Black Bulls.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.760
Perhaps this is related.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:33.640
A joint training session, huh? 
Hey, I just had a great idea.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.640
Huh?

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.420
The kingdom's citizens are still

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.650
emotionally and physically exhausted 
from the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attacks.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.550
I can't deny that.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.030
I'm sure they're worried about whether 
the royal family can protect them or not.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:51.940
We need to reassure them that the Magic 
Knights have the strength to protect them,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.210
and raise the morale of the captains 
and Magic Knights, too.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:00.040
So that we can face the impending threat 
of the Spade Kingdom and the devil.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.440
Um... If I may, what exactly 
are you planning to do?

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.190
I'm going to have the 
captains fight each other.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.450
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 151:

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 151
 Clash! The Battle of the Magic Knights Squad Captains!"

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.810
