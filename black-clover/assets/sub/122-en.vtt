WEBVTT

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.740
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demon.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.370
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.790
His name was Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.800
He would eventually be called the first 
Wizard King, and he became a legend.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.740
As Pitch Black as It Gets

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.770
Town in the Common Realm, Nean

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.770
What? To the royal capital again?

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.770
Yes. I do apologize, as I realize 
she just came back, but...

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.860
Here is the order.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.740
It appears to be real, but...

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.550
Do not worry.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.270
We'll make sure she gets there safely.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.460
As soon as Marie returns from battle,
she's summoned to the capital again?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.020
Theresa Rapual

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.020
Neige

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.020
What could the Magic Parliament want with her?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.340
Sister Theresa!

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.880
What's the matter, Rebecca?

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.860
Rebecca Scarlet

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.340
There's trouble. Here, look at today's paper.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.600
Church, Hage Village

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.450
Th-Th-The paper...

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.600
Orsi Orfai

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.390
Asta's in the paper!

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.500
Lily Aquaria

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.050
"Rebelling Against the Kingdom... 
A Minion of the Devil"?!

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.450
This must be some kind of mistake!

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.030
The Royal Capital, Clover Kingdom

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.090
So that peasant brat 
finally became a criminal!

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.060
Revchi

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.060
Gueldre Poizot

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.110
Sucks to be him!

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.460
Ooh!

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.780
Does that mean Asta will have to work here, too?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.980
Sally

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.850
That means I get to dissect him, right?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.160
I mean, he promised me that I could.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.470
Rades Spirito

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.470
Hell if I know!

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.830
Jeez, why are you so angry?

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.390
I'm not angry!

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.620
Your blood is always boiling.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.940
I know. Maybe if I took some 
of your blood, that'd help.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.810
I'll just dissect you!

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.430
Don't!

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.250
Why do I have to do this, anyway?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.270
Hey, what the hell is going on, Valtos?!

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.630
Valtos

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.380
Don't ask me.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.850
You're the one who followed me.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.880
I just decided that I would atone for my sins.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.690
Damn it!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.440
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises
Jack the Ripper

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.420
Shut it! Start yappin' again and 
I'll slice you, criminals!

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.930
You already did!

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.220
Are you trying to kill us?!

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.180
You bastard!

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.570
Of course I am!

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.530
If I'd had my way, I would've turned you all
into sliced ham while you were roaming free!

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.880
Go ahead and run! That'd give me
an excuse to slice you up!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.150
You can't be serious! You look more 
like a criminal than any of us!

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.280
I'm gonna control your corpse one day!

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.840
I'll tie you up in chains!

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.060
Shut up!

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.940
Asta...

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.210
This is... Are they trying to make Asta 
take the blame for everything we did?

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.350
Damnatio from the Magic Parliament
 just might do that.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.590
They say that he judged his own father before.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.930
He's the scale of justice that will 
cruelly judge any crime for the sake of

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.220
the kingdom and the law.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.670
So Asta's up against the jurisdiction 
of this kingdom itself.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.490
If anyone defies it, their entire
 clan will be punished.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.230
Magic Parliament Courthouse

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.150
That form is truly...

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.320
It's just as the legends describe.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.690
He's a devil!

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.970
So you've shown your true self,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.160
you devil!

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.930
I'm able to go into my black form quicker now.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.770
After that last fight, I've managed
 to make it more my own.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.520
Asta...

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.590
Don't you worry, Marie. I'll protect you.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.540
Okay.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.680
Everyone, listen!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.500
It's okay! I'm able to control this power now!

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.520
I won't attack any of you!

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.850
Like we can actually believe you!

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.220
You're possessed by a devil!

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.910
How grotesque!

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.320
How horrifying!

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.020
You're a filthy peasan
 who's made a deal with the devils!

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.820
Give him death!

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.060
I knew he was nothing more than trash.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.260
A devil...

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.390
Nothing is more suitable than the death 
penalty for peasant filth like him.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.180
Bah-ha?! The death penalty?!

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.280
Please! Listen to me!

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.820
Kill him! Before he brings
misfortune upon the kingdom!

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.220
Sentence him to death immediately!

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.160
Give yourself up.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.530
Even if you were able to defeat me
and escape from here,

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.060
you'd just become a fugitive.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.940
There's nowhere for you to run.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.060
And if that were to happen,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.210
the ones who raised you in the church 
will probably suffer, too.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.250
You should be convicted right here, right now.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.330
By having someone as 
dangerous as you disappear,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.700
that little girl, as well as many 
Magic Knights, will be saved.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:48.380
There is no one in this place nor this kingdom
who can or will save you right now.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.540
You sow calamity over everyone you touch.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.680
You are evil.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.950
What's going on?!

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.590
What is the meaning of this?!

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:19.120
Man... I knew you guys would be 
doing whatever the hell you wanted.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.790
I was told the trial would 
be two days from now.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.800
I don't give a rat's ass 
if that kid is evil or not.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.950
He's definitely a badass junior of mine that

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.300
I've acknowledged as a real man's man.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.810
He's my precious friend.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.060
I can't let you kill him right here.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.020
What do you think you're 
doing to my best friend?

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.530
Do you all want to get cursed to death?

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.830
I've transformed into him,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.070
so I know that he's always bold, and I'd
 love to be as persistent as he is.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.030
He's... really, really... nice...

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.580
and... a good... boy.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.110
Losing you would make Marie sad,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.980
so I guess I don't mind 
saving you along with her.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.080
Also, get your paws off Marie!

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.740
He may be a boy,

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.270
but he's a very brave young man that

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.720
makes even the cruelest fates
 bounce off of him.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.550
He makes me look good as his senior, 
and I couldn't ask for a better partner!

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.060
I still need him to live 
longer and eat more noms!

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.440
He's a stupid little shrimp,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.020
but I don't mind conceding a little bit

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.610
and saying he's pretty close to 
what a true Magic Knight should be.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.980
He's stupid, loud, and reckless,

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.820
but as royalty, I acknowledge him 
as someone this kingdom needs!

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.830
N-Not that there's any deeper meaning to that.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.500
How about you guys give back...

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.490
...Asta now?

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.510
The Black Bulls...

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.090
Wh-What in the world is that giant thing?

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.490
Th-The Black Bulls?

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.440
How dare you disturb this honorable 
trial with such violence?!

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.890
Yami Sukehiro...

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:15.820
You're defending the criminal 
that started this great war?

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.490
Do you know what will happen to the 
Black Bulls because of this decision?

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.120
Oh, you didn't know?

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.870
We're pretty much the worst Magic 
Knight squad ever to exist.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.860
Both those guys there with the 
horns belong to our squad.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.080
Me?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.970
If you're gonna mess with them,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.770
we'll be scoundrels or rebels 
or whatever, you jackass!

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.110
Guys...

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.620
That aside, I'm gonna punish 
anyone who dares to touch Marie.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.870
B-Big Brother! Now's not the time for that!

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.800
How stupid can you be to come 
out and get caught like this?

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.310
How many times to do you intend 
to almost die, Stupidsta?!

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.850
Even death couldn't fix his stupidity.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.880
At least die fighting me!

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.630
When you die is the day I die!

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.700
How dare you hold Marie? Die, Asta.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.570
Wait, didn't you come to save me?!

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.390
Big Brother, stop!

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.370
Apparently, even death couldn't 
fix his sister complex.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.970
Hey, guy from the royal Kira family or whatever.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.450
Looks like you took real good 
care of two of my squad members.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.200
Don't worry about me. Just take
 Asta and get out of here!

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.150
I'm not even from this era, and I'm no longer 
really human because of the forbidden magic.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.300
I basically used you to complete my mission.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.720
You've really got some nerve, saying that 
after spending so much time at our place.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.980
You've been watching us this whole time,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.720
but apparently, you've still got no clue.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.020
I heard all about you.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.340
You were being badass in the 
form of a bird for 500 years?

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.900
That's pretty awesome.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:22.700
It... must... have... been... really... 
lonely... all... by... yourself.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.620
I know that feeling all too well.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.160
We'd love to have another 
cute girl like you!

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.230
You were working hard in the shadows.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.440
We'd probably get along really well.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.480
Be my friend.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.170
Actually, we've been best 
friends since the day I was born.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.050
Y-Yes!

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.330
Now you get to enjoy life 
along with all of us.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.640
Just make sure you eat tons!

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.830
Thank goodness I didn't eat 
you when you were a bird.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.640
You were planning on eating her?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.650
Nothing will change about 
the Black Bulls if we have

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.450
another weirdo like yourself.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.320
For me, your ki is really familiar,

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.290
and we've already got plenty of weirdos.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.960
This is...

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.700
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.650
I'll go with you!

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.150
Yeah, we're basically as pitch black as it gets!

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.530
That's...

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.410
Us, the Black Bulls!

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.420
Apparently, you don't understand at all.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.130
Even if you protect that devil's minions,

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.920
it won't change the situation.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.550
Cause all the fuss you want here,
but it won't clear the boy's name.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.310
It's actually just going to worsen 
the charges of him being a devil.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.810
Apparently, you're all very emotional, 
but that won't save this kingdom.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.480
You cannot change the minds of 
all the nobles gathered here.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.840
They're still leaning toward 
bewilderment and suspicion.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.370
And even if they were to rampage...

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.250
Scale Magic: Scale Regulate!

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.800
La! My magic's getting smaller!

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:49.620
My scale magic measures one's abilities,
 balances them, and establishes order.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.560
No matter how powerful your magic is,
it's impossible to defy it.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.870
But Rouge hasn't disappeared.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.310
Meaning he can't lay a finger on us!

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:05.320
And we have a boy who can
make the impossible possible!

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.070
Demon-Destroyer Sword: Fate Release!

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.790
He erased my magic's effect!

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.790
Gotcha!

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.110
Oh, are they...

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.890
You're as reckless as ever, foreigner.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.350
What were you planning to do after this?

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.600
Eh, I just got a little worked up.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.290
Though it appears you meant to miss.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:46.400
Honestly... Even if this 
was for your squad members,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.210
you couldn't make a worse impression.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.360
Though thanks to that, we made it in time.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.050
What the hell is that big dragon?!

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.370
You really did power up when you came back!

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.630
Captain Fuegoleon... Captain Nozel!

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.630
Why...

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.930
We can't afford to lose 
any capable Magic Knights.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.180
In other words, the people

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.760
who acknowledge you aren't 
limited to any rank or class.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.890
Nozel! Captain Fuegoleon!

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.410
Two royal members of the Magic Knights...

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.640
What's the meaning of this?

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.500
But what are you going to do now?

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.650
We have a mission from the Wizard King.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.070
The Black Bulls Magic Knights Squad

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.460
is tasked with locating and
investigating the devils.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.330
Huh?

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.450
Prove your innocence with your own hands.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.080
I see.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:50.130
Royals have authority here, 
so he had Nozel and Fuegoleon,

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.330
two royals, deliver the order.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.350
Can that geriatric kid see 
the future or something?

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.070
Curse you, Julius!

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.850
You were missing when we 
really needed you,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.850
and now you go stepping on my toes again!

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:09.210
So I guess that means Asta 
won't be executed immediately.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.860
Ba-hank goodness...

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.030
While Asta is on this mission,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.870
the Wizard King and Magic Knights will 
take full responsibility for him.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:23.540
By making it look as though the brat's 
being dealt with by the Magic Knights,

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.540
they're given the leeway 
to prove their innocence.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.550
So, uh, er... Wait, what does that mean?

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:38.010
We're gonna go investigate the devils 
so we can clear that name of yours!

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.770
And break the curse of the forbidden magic, too.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.980
Investigating the devils?

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.130
But that doesn't resolve anything...

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.090
It's an order from the Wizard King.
 He wouldn't be too foolhardy.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.100
I mean, two royal captains of the 
Magic Knights are vouching for him.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.910
And the Wizard King says 
he'll take responsibility.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.790
Apparently, I weighed the trust 
people have in you too lightly.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.070
But know that you'll be

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.290
executed immediately if you prove 
to have no use to the kingdom.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.610
You're still hanging in the balance.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.530
Let us go.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.470
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.290
Marie... Thank goodness you're safe.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.480
Big Brother!

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.710
I told you not to attack Asta!

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.400
M-Marie?!

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.410
Um... Nozel...

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.670
Thank you very much.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.160
Do not thank me. Thank the Wizard King.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.790
I will.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.540
Asta, take this.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.310
Huh?!

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.050
What was that?

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.960
Now we'll know where you are.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.060
This way, you can't flee.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.310
Like I would actually try to flee!

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.820
We know.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.880
But putting up a front is necessary at times.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.190
Do you understand?

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.280
Yes, sir.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.950
Good for you, Asta.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.020
Jeez, don't worry us like that!

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.540
Go on. Eat up!

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.380
And drink up, too.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.540
Want more?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.360
I'll feed you myself, my dear friend.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.950
Asta...

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.570
You dumbass.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.550
Uh... Um... Um...

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.680
I-I'm gonna die!

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.670
Come in.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.490
Pardon me.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.500
Hello, Damnatio.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.820
So you're trying to take on everything again,
 despite what you've been reduced to.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.580
Both what happened with the Magic Knights,
 as well as the boy possessed by a devil.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.140
That order was smart thinking, wasn't it?

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.330
Now no one will get punished.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.590
Of course, that's how it should be, 
since Asta never did anything wrong.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.190
I'm sure that the Black Bulls will be 
able to find some clues about the devils.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.600
That'll make up for them 
barging into the trial, too.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.740
Forgiving them means taking responsibility.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.270
The kingdom can't take that 
kind of responsibility.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.860
You can't take on that 
responsibility yourself, either.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.570
I didn't forgive them. I left it in their hands.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.160
It's not about responsibility. 
It's about trusting them.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.900
Eventually, I'm sure your scales will 
tip in favor of Asta and his group.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.670
It appears that you haven't changed 
at all inside. I'm relieved.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.550
The distortions in this country...

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.660
The crisis we're facing is not a small one.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.350
If the kingdom is about to fall,
 I'll have to pass judgment.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.560
On that boy, and even you.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.830
Pardon me.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.630
Master Julius!

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.660
Hey there, Marx.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.450
Feeling better already?

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.700
You're alive, but you're little...

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.210
You're little, but you're alive...

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.430
Huh? Wha... I...

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.710
I'm fine, but... What? What's going on?

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.350
You were always like a child...

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.650
And now, you really are a child.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.270
So, yeah, this...

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.900
You don't need to explain!

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.140
Just show me your memories later.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:01.030
The kingdom is in trouble, 
and that form of yours is...

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.530
Honestly...

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.510
You're such a ridiculous person...

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.750
I'm s-so glad...

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.860
you're alive.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.960
I'm sorry for always worrying you, Marx.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.590
No, I'm not forgiving you!

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.640
Huh?

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.630
There's a mountain of work waiting for you!

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.290
Wait...

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.640
There are plenty of problems 
we need you to solve.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.060
What?!

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.530
Petit Clover

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.650
Petit Clover!

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:12.030
There's Trouble!

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.670
There's Trouble!

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.490
Sister Theresa!

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.040
What's the matter, Rebecca?

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.500
There's trouble. Here, look at today's paper.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.000
Th-This is...

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.630
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha...

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.630
Th-This is...

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.310
Th-This is...

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.730
All you people just keep saying, "This is..."

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.010
This is... <i>what</i>?!

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.060
Nice, I say!

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.100
On that day, five hundred years ago,

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.480
the tragedy between the humans 
and the elves happened.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.900
And it was all caused by a devil.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:54.030
