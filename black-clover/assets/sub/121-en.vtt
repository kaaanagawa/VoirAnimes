00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.750
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demon.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.370
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.790
His name was Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.290
He would eventually be called the first 
Wizard King, and he became a legend.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.360
Heya. I somehow survived.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.390
Though I'm a bit smaller now.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.350
Yami...

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.770
I leave the rest to you...

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.650
Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, no. You definitely died.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.470
That was definitely leading up to you dying.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.160
That was, like, your end.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.500
Weren't you leaving everything 
to me or something?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.780
Could you give me back my determination?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.380
Yami, you're being a bit scary.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.710
Sorry I was so useless when the 
kingdom was in such danger.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.840
I thought my magic would kick in sooner, but...

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.300
Magic?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.440
It's probably about thirteen years' worth...

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.720
I'd stored time into a certain magic item.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.350
I had to take a bet on whether 
it'd actually activate or not.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.970
Damn it...

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.060
You're such a crazy old man.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.570
But I got to see your face when 
I thought I never would again.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.070
I guess that's not so bad.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.300
Master Julius...

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.530
I... I...

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.620
William Vangeance. No matter 
what the reason may have been,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.790
betraying the kingdom is a grave crime.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.060
Many were hurt,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.670
and it will take time for 
everyone to recover.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.670
I'm not going to let you 
sit idle during that time.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
Wait, aren't you going kinda easy on him?

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.060
After everything he did, 
you're not gonna punish him at all?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.780
Well, I'm the one who invited 
William into the Magic Knights

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.450
and appointed him as a captain.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.820
I'm responsible for what happened, too...

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.450
and for losing against the 
other soul that was in him,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.060
the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.730
William, I'm sure there will 
be those who resent you

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.420
for being a part of all of this.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.100
But I know how much you suffered, too.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.020
Do you have the resolve to 
withstand that hatred and proceed?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.210
I pledge my grimoire once again 
to you, and to the kingdom.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.900
This time, for good.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.150
For crying out loud, this guy...

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.450
He may have shrunk, but he 
hasn't changed one bit.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.760
Three Problems

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.790
Now, then...

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.790
All of you worked very hard.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.730
The battle has ended, and now 
we can live happily ever after.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.550
Or so I'd like to say,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.590
but currently, we have three problems.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.950
Who is this guy? He called 
us here out of the blue.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.190
He's just a kid.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.430
What a snotty little brat.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.430
I swear I've sensed this 
mana somewhere before...

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.420
Captain Yami! This ki... Don't tell me he's...

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.780
The first problem.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.470
The Wizard King is gone.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.000
He's standing right here.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.530
That's you, remember?

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.860
What?!

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.530
What?! I knew it!

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.700
Most of my magic is now gone.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.850
This is all that's left of my grimoire,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.850
which means I won't be able to fight,

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.930
and my influence on the hard-line 
monarchist nobles who prioritize the wealth

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.840
and power of this kingdom 
has been weakened.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.010
Ooh, me! Me, me, me!

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.100
How did you get so small, and why 
are you alive, Wizard King?!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.860
Mister Energy really doesn't hold back at all.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.650
Well, you see, during my 
incognito wanderings, I found

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.560
magic storage technology left 
behind by some ancient mages.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.060
According to some documents 
I found in the castle's library,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.100
it's called Swallowtail.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.750
My time magic and Swallowtail 
were very compatible.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.980
I stored my time and magic into the 
emblem on my forehead little by little.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.760
Time that would let me start over 
in case something happened to me.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.010
But I didn't get to start over immediately,
 and I only made it as far as this age.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.730
Guess things don't always go as planned.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.970
Uh, this is plenty. You don't 
usually get do-overs in life.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.030
You're insane, you old man 
who looks like a kid.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.490
Secré! We did it!

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.450
We've finally completed our first prototype!

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.850
We're now one step closer

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.790
to the peaceful, fair world that 
you so long to create, Your Highness.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.730
It's all thanks to you, Secré.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.300
You seem to think that your magic 
isn't useful, but that's not true.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.380
Your Highness...

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.130
I came up with a name for this magic item...

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.210
But it's still a secret, Secré Swallowtail.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.400
My prince, our magic item 
has survived all this time

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.700
and saved the life of someone 
who carries on your legacy.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.250
I'm just so glad that 
you're alive, Wizard King!

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.670
Thank you. I see that you're 
as lively as ever, Asta.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.710
I heard you did a great job yet again.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.830
I did my best! But I've 
still got a long way to go!

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.020
As for Noelle and Mimosa,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.730
I can imagine how much you must
have risked your own lives

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.310
in this endeavor just by how 
much your mana has grown.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.300
Yes, sir!

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.310
And as for our guest that 
I don't recognize...

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.690
What kind of magic do you use?!

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.820
My many years of incognito 
wandering tell me

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.560
you definitely use some unique kind of magic!

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.870
Yeah, yeah. Get on with 
your explanation already.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.810
We need to hurry out there 
and help the others.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.950
Sorry about that.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.560
I see the Wizard King hasn't changed.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.970
He sure hasn't.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.660
He's definitely the same.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.420
So what's the remaining two 
of these three problems?

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.140
I'm trying to keep those two 
secret as much as possible.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.800
But I predict that, at this rate,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.310
the Clover Kingdom will be destroyed 
by the surrounding countries.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.180
You mean...

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.440
The Diamond Kingdom and the other ones?!

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.180
Or Asta dies.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.190
What?!

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.690
Asta?!

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.480
Wh-Why, though?!

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.240
Wait, why is either the Clover Kingdom 
going to be destroyed or I just die?!

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.550
Or it could even be both.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.350
His predictions are pretty spot-on, too.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.990
Sucks to be you, kid. Namu.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.160
Why are we going forward with me dying?!

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
What the heck is going on, Wizard King?!

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.790
Asta, a devil is the source of your black power.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.760
A d-devil?

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.790
Just like that creepy, black guy?

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.510
I mean, when I use my black 
powers, it feels similar, but...

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.020
A devil?

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.850
So that form Asta takes...

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.690
It really was similar to the one Granny 
told us about when we were kids.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.970
Is your body okay using powers like that?

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.820
I'm totally fine! Though my whole 
body hurts like hell afterward!

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.700
I wouldn't call that fine, Asta.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.240
A devil? Wow, talk about creepy. Gross.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.500
Back off, man.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.710
Captain Yami! You don't know how much 
your words can hurt people sometimes!

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.560
Your black horn is proof that humans 
ventured into a forbidden realm

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.870
and involved themselves in 
a world beyond this one.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.200
It's a curse known as weg.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.370
There appear to be other 
Magic Knights who have similar curses.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.560
Other than me?

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.020
U-Um...

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.070
A world beyond ours?

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.820
I don't have all the details, but it's
 said that the devils live there.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.820
And the five-leaf grimoire that 
one devil failed to obtain

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.620
has another devil inhabiting it.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.290
You're...

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.170
So your horns are...

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.690
Five hundred years ago,

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.030
I fell under the curse of forbidden 
magic in order to seal the devil.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.650
The curse and my magic mingled,
 and this happened.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.450
I can switch forms as I choose now.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.730
Nero's talking! How adorable!

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.510
That's amazing! This seems different 
from transformation magic!

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.110
So you're sealing yourself 
into the form of that bird!

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.210
To think the penalty for 
forbidden magic would overlap with

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.000
unusual magic to produce a result like this.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.490
Ancient magic is truly fascinating!

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.540
Uh, so, Wizard King... 
What's this about m-me dying?!

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.750
Is the devil going to explode or something?!

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.450
Oh, sorry about that.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.300
First, there are three kingdoms 
surrounding the Clover Kingdom.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.440
There's Diamond, an aggressor 
kingdom that has a powerful army

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:06.530
Aggressor Kingdom
Diamond

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.920
thanks to their magic scholars, and has 
no problem with experimenting on humans.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.610
Heart is an unseen, neutral kingdom 
of mystery that takes in and uses

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:16.130
Kingdom of Mystery
Heart

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.470
its abundant natural mana, 
perfecting its own unique magic.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.040
And then there's the Spade Kingdom.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:25.180
Demon Kingdom
Spade

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.460
A kingdom of winter, mysteries, and demons
 that is served by the ancient evils

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.950
that sleep in its vast, frigid land, 
and is attempting to gain supremacy.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.600
Like Diamond, our immediate neighbor,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:36.130
Spade Kingdom

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:36.130
Diamond
 Kingdom

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:36.130
Clover Kingdom

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.250
the Spade Kingdom is attempting 
to extend its influence across

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.130
Heart
 Kingdom

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.190
the strong magic region that separates us.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.280
But currently, the Magic Knights 
that defend our kingdom

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.300
have grown exhausted like never before.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.640
Not only that, but some turned against us,

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.050
even if just for a moment, 
because of the reincarnations.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.060
That currently puts them on shaky ground.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.470
Not to mention what Julius 
looks like right now.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.020
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.530
It wasn't any of their faults, though!

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.900
They were taken over by elves!

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.410
Or rather, it was all because of 
that "Hur hur hur" devil guy!

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.910
Which means we need people to know that

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.410
they were just being 
manipulated by that devil!

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:16.420
Exactly. And so the Magic Parliament 
will probably put the power

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.810
of your devil on trial to find it guilty.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.480
After all, a peasant who uses the 
powers of an unknown devil as you do

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.510
is a perfect scapegoat to 
take the fall for everyone.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.390
No way! But I haven't done anything wrong!

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.210
What the heck's this Magic Parliament, anyway?!

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.270
You seriously don't know about that?

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.610
The Magic Parliament is made up of 
royalty and nobles who create laws

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.350
and conduct trials for significant crimes.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.030
They are one of the highest 
authorities in this kingdom.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.810
And one of the three great royal 
families stands at its center.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.050
The House of Kira.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.960
The current king's royal family, 
which has the most authority.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.720
Well done! Excellent work protecting me!

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.890
Member of the Green Praying Mantises,
 Sekke Bronzazza!

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.710
Bah-ha?

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.690
You're only a commoner, 
but you did fine work!

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:28.520
So this is what Julius meant when he 
said that even the lowliest had potential!

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.070
The Green Praying Mantises Squad 
is nothing but commoners,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:37.040
and your captain is downright psychotic, 
so I never liked him, but well done!

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.540
What the heck's going on?

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.840
All hell broke loose in the royal capital,

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.710
so I was trying to get the hell out...

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.550
Bah-ha?! The king?!

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.620
Y-Y-Y-You're not dead, are you?!

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.350
This isn't my fault, is it?!

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.310
So this all just happened by coincidence.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.270
Your Majesty...

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:03.610
With my newly-awakened, true powers,
 it was a piece of cake!

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.430
Such a brave young lad!

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.990
My luck's been crap ever since I met 
that brat at the Entrance Exam,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.710
but now, my comeback success 
story is about to start!

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.110
That's the star I was born under!

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.210
There he is.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.170
There's a Magic Knight with him,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.050
but he's a low-ranking one
that won't give us any problems.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.430
Augustus Kira, we've come for you life!

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.310
Who the hell are you?!

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.310
Wait... What the hell, bah-ha?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.110
You don't need to know that.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.130
This will all be blamed on the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun, anyway.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.990
Die!

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.990
I have no idea what's going on...

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.500
But I'm counting on you, Sekke!

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.300
Bah-ha?!

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.490
I barely have any magic left!

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.270
My magic... it shrank!

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.380
You anti-monarchist nobles,

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.760
taking advantage of the kingdom and 
castle's crisis to harm the king...

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.180
You...

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.740
are evil.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.140
Kneel!

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.770
What the hell kind of magic is that?!

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.700
I can't... move.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.030
You're... from the House of Kira.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.360
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.490
I certainly am not all right, Damnatio!

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.330
My clothes are filthy!

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.090
Speaking of filthy, this reaction...

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.830
So it finally appeared.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.050
In the name of the royal family... 
In the name of justice...

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:47.460
Damnatio Kira

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.460
I swear I will condemn you,

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.370
devil-possessed wretch!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.970
Several days later,

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.440
the royal capital, after being 
destroyed by the elves' attack,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.800
was steadily being rebuilt under the 
leadership of Fuegoleon and Nozel.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.310
Smiles were finally returning 
to the people's faces.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.940
And as for Asta and the others...

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:13.820
Come on, eat up! Miz Charmy's 
food will recover your mana, too!

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.260
You must be Asta!

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:21.650
I heard you did great in the battle the 
other day! I'm honored to meet you!

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.900
Nah, it wasn't that big of a deal.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.250
Wait, who are you?

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.090
Oh, I do apologize.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.420
I work with the Magic Parliament.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.680
Hey, those are the guys the 
Wizard King mentioned.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.250
Would you mind testifying before us 
about what happened during the battle?

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.890
We want to know the truth.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.420
The truth?

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.310
That's our duty, after all.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.620
Ah, the mysterious maiden!

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.460
You should also join us 
and tell us what happened.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.970
Okay, let's go, Nero!

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:53.970
What?

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.280
Asta, wait. What are you—

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.540
It'll be fine! They seem like 
a bunch of reasonable guys.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.040
Besides, we'll be the best ones 
to explain what happened

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.790
with the elves and the devil,

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.070
and how the reincarnation 
spell was broken.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:16.890
Magic Parliament Courthouse

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.770
Please step inside.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.640
I'm getting super nervous!

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.930
Your position is compromised 
because of your black power.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.710
Don't let your guard down.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.710
We managed to get through to the elves.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.900
We'll be able to work this out 
as long as we get to talk.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.650
What the heck is this?!

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.540
Who is that?

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.220
He's so vulgar and rowdy.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.950
Who knows what he would do 
if we didn't handcuff him?

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.000
The pillar of legislation and 
justice for the Clover Kingdom,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.540
the Magic Parliament.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.850
I am the chairman, Damnatio Kira,

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.140
and I shall pass judgment 
upon Asta of the Black Bulls.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.540
Th-This isn't what we talked about!

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.850
You're already treating me like a criminal!

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.350
Looks like we fell right into their trap.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.630
My eyes didn't deceive me.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.480
I knew that brat was up to no good.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.940
Precisely!

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.990
I don't know what he's guilty of,
 but take that, bah-ha!

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.690
And after I let you into the 
Royal Knights! You ungrateful wretch!

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.540
Asta of the Black Bulls...

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.540
From the church in Hage Village 
that lies in the Forsaken Realm.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.950
You are a peasant,

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.590
an orphan, and I cannot feel 
an ounce of magic from you.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.300
The Forsaken Realm?!

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.460
Goodness!

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.810
Filthy little peasant.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.720
And you, girl...

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.300
Hey... Those horns...

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.890
The kingdom has no record of her birth,

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.690
and her horns are proof that 
she has dabbled in forbidden magic.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.610
Forbidden?! How vile!

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.140
They testify that this disturbance 
was caused by a devil

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.610
who ensnared and controlled 
the Magic Knights.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.040
That's right!

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.160
The Magic Knights were possessed 
because of that devil!

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.140
D-Devil?!

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.940
Bah... ha? Uh, this is turning 
into a bigger mess than I expected.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.350
Peasants can't be trusted.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.460
How uncouth! He may be a Magic Knight,
 but he's from the Black Bulls.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.930
Aren't those horns a sign that 
she sold her soul to the devil?

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.310
That must be it!

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.850
Wizard King Julius worked so hard...

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.480
And yet there's still this much 
prejudice and discrimination.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.940
So much that it's dimming 
Asta's determination

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.980
to make us all understand each other.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.060
Their kind has always been the only 
kind of people that gather here.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.460
Hey, listen to me!

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.740
I'm not lying!

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:47.200
In this trial, either you were 
going to be convicted as a devil

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.760
or the Magic Knights were going to pay for 
their sins. Those were the only two options.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.750
And you can't abandon other people.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.690
The scales reveal that you are

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.760
simple, impulsive, and dealt with easily.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.310
A single peasant,

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.010
or the cornerstone of the 
kingdom's defense, the Magic Knights.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.060
It's obvious which way the scales will tip.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.770
I wonder where this devil 
that you speak of is.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.400
I told you! We defeated him!

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.070
Nero worked hard for so 
long to make it happen!

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.150
Everyone here suspects that you are

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.950
the ones who are truly in 
communication with the devil.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.690
No! The one in my grimoire is—

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.080
Anything you say right now 
will just get warped.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.820
Revealing the black power is too risky.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:41.340
If there is no devil, we'll just have 
to pass judgment on everyone in turn.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.750
Bring her in.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.100
Marie?!

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.100
Asta!

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.860
This is Marie Adlai.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.000
She was a daughter of the House of Adlai,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.270
but she is now a ruined noble 
who lives in a church with orphans.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.360
Her older brother is an ex-convict.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:09.220
We have determined that, during the 
recent great battle, her eye magic

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.870
caused indirect harm to 
Magic Knights and the citizenry.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.860
Quit making things up!

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.500
Marie didn't do any of that on purpose!

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.230
Indeed.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:24.010
If a devil truly exists, 
there's no doubt she was manipulated.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.410
But if there is no proof of that,

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.570
all that remains are her undeniable crimes.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.520
Therefore...

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.270
She must be judged!

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.060
In the name of justice!

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:41.650
Stop!

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.400
I-I'm...

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.150
You are evil.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:47.910
Guilty!

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.290
You've made it loud and 
clear how you operate.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.790
Look at him!

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:03.050
There's no way in hell I'm going 
to acknowledge your justice!

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:07.900
And we won't even attempt to reach 
an understanding with a devil.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.730
Damnatio tends to be very 
serious and stubborn,

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.610
so he probably won't let Asta 
off the hook that easily.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.610
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 122:
 "As Pitch Black as It Gets."

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 122
 As Pitch Black as It Gets

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.390
Hey, I have a great idea for how to save Asta!
