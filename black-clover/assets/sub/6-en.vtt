00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.320
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.140
The Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.430
Asta and Yuno were able to get through 
its grueling selection process.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.180
Wind Magic: Towering Tornado.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.070
Number 164.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.800
What?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.160
Seriously?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.260
All of the captains...

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.660
...raised their hands?!

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.450
Please allow me to join the Golden Dawn.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.620
Number 165...

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.790
No offers.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.010
Well, that's no surprise.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.100
And since you have no magical powers,
no one wants you.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.390
I'm still going to become 
the Wizard King someday!

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.070
You're funny, kid.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.320
Join my squad.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.800
Both Asta and Yuno successfully joined

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.290
the Magic Knights and took their first 
steps toward becoming the Wizard King.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.880
I'm Asta from Hage Village!
I'll be joining the Black Bulls tod—

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.510
Oh, dear...

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.180
Welcome to the absolute worst
Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.330
The Black Bulls

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.640
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.420
I know, yeah I know

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.480
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.900
I dreamed it all my life

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.430
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.450
Don't care how much I fall

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.010
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.320
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.490
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.870
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.130
Someday I will write the next page

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.630
You are my hope

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.380
Like that page from someday

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.720
I was able to meet you

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.680
I call this a miracle

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.620
So you're our new member this year?

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.780
What's your name?

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.570
It's Yuno.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.790
Hmph.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.500
I'm Klaus Lunettes.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.160
You're neither a royal nor a noble,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.620
but a peasant from the boonies, 
and he let you join our squad.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.510
What in the world is Captain 
Vangeance thinking?

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.690
Don't get a big head just because 
all the captains raised their hands

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.900
for you at the exam.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.980
You won't be accepted as a member 
of the Golden Dawn that easily.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.150
I'll see to it that you accept me soon.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.750
That's some mouth you have.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.710
I'm not done yet!

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.380
Now I'm pissed! You'd better be prepared!

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.590
I'm not... but let's do this!

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.930
Die!

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.550
Whee!

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.340
What's all the ruckus?

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.060
Ugh, I drank way too much. My head hurts.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.420
You're as adorable as an angel
again today, my little sister Marie.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.330
Keep it down, you morons!

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.260
I see they're at it again.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.250
They're at it again.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.860
Hey, that's dangerous!

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.270
They're scary...

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.630
B-But starting today, I'm also 
a member of the Black Bulls.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.970
I'm Asta from Hage Village!
It's a pleasure to meet all of you!

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.700
I'm gonna be the Wizard King!

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.440
That pudding you were 
saving sure was delicious.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.150
That's going to be your last supper!

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.520
That's enough, you two!

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.550
What if this ruckus you curs are causing 
wakes up my little sister, you dumbasses?!

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.120
Oh, shut up, sister lover!

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.150
I remember up to when I started a 
drinking contest with some old guy.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.300
Thanks!

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.380
They're not listening at all!

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.760
This is for my pudding!

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.540
Would you guys shut up?
You're not helping my headache!

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.580
Shut up, you booze-swilling hussy!

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.130
What'd you call me?!

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.900
You virgin delinquent!

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.540
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Who're you 
calling a virgin delinquent?!

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.830
Uh-oh! If you look away, 
I'm going to kill you.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.000
Just try and kill me!

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.060
I told you guys to shut up!

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.780
In the name of my angelic sister, 
Marie, I will kill you all!

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.140
All of you...

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.590
Stop breaking everything!

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.310
Yet he just destroyed the wall!

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.190
Captain!

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.200
Thanks for all your hard work, Mister Yami!

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.430
Captain, this is really good.
I'll give you half. I'm giving you half!

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.200
Do you have a moment, Captain?

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.200
Welcome back, Captain! Come on. 
Have a seat and drink with me.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.120
Mister Yami, did anyone get too uppity 
with you? If they did, I'll kill them!

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.360
Captain! Spar with me today!

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.290
Come on! With everything you've got!

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.260
C'mon, just ignore these 
brats and drink with me.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Hey, hey, eat this.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.890
Isn't it delicious? Isn't it?

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.680
I'm sorry. I've reached my limit, 
so can I go see my sister now?

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.770
I see, I see. So you guys 
love me that much, eh?

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.520
But you need to shut up.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.740
Sorry.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.780
I brought a new mem—

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.320
Where'd he go?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.220
Over there.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.690
Save me!

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.690
Why are you fooling around over there?

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.080
I-I'm not.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.350
This little shrimp is our other new member.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.690
Other?

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.410
What was your name again?

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.420
Right!

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.540
I'm Asta from Hage Village!

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.100
It's nice to meet all of you!

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.280
Hage? Seriously?

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.660
Talk about out in the sticks.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.100
Hey, introduce him to the other members.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.480
Oh, right. Well, you've already met him, but...

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.030
This is Gordon Agrippa.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:29.900
Nice to meet you.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.020
He's pretty gloomy, and you never know 
what he's thinking, but he's a good guy.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.240
And over here

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.280
is Vanessa Enoteca.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.340
She'll get in your face when she's drunk,
but she's a good person.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.730
I won't get in anyone's face.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.830
Hage... Isn't that a small 
village out in the boonies?

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.720
Yes!

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.490
Huh...

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.360
To come from out in the boonies
and join the Magic Knights...

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.380
You must've worked really hard, little boy.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.750
How about I reward you with a special treat?

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.050
I wish I could accept that!

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.650
But I already have a goddess 
named Sister Lily in my heart!

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.740
Let's continue with the introductions.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.800
What?!

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.410
I'm next!

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.420
This is Luck Voltia.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.000
He loves to fight and is obsessed 
with battle, but he's a good guy.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.770
Nice to meet ya!

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.260
Do you like to fight?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.750
S-Sure...

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.300
I love to fight!

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.070
Wanna fight? Wanna fight?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.550
Huh? What?

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.550
Hey.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.190
Look.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.170
Huh?

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.770
This is my little sister Marie.
She's an angel.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.070
Right...

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.730
Listen well. If you lay a finger 
on Marie, I'll kill you.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.280
What?!

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.590
This is Gauche Adlai.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.230
He's a bit too obsessed with his 
little sister, but he's a good guy.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.890
This is Charmy Pappitson. She eats way 
too much, but she's a good person.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.240
Nice to meet you!

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.190
This is Grey. I don't really 
get him, but he's a good guy.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.240
H-Hi...

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.510
And then we have Magna Swing.
He's a delinquent, but he's a good guy.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.750
He's scary!

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.680
And I'm Finral Roulacase. I'm super popular.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.220
And last but not least, 
the captain of the Black Bulls,

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.140
Yami Sukehiro!

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.800
He's not calling him a good guy?!

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.540
Th-Thank you for having me!

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.140
There are other members,
but they're either on some mission,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.560
taking a break, or slacking off.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.080
Try to get along with them all.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.200
Right! I'll super get along with them all!

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.970
Once again, it's nice to meet all of you!

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.970
My head hurts.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.310
Your height and the volume of
your voice are all out of proportion.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.300
Yes, sir!

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.120
Shut up.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.460
Sorry!

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.930
Anyway, put him to work, but don't kill him.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.580
Huh?!

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.670
Did you hear that?

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.620
What?

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.050
Mister Yami said to put you to work.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.060
I'll gladly put you to work.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:14.510
A weak-looking shrimp like you from 
a village like Hage out in the boonies...

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.110
I barely sense any mana from you.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.360
And you're a new member of the Black Bulls?

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.840
I don't know what a hick like 
you with no magical powers

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.120
did to get on Mister Yami's good side, but...

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.230
You want one of these Black Bulls robes?

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:40.630
A-A Magic Knight robe! S-So cool!

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.340
Isn't it?

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.690
You want one?

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.060
I do!

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.350
Please give me one!

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.830
Oh, yeah? You want it that badly, huh?

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.560
In that case...

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.250
You're going to have to convince me, 
Mister Yami's #1 man

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.070
and a real man's man, Magna Swing!

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.700
Time for your initiation 
into the Black Bulls.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.740
Huh?

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.780
His face is so scary.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.670
Hey, hick from Hage!

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.990
If you want one of these robes,
get through this trial I'm about to give you.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.730
Got it!

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.080
He's making up initiation rituals again.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.480
I wanna do it, too!

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.490
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.490
Marie...

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.820
Let's start this thing!

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.370
First, show me just how much 
guts and stamina you have!

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.740
Five thousand sit-ups!

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.040
Got it!

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.470
Five thousand push-ups!

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.190
Ow!

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.170
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.250
Ow!

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.600
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.600
My angel...

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.940
That kid's not bad, though this is pointless.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.380
Not that it matters since magic 
is everything in this world,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.940
but he has a crazy amount of energy.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.610
How's that?!

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.330
I guess you have some guts.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.160
Did I convince you?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.810
Can I have my robe now?

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.700
Not yet!

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.420
You're a hick from the boonies! 
It's not gonna be that easy!

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.250
There's one more. 
The final trial in the initiation!

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.630
The final...

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:49.180
You can use magic or whatever else you want...

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.140
to either block or dodge my attack magic!

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:03.790
If you're able to do that,
you'll officially be one of us Black Bulls.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.690
You'll get your precious robe!

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.590
Want...

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.620
G-Got it! I'll do my best!

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.740
Shut up!

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.450
Hold up your grimoire, you stupid shrimp!

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.670
Yes, sir!

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.700
Whoa! What's that?

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.010
It's huge.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.570
You ready?

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.320
Yup!

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.330
Here I go!

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.550
Bring it on, sir!

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.090
Not bad!

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:11.470
Yes, sir!

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.840
I might just make it.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.350
But the true test...

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.180
starts now!

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.780
It's so hot.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.860
Flame Magic:

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:42.930
Exploding... Fireball!

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.000
Die!

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.630
Seriously?!

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.860
Oh. I'm dead.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.640
Asta's brain knew instinctively.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.650
With his well-trained muscles,
kinetic vision, and explosive power,

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.170
Asta had always been able to slice 
through magic and defeat his enemies.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.870
But Magna's magic was
 too fast for Asta to see.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.180
It's fast!

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.830
Even if he could slice through it,

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.370
the momentum of this attack would continue.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.750
He would just be hit by
 the split attack's halves.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.700
I can't stop it!

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.940
Now that he had realized his limits,
his brain shut down.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.000
However...

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.510
His body hadn't given up!

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.600
His well-trained body's super reflexes

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.110
put up one last struggle...

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.110
And he was able to find a way out!

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.820
He hit it! He hit it!

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.710
Wow.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.370
It's been a while since we didn't 
have to save a new recruit's hide.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.970
He wasn't able to cut it, 
but he was able to hit it.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.220
That sword can cut through 
magic as well as repel it.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.590
How interesting.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.490
I had no idea!

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.860
I knew it could cut through magic,
but I guess I can hit it, too.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.390
This sword is awesome! But man, 
I thought I was gonna die!

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.140
That was too close!

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.990
What's he thinking?! Was he 
planning to kill a new recruit?!

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.750
Wait, is he dead?

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.380
You little bastard.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.770
What?! He took that head-on, and he's fine?!

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.170
I was able to nullify it in time, so I'm fine,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.180
but I was almost offed by my own magic.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.240
You little bastard!

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.900
Scary! Scary! Scary! Scary!

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.150
You're not half bad!

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.420
Huh? What?!

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.170
Not only were you able to block my magic, 
you actually sent it right back at me!

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.490
I like you, Shrimpsta!

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.410
I-It's Asta!

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.930
Sorry I made fun of you for being a 
backwoods hick with little magical power.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.150
I'm actually from out in the country myself.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.460
I'm from Rayaka Village, just above Hage.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.430
Whoa, seriously? Rayaka Village
is way out in the sticks!

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.970
Like you can talk!

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:51.160
Actually, it's not that I have little 
magical power. I don't have any at all.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.970
Huh?

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.960
You don't have any magical power?

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.540
And yet you were able to 
hit my attack back at me?

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.470
Y-Yeah...

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.390
That's even more awesome! So that means

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.450
you're a real man.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.090
Nice! You're really interesting!

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.090
Want to eat this?

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.090
Not bad, little boy.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.090
Stay away from my sister.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.290
All right. Let's start the second initiation!

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.260
Come again?

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.090
Let's try and kill each other!

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.370
You looked great out there, little boy.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.520
Uh, thanks...

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.980
Here.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.970
Try it. It's yummy. Okay?

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.190
Oh, thanks.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.390
Here! I'm being generous. You can have half!

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.960
Actually, half of half.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.990
Thanks!

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.780
Yummy!

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:50.630
Okay, okay. Isn't there something 
more important you should be doing?

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.930
Aw...

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.430
Here.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.590
This is yours, Asta!

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.090
You don't want it?

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.730
I do! I do!

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.530
This is mine...

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.780
Go ahead, try it on.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.290
And while we're at it...

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.610
Looks good on you.
Don't you think so, Mister Yami?

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.270
He looks pretty bland.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:59.210
And now, you're officially a member of 
the Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls!

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.990
You better work hard not to shame 
Mister Yami or the Black Bulls!

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.590
Thanks! It's a pleasure 
to work with all of you!

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.130
Shut up.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.050
Sorry!

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.260
I'll be more careful next time!

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.270
The captain just told you to shut up!

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.250
That's the other new recruit?

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.860
What an insect.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:52.600
No one can escape from here

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:59.270
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:07.160
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:14.000
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.640
I've thought many times

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.150
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:28.760
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:35.620
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:42.880
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:49.760
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.610
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.280
Petit Clover

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.710
Petit Clover!

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.790
Real Life!
Magic Knights 24!

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.790
Real Life! Magic Knights 24!

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.270
It's chilly.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.430
Right, Mister Yami!

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.030
It's hot!

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.090
Right, Mister Yami!

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.090
I can't see anything.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.100
Right, Mister Yami!

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.470
Get out.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.510
Right, Mister Yami!

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.810
I've finally been acknowledged 
as a member of the Black Bulls!

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.650
Huh? There's another new recruit?

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.110
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 7:
"The Other New Recruit."

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:55.000
Page 7
The Other New Recruit

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.180
Not giving up is my magic!
