00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.340
With the guidance of the ten elves 
known as the Apostles of Sephira,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.390
the border between this world and 
the next that lay inside Clover Castle,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.770
the Shadow Palace, appeared.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.540
When we put the final magic stone 
in its pedestal inside the palace,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.730
the elves' reincarnation 
will be complete!

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.180
In exchange, the souls of the 
humans who owned these bodies

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.990
will be sent to the underworld!

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.790
So basically, there's a magical 
space spreading over there.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.980
Well, why don't we head on over?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.300
We will not let you get in the 
way of the Apostles of Sephira!

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.260
It's just one thing after another... 
Give us a break already, damn it!

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.850
The ones who arrived during 
this time of crisis were...

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.470
That's...

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.890
Everyone!

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.750
Are you okay?!

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.900
A stupidly huge... bull?

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.450
What kind of entrance was that?

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.240
Welcome, you dumbasses!

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.110
Curse you, humans! It doesn't 
matter how many of you show up!

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.160
You're no match for us elves!

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.290
It looked as though the tables had turned 
thanks to Asta and the others, but...

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.840
Oh, come on. Don't tell me this ki is...

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.550
Isn't that...

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.760
The Captain of the Coral Peacocks,
 Dorothy Unsworth?!

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.180
Dream Magic: Glamour World.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.600
Dorothy Unsworth,
 the Captain of the Coral Peacocks,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.060
had also reincarnated as an elf.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.750
She used her magic to teleport Vanessa 
and the others into the dream world.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.690
The Eyes in the Mirror

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.550
La! La!

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.930
Wow! Where are we?

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.130
I can't see too well without my glasses,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.670
but it looks fun!

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.660
What the heck is this weird place?

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.930
This must be the magic of the 
Captain of the Coral Peacocks.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.930
Rouge wasn't able to evade it because 
she couldn't identify it as an attack spell.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.150
This is amazing!

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.780
I think this is one of the most 
powerful spells a single mage can produce!

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.190
Now's not the time to be so happy!

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.850
This place goes on forever. 
I don't think there's an end to it.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.110
Huh?! Like that's even possible,
 Luck, you dumbass!

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.930
It's probably more possible 
than you ever not being stupid.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.950
The hell did you say?!

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.630
Making the impossible possible is 
what happens here in the Glamour World.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.880
Welcome...

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.630
to the world where I control everything.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.680
The bed just...

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.230
Everything...

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.690
is as I wish it to be.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.940
S-S-S-S-Some kind of strange 
creature just appeared!

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.480
And it just keeps getting bigger.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.530
I wonder if it tastes good.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.030
So you have...

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.530
absolutely no chance

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.830
of winning.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.330
You can sleep forever now.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.340
How dare it try to eat us instead?!

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.090
I thought we died, damn it!

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.730
The result changed?

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.100
So that magic really does 
have to do with logic.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.180
That cat really is amazing!

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.060
You're not one of the Black Bulls.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.230
If you stray too far, her magic 
won't affect you, so be careful.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.810
I see! So it just works on your teammates!

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.240
I guess there'd have to be 
limits on a spell this amazing!

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.620
Dream magic and thread magic...

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.220
These two witches are absolutely amazing!

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.790
I wanna research them so bad!

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.220
Uh, I think she's bad news.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.170
You think so?

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.730
Here! Once you've used magic,
eat up so you can recover mana!

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.060
That magic's amazing, too! 
You're not a witch, are you?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.060
Nope. I just like to eat lots.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.060
An inexhaustible magic supply 
and absolute evasion...

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.780
This is not going to be easy.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.280
If this ridiculous place is magic, too,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.830
then we can get outta here if we beat her.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.450
Looks like it.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080
Useless.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.250
I wonder if she can use any magical attribute!

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.940
I wonder what her limits even are!

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.370
This is so much fun!

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.430
Who the hell cares?! This isn't fun at all!

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.100
Actually, what are we even supposed 
to do? She's basically invincible.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.690
Your magic's not that interesting.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.610
The hell did you just say?! Huh?!

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.270
Wanna fight me?

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.810
This is no time to be playing around!

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.280
Yeah!

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.670
I'm the cornerstone of our defense,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.030
and Charmy's vital to mana recovery.
We can't both stay stuck here.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.790
We have to hurry back to everyone.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.290
But...

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.130
All I can do is make sure we 
evade with Rouge's magic.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.300
Okay, time to recover your mana, la.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.300
Eat, eat, eat, Vanessa!

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.720
Hooray, hooray, Vanessa!

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.020
You can do it, appetite!

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.640
I'm going to slap all of you
if I get fat from this!

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.970
There has to be some kind of 
limit to her healing abilities.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.460
An ever-flowing pool of water

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.770
that happens to have blade-fish 
perpetually spawning from it...

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.590
A never-ending barrage of attacks...

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.590
My noms!

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.710
Th-That's not good!

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.630
Water, eh?

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.380
Say, lightning boy, could you 
attack that pool of water?

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.210
I don't think I can destroy 
something that big, though.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.130
That's fine. Just give it your all!

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.680
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.010
Aw, it didn't work after all.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.620
Okay, now you attack, fire protozoan.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.330
Who're you calling a fire 
protozoan, you dumbass?!

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.490
Oh, just shoot it with 
everything you've got already.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.900
Who the hell do you think I am?!

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.870
If I guessed correctly and 
that really is water...

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.780
It'll explode!

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.910
Yay! Look at that intensity!

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.710
Wh-What just happened?

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.260
I used electricity to chemically decompose 
water, then set fire to what was left.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.100
Huh?

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.340
Simply put, if you unleash lightning 
magic and flame magic on water,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.480
you can create an explosion big 
enough to destroy a mountain.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.270
Wh-Wh-What were you thinking, 
making us do something that dangerous?!

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.240
Who cares? You can use the cat to evade.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.240
I'll try this with Noelle's magic next!

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.020
That experiment made a 
few other things clear, too.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.290
First, what she's generating are 
actual objects she visualized.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.870
That means real-world 
principles work on them, too!

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.670
Nom! This is a real fish!

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.880
Second, because of that, 
she can't manipulate

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.180
the spells we cast and the resulting phenomena.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.900
That's true. Otherwise, that explosion and

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.140
Rouge's ability to manipulate 
fate wouldn't have worked.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.670
And...

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:52.150
Third, it's still going to 
be really hard to beat her.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.570
There's no end to this!

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.530
We need to hurry up and find a way outta here!

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.830
You don't have that kind of time.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.950
Charmy?!

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.210
I'm... I'm so sleepy...

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.290
H-Hey! What the hell are you talking about?!

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.330
This ain't no time for... sleep...

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.540
Uh-oh...

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.720
Yeah, this is...

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.720
It appears you couldn't evade the drowsiness.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:29.670
Everything that exists in Glamour World 
will eventually get drowsy.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.350
And those who fall asleep 
will never awaken again.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.140
Who do you think I am?!

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.290
I managed to stay awake even during 
all of Mister Yami's all-nighters!

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.540
This is bad. At this rate... 
But I don't know what we can do!

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:54.040
Sink slowly into the sleep of death, 
unable to do anything within this space.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.050
Aw, everything that was already 
blurry is getting even blurrier.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.650
Not having my glasses seriously sucks.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.140
Oh, yeah!

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.420
Hey!

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.020
Do you know what these are? The answer is...

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.730
Glasses!

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.440
Uh, what the hell are you talking about?
 Now's not the time for—

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.940
Yay!

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.380
What?!

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.930
Wh-What just...

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.790
What just happened?!

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.380
Everything in this world 
happens as she sees fit.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.000
So things that she visualized 
in her head appeared.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.620
So...

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:38.590
What this world needs... is an 
exit, exit, exit! Make one, please?

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:50.830
It's hard to not think of something once 
your mind has already visualized it.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.150
Hell yeah! She's only 
invincible in this world!

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.940
If we can escape it,
we can figure something out.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.130
What the hell's going on?

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.450
We keep seeing the same 
stuff no matter how far we go.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.620
We can't even find any walls, let alone Licht.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.340
And this faint ki I feel... Is it...

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.820
Looks like someone's 
magic is making us get lost.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.310
Guess you noticed it, 
too, you beanpole weirdo.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.710
Right back at you, meathead.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.690
They've got some nerve hiding.
I wanna slash them up already!

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.740
I'll take care of them.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.490
No, I'm gonna slash them up.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.870
Uh, I found them first.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.740
What are you talking about? I was first!

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.810
It was me!

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.760
It was me!

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.870
Ugh, you're such a pain in the ass!

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.710
The early bird slashes the worm!

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.210
You're right there!

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.530
Hey, where are you slashing? 
The enemy's over there.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.960
What?! They're right over there!

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.270
Besides, you didn't even hit them.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.140
Well, neither did you!

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.050
Ugh, whatever! I'm done with you!

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.810
That's my line, you stupid meathead!

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.880
You useless beanpole!

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.520
Go over there!

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.520
No, you!

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.530
Yikes! That was close.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.110
Though they were technically both 
correct in my warped space.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.510
Thank goodness I rolled a six 
in order to keep them busy.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.140
The higher the number with dice magic,

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.040
the more effective it is 
in the situation at hand.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.630
I won't let anyone get in the way 
of the Apostles of Sephira.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.140
I would appreciate it if

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.590
these two would keep quiet
 for just a while longer.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.690
I-I-I can't keep this up anymore!

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.400
Their overall magic power 
is way higher than ours.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:12.530
I... am... going... to... 
reach... my... limit... soon...

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.410
Why not give up already, humans?

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.080
Not yet!

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.080
We're not done yet!

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.330
Right!

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.840
What should I do? Think!

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.090
If I can get into my black form...

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.140
But I don't even have a chance to do that.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.140
Asta... Everyone...

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.400
I hate that all we can do is watch.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.660
Big Brother...

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.420
Yeah. It looks like we're gonna keep 
Licht and the others waiting a bit longer.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.500
Eclat, we're going to do <i>that</i>.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.780
Okay.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.200
Here we go.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.960
Huh?

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.290
Asta!

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:08.550
This is... the spell Gauche 
used to evade attacks.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.430
Right this way, kid.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.870
Licht's Demon-Destroyer Sword severs

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.140
the cause-and-effect relationships around it.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.870
He has the ability to nullify Eclat's 
eye magic, so I'll get rid of him first.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.360
Look at me.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.110
Nope!

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.110
Can you evade attacks with your eyes closed?

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.410
I can evade using ki!

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.080
Well, in that case... How about this?

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.170
That many... This definitely isn't good!

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.920
Asta!

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.530
This time, it's our turn...

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.180
...t-t-t-to save him!

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.180
Go!

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.070
I'm gonna rip right through 
that in an instant.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.000
What?

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.840
Now I can fight!

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:39.970
You're mine!

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.230
You...

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.520
...looked at me.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.400
The magic item in his left eye...

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.100
Crap!

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.670
I've had enough of you, brat.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.510
I'll wipe out every last speck of you

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.470
so you can't fight us again.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.960
I can't undo the binding spell in time.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.590
Asta!

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.960
M-My magic can't reach that high!

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.880
Asta!

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:21.890
Well, see ya.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.130
Asta!

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.420
Poison Magic: Violett Schirm!

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.750
Transformation Magic...

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.820
Magic Conversion: Poison to Mirror!

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.240
Thank you very much!

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.810
Not bad.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.140
As we thought... Gauche is way 
stronger than usual right now.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.340
But...

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.230
Move!

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.420
The three of us can do this.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.650
I can still figh—

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.860
Henry!

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.160
A-A-A-Are you okay?

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.540
Of... course... I... am!

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:32.040
Magic... please hold out just a little longer.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.920
Just a little longer!

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:41.100
Just like many mages reinforce 
themselves by using magic,

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.590
Henry uses his magic to keep himself alive.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:49.010
His blood vessels, muscles, and basically 
all of his organs are very frail.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.780
He cannot stay alive unless he 
continually uses magic to reinforce them.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.240
What he'd been given was

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.690
a constitution that absorbed magical power.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.310
The ability to absorb 
magical powers from others.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.790
Despite being born into a renowned 
noble family, his body was just too frail,

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:12.350
and his family... the world could 
not accept him for what he was.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.010
How can this be?

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.070
If we continue to harbor that creature,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.550
it'll disgrace the great name of Legolant.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.290
But he's our child!

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.180
I know that!

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.820
This is for our family.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.930
It was the warped love of high society.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.270
The only thing Henry's parents gave him

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.190
was a house in the forest that stored up

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.990
magic power while remaining 
unseen by others.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.860
This is how it should be.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.450
I just cause everyone trouble.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.750
Are you the resident ghost that 
everyone keeps talking about?

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:54.250
Well... I'm... not... 
actually... a... ghost.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.110
Heya, I'm Yami Sukehiro.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.050
I just became a Magic Knights
Squad captain recently,

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.550
and I'm looking for a hideout.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.970
Up until that moment, I was basically dead.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.100
I need you to live.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.810
But... I...

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:17.570
Basically, you just need a lively bunch 
of people to live here, right?

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:23.970
My house became the hideout of the 
Black Bulls, and up until that moment...

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.850
I was...

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.460
The only reason I have my 
life now is because of them.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.690
That's why I don't care what happens to me!

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.680
He managed to get through Eclat's binding.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.800
I'm gonna stop you two, no matter what,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.890
and turn you back into the 
normal Gauche and Marie!

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.190
Yes. I'm going to save him, no matter what.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.840
I don't care what happens to me.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.940
I'm going to save my friend!

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.500
Petit Clover

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.730
Petit Clover!

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.010
You Saw

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.570
You Saw.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.850
I'm gonna stop you two, no matter what,

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.970
and turn you back into the 
normal Gauche and Marie!

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.620
I'm Droit.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.060
I'm Eclat.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.180
We're never turning back.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.560
But... I do want to know a little 
more about this human named Gauche.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.730
This doll that looks just like Eclat 
that I had when I reincarnated...

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.070
It's just too cute.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.990
And these pictures of her 
in different outfits...

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.950
He's got such good taste!

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.490
This guy knows what he's doing!

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.000
Big Brother?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.710
O-Oh, I was just...

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.510
Marie's doll and pictures!

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.720
You saw...

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.470
I did.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.310
I can't move...

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.890
Next... time... on... <i>Black... Clover,</i>

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.310
Page... 112: "Humans Who Can Be Trusted."

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:54.030
Page 111
Humans Who Can Be Trusted

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:53.870
It's... my... job... to... 
save... my... friends.
