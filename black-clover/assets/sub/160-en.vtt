WEBVTT

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.770
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.400
a devil.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.320
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.740
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.830
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.620
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.500
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.420
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.300
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.900
Asta and the others took over one of the 
Spade Kingdom's bases, the town of Tolon,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.860
and returned to the Heart Kingdom.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.690
They enjoyed a moment's rest,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.610
but then...

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.330
Charmy's power and appetite 
had grown from training,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.290
and along with all the hungry animals,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.410
she was trying to eat 
all the food in the forest.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.290
Picture Magic: Invasion of Heat-Infused Ice!

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.010
Thus things calmed down for the moment.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.380
Around the same time,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.430
Yuno received a message and 
returned to his home village of Hage.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.530
He then received shocking news 
from the man he met there.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.700
You belong to the House of Grinberryall.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.940
Meaning...

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.650
You are the Prince of the Spade Kingdom!

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.190
The Messenger from the Spade Kingdom

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.280
Where's Vice Captain Yuno?

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.760
Apparently he received 
word from his hometown,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.230
so he quickly wrapped up a 
mission and headed over there.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.790
That quick? As expected.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.300
His hometown? You mean Hage Village,
out in the boonies?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.320
Yes.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.150
Considering how much mana he has,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.120
it's hard to believe he's actually 
from the Forsaken Realm.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.180
It doesn't matter where he was born. 
Yuno is obviously a very skilled Magic Knight.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.660
Oh? What's this?

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.140
What?

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.720
You have a lot of rivals.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.600
Huh?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.040
Yuno has fan clubs all throughout 
the kingdom right now.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.980
Yuno!

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.000
It's not like that!

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.400
No, really. He's amazing.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.680
A year and a half after he joined 
our squad, he's already vice captain.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.640
He might just become the Wizard King.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.330
Yuno...

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.600
...is the Prince of the Spade Kingdom?!

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.580
I always knew he was amazing, 
but he's actually a prince?!

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.740
This is unbelievable!

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.560
I knew it! I totally 
thought that was the case!

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.800
He's royalty! Royalty!

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.600
Quiet down, both of you.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.280
You're overflowing with 
dignity and class. Of course!

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.720
What is this creature?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.500
I'm one of the Four Great Spirits,
 the Wind Spirit Slyph!

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.990
I'm the one who's closest to Yuno!

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.100
You have the Wind Spirit! 
Amazing, Prince Yuno!

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.720
Then what about Asta?

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.560
Asta?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.310
The child that was abandoned in 
front of this church alongside Yuno!

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.890
I-I have no idea.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.200
I just know that Prince Yuno is 
the Prince of the Spade Kingdom.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.700
Where are you even coming up with this?

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.750
Me? The Prince of the Spade Kingdom?

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.820
Yes!

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.980
Even if I was, why would the 
Prince of the Spade Kingdom

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.020
be abandoned in the Clover Kingdom?

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.530
Th-That's because...

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.710
Let me change the question. 
Why did you come here?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.290
I'm sorry. I should've said this 
earlier. My name is Ralph.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.530
I came here you tell you the truth.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.700
So with my brethren's 
thoughts and mana within me,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.590
I traveled through the strong 
magic region to get here.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.090
Just as my father did.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.820
Prince Yuno...

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.580
Flame Magic: Trace Mirage.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.270
Please take a look at your past.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.810
This is...

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.520
Apparently, on that day, a ray of light 
managed to break through the thick clouds

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.850
in the sky over the Spade Kingdom.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.540
It was as though it was a sign foretelling 
a bright future for the kingdom.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.000
Your Majesty...

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.250
Perhaps you should calm down.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.710
R-Right...

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.610
He's born!

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.760
He's a healthy baby boy.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.280
Thank you so much for being born.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.570
My beautiful child...

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.200
Ciel...

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.520
Thank you. You worked so hard.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.790
My love...

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.420
I obtained this magic stone 
 long ago when I made it

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.340
safely back through 
the strong magic region.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.300
I will give it to Yuno for protection.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.340
That name...

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.890
"If it's a boy, we'll name him Yuno."

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.280
That's the name you chose, isn't it?

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.230
Yes!

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.610
He's born! The prince is born!

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.070
An heir has been born!

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.050
He's born! The prince has been born!

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.870
They said that the festivities continued 
long into the night that day.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.790
Your birth was truly a ray of hope that 
shone through the long, harsh winter

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.840
that had closed off our kingdom.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.840
Everyone always smiled 
around you, Prince Yuno.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.390
How do I get him to stop crying?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.310
Guess you're not so tough now, Captain of 
the Mage Defense Force's 1st Division.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.690
Did you already forget what 
you did for your own son?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.150
I let my wife handle all that.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.460
Hey, he stopped crying!

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.620
He's the son of King Loyce and Queen Ciel.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.750
I'm sure he'll be an amazing mage.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.960
Yes. He's going to be a way 
more powerful mage than you.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.760
Like you can talk!

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.280
Prince Yuno truly is adorable.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.540
There, there...

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.020
Our duty is to make sure these 
days of peace are protected.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.940
Ralph, you'll eventually join
 the Mage Defense Force.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.400
Make sure you do your best to protect Yuno.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.610
Yes, Father!

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.490
He finally stopped crying.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.550
Yes.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.040
Will he be all right?

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.030
What?

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:48.560
He's such a crybaby... but eventually, 
he'll need to take my place on the throne.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.050
What?

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.890
Yuno is still a baby. I think it's 
too soon to worry about that.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:57.940
You think so?

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.430
Right, my little crybaby?

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.460
No one could've known that

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.650
those days filled with happiness 
would come to an abrupt end.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.820
The Zogratis siblings have returned!

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.740
Well done on your subjugation mission.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.780
Make sure you get plenty of rest.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.660
And continue to work hard to 
maintain the peace of this kingdom.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.170
As you wish... For the peace of this kingdom.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.090
Always keep an eye on those three.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.300
What do you mean, Father?

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.800
I have a bad feeling about them.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.350
I see.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.560
I heard those three killed all the rebels.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.540
Yes.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.980
Did you order them to do so?

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.460
Don't be ridiculous!

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.650
Oh, there, there.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.120
I cannot bring myself to like those three.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.290
I wonder why Father said that.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.790
Regardless, I swear fealty to this kingdom.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.690
Ralph, why don't you take a break?

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.180
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.930
If I had listened to my father's words

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.530
and kept my eye on those three, the Dark Triad,

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.520
we may have been able to avoid that tragedy.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.690
Treason!

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.950
The Zogratis siblings 
have attacked the castle!

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.910
This is the best!

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.590
Halt!

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.750
Traitors!

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.590
Ooh, here we go!

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.760
I guess it's time to make that 
mountain of corpses even higher!

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.470
Unbelievable...

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.890
No! The Mage Defense Force's troops are 
being taken out one after another.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.730
They're too powerful... We can't stop them!

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.210
Does this mean the rumor that the devil's 
power has been bestowed upon them is true?

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.610
Why would you do this?

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.460
Father!

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.510
Where are the king and queen?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.110
Wait...

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.930
They have left...

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.640
the future with me.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.100
Isn't it boring that they're all so weak?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.270
I'll buy us some time! Please hurry!

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.860
Don't you think so, Zenon?

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.690
Yeah.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.940
Ralph, I swear to protect 
Prince Yuno with my life.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.740
Make sure you survive.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.160
I promise I will!

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.540
That was the last time I saw my father.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.130
Is Prince Yuno safe?

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.670
Yes.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.530
I don't think they'd actually 
try to kill Prince Yuno, but...

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.770
There's no guarantee of that.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.720
Wait. They have no right to the throne.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.390
They would need Prince Yuno.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.770
Do you think that those 
three are after the throne?

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.040
Are they not?

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.290
I'm not sure. But I feel something more 
ominous that I can't put my finger on.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.050
We cannot let them have Prince Yuno.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.800
They know everything about 
this kingdom, just like we do.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.930
We must leave here.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.950
So we will move according to plan!

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.790
They split into three groups!

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.060
It'll be all right, Prince Yuno.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.230
Just hold on a bit longer.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.900
I will risk my life to protect you,

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.420
and I'm sure that amulet 
will protect you, too.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.160
Wait, did he enter...

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.540
...the strong magic region?

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:37.870
What shall we do?

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.500
It doesn't matter.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.380
But things may be difficult 
if the prince is left alive.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.690
If you think that, then kill him.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:46.930
Y-Yes, sir.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.980
I will protect you, no matter what...

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.530
Prince Yuno!

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.540
That's a church.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.770
That place should be...

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.420
This is my final spell for you, Prince Yuno.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.430
Please become strong.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.990
I see they're already here.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.690
Since I'm this far from the church, 
Prince Yuno should be safe.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.860
Prince Yuno... Please stay safe.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.240
I refuse to die at your hands!

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.790
Ralph... I'm leaving the future to you.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.840
Yuno...

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.810
Considering how much mana you have, 
I'm sure you realize that

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.020
everything I've shown 
you actually happened.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.940
There are no lies here.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.200
That's exactly what a liar would say!

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.800
Don't believe him, Yuno!

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.450
My family served the 
royal family for generations.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.120
It's not just me.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.230
There are many citizens being 
oppressed by the Dark Triad

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.250
who are praying that you're safe.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.830
What's the matter?

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.180
There's trouble, Vice Captain!

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.200
The Golden Dawn's headquarters...

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.970
is under attack!

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.560
What?!

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.570
So you don't mind us going wild...

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.550
Lord Zenon?

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.910
You can kill everyone other than 
the arcane stage mage we're after.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.250
Yuno?

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.040
Please wait, Prince Yuno!

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.880
If they were able to get into 
the Clover Kingdom that easily,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.840
they must be the Dark Triad, 
or almost as powerful!

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.380
You mustn't fight them carelessly!

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.360
I am the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.520
Prince Yuno!

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.980
I'll go, too!

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.070
You must stay in bed.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.400
Yuno...

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.090
Yuno, your face is really scary right now.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.970
I bet you're thinking about 
how to kick those bad guys' butts!

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.450
I knew it! I'm so smart!

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.130
You are our hope. You belong 
to the House of Grinberryall.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.130
Meaning...

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.560
You are the Prince of the Spade Kingdom!

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.050
Even so, I'm Yuno of the Clover Kingdom.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.300
Faster... I need to move faster!

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.370
The look of them...

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.900
They're mages from the Spade Kingdom!

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:34.190
I don't know how they got here, but the 
fact that they got into our headquarters...

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.410
Make them regret ever coming here!

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.330
Everyone, concentrate your 
attack spells on them!

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.300
Wha—

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.130
Impossible...

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.020
They're unharmed?

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.020
Where did the other one go?

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.640
Come on, now.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:13.540
Is this all you've got? I heard you guys 
were the best squad in the Clover Kingdom.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.940
Well, I guess I can't blame you.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.110
We are the elite among those deemed

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.930
suitable to be bestowed 
powers by the Dark Triad.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.170
We, the Dark Disciples, are all stage zero.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.410
Stage zero?

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.390
He disappeared?

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.800
Hey, stone magic, just like me!

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.140
But man, you're weak!

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.360
Shire—

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.200
The devil's powers elevate your 
magic to another dimension!

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.530
Our army's captains can handle about 5%.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.120
But I can unleash about 40%!

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.230
And Lord Zenon, who's possessed by a devil...

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.420
can unleash 80%!

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.720
I've been looking for you.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.390
So you're the arcane stage Magic Knight,

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.570
the Captain of the Golden Dawn,
 William Vangeance.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.570
This mana...

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:30.890
Halt!

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.580
Get away from Lord Vangeance!

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.330
Alecdora, don't! Stay back!

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.540
I may have been a vessel for the elves,

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.830
but it is my will to fight for you!

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.670
Alecdora...

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.410
As a Magic Knight of the Golden Dawn...

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.470
I will strike down this invader!

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.050
This magic...

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.350
World Tree Magic: Magic Warding Ash!

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.890
Lord Vangeance...

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.190
No matter who you are...

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.110
I will not allow you to hurt 
any of my squad members!

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.400
So that's world tree magic.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:27.830
To benefit the Spade Kingdom, 
I'll be taking you.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.410
Bone Magic: Eternal Fangs.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.960
Everyone!

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:54.730
Oh?

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.610
What do you think you're looking at,
little fly who was late to the party?

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.870
What do you think you're doing...

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.950
to my comrades?!

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:48.550
Petit Clover

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.590
Petit Clover!

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.050
Yuno's Fan Clubs

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.390
Yuno's Fan Clubs.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.270
It doesn't matter where he was born. 
Yuno is obviously a very skilled Magic Knight.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.820
Oh? What's this?

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.400
What?

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:03.940
You have a lot of rivals.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.800
Huh?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.250
Yuno has fan clubs all throughout 
the kingdom right now.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.570
I'm aware of that.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.580
I mean, I'm in charge of the 
Golden Dawn's Yuno fan club.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.350
There's one in the Golden Dawn, too?!

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.620
Of course there is!

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.670
You said so yourself. Yuno has fan 
clubs all throughout the kingdom.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.510
Right...

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.250
Of course, I have buttons, 
clear files, acrylic stands,

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.440
and every other type of Yuno merchandise.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.190
And of course, I follow 
him on social media, too.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.220
Hang on a second! 
Yuno has social media accounts?!

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.870
You won't get away with this.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.080
What do you think you're doing to my comrades?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.980
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 161: "Zenon's Power."

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:54.060
Page 161
Zenon's Power

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.150
I don't care if you have 
the devil's powers or not.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.610
I'm going to defeat you!
