WEBVTT

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.060
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.670
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.950
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.610
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.040
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.860
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.650
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.370
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.920
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.900
We can finally train in the Heart Kingdom!

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.110
Now that I've sworn I'd be worthy of 
being the head of the House of Vaude

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.660
and of Miss Finnes,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260
If I don't become stronger now,
 it'll all be a lie.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.310
So the Spirit Guardians won't break 
even if I go all-out, right?

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.690
I can't wait!

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.420
Hell yeah! I'm definitely gonna get stronger!

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.200
Well, you can get stronger, but I'm 
still gonna get even stronger than you!

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.380
The hell'd you say?!

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.340
To avenge my mother... 
To destroy the devil Megicula...

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.820
I'm going to become stronger!

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.230
The 5 Spirit Guardians

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.740
Guys, you're already here?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.110
Asta!

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.860
I've been waiting for you, my rival!

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.910
Training in another kingdom... 
Yami should've come, too.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.710
Asta, Yuno gave me a message for you.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.920
Oh? What'd he say?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.920
Just simply, "I'm going to become 
stronger with the Golden Dawn."

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.120
What's that supposed to mean? He'd obviously 
get stronger if he trained over here.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.060
Nah, he'd get stronger 
no matter where he was.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.680
I can't lose!

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.800
It appears that you're all here.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.720
Yes. Thank you for having us, Gaja.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.940
Then allow me to lead you in.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.690
There are many of you I am 
meeting for the first time.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.190
Welcome to the Heart Kingdom.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.750
Normally, I would be holding a 
feast to welcome all of you here,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.790
and it pains me deeply that 
this is the best I can do,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.700
but considering the circumstances...

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.500
Is something the matter?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.590
I do beg your pardon for bringing 
this up, but the one on your lap...

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.340
It's Charmy.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.820
Yeah, that much is obvious. 
But what's she doing here?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.330
Wherever there are delicious noms,
 I shall also be there!

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.770
What the hell?

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.720
Honestly, this is the problem 
with the Black Bulls.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.770
But it does appear that 
Queen Loropechika is okay with it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.170
If the queen is allowing it, 
there shouldn't be a problem.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.280
It seems the queen here is very generous.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.280
Is this actually what you'd call generous?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.380
It's a pleasure to have you all here,
citizens of the Clover Kingdom.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.840
We'll be in your care for a while.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.540
We thank you for your kindness!

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.540
Then let us go into a bit more 
detail about your training.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.080
First, the Spade Kingdom has

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.730
already taken control of most of 
the bases in the Diamond Kingdom,

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.670
and their invasion has halted for the moment.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.130
Which means that our kingdom, as well as

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.810
the Clover Kingdom, 
may be targeted at any time.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.830
And because of that,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.520
all of you will be undergoing rigorous 
training to ensure rapid growth.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.150
Bring it on!

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.160
We also wish to become more 
powerful as soon as possible.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.600
I will now introduce the Spirit Guardians
 who will be mentoring you.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.170
The Spirit Guardian of Earth
Sarado

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.730
The Spirit Guardian of Earth, Sarado.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.830
Pleased to meet you!

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.730
The Spirit Guardian of Plants, Potrof.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.170
The Spirit Guardian of Plants
Potrof

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.170
Let us learn together!

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.180
The Spirit Guardian of Fire
Floga

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.710
The Spirit Guardian of Fire, Floga.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.180
I have high hopes for you!

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.800
The Spirit Guardian of Wind
Smurik

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.850
The Spirit Guardian of Wind, Smurik.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.520
Hey, they seem pretty intense.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.390
This seems fun! Who do I get to fight first?!

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.770
Mimosa and Charlotte, please 
train with Sarado first.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.140
Understood.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.940
Very well.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.820
Leave it to me!

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.020
Finral, please learn from Smurik.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.820
Yes, sir!

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.920
Rill, Potrof shall be your mentor.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.400
Yeah, sure thing!

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.830
I'll be waiting for you in the forest!

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.250
Leopold and Magna will be under Floga's care.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.630
I hope you'll train me to the fullest!

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.000
You both seem really determined!

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.760
I can't wait to meet you in person!

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.220
Luck, I will be training you myself.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.810
As long as we get to put our lives 
on the line, I don't care who it is.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.770
What about me? Who's gonna be training me?

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.550
You do not have any mana whatsoever.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.700
We may be Spirit Guardians, but we 
cannot make mana grow from nothing.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.440
Huh?! Then why the heck did I come here?!

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.060
But you are one of the mages

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.540
at the arcane stage, who could
 possibly defeat the devil.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.100
I would like you to spar with me 
so I can gauge your strength.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.540
We will figure out the details after that.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.540
Spar with you? Okay, got it!

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.420
As for the other mage at 
the arcane stage, Nero...

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.790
I will be training her myself.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.180
The queen will be training Nero personally?

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.840
I look forward to working with you, Nero.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.730
And as for Noelle, 
Undine and I will be training you.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.940
Let's do our best.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.330
Yes, all right.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.220
This covers the assignments for the training.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.360
Hang on a second!

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.470
What is it, Magna?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:15.950
Is there any way I can continue going 
at it with Luck and train under you?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.450
Very well.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.850
Hell yeah!

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.340
Aw, sure. But do you think you'll 
be able to keep up with me?

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.460
Of course I can!

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.430
The rest of you, as well, are not bound 
permanently to the assignments I have chosen.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.860
Once your mana grows a bit, please move 
on to a different Spirit Guardian.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.470
That will help you learn as much as possible.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.480
Now then, everyone, I look forward to 
working with all of you for a while.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.720
Right!

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.040
Magna uses flame magic, 
and Luck uses lightning magic.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.810
If natural magic attributes work better 
with the Heart Kingdom's techniques,

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.420
then these two are perfect, aren't they?

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.750
Essentially, yes.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.510
First, I will show you how to make 
mana words with natural mana.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.260
The hell is that?!

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.150
Without this, you cannot 
create this technique.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.090
By creating a technique using mana words,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.570
you can add simple orders to spells.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.520
For example...

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.740
Please dodge.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.740
Like this?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.890
Just like that, it means 
we are able to give it

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.710
orders like "chase him" or "become bigger."

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.330
That's awesome!

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.440
Huh...

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.250
All right! Let's do this!

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.260
Plants grow from the earth.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.760
In order to strengthen plant magic,
 you start with the earth.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.110
I somewhat understand what you're saying...

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.560
So you're telling us to understand the earth.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.180
It's probably quicker to show 
you than try to explain it.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.790
So this is the Heart Kingdom's technique.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.170
Though our magic attributes are different,

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.030
we're in the same boat when it 
comes to understanding nature.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.670
If you can master this, your magic 
will instantly power up!

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.770
That's rather surprising. One of my 
subordinates uses similar magic,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.930
but yours is much faster and more powerful.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.330
From the looks of it, you all 
just rely on your own mana,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.210
and can't use natural mana at all.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.770
So you're telling us to become able to do that.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.440
And how do we do that?

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:59.950
You just gather it, like "swoosh," from 
a <i>huge</i> area, and bam, you're all set.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.950
Um, could you be more specific, please?

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.670
You just sense mana, like, "ding, ding, ding."

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.700
Once you feel it, you've just 
gotta go whoosh and swoosh.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.000
Then we can talk about technique.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.600
That's far too vague...

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.550
He seems a bit different.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.590
The wind that comes down 
from the mountains,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.470
the wind that rises from the ocean...

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.170
All the wind passes through this valley.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.480
I see. So that's why the 
wind is so strong here.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.480
I was looking forward to the arrival 
of the boy chosen by the Wind Spirit.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.420
Oh, you mean Asta's rival.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.510
But you came to me instead. I'm sure 
there must be a deep meaning behind that.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.290
I mean, I think Gaja decided that, but...

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.010
Now, what will you do?

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.150
Is this training?

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.900
Has our training already begun?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:21.240
Whether this is training or not, the wind 
that blows between us does not change.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.160
Isn't that right?

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.950
I can't seem to figure this 
guy out. Is he really okay?

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.930
Spatial magic's main purpose 
is to support your friends.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.570
Isn't that what you think?

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.920
Yes... and?

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.920
Then if someone targets you, do you 
just expect your friends to save you?

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.380
Does that truly make you a supporter?

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.860
What you must do is not 
necessarily just one thing.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.890
Crap!

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.400
Well, what now?

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.360
Please continue!

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.280
Very well. Anywhere the wind blows.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.530
What a beautiful day! 
A perfect day for training.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.220
I look forward to working with you, Floga!

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.780
First, let's see your magic.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.040
About 80% of your power is enough.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.300
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.630
Nice. If this is what you can do at 80%, 
you've got a fair bit of potential.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.310
No, this is nowhere near enough.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.740
I must learn much more 
and become even stronger.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.310
I don't want this chance to go to waste.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.570
Agreed.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.260
I realize I may come off 
as rude when I say this,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.490
but I'd like to see your powers.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.320
Mine?

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.570
I want to see with my own eyes 
whether I can learn anything from you.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.820
Ah, so that's what you mean. 
Well, in that case...

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.870
I think that about does it.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.150
I apologize for doubting your strength.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.900
Don't worry about it.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.810
It was so intense... I want to 
make that intensity my own!

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.620
Your potential is far greater than mine.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.000
Once you learn how to use natural mana,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.320
it won't be that difficult 
for you to do what I just did.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.490
You're on the right track.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.160
But it's not easy getting 
full control of natural mana.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.410
I look forward to working with you, Floga!

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.290
You've gotta push harder, Magna!

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.330
Your magic is far too weak, after all.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.470
What?!

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.690
You're around the fifth stage.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.470
To use these techniques in battle, 
you need to be third stage or higher.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.310
What the heck is this? It's super fun!

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.560
It appears that he has a knack for this.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.740
Guess I'm just gonna get 
stronger on my own, then.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.380
Magna...

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.970
Just leave him alone, Asta.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.000
If he can't get any stronger,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.710
it just means that's all he's worth.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.770
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.920
As I stated earlier, I'm going 
to measure your strength.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.430
Please come at me with everything you have.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.680
I get to fight someone who's almost 
on a par with the Wizard King!

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.550
Let's have a good match!

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.860
I think this is a good spot.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.070
So what are we going to do for training?

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.240
We're going to bask in the natural mana.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.230
Plants and animals...

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:57.200
The earth, water, wind, sunlight... 
This place is rich with life,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.120
so it's also overflowing with mana.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.630
Now that you mention it, 
I think I can feel that.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.300
And don't ever forget that feeling.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.050
You need mana words to create the 
techniques we use in the Heart Kingdom.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.720
You'll be able to use mana words as you please

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.800
once you become one with natural mana.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.060
Wow!

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.060
I can feel something welling up inside me

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.280
after seeing you use your magic like this.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.610
Then why not try using mana 
words as your heart desires?

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.560
It probably won't go perfectly as 
planned at first, but that's fine.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.720
All right.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.830
Er, that's not quite right. 
You need to use mana words—

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.430
I feel the need to create 
welling up within me!

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:52.390
Uh... I see that you're an excellent painter,
 so why not try writing mana words?

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.930
Mana words... like this.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.310
Like this?

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.430
My painting!

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.700
Unbelievable.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.110
You were able to write that many mana 
words after seeing them just once...

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.950
Rill, keep that up.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.440
No, don't go painting again!

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:14.220
Thanks for your help. I think this painting 
is going to be even better for it.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.950
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.140
Hey, you're from the Black Bulls...

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:28.610
Aren't you Queen Loropechika's pet...
 er, I mean, guest?

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.710
Weren't you enjoying a 
meal back at the palace?

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:37.350
Well, I ate all the food there, 
so I came here in search for new foods, la.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.680
You're telling me you've depleted 
all of the palace's reserves?

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.960
Yup.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.460
Well, since you came all the 
way to the Heart Kingdom,

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.360
why not learn the Heart Kingdom's techniques?

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.320
Well, right now, I just want to eat 
as many delicious noms as I can.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.700
Oh, don't be like that. See, look.
 These are mana words.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.450
They're really convenient to be able to use.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.480
Ah! Looks like we have 
another genius on our hands!

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.250
But it's not complete just yet.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.330
Listen well. You use mana 
words and natural mana to...

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:20.230
I think there's even more delicious 
fruit further in the forest.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.780
If we go further into the forest,

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.690
I'm sure I'll find some scenery 
that'll spark my inspiration!

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.690
I'm begging you two, please listen to me.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.030
Now, let's have you train us,
 Loropechika and Undine.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.950
Of course. But first, 
I have a request for you two.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.410
Please save me.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.190
As things stand, this curse will kill me.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.240
Before that happens...

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.400
We know. We'll defeat the 
devil before that happens.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.260
That's why we're all here to train.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.760
The four of us here will strike 
down the devil Megicula.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.020
Could you explain what you mean?

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.920
Of course, we will need 
everyone else's help in order

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.990
to stop the invasion from the Spade Kingdom.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.860
But Megicula... The one that 
Megicula possesses, the mage Vanica...

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.790
We don't stand a chance

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:23.390
against that one unless Undine and I, 
as well as the two of you, join forces.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.790
And you know how this Vanica fights. 
That's why you're saying that.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:37.350
My duty is to fight alongside 
Loropechika, as well as protect her.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.800
But the two of us were no match for Vanica.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.450
It's my fault that Loropechika has to 
deal with the fear of impending death.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.640
No, it's not your fault, Undine.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.810
Those possessed by the devil cannot 
be defeated by ordinary means.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.410
So you're saying if you have 
Nero and me with you,

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.820
we'll be able to win using
 unconventional means.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.970
We can't be certain just yet.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.700
But I've come to the conclusion that 
if the four of us work together,

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.580
we may come closest to that result.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.090
Please... help us so that 
we can save Loropechika.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.080
Nero's arcane stage...

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.970
Noelle's combative spirit 
and fighting style...

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.900
If you two grow along with Undine and me,

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.270
we should be able to defeat Vanica, 
as well as Megicula, who possesses her.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.140
I'll believe you.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.470
Nero, you're doing this, too.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.610
Thank you.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.870
You don't need to thank us.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.800
I have my own reasons for wanting to 
defeat Megicula with my own hands.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.620
Very well. Then let us begin.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.960
All right! Come at me from wherever!

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.850
You've got the right idea.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.600
But if you can't figure out your 
opponent's powers, there's no point.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.610
This isn't good. At this rate, 
I won't be able to support my friends!

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.790
Keep zooming at me! 
Keep using those mana words!

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.700
Then you'll eventually get the hang of it!

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.840
This time, I'll get you!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.040
The power to nullify magic is unrivaled.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.400
But your vision is so narrow that you can't 
use your powers to their full potential.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.400
Not yet!

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.270
Solely relying on how tough 
you are in your fighting style

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.920
will not keep working forever.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.360
To use those powers to their full potential,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.380
it's only logical that you use 
them to back up your friends.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.920
Please let me try again!

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.930
I guess you won't be satisfied with that.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.940
Yeah, they're working me 
to the bone from day one.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.450
Not just me. All of us!

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.940
So, are you seeing any progress?

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.430
It looks like everyone else has already 
learned the Heart Kingdom's techniques,

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.450
so I think it's unlikely that we won't get 
stronger if we keep this up every day.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.230
Oh? Well, keep up the good work.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.040
Yes, sir!

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.710
Looks like they're all trying 
to surpass their limits.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.210
So I guess I need to work a bit harder, too.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:45.130
Everyone's gone out training, so the 
Black Bulls' hideout is super quiet.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:49.530
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 156: "Awakening Powers."

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 156
Awakening Powers

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.430
Guess I should push harder, too.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.430
And no, I don't mean in the bathroom.
