00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.740
I would always close my eyes

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.070
And cower at reality

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.770
I can't stand the idea

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.120
Of just making excuses to give up

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.300
Stand right there

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.400
I don't want to be near you

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.540
Any minute now

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.920
Just wait right there

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.920
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.010
Black and blue

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.930
I'll give up on giving up

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.430
And get the world on my side

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.320
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.450
And head where the light shines

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.290
I want to keep my promise

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.830
I'll deliver it to you

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.820
shape of love

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.570
Assembly at the Royal Capital

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.400
What?!

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.230
I was asleep for a week?

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.010
Honestly, how many days were 
you planning on sleeping?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.780
Noelle was so worried about you 
that she kept checking on you.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.440
I-I wasn't worried...

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.860
I was just wondering what we were 
going to do if he didn't wake up.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.460
Pretty sure that's called being worried.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.170
Thanks, Noelle.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.800
I was worried, too. But I'm glad 
you all came back safely.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.210
Getting rest is important, too,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.430
because that's how much energy you 
used up conquering that dungeon.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.030
But it was a week...

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.850
Stop with this nonsense.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.090
Do you think that my goddess,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.240
my sister Marie, would enjoy 
listening to all this?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.170
Talk about something more interesting.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.550
I only have 3,214 stories stocked up for her.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.370
When exactly are you going 
to tell her all those?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.100
How are you feeling? Is the hole 
in your stomach closed up yet?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.300
Can you fight me now? Can you?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.760
It's not completely closed up yet. 
In fact, my stomach's so empty, I'm starving...

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.340
Everyone! The Sheep Cooks made breakfast!

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.770
Yum! So good! Delicious!

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.910
Jeez, calm down.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.850
Thanks...

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.570
You're such a pig.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.660
Now, now. He needs his nutrients.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.970
Want a taste?

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.030
No, he can't!

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.570
So good!

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.790
Nice, nice! Your eating form is excellent!

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.710
The Sheep Cooks are delighted, too.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.850
I think I'll have some 
breakfast and go back to bed.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.510
Captain! Good morning!

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.570
Morning.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.970
You finally awake, kid? 
I guess you didn't die.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.970
I-I'm alive!

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.460
Good work, even though you 
always come back banged up.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.560
Thanks!

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.140
Oh, yeah. Apparently, Magic Knights
Headquarters wants a report on the dungeon,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.070
so if you can walk, pay them a visit.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.240
Huh?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240
A report?

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.000
The Magic Knights Headquarters?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.810
La?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.860
Sounds like there'll be 
lots of strong guys there!

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.620
I wonder if I can fight them.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.460
You'd probably cause trouble if you went,
so you're not going, Luck.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.020
Aw...

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.590
Instead, there's a fighting mission,
so go on that with Magna.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.590
Fighting mission?

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.930
Let's do our best, Magna!

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.970
Huh? Creepy!

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.630
Are you really Luck? Are you sure 
you're not Grey in disguise?

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.930
Oh, there he is.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.150
Ooh, pick me! I'll go instead!

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.870
I wonder what yummy things 
await me in the Noble Realm.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.700
Uh, there's no way you can go. 
All you do every day is eat.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.700
La?!

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.410
La... La!

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.580
Captain, I have to write a 
letter to Marie, so I can't go.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.570
Sure. No one asked you, anyway.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.750
Can I go—

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.260
Clover Kingdom Royal Capital

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.930
This is awesome! It's this huge up close?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.570
Oh, come on.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.790
Could you calm down? You're embarrassing me.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.890
So awesome!

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.110
Hey!

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.930
I'm alone with Asta.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.870
Wow! It's so huge!

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.410
How long must you keep saying that?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.120
This is completely normal.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.120
Oh?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.710
Well, hello! If it isn't the members 
of the Golden Dawn!

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.080
Ah, it's been a week, Asta.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.960
Are you here to give a report, as well?

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.650
Have your wounds completely healed?

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.930
Yeah! My stomach still hurts a little,
but I ate lots and slept lots, so I'm fine!

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.900
What are you, a kid?

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.310
Who are you calling a kid?!

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.250
You.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.220
You're the same age as me!

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.820
I'm better because of your 
magic, Mimosa. Thanks.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.580
Why'd she run away?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.030
When you raised your hand, your arm was 
shorter than expected, and it startled her,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.980
maybe?

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.200
What the hell?! Yuno, you jerk!

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.200
See?

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.700
Damn it!

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.700
Unbelievable.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.750
What's wrong, Mimosa?

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.540
Mimosa?

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.760
I don't know what to do, Noelle.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.850
I, um... Whenever I see Asta, 
my chest feels tight.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.560
Ever since that day,
all I can think about is Asta.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.450
What in the world is wrong with me?

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.280
What?!

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.190
I wonder if he'll hate me 
after I ran away like that.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.980
Wh-Why him? He's a peasant, 
he's stupid, short, loud...

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.700
I find all those things endearing.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.620
And the contrast between that and his body...

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.370
Could this be...

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.520
No, no, no. That meathead is just...

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.880
Wait. Why do I sound so desperate?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.920
No, no, no!

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.130
I don't feel anything for that idiot!

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.790
What are they moaning about?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.640
Maybe they have a headache.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.650
I believe headquarters is this way.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.980
I guess there are things even 
you don't know, four-eyes.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.900
Indeed, there are.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.550
He's apparently content with 
being called "four-eyes" now.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.780
He's much nicer to Asta now.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.790
We don't often get to come to headquarters.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.170
Y-Your Majesty!

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.130
I never expected you to welcome us yourself.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.970
Who's that flashy old guy?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:25.190
You fool! That's the current 
Wizard King, Julius Novachrono!

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.190
What?!

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.720
This guy is the current...

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.110
...Wizard King?!

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.100
Well done acquiring this.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.220
This magic was probably the most 
important relic in that dungeon.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.030
You can read that?

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.370
Somewhat.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.570
The most important relic! So cool!

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.230
I see...

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.920
He's so excited...

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.360
I guess the rumors about the Wizard King 
being a total magic nerd were true.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.070
Hey, would you try using this magic?

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.580
Please?!

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.710
I'm sorry. I think it activated 
in the dungeon once, but...

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.130
I haven't been able to use it since.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.680
What?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.840
I see... Aw, that's too bad.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.220
Sylph, the Wind Spirit of 
the Four Great Attributes...

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.060
Apparently she's chosen him this era.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.380
All I can say for now

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:52.310
is that this spell will grow with you and, 
one day, become an extraordinary power.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.530
Take good care of it.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.400
Yes, sir.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.370
Wizard King! My grimoire has 
some weird scribbles in it, too!

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.950
Please look at it!

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.870
Hey, you're being rude.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.370
This is...

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.000
This is?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.880
Something I can't read at all.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.030
I've never even seen this 
writing in any documents.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.720
This thing pops out of it! Take a look!

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.720
Ah, a second anti-magic sword!

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.270
I got mine to work.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.560
A-Anti-magic... C-Can I touch that?

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.320
Go right ahead!

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.220
Thank... you?! It's so heavy!

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.780
Are you all right, Wizard King?!

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.500
I'm amazed that you can 
actually swing this around.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.650
My magical power... is being absorbed.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.830
I see.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.290
Thank you. You can have this back now.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.830
Yes, sir.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.210
This is beyond my abilities.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.760
It appears you're able to wield it 
because you have no magic.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.020
How did you know I don't have any magic, sir? 
And about my sword that cuts through magic?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.440
That's a very good question.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.060
Well, anyway, you all did 
splendidly. Good work.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.030
U-U-Um, d-d-do you have a moment?

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.530
What is it?

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.730
H-How...

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.950
...do you become the Wizard King?

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.210
I see. So you both want 
to become the Wizard King.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.670
Any Magic Knight should have that aspiration.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.180
You two! It's rude to ask
the Wizard King that directly.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.460
Listen. The Wizard King must be proud 
and have the trust of the people—

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.390
No.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.770
It's merit.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:02.320
You can't protect others with pride,
and the trust of others comes with merit.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.780
There is only one thing people 
want from the Wizard King...

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.290
Merit that proves they are the best.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.310
Gain merit.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:17.040
Continuously gaining merit is everything.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.800
Anyone who can't do that 
can never stand at the top.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.510
Bring it on!

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.290
Your newbies have very determined eyes,

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.330
William, Yami.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.020
Now, then...

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.320
We're actually holding a decoration 
ceremony for the Magic Knights who've been

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.490
awarded an outstanding number of stars today.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.070
Deco...?

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.440
Decoration ceremony.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.580
It's a ceremony where we award those who 
have done exceptionally well and honor them.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.540
Wow...

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.290
I would love for all of you to join us.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.770
Huh?

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.550
I wonder what decoration ceremonies are like.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.970
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.210
I could never have imagined this happening.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.370
Now, then...

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.070
Can you give me better results than them?

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.760
Now, then... let us begin 
the decoration ceremony.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:56.890
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
Senior Magic Knight, First~Fifth Class
Intermediate Magic Knight, First~Fifth Class
Junior Magic Knight, First Class
Junior Magic Knight, Second Class
Junior Magic Knight, Third Class 
Junior Magic Knight, Fourth Class
Junior Magic Knight, Fifth Class

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:51.400
Magic Knights of the Clover Kingdom are given
ranks to indicate their level of ability.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.890
The ranks are further divided into sub-ranks,
with the Wizard King at the top.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.330
If knights are awarded a prescribed number

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.850
of stars in the time before the 
annual decoration ceremony,

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:08.530
they are given a new rank by the Wizard King.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:15.290
With seven stars earned,
Leopold Vermillion of the Crimson Lion Kings,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.890
I grant you the title of 
Intermediate Magic Knight, Second Class.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.180
You use the same flame 
magic as your older brother,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.300
the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings. 
Your power is overwhelming.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.010
Make sure you don't go overboard.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:36.270
Member of the Crimson Lion Kings
<font size="30">Leopold Vermillion</c>

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.270
Evil needs no mercy.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.020
With six stars earned, Sol Marron 
of the Blue Rose Knights,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.730
I grant you the title of
Intermediate Magic Knight, Third Class.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.740
You're as dynamic as the men,
and your creative earth magic is amazing.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.970
But you might be a bit
too much of a free spirit.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:57.290
Member of the Blue Rose Knights
<font size="30">Sol Marron</c>

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.290
The only one who can tie me down is my sis,

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.870
the captain.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:05.380
With six stars earned,
Solid Silva of the Silver Eagles,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.410
I grant you the title of
 Intermediate Magic Knight, Third Class.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.200
The maneuverability of 
your magic is amazing,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.910
Member of the Silver Eagles
Solid Silva

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.170
but I think you'd be even more amazing

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.210
if you stopped showing off your powers
 and cooperated with others.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.100
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.650
With nine stars earned,
Nebra Silva of the Silver Eagles,

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.590
I grant you the title of
Senior Magic Knight, Fifth Class.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.960
The skillful illusions you create 
with your mist magic are splendid.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:38.680
Member of the Silver Eagles
Nebra Silva

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.560
Just make sure you don't play with 
the enemy more than necessary,

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.820
or you might get bitten.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.540
I thank you for the warning.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:48.050
With seven stars earned,
Hamon Caseus of the Golden Dawn,

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.790
I grant you the title of
Intermediate Magic Knight, Second Class.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.050
Just by looking at you, the enemy 
would never expect your glass magic,

00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:00.080
Member of the Golden Dawn
Hamon Caseus

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.460
and I bet they're completely boggled.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.450
I thank you, Your Majesty.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:07.770
With eight stars earned,
Shiren Tium of the Golden Dawn,

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.750
I grant you the title of
Intermediate Magic Knight, First Class.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.860
Unlike your eloquent magic, 
you're a very quiet fellow,

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:21.830
Member of the Golden Dawn
Shiren Tium

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.940
so you'd be better off if 
you spoke your mind more.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.830
Understood.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:27.840
With eleven stars earned,
Alecdora Sandler of the Golden Dawn,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.530
I grant you the title of
Senior Magic Knight, Second Class.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:36.560
You amaze me with your 
diligence and flexible magic.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.310
Member of the Golden Dawn
Alecdora Sandler

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.240
You can probably relax a 
little more once in a while.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.810
I am honored, Your Majesty.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.490
The Golden Dawn has earned 
a total of 71 stars.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.860
They are the clear leaders.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.580
I hope the rest of the squads do 
their best to not fall behind.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.920
Well done, all of you.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.700
Now then, there's a simple reception 
set up for you, so go enjoy yourselves.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.050
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.870
I've invited some special guests today.

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.550
Make sure you get to know 
each other very well.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.270
Wizard King,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.460
regarding that matter...

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:18.140
Something came up, so I have to 
excuse myself, but have fun!

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.890
Huh?

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.360
All those stares are beginning to hurt.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.010
How are we supposed to enjoy this?

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.410
Why is the Wizard King 
entertaining us like this?

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.220
Not to mention the Wizard 
King went off somewhere...

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.270
The heck is this?!

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.540
I've never eaten anything like this!

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.500
So good!

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.190
How can you be so bold? You're amazing, Asta.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.760
No, he's just unrefined.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.440
So good!

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.210
U-Um, Asta...

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.180
May I join you?

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.150
Oh, Mimosa, were you eyeing this meat, too?

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.070
Huh? Oh... Yes, it looks quite delicious.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.430
Vulgar peasant.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.740
Why did the Wizard King 
invite such lowborn scum?

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.550
I can't sense any magic from him.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.120
Them capturing the dungeon 
must've been sheer luck.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.810
The way he eats is disgusting.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.130
It's unnatural for him to be here. Filthy rat.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:40.770
Man, listen to them tear into me.
Good thing I'm used to it.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.580
H-He's so forgiving!

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.770
You also have a peasant in your squad.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.690
The peasant who's forgotten his place 
since everyone fawns over him

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.100
because of the four-leaf grimoire he has.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.780
I could've handled capturing 
that dungeon even better.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.240
That's quite confident, crimson brat.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.080
It's not like we expect 
anything from that peasant.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:17.170
We are the ones who embody Lord Vangeance 
and the Golden Dawn's ideals.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.150
W-With all due respect...

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.620
That goes for you as well, Klaus.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.670
Aren't you ashamed, being here 
with your lack of skill?

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.810
I...

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.930
And Mimosa!

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:34.190
I heard that you were wounded early on 
in the dungeon and left the front line.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.480
To think that you're royalty of 
the Vermillion line is laughable.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.820
I-I'm terribly sorry.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.780
N-No, Mimosa was...

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:51.000
Now, now. The most useless fool here...

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.630
is you.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.210
Wouldn't you agree, Noelle?

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.510
Solid...

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.140
H-How could you?

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.810
You can't even control your magic. 
You're such an embarrassment.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.620
You've basically been exiled 
from the Silva family.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.360
I'm surprised you had the nerve 
to return to the Noble Realm.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.950
Nebra...

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.700
You got a big head from one achievement.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.860
Did you come here intending to bring
shame upon the Silva name?

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.870
N-Nozel...

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.380
You do not belong here.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.380
Begone,

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.880
failure that killed our mother.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.230
There's no reason to run from these jerks.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.410
Asta?

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:06.450
I thought you'd all be amazing 
since you were called here,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.700
but you're no different from the rest of them!

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:15.290
Calling us peasants, rats, 
embarrassments, failures...

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.540
Who cares if you think we're worthy or not?!

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.300
Just you watch! I'm going to—

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.420
That's enough, you scoundrel.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.150
You shouldn't even be allowed to talk!

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.220
Silence!

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.520
I won't shut up!

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.830
He just...

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.310
Listen up, you bastards!

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.310
I'm going to pile up merit,

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.570
become the Wizard King,

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.330
and shut you all up!

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.570
And push me forward

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.640
(I can't find a place to go)

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:27.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.660
(Break free yourself)

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:03.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.290
Petit Clover

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.710
Petit Clover!

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.800
My Magic

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.270
My Magic.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.150
I'll show you my magic. It's hex magic.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.450
In the next ten minutes...

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:34.800
you'll blink.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:36.700
Let's <i>Go</i>rdon!

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.810
Hey, Asta!

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.650
You're being rude to the senior 
members of the Magic Knights!

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.420
Apologize, right now!

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.020
I'll even apologize with you!
