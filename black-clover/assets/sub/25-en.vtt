00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.630
The mysterious enemy,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.840
controlling an army of the dead
to attack the royal capital,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.730
was restrained by Fuegoleon, 
along with Asta's help.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.980
Couldn't you think of any other way to get 
people to acknowledge your power?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.090
What?

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.370
Well done, Magic Knights.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.030
No—

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.850
Most of the Magic Knights were sent

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.860
far away from the royal 
capital with spatial magic.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.010
I figured they must've had a rather 
skilled spatial magic user, but...

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.890
To think they were able 
to send us all this far.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.100
This is spatial magic.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.900
Very well. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.010
The captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.360
Fuegoleon Vermillion, was also
sent away somewhere.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.410
You're...

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.210
Meanwhile, Yuno was able to escape 
the spatial magic attack,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.100
but while battling a witch who
used ash curse magic,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.050
he ended up losing his sight, 
hearing, and other senses.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.670
But...

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.490
Not yet!

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.890
Let me just tell you one thing about me.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.060
I...

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.970
hate losing more than anything else!

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.400
Wind Spirit Magic: Sylph's Breath!

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.720
I would always close my eyes

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.050
And cower at reality

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.720
I can't stand the idea

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.100
Of just making excuses to give up

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.200
Stand right there

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.400
I don't want to be near you

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.540
Any minute now

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.900
Just wait right there

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.900
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.990
Black and blue

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.910
I'll give up on giving up

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.410
And get the world on my side

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.300
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.430
And head where the light shines

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.270
I want to keep my promise

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.810
I'll deliver it to you

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.820
shape of love

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.530
Adversity

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.830
Castle Town Kikka

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.410
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.840
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.770
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.850
So good!

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.350
The way you eat is fantastic,

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.610
you shrimp!

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.230
All right! Eat, eat, and eat some more!

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.240
'Kay...

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.660
The country's in danger!
What the heck are these two doing?

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.310
If it's not enough, I'll make
as much as you want!

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.120
'Kay!

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.100
La?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.920
A witch?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.800
We're being attacked!

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.370
That's why we told you we should run!

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.930
Sir, hurry!

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.830
Come on, shrimp, we gotta go!

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.290
I need... mana.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.650
I need to steal some!

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.400
She's overflowing with mana...

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.370
It's glistening on her skin!

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.950
I need to steal it!

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.510
Give it to me!

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.520
Give it to me!

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.140
Give it to you? You can't mean...

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.550
My food?!

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.770
N-No!

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.360
Give it to me!

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.930
No!

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.200
This mana... That woman must still be alive.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.090
I'm reaching my limit.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.250
What is this overflowing magic?

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.170
Give it to me!

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.210
La...

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.970
I told you...

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.600
I told you no.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.130
I-Impossible!

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:35.400
Cotton Creation Magic:
Strike of the Sleeping Sheep.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.410
Th-That's amazing!

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.180
How'd you like that?!

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.360
The food that I cooked with all my soul 
powered up the shrimp's magic!

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.190
Seriously?! We'll follow you forever, sir!

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.810
Thank you so much!

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.080
Glad ya liked it!

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.450
None shall ever lay a finger on my food.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.950
And don't you ever come back!

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.930
Am I pretty?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.640
Eliza...

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.720
I'll love you no matter how you look.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.680
I love you, too.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.820
Eliza!

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.360
My love!

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.200
La!

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.710
La!

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.960
My food!

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.090
My noms!

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.630
A kid?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.610
That tremendous magical power 
I felt earlier... was from her?

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.940
A Black Bulls robe... So it was her.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.690
M-My noms?

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.420
Noms? Oh, here. I'm not sure 
what's going on, but...

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.250
Thank y—

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.630
La!

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.640
My meal-saving prince has arrived!

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.640
Meal-Saving Prince

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.410
Th-Thank you...

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.400
Sure...

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.940
U-Um...

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.800
N-Name...

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.740
Short ribs?

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.950
Oh, yeah. They're delicious! Try some!

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:22.170
No, I mean... Wh-What is <i>your</i> name?

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:28.340
Um, I mean, I like meat, too, but...

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.000
As you'd expect...

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.210
That spell wears out my body 
and uses a ton of mana...

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.670
But what I was wondering 
about is your name...

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.160
I need to learn how to use it better.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.310
Look out!

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.360
La... La! Got it!

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.390
La la la...

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.460
Well, I guess I might as well eat...

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.870
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.270
It's rather noisy out there.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.770
King's Quarters

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.490
Could you shut them up?

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.010
It's time for my royal nap.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.380
I'll look into it.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.200
He should be back any moment now.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.230
The "He" in Question

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.030
You're the best shrimp ever!

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.070
Uh-huh!

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.260
Come see me whenever you're hungry. 
I'll let you eat all you want.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.890
Yay!

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
North District

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:52.050
You bastard! What have you 
done with my brother?!

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.890
Leopold! He's not the spatial magic user.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.810
That spell pinpointed him,

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.890
so there's no way the spellcaster 
could've cast it from far away.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.860
Where could they be?

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.460
Huh? Asta?

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.360
You're right there!

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.130
He was hiding among the corpses?!

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.020
I'm impressed you found me.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.910
I figured I'd be found if 
I used magic to transform,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.570
so I went to the trouble of 
making this filthy disguise.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.090
What are you, an animal?

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.070
But it appears that it's over now.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.680
Over?

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.580
What's over?

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.810
Fuegoleon!

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.580
But...

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.930
But he's so strong.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.580
That's... impossible...

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.640
H-His arm...

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.190
Fuegoleon...

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.110
Fuegoleon... Fuegoleon!

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.120
That's impossible... There's 
no way Fuegoleon would lose.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.120
My brother wouldn't...

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.120
Captain Fuegoleon's grimoire...

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.630
It's still intact, which means... he's still alive!

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.910
We have to stop the bleeding!

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.010
Impossible... That's impossible...

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.050
If only Mimosa were here...

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.810
Oh, no... His grimoire is breaking apart!

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.410
Leopold, help me!

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.950
Fuegoleon...

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.990
Leopold! Your captain is...

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.490
That's what you get for 
talking down to me earlier!

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.000
Leopold!

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.010
A magic blast...

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.690
What you lacked to overcome adversity...

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.490
was a righteous heart.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:55.220
A righteous heart?! I've always
been true to myself!

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.460
Keep yappin' in the next world,
Fuegoleon Vermillion!

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.290
We've completed our mission.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.720
We're leaving before the other 
Magic Knights come back, Rades.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.770
Hold it... right there.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.120
Asta, wasn't it?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.400
I'll eventually kill you and make
you into one of my toys.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.600
Look forward to that, you little brat!

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:35.990
Asta!

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.870
This distance... I'm not gonna make it.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:45.790
Don't!

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.880
If you move any more while 
you're bleeding that much...

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.210
Not yet!

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.980
The captain of the Crimson 
Lion Kings just taught me...

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.260
I need to think calmly.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.200
How can I stop him?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.770
That spatial magic...

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.020
Not giving up is my magic!

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.540
And my sword can...

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.070
Cut through magic!

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.560
What?!

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.280
Ow! What the hell are
you doing, you little shit?!

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.290
Not good...

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.010
You have the nerve to say that 
after hurting all those people?!

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.850
This...

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.300
is pain!

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.980
This is what you did to innocent people 
as you laughed about it!

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:49.990
Stop!

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.400
Getting hurt and bleeding 
are signs of being weak!

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.860
Those who lack magic should just 
get their asses beat by those

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.200
who are more powerful!

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.040
Especially... pieces of trash like 
you who don't have any magic!

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.680
I'm here to make sure...

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.130
that doesn't happen!

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.470
And...

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.530
Even those without magic 
can become the best!

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.480
I'm going to prove that by 
becoming the Wizard King!

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.120
Valtos! Do something!

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.450
If I could, I would've by now.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.070
That anti-magic is more 
troublesome than I'd imagined.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.210
Looks like we're going to have 
to take care of him first.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.470
He's gathering magic? What's he—

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.890
Is he going to attack using spatial magic?

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.730
Asta, look out!

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.430
Too late!

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.700
How can I be panicking?

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.700
I always need to remain calm...

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.910
Right, Fuegoleon?!

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.750
Leopold!

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.830
This isn't good... We can't 
afford to lose Rades, too.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.230
D-Damn you all! Get away! Stay back!

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.110
Pathetic.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.630
We received orders from Master 
to come here, and look at you...

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.320
You're struggling against 
this lot. How pathetic.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.680
Such piercingly cold magic...

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.790
There are five new enemies!

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.690
I was only scratched... but thanks to 
that curse, the bleeding won't stop.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.490
If I lose any more blood, I'm in trouble.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.290
No one asked for your help!

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.250
Aw, you should be thanking us.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.780
If we hadn't arrived,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.960
you definitely would've been
captured and dissected alive.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.250
And if you're gonna be dissected, 
I want to be the one to do it.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.170
Shut up!

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.580
Anyway, it looks like the tables have turned!

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.810
Asta!

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.030
You...

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.160
Now I can keep fighting!

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.330
Please watch me, sir!

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:35.250
This brat... He struck himself with his 
own swords to get rid of the curse?

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.250
Unbelievable... He's so stupid!

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.820
Wow, he's fun. Can I dissect him later?

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.220
Quiet.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.050
Boo. You're such a spoilsport.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.810
All I've ever faced since 
I was born... was adversity.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.580
No matter how many come at me,
no matter what happens,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.740
I'll blast them all away!

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.780
All right! Come at me!

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:33.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.570
And push me forward

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.610
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:43.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:49.390
And change the flow of time

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.620
(Break free yourself)

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:25.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:44.340
Petit Clover

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.750
Petit Clover!

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.840
They Won't Find Me

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.390
They Won't Find Me.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.510
Leopold! He's not the spatial magic user.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.510
That spell pinpointed him,

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.810
so there's no way the spellcaster 
could've cast it from far away.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.520
Where could they be?

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.510
They won't find me.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.120
I can't find him!

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.240
Nope!

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.200
I'll kill you.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:18.890
Nowhere to be found!

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.020
It's about time...

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.750
I'll make my grand entrance 
and surprise them!

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.850
I'm pretty sure they're not here.
Let's go look over there.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:28.820
Yeah.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.250
Let's see who can find them first!

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.250
What?

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.840
What...?

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.580
Magic Knights, eat my cooking and fight!

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.020
I'm going to fight my battle in the kitchen!

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.750

 Wounded Beasts

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.740
Cooking food with magic is my job!
