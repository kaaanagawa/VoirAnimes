00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.700
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.220
Vetto from the Eye of the Midnight Sun 
suddenly appeared before Asta and the others.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.140
He came to steal the magic stone 
that was in the Underwater Temple.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.690
Let's go, Kiato!

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.980
You got it, Asta!

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.990
How boring.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.530
Slow movements and weak attacks.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.790
I suppose I can't expect more from 
no-magic trash and hick scum.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.660
You sure know how to hurt a 
guy's feelings, you hairy gorilla.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
We'll show you what happens when 
trash and scum get serious!

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.840
Asta and Kiato struggled,
but Vetto was just too strong.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.090
Did you get your hopes up?

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.310
These childish attacks won't work on me!

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.060
Not yet...

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.650
No-magic trash! Prancing around 
with weapons too good for you...

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.110
So what?!

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.910
You never had any hope of winning.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.450
Now... scream! Despair!

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.030
Ib I gwabe up...

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.090
Fu curd I brotec?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.920
Huh?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.930
He said, "If I gave up, who could I protect?"

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.630
Awakening

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.530
Noelle...

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.740
Kahono!

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.280
I see that you two are next.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.830
Try to entertain me at least a little bit.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.500
Dad...

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.170
Magna... Luck!

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.920
Asta!

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.260
Everyone was defeated so easily...

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.510
Just how strong is this guy?

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.480
Not yet!

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.480
Losers... can get lost!

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.900
Asta!

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.690
Song Magic: Rhythm Cushion!

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.880
Thanks, Kahono.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.580
That'll just be a thousand yuls.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.140
I'll pay you back a hundredfold.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.880
Can you heal everyone with 
your song recovery magic?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.220
I can, but do you think that guy's 
going to wait for me to finish singing?

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.100
That's...

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.310
Hey!

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.030
Big Brother! Why are you sleeping?!

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.780
What happened to our promise to become an 
idol and dancer, and then become huge stars?!

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.790
We were going to become sibling 
idols who could sing and dance!

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.870
That's right!

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.860
Huh? He's your big brother?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.380
Yup. That moron over there 
is my big brother, Kiato.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.710
Who are you calling a moron?!

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.720
Ow...

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.930
If I hadn't softened the blow of 
that punch with my dance magic,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.790
he would've taken my head off.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.680
He's unbelievably strong.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.480
But...

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.350
The two of us dream of going to the surface!

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.570
That's right! If we want to fulfill that dream, 
we can't just sit around napping!

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.890
Let's go, Kahono!

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.740
Yeah!

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.630
Her mana's getting stronger?

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.130
Combo Spell:

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.010
Sea God Slash!

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.270
Sea God Slash is a song 
and dance combo spell.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.270
Dancing to Kahono's song 
reinforces my dance magic,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.530
and unleashes magic slashing attacks!

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.900
Amazing...

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.920
Kiato! Kahono!

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.420
You can do it! The two of you have got this!

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.170
You've worked so hard ever 
since you were little.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.790
I guess that's enough for today.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.680
No way. We'll never get rich if 
this was enough to tire us out.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.710
You're right. We can't become stars that way.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:25.110
Yup. Besides, we need to make sure our 
song and dance will please the sea god.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.840
Yeah, so we need to work harder.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.290
Okay, let's do this.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.090
Yeah!

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.610
Your hard work...

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.610
...won't betray you!

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.780
Oh? All this power

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.410
from a little bird's song 
and a mouse's dance.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.120
Frontier magic is truly intriguing.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.630
That's right! This spell was 
created because we're here!

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.000
We served the sea god, praying, 
singing and dancing...

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.510
We spent a long time that way, 
weaving the magic into our lives!

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.220
That's right! Ever since we were 
little, we've offered up this song

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.500
and dance to the sea god 
and the rest of our people!

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.770
This spell...

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.850
...is our bond with the people

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.270
of the Underwater Temple!

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.560
You can do it!

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.070
Kiato! Kahono!

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.820
Go, Kiato! Kahono!

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.690
We're not going to let you...

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.120
...break that bond!

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.120
Did they do it?

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.510
So what?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.380
No way...

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.140
Wha...

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.250
Kiato!

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.490
Big Brother!

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.920
Kiato!

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.460
Run, Kahono!

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.610
Dreams? Bonds?

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:43.350
People like you have no right 
to talk about such things!

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.730
Kahono!

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.420
Curse you!

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.860
Game Magic: Monster Toy!

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.080
Every last one of you thinks
this is some child's game.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:17.170
We're the ones who truly 
have dreams and bonds...

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.490
We, the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.480
The ones you broke...

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.890
Our golden dreams and our bonds of blood!

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.160
What is that fool talking about?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.150
You devil!

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.410
Now you won't be able to perform your 
silly songs and dances ever again.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.020
In other words, your cheap little 
dreams just went down the drain.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.620
Well, weakling? You grounded little bird...

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.540
Did you get a good taste of despair?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.640
I don't like those eyes.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:10.120
In that case, I'll have to rip 
off your wings one by one...

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.090
A bird that can't sing has no reason to live.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.530
I'll just...

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.920
Stop!

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.660
Let her go!

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.410
You think you can stop me with words?

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.080
If I miss, I might hit Kahono...

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.840
You never had any hope of winning.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.880
Now... scream! Despair!

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.960
I couldn't attack earlier, either.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.940
In any case, would my attacks 
even work on someone like him?

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.890
Are you finished? Then just 
watch from there, you loser.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.420
Everyone's fighting, even though 
they're getting torn to pieces.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.920
And yet, I...

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.730
I...

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.920
It's all right.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.930
Kahono?

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.280
That immense power inside you...

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.190
You'll be able to control it now, Noelle!

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.990
Because you're fighting to protect 
what's important to you.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.420
You're fighting to win!

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.570
What's important to me?

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.570
You'll be fine! There's no doubt about it...

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.960
Because I'm your friend, and I say so!

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.020
Hey...

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.230
It's shaking?

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.250
Wh-What's going on?

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.120
So you finally showed up,

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.600
Noelle!

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.330
I'll tell you one more time.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.420
What is this power?

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.800
Let my friend go!

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.350
Black Bulls girl,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.140
you're not letting what your 
siblings said get to you, are you?

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.940
There's no time for that on the battlefield!

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.520
One wrong decision and a life could be lost!

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:07.200
You're standing here right now 
as a member of the Magic Knights!

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.340
If you joined the Magic Knights 
of your own free will,

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.540
then steel yourself and get stronger!

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.700
Steel myself?

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.340
Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.960
However, staying weak is!

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.100
Let my friend go!

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.280
This power...

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.600
Girl, you're royalty?

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.820
So what if I am?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.110
That has nothing to do with this!

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.920
I'm Noelle Silva of the Black Bulls!

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.320
How dare you hurt my friends and comrades?!

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.700
I see...

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:55.870
I knew it.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.140
You're from the most corrupt clan!

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.050
Very well!

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.460
Come at me with all of your strength!

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.900
I'll force you and that 
sinful mana to your knees!

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.190
I'll defeat you,

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.900
whether you ask me to or not!

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.880
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.580
Th-The sea god?

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.020
I did it!

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.490
Take a look at that power!

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.610
Noelle, you little... I think you 
might've killed your limits there.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.450
She's the sea god incarnate... 
No, she's a goddess!

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.570
I always figured she had 
incredible latent ability,

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.660
but who would've thought she 
was such an attack mage?

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.400
Come live with me.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.000
It's not you who should despair.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.140
It's the people of the Clover Kingdom.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.600
Remember...

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.960
your true self.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.850
May you two be happy!

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.450
What...

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.330
This can't be!

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.130
The humans?!

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.850
I'll kill them!

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.530
Impressive... You managed 
to draw me out, human.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.930
What's with that eye?

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.930
And this eerie magic I've 
never felt before...

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.000
Mythical Beast Magic...

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.740
N-No way!

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.230
What in the world is that?

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.710
He regrew the arm he lost?

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.750
There isn't any magic like that!

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:15.250
The best that even the most powerful 
recovery spell can do is close wounds.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.780
These guys aren't just terrorists.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.890
They're something weirder... 
Something abominable!

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.390
Run... Get out of there, Noelle!

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.890
Run?

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.530
I...

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.910
won't run!

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.530
That's some fine resolve for an insect.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.170
Now, it's payback time.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.510
Vanish!

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.020
Mythical Beast Magic...

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.250
Sea Dragon's...

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.490
That last spell drained all my magic!

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.600
A-Asta!

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.140
Kid!

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.990
Not yet...

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.650
Not yet, damn it!

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.030
We haven't given up yet!

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.030
Not yet? Yes, not yet!

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.970
Starting now, I'll show you true despair!

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.340
Petit Clover

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.480
Petit Clover!

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.850
Mythical Beast Magic!

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.850
Mythical Beast Magic!

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.030
Hey, what were you saying during 
your mythical beast magic spells?

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.670
Very well, insect. I'll tell you.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.980
Who are you calling an insect?! I'm royalty!

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.530
This is the spell!

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.350
Easy, right? Read it.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.740
I can't read that.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.770
It's...

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:11.440
Say what?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.320
It's...

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.130
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers?

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.400
That's not it at all!

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.960
It's...

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.030
The only difference between a 
whale and a dolphin is their size?

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.590
Udon

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.710
Somen

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.840
Hiyamugi

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.890
The only difference between udon, somen, 
and hiyamugi is how thick they are!

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.550
Hawk

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.550
Eagle

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.240
Apparently hawks and eagles 
are the same birds, too.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.550
I did not know that!

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.490
Of course I knew that! I'm a royal!

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.770
What were we talking about again?

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.810
Insects, I'm getting tired 
of your incessant buzzing!

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.690
I'll crush you with my own hands, one by one!

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.860

 The Only Weapon

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.740
My magic is Mythical Beast Magic!
