WEBVTT

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.440
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.760
The list of Magic Knights who 
made it into the Royal Knights

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.260
was announced at last.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.600
Zora, one of those who passed, arrived late.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.650
Shiren Tium, Cob Portaport, and the 
Captain of the Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.090
were also added later on as support,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.650
making for a total of 20 Royal Knights.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.990
We have no use for anything 
other than victory!

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.370
The Eye of the Midnight Sun is

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.790
a terrorist organization that 
threatens the Clover Kingdom!

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.830
If we don't take care of them ourselves, 
there will never be peace in our land!

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.540
The Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.380
is located in...

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.580
a floating dungeon within the strong 
magic region known as Gravito Stones!

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.000
Storming the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's Hideout!!!

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.520
The Crimson Lion Kings' Headquarters

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.650
I thank you for coming, my rival!

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.780
The Crimson Lion Kings' Headquarters
Infirmary

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.780
I heard from my sister that you two 
passed the Royal Knights Exam.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.610
Yeah! We're finally gonna take 
down the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.610
We're leaving in three days.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.790
We're standing by in the royal capital 
until then so information won't be leaked.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.690
I see.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.550
Um...

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.350
Hm?

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.830
How's Fuegoleon doing?

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.260
He's still asleep.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.140
We still don't know what happened 
to him when he was captured

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.930
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun during 
their attack on the royal capital.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.260
Whatever they did,
I'm sure it was underhanded.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.190
Yet even then, my brother would just say...

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.570
"The reason I was unable to defeat 
them was my own weakness."

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.740
I will train even harder, 
catch up to all of you,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.660
and surpass you!

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.380
Leopold...

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.010
I will get revenge for Captain Fuegoleon,
 no matter what!

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.420
Captain Fuegoleon didn't laugh at 
my dream to become the Wizard King.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.260
He even called me a rival.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.390
The reason I'm here right now 
is because of Captain Fuegoleon.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.390
Me, too.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.310
Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.400
However, staying weak is!

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.150
Those words helped me grow stronger.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.990
Asta, Noelle, I'm counting on you.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.950
Yeah! For the sake of returning 
peace to this country...

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.950
...we'll defeat the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.370
Next time, let's fight together, Leo!

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.300
Of course! Be careful.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.100
Yeah!

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.080
We'll come by again.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.220
I hope Captain Fuegoleon 
and Finral both wake up soon.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.150
Not to mention...

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.160
The eerie feeling I got from that mana...

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.150
The Eye of the Midnight 
Sun might be behind that.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.070
We have to defeat them.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.340
Yeah...

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.060
But something's been bugging me.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.080
Huh?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.070
You remember what that hairy gorilla said?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.170
For some reason, they can't forgive us, either.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.590
We're fighting each other because 
we can't forgive each other.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.980
And I mean, if we could forgive each 
other, we wouldn't have to fight...

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.330
So that means...

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.040
Even <i>I </i>have no idea what I'm trying to say!

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.460
That's what you get for thinking 
so hard when you're so stupid.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.050
Don't call me stupid!

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.460
Then again, Captain Yami 
told me the same thing!

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.610
All right! At times like this,
 I need to work out!

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.120
First, my abs!

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.620
Next, my back muscles!

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.240
You meathead.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.630
Everything's cramping at once!

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.860
You can't be serious.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.120
Yuno! Mimosa and Mr. Glasses, too!

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.130
Did you come to visit Fuegoleon, too?

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.140
No, we're here for another reason.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:14.300
The Golden Dawn had the most members pass 
the Royal Knights Entrance Exam, after all.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.860
Asta! Are you all right?!

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.300
No need to worry about me!

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.850
I've trained every single muscle in my body!

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.480
We've been having fiery meetings with 
Captain Mereoleona these past few days

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.480
The only thing you haven't 
trained is your brain.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.740
so we don't let anyone down.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.820
Yup, exactly! It's super weak!

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.480
Hey, don't make fun of me!

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.820
If there's a spell to make someone smarter,
 could someone use it on Asta?

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.750
Oh, you're so nice, Yuno!

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.350
Don't make weird requests like that!

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.260
I'm terribly sorry. I can't think of any.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.910
I'm actually kinda disappointed!

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.810
Honestly...

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.170
We have a big battle ahead of us,
 and you show no sense of urgency.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.460
What if an enemy spy finds out our plan?

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.670
A spy?

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.010
It's entirely plausible.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.060
They were able to bribe the 
Captain of the Purple Orcas

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.020
to help them out with their 
attack on the royal capital.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.020
You can never be too cautious.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.670
True.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.530
We've gotta be careful.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.390
If you two are also heading to the 
royal capital, would you like a ride?

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.780
On my vessel.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.330
Wow, really? Awesome! Thanks!

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.960
Well, if you insist...

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.210
Royal Capital
Lodging House

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.210
So good!

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.470
So good! So good!

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.720
The food in the royal capital 
is on another level!

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.220
Oh, dear.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.260
Asta, you have some sauce on your mouth.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.150
Forgive me! I'm being too forward!

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.610
Thanks, Mimosa!

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.430
You're eating entirely too much.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.590
I thought you were going to be more cautious.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.550
Y-Yeah! Look at you, 
getting your mouth wiped like a baby.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.180
N-Not that I care the slightest bit!

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.670
But I am on my guard.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.410
Normally, I'd eat at least twice this much!

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.700
You can't be serious.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.100
I'm worried.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.590
It's not just Asta.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:13.020
They may be talented, but there are 
a lot of troublemakers among them.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.960
I can't wait to fight some people!

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.390
I'm gonna beat them to 
a pulp and squash them.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.690
Zora is all by himself!

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.440
He must be too shy to talk to the others.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.940
I need to be the one to break the ice!

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.200
Take a look at this!

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.740
This is what your face looks like!

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.280
It stinks so bad!

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.040
C-Captain Rill?!

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.550
All of you lack manners.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.870
Meals are meant to be enjoyed 
in a much more elegant,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.690
beautiful, and distinguished fashion.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.930
You dare run away from me because 
you don't want to be eaten?

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.610
What a repulsive mushroom.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.310
Hey! Wait!

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.490
You... repulsive... mushroom!

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.290
Don't eat my brethren!

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.040
Everyone, it appears that Miss Puli 
wants to give us the gift of song.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.150
Puli, Puli, Puli, my skin's so pretty!

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.900
I'm a lovely lady who sings so sweetly!

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.900
What the hell is this song?!

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.030
Puli, Puli, Puli, I'm a lovely lady

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.330
How bad a singer can one be?

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.200
As rude as this sounds,
 I want to murder someone.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.360
with supple cheeks!

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.260
Shut up!

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.120
Puli poo pariponpen!

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.190
I can't get any useful information 
while I'm sticking to that guy!

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.130
Pushka, pushka...

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.450
What's the matter, 
Captain of the Silver Eagles?

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.140
You're taking three days 
to start this operation.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.730
You're being awfully cautious.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.870
What are you getting at?

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.440
Do you think I'm hesitating?

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.400
No. It appears I needn't worry.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.570
You always were perceptive.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.890
I set a trap to find out how much 
the enemy knows of our plans.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.170
Well, let's hear it.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.590
Did you really think you could 
trick me with such a foolish spell?

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.430
Damn it!

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.730
You're not getting away.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.170
A spy from the Eye of the Midnight Sun?!

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.490
I can't believe there really was one...

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.830
Mushroom is shocked!

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.940
Second-Place Rookie,

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.830
apparently, he was following you.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.510
To think I hadn't noticed...

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.960
How disgraceful.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.590
I questioned him without killing him,

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.900
but apparently, our enemy hasn't 
noticed any of our movements.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.090
Therefore, we will be moving up 
the operation's start time.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.500
We strike the Eye of the Midnight 
Sun's hideout tomorrow morning.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.230
T-Tomorrow?

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.190
Not in three days?

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.360
I don't want Yuno to see 
me right after I wake up!

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.950
Make sure you all get plenty of rest tonight.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.380
That is all.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.550
It appears Lady Mereoleona intended 
all along to depart immediately

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.930
as soon as she captured the enemy spy.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.790
So if you want to fool your enemies, 
you must first fool your friends.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.890
But tomorrow morning?

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.020
What a scary lady.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.110
What's up, shitty shrimp junior?

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.690
You scared?

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.690
It's the exact opposite.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.450
The reason I want to become Wizard King

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.480
is so that everyone who lives here

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.220
can have a free country 
where they can always smile.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.190
I'm going to stop their rampage,
 no matter what!

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.710
You'd better not go on a 
rampage and hold us back.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.340
I'm never going to lose to you!

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.010
I'm the one who's going to win.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.340
It's finally time.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.340
Yes.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.470
Tomorrow is when we finally settle this.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.970
We're going to...

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.710
...defeat the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.070
Gravito Stones Floating Dungeon
The Eye of the Midnight Sun's Hideout

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.070
Holy crap! There's a castle 
floating in the sky!

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.420
That's the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's hideout.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.140
Well, there aren't many who would 
set foot in the strong magic regions.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.080
And since it's hidden by this 
magical fog, it's even harder to spot.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.400
Anyone would have difficulty finding it.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.780
You figured all that out, and that's 
why you had people search this area.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.030
You've gotten better, 
Captain of the Silver Eagles.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.910
I just happened to have 
people searching dungeons,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.250
and we coincidentally found 
out it was their hideout.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:21.000
Oh? So what brought the Captain of 
the Silver Eagles himself here, then?

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.750
That's enough idle chatter.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.260
You can use your spell from 
this distance, can't you?

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.330
Indeed.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.280
Stone Creation Magic: 
Stone Model of the World.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.410
That's so cool!

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.610
I see. It's like an ants' nest that 
allows entry from anywhere.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.790
Seems simple enough to infiltrate.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.620
I see there are plenty of guys 
around Senior Magic Knight level.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.770
There's someone with very 
powerful magic in the middle.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.770
Must be their boss.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.680
So that's where Licht is...

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.100
Captain Nozel, what is our plan?

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.250
I am not the Captain of the Royal Knights.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.080
The one who'll decide that is Mereoleona.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.770
Y-Yes, of course.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.990
Listen up, all of you!

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.030
If we want to ambush the enemy and 
throw them into a state of chaos,

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.980
we can't let them know 
how many of us there are,

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.510
so splitting up is the best option.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.380
But the fact that there are so many entrances

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.480
means that the enemy is 
confident in their defense.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.790
The more we split up, the more that 
may work against us and overwhelm us.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.670
So where does that lead us?

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.770
Ooh, me!

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.340
We'll overwhelm the enemy even 
more with sheer willpower!

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.350
We don't need willpower. 
I'll overwhelm them myself.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.600
I wanna mash them all up!

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.280
I shall defeat them beautifully on my own.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.850
I wish you'd just disappear.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.900
I'm surrounded by idiots.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.670
What's important is balance.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.780
The most effective way to get through 
the enemy's defense while split up

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.720
is to divide into five teams of four.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.280
Is that what you're thinking?

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.700
Exactly.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.250
We will now split up into 
five groups and proceed.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.120
I'll settle for anyone, as long as I don't 
end up with the crazy stupid shrimp.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.810
Say what?! That's <i>my</i> line, 
you cool masked jerk!

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:35.530
Wait.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.740
No one would want to team up with you anyway,

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.340
so I don't mind teaming 
up with you after all.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.230
Why do you sound like you're taking 
pity on me, you little shit?

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.480
You're coming with me, 
you damn problem children.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.710
Hello there, Lady Royal.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.780
Please accept this rainbow stinkbug 
as a token of our friendship.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.690
You idiot!

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.630
A stench this weak has no effect on me.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.100
You sure you want two peasants 
hanging around you, Lady Royal?

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.510
What?! You're a peasant, too?

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.560
I don't care if you're a peasant or royalty.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.790
I've never given a rat's ass 
about differences in status.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.140
All that matters is if you're weak or strong.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.390
You're here because you're strong,
 are you not?

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.790
The fools that Yami selected...

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.990
Don't let me down.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.320
Yes, ma'am!

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.740
Sure thing. Guess I'll 
be careful, Lady Captain.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.550
The rest of you should also be proud 
to be chosen as Royal Knights,

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.900
and use your strengths to the fullest.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.380
I will now assign your positions.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.760
Group 1
En Ringard   Nils Ragus   Nozel Silva   Shiren Tium

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.890
Group 1 will attack from the upper left.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:53.960
Yes, ma'am!

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.760
As you wish.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.010
Group 2
Ben Benfunk   Luck Voltia   Noelle Silva   Kirsch Vermillion

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.260
Group 2 will attack from the lower left.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.260
'Kay!

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.260
Yes, ma'am.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.510
Group 3
Ruben Shagger   Rill Boismortier   Fragil Tormenta   Puli Angel

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.570
Group 3 will attack from the upper right.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:02.510
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.740
Group 4 will attack from the lower right.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.770
Group 4 
Klaus Lunettes   Mimosa Vermillion   Yuno   Hamon Caseus

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.770
Yes, ma'am!

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:12.270
Group 5
Asta   Mereoleona Vermillion   Zora Ideale

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.080
And we're going to attack front and center.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.980
Yes, ma'am!

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.030
The spatial magic user will stand by here.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.030
Roger-dodger-roger!

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.780
You'd better put your all into this.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.210
Let's go!

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:37.760
Do you know why you're in this mess?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.860
It's because you're a citizen 
of the Clover Kingdom.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.190
I was a citizen there myself, 
until not so long ago.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.310
But...

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.310
I was different.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.160
Lord Licht gave me my true name.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.870
We're special, you see.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:17.990
So we can do whatever we 
want to trash like you.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.410
He's way too weak.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.740
There are stronger guys, right?

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.820
Do leave me some chances 
to strike beautifully.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.800
Are you all right?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.410
Thank you so much.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.020
I'm sure you don't need detailed plans.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.870
Take down any enemies you encounter 
as you proceed toward the center.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.620
You may do that

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.020
however you prefer!

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.130
I don't care what you do 
as long as you don't lose.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.540
Ah, the ants show themselves at last.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:14.150
I hear you caused quite a mess at 
the royal capital while I was away.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.900
You will not escape like you 
did from a certain cave.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.390
Eye of the Midnight Sun, we've come...

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.620
...to get our revenge.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.660
How dare you do that to my rival...

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.700
To my foolish little brother...

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.540
You shall pay dearly!

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.960
I will be the one to take your leader's head!

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.890
H-Holy crap!

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.970
Wait, do we even need to be here?!

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.550
Looks like someone dangerous showed up.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.980
Licht is gone right now, too.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.410
Guess I shouldn't be so lazy 
about this and just go.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.500
Petit Clover

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.430
Petit Clover!

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Lazy Raia!

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.870
Lazy Raia!

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.190
Lord Raia! Lord Raia!

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.010
What's up? Why are you so panicked?

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.210
We're being attacked!

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.190
Sounds like it.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.660
But it's such a pain to deal with them.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.490
What?! Please don't be like that!

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.020
It's a pain to get up.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.690
I shall sit you up.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.190
It's a pain to put shoes on.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.710
I shall do that, too!

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.360
It's a pain to stand up.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.530
Up you go.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.180
Walking is a huge pain! 
Yeah, I'm not gonna do it.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.120
What?!

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.940
Please reconsider!

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.650
I think I was sleeping with my mouth open,
 because my throat hurts...

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.130
I'll give you this lollipop!

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:25.880
What flavor is it?

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.880
A-Apple...

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.390
I guess I shouldn't be so 
lazy about this and just go.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.260
What would've happened if 
it was an orange lollipop?

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.820
Come to think of it, I wonder how 
Valtos and the others are doing.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.640
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 89:
"The Black Bulls Hideout."

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 89
 The Black Bulls Hideout

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.950
Make sure you find what 
we're looking for, Val.
