WEBVTT

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.220
Looks like his own ultimate 
spell did a number on him, too.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.990
Asta and the others were 
able to defeat the leader

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.600
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.860
But it was then that the strongest 
three in the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.810
the Third Eye, showed up.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.610
Well, this definitely doesn't look good.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.320
How dare you insects do 
that to my comrades?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.950
I hate those who have hurt Licht.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.500
Raia the Disloyal, Vetto the Despair,
and Fana the Hateful.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.170
I have nothing to worry about,
now that you're here.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.880
Faced with the trio's far superior strength, 
the situation looked dire.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.480
I think it's about time we end this.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.680
Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.760
But then, the captain of the Green 
Praying Mantises, Jack the Ripper;

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.600
the captain of the Blue Rose 
Knights, Charlotte Roselei;

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.310
and the captain of the Silver 
Eagles, Nozel Silva, arrived.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.370
Looks like you're having fun, Yami.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.790
The One With No Magic

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.710
I'm so glad you're safe.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.710
And then Baro turned into mud.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.720
So in the end, you two were being used 
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun, too?

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.600
But it's true that my brother and I 
kidnapped the children and stole their magic.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.570
So I plan to atone for both 
my sins and my brother's.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.020
I'll turn myself in to the Magic Knights.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.520
Then Asta...

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.820
He told me...

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.210
Yeah. And when you're done 
with that, let's be buddies.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.320
You can use really cool magic, 
so you'd be really popular!

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.260
Just like that.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.290
I'm very sorry.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.490
There's no point in apologizing to me.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.890
You're going to be his friend

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.250
as soon as you atone for your crimes, right?

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.930
Then you also need to pray 
for Asta's safe return.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.720
Right.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.570
Asta, what are you doing?

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.230
Hurry up and come back.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.020
Asta, please be safe.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.590
I-It's not like I care what 
happens to Stupidsta.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.950
I don't care at all!

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.420
Why does this keep happening lately?!

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.170
Also, who am I making excuses to?!

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.170
I see. So she also...

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.580
I wonder if she's the one 
Asta gave his heart to.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.590
There's no way he'd give me the time 
of day with someone like her around.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.830
No, I shouldn't be thinking 
about that right now.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.240
I have to do everything I can for 
when Asta and the others come back.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600
Okay!

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.770
Reinforcements, eh?

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.650
Hey, no fair, Yami. You were hogging these 
fun-looking enemies all to yourself.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.400
Well? Are they worth slicing up?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.880
Nope, not at all.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.050
They're pretty much like paper.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.450
I was just about to finish them 
off when you butted in, you jerk.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.010
Yeah, right. Look how beat up you are.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.210
Beat up? Who are you talking about?

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.010
Actually, why don't I use this 
opportunity to slice you up, too?

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.480
Vent all of my past grudges.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.600
And there he goes. What an idiot.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.610
I'm sorry. Please spare me.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.310
You moron. Like I actually would.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.840
I'll only do it when you're in tip-top shape.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.110
Otherwise, there's no point.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.840
How long are you just going to sit there?

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.080
You're so pathetic for a man.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.830
You idiot. The ground just loves me 
so much, it won't let my ass go.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.210
You're the idiot.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.970
There's no way the ground 
would love an outlaw like you.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.670
Talk about harsh. You're never going to find
a guy who'll marry you with that attitude.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.880
Yikes.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.610
I don't need to marry anyone!

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.390
The battlefield is my partner!

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.480
The battlefield's your partner? That's sad.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.180
Why did I insult him again?

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.240
More importantly, how did I 
fall for someone like that?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.950
Even so, I just can't get him out of my head.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.700
I can't just come out and 
say that I l-like him now.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.580
Besides, what would my 
knights say about that?

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.590
Are you serious, Sis?!

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.810
He's a <i>man</i>! Seriously?!

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.470
What am I thinking? 
Now's not the time for this.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.780
The Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.470
Its leader and top brass...

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.480
The top brass of the traitors who 
attacked our country are all in a row.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.620
What a perfect opportunity.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.640
I'll bury them with my own hands.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.900
Wow, you're so cool.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.840
Begone from my sight, foreigner.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.710
Thanks for your consideration, 
Mr. Ball o' Pride.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.790
Hey, I wonder how he gets his hair like that.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.140
Huh? Doesn't he just get one of his 
servants to do it, since he's royalty?

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.370
I'm sure he's got his own hair stylist.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.130
He actually has someone do 
it for him? But it's so lame!

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.880
Wait, so he does that braid himself?

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.930
That's pretty gross, too.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.380
Shall I bury you lot first?

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.730
Nah, don't waste your magic on a foreigner.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.400
I shall not hold back.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.850
I'm getting fired up!

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.110
I can still fight, too!

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.870
Stay out of this, pond scum.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.910
When the captains are on the battlefield,

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.330
mediocre combatants will only slow us down.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.890
Especially a lowly peasant 
with no magic like yourself.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.890
Very well! True despair lies at 
the end of an endless battle!

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.840
And the despair of the strongest 
fighters is the ultimate spice!

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.100
What the hell is he talking about?

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.720
We're hunting some rats. Let's go.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.790
You seem pretty excited, Vetto. What a pain.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.260
Well, whatever.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.490
I guess I'll do my best for Licht.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.620
Right, so I call dibs on that pretty lady!

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.290
If I win, we're going drinking together!

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.970
If you win?

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.040
In that case, we'll never 
raise glasses together.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.550
Briar Creation Magic: 
Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees!

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.090
There!

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.820
Whoa!

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.540
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.780
You get to fight me, big guy!

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.920
Oh? The Praying Mantis knight.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.120
You dare fight me, insect?

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.370
Don't underestimate insects!

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.470
You're just a praying mantis!

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.880
I'll tear off your limbs and 
wings while you're still alive!

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.880
Bear Claw!

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.170
The one I have business with is you.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.930
Mercury Magic: Silver Spears!

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.860
You want to hurt Licht, too?

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.650
I hate you. Die.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.140
Her flames melted your mercury!

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.010
Want me to switch with you, Sparkles?

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.170
Shut your mouth.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.960
As if flames like those could hurt me.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.330
Just who do you think I 
spent years competing with?!

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.240
What?!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.000
What is this?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.200
They're practically a natural disaster!

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.820
I can't see through all this dust!

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.190
Wow, they're working hard.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.810
Hey, that's cutting it a little close, Jack.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.660
Not bad, Charlotte.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.880
I'm surprised Nozel's braid stays in place.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.670
You can see them?

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.390
I'm using ki. Try it, 
even if you can't see them.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.970
Hey, Finral.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.300
Yes, sir?

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.940
You've recovered enough spatial magic
for one trip, haven't you?

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.440
We're going home? Yes, let's!

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.550
Let's let them handle this and—

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.070
True, Magic Knights captains are strong.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.740
But they cannot defeat the Third Eye...

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.960
Because we are loved by mana.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.460
So...

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.080
This must be some kind of mistake.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:40.030
For that mere human with no magical 
powers, who isn't loved by mana,

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.550
to have that grimoire...

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.600
I must hurry and retrieve it.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.520
I finally weakened him this much. 
There's no way I'm letting him go!

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.400
I figured you'd try that!

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.780
He's countering? Not good!

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.810
Yami!

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.940
Oh, dear. Looks like you 
underestimated our boss too much.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.740
Farewell.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.680
Licht...

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.620
You're after the leader's head, too, right?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.130
Go on. Go!

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.120
Wha—

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.460
What's he doing there?!

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.720
How did he get through the 
smoke from this melee?

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.220
If you can read ki, it ain't impossible.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.970
We didn't notice. None of us did.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.830
We couldn't sense him.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.210
Because he has... no magic!

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.230
Not giving up...

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.230
Thanks for believing I'd take a shot at you.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:44.240
I believed in our no-magic idiot!

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.120
...is my magic!

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.840
How'd you like that? No magic in that attack!

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.720
Same with my attack.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.580
Captain!

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.640
You surpassed your limits, kid.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.190
Right!

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.490
Licht!

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.400
Licht!

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.110
You've got some nerve, looking away!

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.740
That shrimp got us.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.950
He totally stole the glory!

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.220
We cannot fall behind.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.210
Let's finish off the rest of them!

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.710
Yami!

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.140
There won't be any other 
reinforcements, will there?

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.540
Badump, badump.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.550
What? No way!

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.850
Let's finish him off while 
the others are being held up!

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.840
Yeah.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.750
What...

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.100
What is that?

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.930
Crap!

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.300
Because of that brat's anti-magic attack,

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.860
the sealing magic on Licht has been broken!

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.320
Crap.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.570
That power's being held back 
for the day that's to come...

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.830
Why?

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.620
Why do you have that grimoire?

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.890
Why do you...

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.920
have the Demon-Slayer Sword 
and the Demon-Dweller Sword?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.550
What's he talking about?

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.260
Those swords belong to the master!

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.930
"The master"?

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.410
According to our intel,

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.900
"the master" should refer to the leader 
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.400
Does this mean it's not him?

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.130
All this about getting something back,
or something belonging to the master...

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.930
What the heck are you even talking about?

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.410
This crappy grimoire and these 
crappy swords belong to me!

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.750
Stop making false accusations, 
you crazy bastard!

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.750
No... Give them back.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.880
That grimoire is...

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.050
Our master's grimoire and swords...

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.220
What?!

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.000
Captain!

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:20.520
A human like you shouldn't have them.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.390
Well, this isn't good.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.770
Bring it on!

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.250
Death Scythe!

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:27.030
Why? I need to get them back.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.030
It swallowed up my severing magic!

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.240
Such an incredible concentration of magic!

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.700
If he actually releases that...

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.360
He'll blow this whole area away!

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.080
Even we won't be able to stop that!

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.570
What is this magic?

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.290
We're finished. His power was 
actually restricted before?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.510
I knew I shouldn't have come!

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.660
Actually, I wish I'd never 
even joined this squad!

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.010
Hey, quit your complaining.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.770
This is actually our chance.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.770
If we defeat him and this power, 
we'll leave our limits in the dust!

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.440
All right!

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.060
No way! You guys are nuts!

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.200
Hey! Don't you dare give up, Finral!

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.870
I have seniority here!

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.660
I'm not completely recovered yet.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.000
Can I reflect it with my remaining magic?

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.160
Sorry, pretty lady.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.750
We'll have to finish this next time.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.510
If this keeps up, you won't last, Licht!

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.010
Trinity Sealing Magic!

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.560
They're actually trying to seal that?

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.250
That magic...

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.280
Damn...

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.410
You worked a little too hard there, Licht.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.700
Get some rest.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.550
He's okay.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.910
Damn it.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.960
Let's go, Vallie.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.430
Our boss isn't feeling too good, 
so we're gonna head home for today.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:24.180
We lost this time. But the next time we 
meet, I'll show you what true despair is!

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.950
Rodents will fall prey to the carnivores.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.440
And that will be the end of you.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.090
We, the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
are always watching you.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.460
Such an unbelievable amount of magic... 
and they were easily able to seal it.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.960
They weren't giving their all.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.020
Not only do they all possess 
a great amount of mana,

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.280
but their control of natural 
mana was on another level.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.970
Looks like they're loved by mana.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.760
They're definitely worth slicing up.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.230
They got away.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.800
But I will be the one to avenge you.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.270
No matter what!

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.280
D-Did we win?

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.110
I'm not sure if we actually won or 
if it's more like they ran away.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.890
Pretty sure we can say 
we won if they ran away.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.850
They did say they lost.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.700
A-All right!

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.690
We did it, Finral! Gauche!

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.770
Yeah! We did it!

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.300
You didn't do a thing.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.100
Hey!

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.090
All right! We did it! We did it!

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.370
So, Yami... Don't you have something to say?

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.470
Man, I'm starving.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.970
Not that. How about thanking us, huh?

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.180
What would've happened if we hadn't shown up?

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.490
I wouldn't have let them escape like you 
did, and I would've defeated them all.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.120
And I told you, that's not possible.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.700
What a pathetic man you are.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.370
I can't believe that lot 
gave you so much trouble.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.750
Jeez. Harsh as usual.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.350
Amazing... I can't believe he was 
actually fighting those three alone.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.750
I guess it's no wonder 
that I f-fell for him.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.240
If you don't learn to be a little nicer, 
you're going to be single forever.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.760
I told you, I don't care!

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.230
My partner is the battlefield!

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.130
You should just worry about your partner!

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:34.830
If we're both still single when we're old,
wanna take care of each other?

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.110
Wha—You can't be serious! 
I wouldn't be caught dead with you!

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.070
Why can't I ever just be honest?!

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.880
Asta!

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.860
Yeah, I'm not surprised he hit his limit.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.220
Oh, well. Go get him fixed up, Finral.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.100
Me?!

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.670
You need to be of some use.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.070
I'm pretty sure I've been 
useful this whole time!

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.130
Tch.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.670
Really?!

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.610
The Black Bulls... Asta, eh?

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.800
Licht pushed himself a 
little too far this time.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.930
Well, he can rest now.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:17.970
Licht...

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.630
What the hell? You're shaming 
the name of the Third Eye.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.070
What did you say?

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.490
Er... So what do we do now?

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.450
Now that Licht's identity is known,

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.250
the Wizard King's bound to put 
everything into this investigation.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:36.110
Geork and Catherine are still 
being held captive, too.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.880
If they get anything out 
of them, this place...

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.670
and Licht's true identity will...

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.410
Well, Rades is right.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.430
It's a bit early.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.950
It wouldn't be good if they 
found things out this early.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.910
Hmm... What to do?

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:01.830
Oh, well. I'd rather not go, 
but I don't think I have a choice.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.420
Petit Clover

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.130
Petit Clover!

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.880
Sis Is Being Weird

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.580
Sis Is Being Weird.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.620
Honestly, why have I fallen 
for that overbearing,

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.630
crude man who doesn't even 
look like he's twenty-eight?!

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.360
I want to embrace him... with my briars.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.270
Yami!

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.890
What was that about Captain Yami, Sis?

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.780
N-Nothing at all!

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.030
Don't call me "Captain"! Call me "Sis"!

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.070
Wait, that's backwards.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.070
I thought I heard something about briars.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.130
Briars? Yes, briars!

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.870
I was thinking about how I wanted 
to bind that Yami tightly with my briars!

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.340
Oh, I see! You want to torment him, right?

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.190
Man, you must really hate Captain Yami, Sis!

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.770
Y-Yes! I absolutely despise that man!

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.780
Well, he is a man! Who'd want
to even see his face?

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.660
Yes... I don't want to see his face.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.900
I want to beat him with my briar whip!

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.890
Why can't I be more honest?!

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.020
I hate you. How could you hurt Licht?

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.490
I will not forgive you, Magic Knights.
