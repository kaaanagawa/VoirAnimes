00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.730
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.620
Flame Creation Magic: Leo Rugiens!

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.860
Is that all you've got,
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings?

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.570
In the instant you attack,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.170
for just a moment, the barrier's 
mana thins in places.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.380
That's what I aimed for.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.800
H-He's awesome!

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.300
Rades, wasn't it?

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.770
Even if you possess extraordinary abilities 
and polish them to their fullest,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.270
without a righteous spirit,
your deeds are nothing but violence!

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.150
No one will acknowledge something like that!

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.950
I need to get stronger so things like 
this don't give me so much trouble.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.610
It's too early for you to 
be cheering just yet.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.080
I think everything's just about ready.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.580
Now for some lively sow's mana...

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.220
How exciting!

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.730
I would always close my eyes

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.070
And cower at reality

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.740
I can't stand the idea

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.120
Of just making excuses to give up

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.260
Stand right there

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.400
I don't want to be near you

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.540
Any minute now

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.920
Just wait right there

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.920
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.010
Black and blue

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.930
I'll give up on giving up

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.430
And get the world on my side

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.320
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.450
And head where the light shines

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.290
I want to keep my promise

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.830
I'll deliver it to you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.820
shape of love

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.550
Blackout

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.430
Why?

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.310
I have magic that's stronger
than anyone else's.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.980
I studied everything there was about my 
magic, polished my skills, and prepared!

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.320
All for this day!

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.870
For years... and years!

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.140
And yet... Why?!

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.060
Noelle, I thank you!

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.440
You can save the thanks! Just hurry up!

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.190
But of course!

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.940
Flame Magic: Ignis Columna!

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.220
How'd you like that?! I made him 
evaporate with intense firepower!

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.930
Ow...

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.250
Excellent! Well done!

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.940
You are definitely a man worthy
of leading this country!

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.440
Yes, sir!

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.940
I accidentally saluted, too.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.240
I-Impossible...

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.810
Impossible! I've got as much magic as a royal!

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.710
I...

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.710
Flame-Binding Magic: Leo Palma!

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.420
L-Let go of me!

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.980
I'm still—

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.220
Damn it! Damn it!

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.730
At this rate, I...

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.730
There are many questions I'd like to ask you.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.230
But before that, I will be 
confiscating your grimoire.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.440
Don't!

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.020
Don't touch my grimoire!

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.950
What is this grimoire?

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.580
S-Stop it!

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.340
There's only one page?

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.740
Don't! Don't look at it!

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.770
He can only use one spell?

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.170
Damn it!

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.950
Give it back!

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.180
Don't you dare look down on me!

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.510
Who's gonna look down on you?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.570
Couldn't you think of any other way to get 
people to acknowledge your power?

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:37.870
You have amazing magic, and you were
strong enough to claw your way up...

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.210
It's such a waste!

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.130
Here. I'll lend you my arm.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.130
Thanks.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.640
What you lacked to overcome adversity...

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.890
was a righteous heart.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.650
Pay for your crimes.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.650
Are you satisfied now?

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.280
A voice...

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.990
What's the matter?

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:14.130
It was impossible for you to beat 
a captain on your own after all.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.910
I-It's not impossible...

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.740
I...

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.710
The sheer volume of your magic isn't enough.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.530
I'm also reaching my limit.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.650
You're through acting on your own.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.570
From now on, things are 
going to go as planned.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.430
All for our master.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.930
West District

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.700
The Magic Knights are amazing!

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.980
Hooray for the Golden Dawn!

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.980
Now, then, I think I'll go have some dessert.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.260
Would you like to join me?

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.900
I will decline.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.430
East District

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.530
Thank goodness...

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.170
Let's go back to our lodgings and 
wash off all this sweat, Sis.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.210
Indeed.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.000
Great job, Blue Rose Knights!

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.110
Lady Charlotte is so elegant.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.290
Lady Charlotte is so lovely.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.920
Sol is so cool!

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.680
Central District

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.900
What is their motive?

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.920
Northwest District

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.490
Looks like they're in the marked areas.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.590
My grimoire...

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.920
What?

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.810
Well done, Magic Knights.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.610
No—

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.480
Sis!

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.450
Wh-What the?

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.700
The Magic Knights...

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.210
Lady Charlotte... disappeared.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.210
Sol...

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.830
Where are we?

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.150
It would appear that we're at least

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.110
a few hundred kilometers 
away from the royal capital.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.700
They got us! Damn it!

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.820
They managed to infiltrate the royal capital.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.630
I figured they must've had a rather 
skilled spatial magic user, but...

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.050
To think they were able 
to send us all this far.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.780
Curses!

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.510
What the...

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.990
The Magic Knights' mana...

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.970
I can't feel it anymore.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.480
This is unprecedented spatial magic. 
Was there another spellcaster?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.250
Wh-What's going on?

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.240
I have no idea.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:53.760
To think the great Magic Knights would 
all fall for a silly trap like that.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.500
How stupid can they be?

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:01.180
I was supposed to play with the stragglers, 
but it looks like I won't have to bother.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.520
Now, then... I'd better use this 
time to get some nice, young mana.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.340
Ash Curse Magic: Ash Absorbing Formation.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.320
Wh-What the?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.110
No! What's going on?

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.380
Excellent. Just look!

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.600
My skin is silky smooth.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.620
Even water would bounce right off of it.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.380
No! Save me!

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.760
Stop acting all cute, you sow!

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.100
Eliza! W-Wake up!

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.400
Well, aren't you a handsome young man?

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.590
Say, do you think I'm pretty?
How old do I look?

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:06.620
Well?

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.290
H-How could you? You monster!

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.260
Who are you calling a monster?! Die!

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.840
Oh, my.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.760
I guess someone was able to 
escape that spatial magic.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:40.610
My, you're hot <i>and</i> my type.
Say, want to have some fun with me?

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.260
Get away from those people,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.860
you old hag.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.830
I'll murder you!

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:07.680
My, you're hot <i>and</i> my type.
Say, want to have some fun with me?

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.290
Get away from those people,

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.930
you old hag.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.100
I'll murder you!

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.100
Who are you calling an old hag?!

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.490
Ash Curse Magic: Cheerful Ash Destruction.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.360
These are curse bullets 
with various curses inside.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.290
You won't know what you'll 
get until they hit.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.050
Who are you people? What are you after?

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.470
My, my. Look at you, 
with such ample time to talk.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.050
Well, since you're hot, 
I guess I'll tell you.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.470
We're here to eliminate someone.
That's our goal.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.100
Eliminate someone?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.850
Who do you think it is, darling?

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.990
Well, I'm definitely not going to tell you.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.270
You're working with at least one other.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.870
A spatial magic user must have 
infiltrated the royal capital.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.370
Where are they?

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.130
Have they already fled?

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.750
No matter where you might've sent 
the rest of the Magic Knights,

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.390
you don't have enough power 
to take over the royal capital.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.890
I can't imagine that this was 
just to go after the king.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.390
King's Quarters

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.970
You've made it clear that 
your motive is revenge,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.870
but what are you and the 
others after overall?

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.910
Our true motive...

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.920
is you, Fuegoleon Vermillion!

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.380
What?

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.680
Fuegoleon!

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.430
What do you—

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.890
This is spatial magic.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.690
Very well. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.390
Fuegoleon!

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.690
What is this place?

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.420
The attacks keep coming. She has
a tremendous amount of magic.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.070
These ash bullets themselves 
don't do much damage, but...

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.050
Oh, dear...

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:18.600
Are you all right? It looks like you're 
having a hard time getting around.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.000
I wonder what you've been hit with.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.870
Damn it...

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.450
I... can barely see anymore.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.010
I'm gradually losing sensation
throughout my body, too.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.970
Hey, can you hear me? Hello?

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:42.020
My ears are also going... This is her power?

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:47.900
My Ash Curse Magic: Cheerful Ash 
Destruction works very gradually.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.460
First, your eyes stop 
working, then your ears,

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.380
and then your body stops moving.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:59.910
You'll pay for having the 
insolence to call me an old hag.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.490
People expected a lot
from my four-leaf clover...

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.460
I even joined the top Magic 
Knights squad, the Golden Dawn.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.880
Yet... what am I doing?

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.500
Who cares about a four-leaf clover?
That stupid peasant, getting a big head...

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.250
Hmph. He lacks the talent worthy to 
be a member of the Golden Dawn.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.890
I'm sure he won't last long.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.650
All those voices around me don't matter.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.400
I'm only bettering myself so I won't lose. But...

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.570
I couldn't win.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.720
What defeated that guy was 
a power I just happened upon,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.120
one that I can't control.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.580
Not to mention...

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.750
That power doesn't seem 
to want to listen to me.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.260
The only reason I was able to 
avoid the spatial magic earlier

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.100
was because something other
than my own power reacted.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.060
It's not like we're expecting 
anything from that peasant.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.300
No, that's not it.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.110
That's not why I'm frustrated.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.950
Where are you attacking?

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.530
You have to aim properly, like this.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:31.580
If you say, "I'm sorry, miss," and adorably 
beg for your life, I'll forgive you.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.130
Not a... chance...

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.030
I can't see... anything...

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.180
I can't feel... anything.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.700
This is... the flow of mana?

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:10.060
It's said that mages with wind-based 
mana are excellent at detecting mana.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.230
With all five senses cut off

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.210
and his back against the wall,
Yuno's finely honed concentration

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.570
demonstrated an astonishing
ability to detect mana,

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.170
and was attempting to go beyond even that.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.610
Come on, hurry up and beg for your life.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.990
If you don't, I'm just 
going to have to kill you.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.020
There are so many things I want 
to ask you. Hey, can you hear me?

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.570
Hey, come on. Answer me!

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.590
Would you shut up?

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.250
I couldn't care less about you.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.080
I just...

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.040
don't want to lose...

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.330
to Asta!

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.170
Not yet!

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.850
That grimoire... 
The legendary four-leaf clover?

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.360
Huh? Mana is gathering...

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.610
This sensation... He's...

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.040
He's controlling the mana?!

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:35.100
I see. The spirit has constantly 
been sending me mana signs.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.130
I was relying so much on my sight and 
hearing that I wasn't noticing them.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.890
Let me just tell you one thing about me.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.570
I...

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.890
hate losing more than anything else!

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.400
Wind Spirit Magic: Sylph's Breath!

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.150
No! I have to use the magic 
I stole to defend myself, or I'll—

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.410
You're...

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:46.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.570
And push me forward

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.610
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:56.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:02.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.640
(Break free yourself)

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:38.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:57.350
Petit Clover

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.750
Petit Clover!

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.850
Birthday

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.140
Birthday.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.110
I was able to get the wind 
spirit to listen to me.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.620
I shall name her Bell,
and today is Bell's birthday.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.520
This cake is for you, Bell.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.660
Yay!

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.110
Should we say you're one year old?

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.620
Happy birthday, Bell.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.370
So pretty!

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.580
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.170
Um...

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.690
Huh? Where's the cake?

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.110
Not a chance...

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.940
You bastard! What did 
you do with my brother?!

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.440
Answer wisely, or you shall face my wrath!

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.980
Fuegoleon! You... Fuegoleon!

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.530

Page 25
Adversity

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.820
I'm calm at all times...
