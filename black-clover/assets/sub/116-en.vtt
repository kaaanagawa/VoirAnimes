00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.840
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.100
The terrifying truth revealed 
by the resurrected devil:

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.530
the Eye of the Midnight Sun

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.060
had devoted their lives to getting 
revenge against the humans,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.980
but that was all part of this 
devil's 500-year-old plan.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.480
Rampage as you please.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.940
The final state of an elf who's 
overflowing with malice...

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.990
The devil turned the 
haggard Patry into a dark elf

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.830
and had him attack Asta and Yuno.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340
Hate...

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.970
Crap...

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.220
This spell is...

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.170
This magic is...

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.710
The Ultimate Natural Enemy

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.650
This spell is...

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.150
the one that gave 
Captain Yami all that trouble.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.660
And now, it's even more powered up!

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.010
Gauche managed to help us back then, but...

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.160
But...

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.370
Patry...

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.710
So much magic is being concentrated.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.960
This is bad!

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.580
Hate... Hate...

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.720
Demon Light Magic: Ray of Divine Punishment!

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.140
Die.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.210
But with how Yuno and I are now...

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.120
We somehow made it through.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.310
Asta!

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.760
Thanks, Yuno!

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.930
That was close.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.550
He should've used up most of 
his mana with that spell.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.260
Hate...

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.010
Hate...

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.190
I hate you!

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.440
You've got to be kidding me!

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.230
You can't be serious.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.740
That sinister magic just keeps welling up...

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.170
Even if I can't change into my black form...

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.080
I can't lose here!

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.790
Asta! Yuno!

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.300
Die.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.440
It seems your appearance has changed a bit,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.310
but we meet at last.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.490
Nozel!

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.910
Captain Nozel...

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.280
I...

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.700
am nowhere near as lenient as him!

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.710
Hate... Hate...

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.710
You cannot defeat me.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.650
Magical attributes play a big role 
in how a magic battle can play out.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.900
That is why Magic Knights act in teams,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.790
so that they can cover each other's 
weaknesses when they go on missions.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.830
And that is exactly why Nozel 
Silva's all-purpose magic

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.370
is a team unto itself.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.430
His ever-changing mercury magic

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.110
can face any enemy, and has
 always yielded results.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.660
Hate...

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.180
My magic's affinity with your light 
magic is better than anyone else's.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.810
Using vast, sophisticated magic to 
create a huge amount of mercury,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.920
he instantaneously hardens it, smooths 
its surface, and reflects the light.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.660
Though I don't plan on losing to the one 
I have the worst affinity with, either.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.930
And I have been sharpening my 
skills for this moment, too.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.150
Captain Nozel...

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.410
He always seemed cold, but he 
is the Captain of the Silver Eagles.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.910
He's super amazing!

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.920
But what's going on with the other guy?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.670
He unleashed all that power and 
can still move that fast?

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.750
I see you like to scurry away 
like the vermin you are, but...

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.930
The preparations are complete.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.130
Since this spell requires 
maximum control and power,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.100
I couldn't use it in the last battle 
because my magic was being disturbed.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.280
Mercury Creation Magic: 
Silver Star of Execution.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.410
Hate... Hate!

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.670
This spell will trap you and your light 
magic while continuously attacking.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.420
It's an inescapable prison.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.210
Hate... Die!

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.140
I hate you... Die!

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.560
Let your own deeds

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.070
be your undoing.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.650
He deflected all of the attacks.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.950
He has such precise control.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.660
Whoa...

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.450
Asta and Yuno, was it not?

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.170
I am the one who will become the Wizard King.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.010
You mentioned that you were going to 
become the Wizard King, didn't you?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.380
Then...

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.310
I guess you're my rival, too.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.490
Then I guess you're my rival, too!

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.470
I'm going to be the Wizard King.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.680
No, it's me!

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.480
It's me!

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.460
It's me, me, me!

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:36.610
Patry... If I hadn't stayed quiet...

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.770
Would you not have ended up like this?

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.000
Hey, Patry... Can you hear me?

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.900
Crap... I think I'm done for...

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.690
Patry... Licht...

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.270
It's warm...

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.280
Why?

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.690
I don't need a reason to save 
someone who's about to die.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.780
It doesn't matter to me if they're 
an enemy or from another race!

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:28.550
Damn it... So in the end, 
I'm being saved by human royalty?

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.400
That's why I didn't want 
to get involved with them.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.660
Regardless of the times, 
they're always like this.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.810
Indeed. You were chosen...

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.690
as my brilliant, foolish pawn.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.070
Now, then... Let's finish you off.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.230
Hang on a sec! Wait!

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.640
I don't think that's how 
this is supposed to play out!

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.660
You can't be serious.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.510
And how else is this supposed to play out?

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.920
This man is the leader of 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.110
He took many lives and threw the 
Clover Kingdom into chaos and confusion.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.870
Yeah, I know that, but...

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.800
Please wait.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:26.680
His body belongs to 
Captain Vangeance. I can tell.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.990
Vangeance?

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.270
What are you talking about? His face 
and his magic are completely different.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.400
I'm unsure of the reason why,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.980
but I can definitely sense 
Captain Vangeance from him.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:39.780
And...

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.590
He might be able to return Captain Vangeance
 back to normal with his sword.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.410
Leave it to me!

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.870
What are you talking about? 
Do you want to die?

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.610
How much do you want to kill the guy?! 
Did you not hear a word we just said?!

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.550
Could I at least give it a try? I can, right?!

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.570
Do as you please.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.950
Thanks!

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.420
This is... way more anti-magic 
than I've ever seen before.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:20.560
Actions come with consequences. 
You can't escape that.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.320
Make sure you never forget that, human.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.250
Asta?

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.790
Asta!

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.370
Hate... Hate... Hate...

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.520
What the heck?!

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.100
Is this, like, his memories 
or his soul or something?!

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.860
Is everything that was sucked out 
through the sword flowing into me?

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.830
That's...

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.470
Hate... Hate... Hate...

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.780
My head hurts so much.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.790
Unforgivable!

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.770
A time spell tremendous enough to save 
all the people of this kingdom...

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.390
Impressive.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.340
But it appears that you've 
used up all the time and magic

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.310
that you had accumulated.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.510
I'm sure you saw my attack.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.840
But you couldn't cancel that time spell

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.220
in order to evade.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.010
Because...

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.570
you are the Wizard King.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.840
Wizard King...

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.730
Wizard King!

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.110
Hate... Hate...

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.320
Hopeless... Hopeless...

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.740
Sad... It hurts... 
Frustration... It hurts...

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.330
Hopeless...

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.190
It hurts...

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:08.010
For Licht's sake, I... I was deceived.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.810
Resurrecting everyone was a mistake.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.980
So many sacrifices that he didn't even want...

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.960
I made the wrong choice.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.980
I was never chosen at all.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.180
"Humans are evil."

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.860
Did I... just want to believe that?

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.070
If... If that was actually true...

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.330
I mean, William and I were 
able to understand each—

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.450
We can never understand each other!

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.140
This is the humans' fault! I hate those fools!

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.140
They cannot be forgiven!

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.000
Humans are all evil!

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.990
That's right...

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.830
This is all... the humans' fault!

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.550
There you are, you bastard.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.870
Hey, I'm Asta.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.630
We meet at last.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:02.610
So on the inside, I guess 
you're a kid about my age.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.860
What do you want, you... human?

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:13.370
You were fooled and couldn't protect 
what was important to you.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:19.800
You lost the light that you believed in... 
and you're a mess of emotions. I know that!

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.380
But that's exactly why I'm going to say this.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.880
Quit giving up!

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.690
What you're doing right now is running away!

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.120
You just stopped thinking

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.680
and locked yourself up in darkness 
because it's easier that way!

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.730
Sh-Shut up!

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.690
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.910
What could you possibly 
understand, you stupid human?!

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.850
Shut up with all that "human" crap!

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.380
I'm Asta, damn it!

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.960
How dare you kill the Wizard King?!

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.840
He was such an amazing person 
who was respected by everyone!

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.720
I... We all wanted to be like him!

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.430
You took everyone hostage 
and killed the Wizard King.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.850
Your reincarnation hurt innocent 
people all over the kingdom!

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:23.700
Just like you can't forgive humans, 
I won't ever forgive you!

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.610
That's why we... also...

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.570
After doing all that, where do 
you get off acting like this?!

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.460
Huh?

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.320
Just because you did something you can't fix,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.700
you shouldn't just despair and run away!

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.110
Aren't you supposed to be trying 
to stop that devil bastard, too?!

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.610
You made up your mind to do all this so far!

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.210
<i>You</i> did that!

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.450
Even if you weren't chosen, 
even if you weren't wanted,

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.350
even if you aren't forgiven...

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.130
You need to stand your ground, 
no matter how pathetic you are!

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.980
Wh-What's with you?

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:05.230
Why are you acting so desperate?

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.590
Just leave me alone!

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:19.490
Even though I wasn't chosen, wanted, 
or forgiven, I made up my mind.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.540
I'm going to become the Wizard King!

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.910
So... I'm not going to give 
up on you guys, either!

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.260
You're...

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.460
We can come to understand each other.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.780
Asta!

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.700
Asta...

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.710
Holy crap, that was close!

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.080
That brat managed to bring Patry back...

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.670
Honestly... I've never met 
such a foolish human before.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.090
What'd you say, you jerk?!

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.470
Asta...

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.350
I guess you're having Captain Vangeance 
hold off for a little while longer.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.090
The thing that I can do right now...

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.610
Could you see this through 
to the end with me?

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.790
Yeah!

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.780
I'm not letting that bastard have his way!

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.750
That must be it.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.370
The door to the outside.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.330
And...

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.810
I won't... let you... go.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.710
You're not even fully awakened yet, 
and you already can't forgive me.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.040
Well, I guess I can't blame you.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.140
I couldn't take this grimoire from you,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.530
so I've taken it from someone very dear to you.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.790
I'm surprised you can manage that, 
after spawning that giant demon

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.770
left your soul so unstable.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.700
Well done indeed.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.420
I must reward you for all of your hard work.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.090
I'll kill you off properly.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.340
"Lightning Lance."

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.600
"Earth Shield."

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.210
"Storm of Blades."

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.280
"Split open."

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.780
And... "Bind."

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.270
That sword can absorb magic,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:13.630
but I imagine it doesn't fare as
well against physical matter.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.850
"Iron Spear."

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:21.150
My word soul magic can not only 
make whatever I say happen,

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.640
but it can also summon physical matter.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:29.140
You are no threat to me when 
you only have one sword.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.270
Goodbye...

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.270
Leader of the elves!

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.330
Oh? So were was an elf who 
wasn't an Apostle of Sephira.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:53.980
I saw Baval enter the 
Shadow Palace, so I followed him.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:20:00.590
After that, I found Baval unconscious, 
and I knew something was wrong.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.380
You fiend! You're a devil, aren't you?

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.800
Hey, now...

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.810
A devil?

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.810
Do those things actually exist?

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.810
I mean, if anything, 
you're way too pasty to be one.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.130
It looks like Nozel headed toward 
the other huge magic that I sensed,

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.650
so I came over here, but... 
What's the deal with this thing's ki?

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.140
You keep showing up one after another.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.140
It's turning into quite the party.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.580
I can only sense malice from him!

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.590
Human... You came this far 
just to get in my way?

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.980
I've got plenty of things to ask and say to you,

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.560
but I'm pretty sure we have to 
take care of that guy first.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.600
I'm also pretty sure I've never seen
 a more obvious bad guy before.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.850
I'm just going to let you 
die if you can't keep up.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.550
I guess you're just as 
unreasonable as the girl I know.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.230
You just make sure that body doesn't get hurt!

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.440
"Wave of Flame."

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.490
Dark Magic: Black Hole.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.490
Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.500
"Storm of Blades."

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.740
"Wither."

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.760
Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.490
My, what masterful teamwork.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.770
I figured you were on bad 
terms with each other.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.460
Yeah, I can't explain it, either.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.680
Okay, everyone. Here we go... Petit—

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.310
Oh, come on now, cuties.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.400
You shouldn't split up so much.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.260
Okay... He's healed.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.870
Everyone together, now...

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.870
He's our savior. We need to be careful with him.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.300
What's this bird?

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.300
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.890
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What the?!

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.300
Huh? Nero?

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.850
Take me to the demon's bones.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.360
Did Nero just speak?!

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.350
Wait, I was asleep, so I could still be dreaming.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.070
Someone pinch my cheek real hard!

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.260
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 117: "Breaking the Seal."

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 117
 Breaking the Seal

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.950
Ow! It wasn't a dream! Nero actually spoke!
