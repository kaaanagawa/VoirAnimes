00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.690
Not yet. I'm not finished...

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.660
I'm going to be... the Wizard King.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.270
You? The Wizard King?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.440
I have the ability to find out

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.990
just how much magical power 
one has with these chains.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.200
And you have no magic whatsoever.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.210
You must've been born that way.
No wonder you couldn't get a grimoire.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.760
To think that you lack
even an ounce of magic

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.030
in this world where magic is everything.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.630
What a priceless find!

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.390
Huh?

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.100
What the hell?

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.850
Then no matter how hard I try, 
I won't be able to use magic?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.470
To think that someone so pathetic existed.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.930
You won't even be able to find a job, 
let alone become the Wizard King!

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.850
I'm sure your friend, the great 
genius over there, mocks you, too.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910
Yeah, maybe.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.650
Yuno's so amazing that he 
was chosen by the four-leaf.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.540
I'm just...

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.760
You can't do a thing in this world. 
Just give up on everything.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.720
You were born a loser!

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.460
He's right.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.770
No matter how hard I try, 
some things just can't be helped.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.520
I'm just going to give...

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.770
Hey!

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.940
Who are you calling a loser?

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.360
Asta, it's true that you won't be 
able to become the Wizard King,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.660
no matter what.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.160
You hear that? Even your little friend 
is telling you it's impossible.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.580
That's because I'm going 
to become the Wizard King!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.000
What?

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.840
He's no loser.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.050
He's...

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140
Asta's my rival!

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.230
Huh?

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.130
Him? Your rival?

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.480
This brat who has no 
magical power whatsoever?

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.340
Not... Not yet.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.780
Sorry you had to see me 
looking that pathetic, Yuno.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.410
Just a sec...

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.160
I'm gonna kick this guy's butt!

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.590
A gri... moire?

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.970
I knew it.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.270
There's no way that Asta 
wouldn't have been chosen!

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.270
Asta's always been that way. 
He always does the unthinkable.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.230
He always has before... 
and he's doing it now.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.040
I'm gonna become the Wizard King... 
and protect you and everyone else.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.370
I'm gonna make everyone even happier! 
So we can have even nicer things!

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.630
And then, I'm gonna prove to everyone...

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.960
Prove?

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.730
That even if you're poor... or an orphan...

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.850
you can still become the Wizard King.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.290
The Boys' Promise

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.640
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.380
I know, yeah I know

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.560
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.640
I dreamed it all my life

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.350
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.450
Don't care how much I fall

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.920
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.280
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.680
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.830
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.090
Someday I will write the next page

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.610
You are my hope

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.340
Like that page from someday

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.680
I was able to meet you

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.640
I call this a miracle

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.300
10 Years Ago

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.790
W-Wait!

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.290
Yuno! Are you okay?!

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.830
Come on, Yuno.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.180
Asta...

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.670
Jeez. You're such a crybaby, Yuno.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.800
Well...

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.700
It's okay!

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.820
I've got your back, Yuno! Okay?

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.850
Yeah.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.860
All right. Let's get going.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.370
Everyone's waiting at the top!

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.710
It's good, but...

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.590
It's hard.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.690
That's our Sister Lily.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.650
You're such an amazing cook!

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.850
When I grow up, will you 
marry me and cook for me?

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.990
It was Father who baked those. 
Would you like to marry him?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.360
No! You're the one I wanna marry!

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.050
Sister! Marry me! Marry me! Marry me!

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.460
Marry me! Marry me! Marry me!

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.410
Very good.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.210
Asta, it's not possible.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.920
Sister is, um... a woman of the cloth.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.430
I'm not done yet, Yuno! I won't give up 
until I'm an adult, no matter what!

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.650
Well, good luck with that.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.750
"And then the world was covered 
in deep, deep darkness.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.460
Just when the demon tried 
to destroy the world..."

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.300
He's not gonna get away with that!

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.450
"...a very brave mage appeared.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.960
The brave mage fought the demon 
to bring the dawn back to the world.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.190
And finally, he defeated the demon.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.720
The mage's light shone ever so
brightly upon the whole world.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.370
The long, long night had come to an end.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.760
This was the dawn of our world."

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.300
Yes!

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.900
"And so, the mage was dubbed the 
Wizard King and became a legend."

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.940
The Wizard King...

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.430
"And they all lived happily ever after."

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.510
Hey, Sister.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.760
The Wizard King still exists, right?

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.260
Yes.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:27.020
The title of "Wizard King" has been passed
down through many generations.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.270
All along, they've been
protecting us with their magic.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.870
It's because of the Wizard King that
the Clover Kingdom is so peaceful.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.830
That's awesome!

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.990
Is the Wizard King really important?

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.430
He's the most important after the king.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.730
Okay, I've made up my mind!

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.220
About what, Asta?

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.510
I'm... gonna be the Wizard King!

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:07.850
Sister?

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.170
I'm sorry. I just wasn't expecting that.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.810
What brought this on?

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.030
Well, he defeated the demon, right?

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.850
That means he's super strong!
And that's so cool!

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.970
I wanna be cool, too!

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.930
And...

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.690
If I become important...
If I become the Wizard King,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.380
I'll be able to make everyone 
even happier, right?

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:41.050
You'll be able to wear nice clothes 
and eat all the good food you want!

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.980
I'm gonna make this crappy 
little church huge and amazing!

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.770
Crappy?

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.850
I'll get you whatever you want, too, Sister!

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.110
I'll look forward to it.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.280
Right, Yuno?

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.780
Yeah.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.090
The Wizard King...

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.280
I'm gonna be the Wizard King!

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.420
So, Sister! Marry me—

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.910
That's a completely different subject.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.450
Not yet! I won't give up!

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.300
No.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.140
Not yet, yet, yet, yet!

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.090
No.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.510
December

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.610
Why?!

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.300
Why is it I still can't use magic?!

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.780
Sister! I'll hang up the laundry!

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.080
Thanks, Asta.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.850
So marry m—

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.650
No.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.950
Mar—

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.340
Nope.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.200
Mar—

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.170
No.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.010
Marry me, please...

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.670
Don't you start crying, too, Yuno.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.930
Nash... won't stop crying...

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.260
Yuno! Leave this to me!

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.020
Asta...

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.860
I'm gonna be the Wizard King, after all!

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.480
Making a baby or two stop 
crying is a piece of cake!

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.070
H-Hey! There, there! There, there, there!

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.580
There, there.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.060
Way to go, Wizard King.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.540
Shut up.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.110
There we go.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.710
Hi there. I was wondering if one 
of you would run an errand for me.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.090
Me! Me! Me! Me, me!

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.940
I'll go!

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.550
Would someone deliver this to the mayor?

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:53.380
Me, me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.080
It's a very important letter, you see...

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.380
Yuno, could you do it?

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.360
Huh? Me?

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.530
Well, it's a very important letter,

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.900
and I'm hesitant to leave it in Asta's 
hands, so I'm counting on you.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.820
I have to go see the mayor 
in the next village over.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.470
I have to ask him to spare us some 
food to make it through the winter.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.120
As it stands now, we just 
don't have enough tatoes.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.490
Yuno, I'll go!

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.660
No. Father asked me to go.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.880
I-I'll go.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.930
Will you be okay by yourself?

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.550
I'll be fine.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.390
I'm heading out!

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.930
Come on, Asta. Chop some wood.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.700
You can't use magic, so at 
least do some manual labor.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.590
Shut up! Did you even dig up the 
tatoes you were supposed to?

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.700
I dug up the ones for 
today a long time ago.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.780
Huh?!

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.970
It looks like it's going 
to get chilly tonight.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.090
That's enough! Get out of my shop!

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.260
The hell are you doing?!

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.460
If you want to drink any more, 
you gotta bring some cash.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.650
You ain't getting any for free!

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.320
I don't want your stupid 
booze anyway, you jerk!

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.890
Damn it...

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.870
Whoa...

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.260
Ow...

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.350
The snow's getting pretty thick.
I'll have to be careful not to slip.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:59.230
Oh, thank you. Please tell 
Father that I received it.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.530
I will. P-Please excuse me.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.340
It's late, so be careful getting home!

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.610
Thank you very much!

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.310
I'm... sorry.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.690
Yuno's taking an awfully long time.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.940
I'm hungry.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.390
And Father isn't back yet, either.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.310
Let's just eat without them.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.580
No! That's not fair to Yuno!

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.600
Boo.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.620
My pendant... That's mine...

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.280
I'm just gonna exchange it for some cash.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.560
Give it back...

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:26.690
You miserable little brat. Where do you
get off having something this extravagant?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.300
Give it... back...

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.780
Give it back...

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.150
That's mine...

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.810
What the heck is that?

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.590
What do you expect to do 
to me with magic like that?

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.260
You want to fight me...

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.140
and die?

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.950
Yuno!

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.800
Who the hell are you, brat?

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.900
That's Yuno's!

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.920
Give it back!

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.410
Give it back!

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.610
Give it back!

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.110
Don't touch me with your filthy hands!

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.540
You... stupid little brat!

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.100
Not yet!

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.470
Not yet!

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.750
Cut it out!

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.940
I'm not done yet!

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.170
Damn it!

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.570
I'm not done yet!

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.770
Damn little brat just won't give up.
What the hell's his problem?

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.670
Asta!

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.820
I'm sorry. I... I...

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.680
Don't worry about it.

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:27.480
I told you, I've got your back.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.330
Asta...

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.230
Asta's always done the unthinkable.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.710
Wh-What is that grimoire?

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.160
That sword!

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.670
Just who are you?!

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.960
You little wretch with no magical powers!

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.910
He... nullified my magic?

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.800
Even without magical powers...

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.360
I'm going to become the Wizard King!

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.870
Not giving up...

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:31.150
is my magic!

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.480
I built up my muscles
since I couldn't use any magic.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.390
Looks like they came in handy after all.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.280
Asta...

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.750
Asta, are you okay?

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.140
I'm so sorry. It's all 
my fault... I'm sorry...

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.000
This is nothin'!

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.600
I'm gonna become the Wizard King.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.600
I'm gonna become the Wizard King... 
and protect you and everyone else.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:37.890
I'm gonna make everyone even happier! 
So we can have even nicer things!

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.210
And then, I'm gonna prove to everyone...

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.240
Prove?

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.330
That even if you're poor... or an orphan...

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.370
you can still become the Wizard King.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.400
We can?

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.710
Yeah.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.700
Can we really?

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.720
Anyone can... if they work hard enough!

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.390
Anyone?

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.390
Me, or even you, Yuno!

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.390
I'll... never cry again.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.420
Maybe I... no...

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.410
Yuno?

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.000
I will...

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.660
I'll become the Wizard King, too!

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.480
I'll get stronger, and protect 
you and everyone else!

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.340
I'm gonna make everyone happier! 
So we can have nicer things!

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.500
Yuno! Look, look! I got my own grimoire!

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.590
It's insanely shabby, but I'm gonna take 
good care of it for the rest of my life!

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.950
There, there, there, there, there. 
There, there, there, there.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.950
I guess...

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.580
you saved me again.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.450
I'll repay you for this someday.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.950
Asta...

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.310
Do you remember our promise?

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.460
So you're gonna become the Wizard King, too?

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.290
That means...

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.190
Yuno, you're...

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.290
Asta, you're...

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.940
...my rival!

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.890
You mean <i>you</i> remember it?

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.870
I thought you were just making fun of me.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.650
I have no interest in being 
too friendly with my rival.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.570
But you're the one who gave me hope.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.450
Even if you're poor, an orphan...

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.190
or even us...

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.910
We can become greater than anyone 
else in this world. And to prove that...

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.950
To make Sister and everyone else happy...

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.960
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:14.840
No one can escape from here

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:21.590
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:29.820
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:36.280
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.710
I've thought many times

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.420
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:51.020
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:57.850
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:05.110
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:11.990
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.720
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.860
Even though I can't use magic,
I'm going to join the Magic Knights!

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.270
So that I can become the Wizard King!

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:50.900
<i>Black Clover,</i> Page 3: "To the Royal 
Capital of the Clover Kingdom!"

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:55.250
Page 3
To the Royal Capital of the Clover Kingdom!

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.820
Not giving up is my magic!
