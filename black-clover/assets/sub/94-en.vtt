00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.780
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.580
While Asta and the other Royal Knights

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.890
were attacking the hideout of 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.010
back at the royal capital, the leader 
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310
had revealed himself before Julius

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.660
and was fighting him for 
possession of the magic stones.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.640
What is behind this man's strength?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.030
He's just an ordinary human. So why...

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.250
Julius used a grimoire that had no cover 
and his time magic, overpowering Licht.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.250
As the Wizard King,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.000
I will protect this kingdom

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.500
and its people.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.010
But Licht then released his sealing magic and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.550
was about to attack every 
citizen of the Clover Kingdom.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.560
The size of that light spell 
is ridiculous... damn it!

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.140
Now... Accept your judgment, humans!

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.020
Light Magic: Arrows of Judgment!

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.240
Time Reversal Magic: Chrono Anastasis.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.200
Julius used all of the time and magic 
he had left in order to save the people.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.830
But that was exactly what Licht wanted.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.080
I'm sure you saw my attack.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.170
But you couldn't cancel that time spell

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.130
in order to evade.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760
Because...

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.640
you are the Wizard King.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.520
What the hell's going on here...

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.500
Vangeance?!

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.010
New Future

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.820
Good day to you, Yami Sukehiro.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.000
I am Licht.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.750
Licht...

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.130
William is asleep inside me.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.950
No... I guess he was watching the Wizard King

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.130
draw his last breath through this eye.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.130
Huh? What the hell are you talking about?

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.140
I hope you're prepared.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.590
This can't be... This can't be happening...

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.690
Lord Julius... No...

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.940
What the hell are you doing, Marx?!

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.570
We need to get him healed! Hurry up and 
get Owen over here, you dumbass!

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.170
Right away!

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.120
Don't worry, Julius! We'll get you—

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.050
It's no use.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.470
This man will die soon.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.830
You protected this country to the very end.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.220
You have my respect for that, 
Wizard King Julius Novachrono.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.110
But...

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.760
Master Licht!

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.430
Dark Magic...

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.270
Dark Cloaked...

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.570
We will never, ever understand each other!

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.780
Dimension Slash!

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.540
I let him get away.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.540
Julius! Hang in there!

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.540
Yami...

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.050
That spell you just used was amazing...

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.180
You actually cut through dimensions...

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.800
Now's not the time for that.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.310
You've truly become an amazing Magic Knight...

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.890
I keep telling you, I'm 28 now.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.900
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.990
This is promising... The next 
generation has grown up well,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.740
and the generation after
 is starting to bloom...

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.890
My wishes will live on with 
the next Magic Knights...

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.390
Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium Barrage!

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.720
What's wrong, last of the Third Eye?
 Is that all you've got?

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.100
He doesn't stand a chance.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.310
I don't have any time to use 
super speed or healing.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.400
Where's your next move? Are you done?

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.650
She's defeating the Third Eye, 
which gave us so much trouble, this easily?

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.870
Captain Mereoleona is so freakin' cool!

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.990
If this is all you've got,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.740
I'm just going to keep punching you 
until there's nothing left.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.700
Well, shit.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.060
Burn to ashes!

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.000
I'll acknowledge your strength, royal lady.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.760
And that's exactly why...

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.390
Before I burn to ashes, 
I'll self-destruct and take you with me!

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.980
Land one more hit on me, and it's kaboom!

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.190
The anti-magic kid... He must've 
sensed the self-destruct spell

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.180
and managed to get over here 
even faster than that lady's attack.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.200
How freakin' fast can he 
read his opponent and move?!

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.710
I saw two others that tried 
to self-destruct, too!

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.750
I'm starting to catch on, you Third Eye jerk!

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.720
Don't waste your life like that!

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.930
What the heck is the deal with you people?!

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.410
Going on about having something stolen 
from you and getting revenge against humans!

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.350
I still don't get it! But you're 
humans just like us, aren't you?!

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.300
First, you guys need to 
clearly explain your deal!

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.480
Then you can listen to what I've got to say!

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.990
I won't allow you to die before that!

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.580
For crying out loud... You sure are 
a fiery little brat, aren't you?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.360
You've got some nerve, cutting into my fight.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.170
Would you like to burn to ashes, too?

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.580
What?!

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.710
The Eye of the Midnight Sun

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.450
threw our country into chaos,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.510
and left us with many casualties.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.470
They have no intention of coming 
to an understanding with us!

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.890
Out of the way.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.650
We have to squash them here and now...

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.730
Even if it means killing them!

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.270
Huh? Why's that?

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.380
We can understand each other.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.320
I mean, we're basically the same as them.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.610
They're mad because something 
precious to them was hurt.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.250
I've been thinking about this for a while.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.790
We're fighting because we 
can't forgive each other.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.750
So how can we get rid of that rage and hatred?

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.980
I'm an idiot,

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.510
so I couldn't figure it out, 
no matter how hard I thought about it,

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.710
but I'm sure we can!

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.650
We have to get rid of that rage and hatred!

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.970
What I strived to achieve... 
The future I tried to create...

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.650
I believe that it's not too far away...

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:09.790
The royals and nobles... 
Commoners and peasants...

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.020
Even if they're not human...

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.380
A kingdom without discrimination or hatred...

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.820
A new future I'd create with all of you...

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.470
A free kingdom

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.410
where everyone can acknowledge 
each other and smile...

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.690
That's the kind of kingdom I want to create

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.090
when I become the Wizard King.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.890
What a fool,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.630
blurting out something so overambitious 
without any hesitation...

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.390
He's actually serious about that.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.640
There used to be a guy who 
said the same thing.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.470
This child is our future.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.400
It'll bridge the gap between elves and humans.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.010
Congratulations, Licht and Tetia!

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.400
Congratulations!

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.530
If all humans were like 
you two, then maybe...

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.710
But...

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.660
There's no stopping this now.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.750
Welcome back!

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.840
Took you long enough! You got the 
last magic stones, didn't you?

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.430
Watch your mouth.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.580
Everything went according to plan.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.180
No, even better! Master Licht 
has slain the Wizard King!

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.030
Whoa, are you serious?!

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.730
Way to go, Master Licht!

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.150
It's finally time.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.750
Now, no one can stop us.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.330
Julius... just hold on a little longer.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
Owen can fix up a wound like this in no time!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.880
The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.510
had the power to kill all 
the people in our kingdom

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.890
even without the help of the magic stones.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.100
He has another goal.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.950
Something terrifying might 
happen to this kingdom...

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.810
I'm sorry I let him steal the magic stones.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.120
I am unworthy of being Wizard King...

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.450
The hell are you talking about?! 
You saved this damn kingdom!

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.910
Lord Julius... Let us make it in time.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:37.330
I'm sure Marx will be angry 
that I let this happen...

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.640
It's a pity that I can't be there
when Fuegoleon wakes up...

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:49.910
Yami... There's so much I still 
wanted to talk to you about...

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.400
You can't be serious! Who the 
hell said you could leave?

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.060
I'm not letting that happen! I still...

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.300
I hear he's not from this kingdom.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.510
Apparently he's a castaway from some foreign 
country who lives on the coast by himself.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.040
I wish he'd just leave the country.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.330
Wow! That's dark magic, isn't it?!

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.060
That's amazing! I've never seen that before!

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.970
Hey, hey, hey! Let me 
get a better look at it!

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.630
No. Who the heck are you, old man?

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.350
Old...? Oh, but I'm not suspicious at all!

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.270
I'm just a Magic Knights Captain who 
was wandering around in disguise.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.130
What's a Magic Knight?

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.920
Huh? You don't know?!

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.400
Hmm...

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.650
Well, why not come see for yourself?

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.450
I'm sure you've got potential.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.210
This is how you write your 
name in our kingdom.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.390
Seriously? I can't learn to write 
wormy-looking letters like that.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.920
Oh, don't be like that! Let's practice!

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.210
I don't wanna.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.400
Huh? Um, if you learn to write it,
 I'll treat you to dinner.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.620
I'll do it.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.420
Huh?

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:09.340
You've only just joined, but your 
performance never fails to amaze me.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.970
Just make sure you don't go too crazy.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.410
We've been getting some complaints...

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.850
Hey, the enemy's here. There's a swarm of them.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.700
Let's go, Yami.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.110
Just don't go too crazy.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.250
Yeah, he's definitely not listening.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:29.870
And starting today, you are the Captain of 
the Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.620
Congratulations, Yami.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.370
Yami...

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.380
I leave the rest to you...

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.890
You got it.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.430
I'm so happy that I got to see so 
many different kinds of magic...

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:19.930
I'm so happy that I got to meet so 
many different kinds of people...

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.930
Julius...

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.090
We'll protect...

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.360
this kingdom!

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.740
I hope everyone is okay in there.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.820
It's been a few hours since I activated 
this spatial jamming spell.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.970
It's becoming difficult to 
stay in this position.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.750
But there's no time for complaining!

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.050
Everyone is risking their lives 
fighting the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.800
For the future of the Clover Kingdom.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.300
Please do your best in there.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:17.930
Look over there!

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.520
That's...

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.770
A tremendous amount of mana!

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.370
That's the center of the hideout.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.400
Everyone, please be careful!

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.970
I don't feel like I'd lose to anyone right now!

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.870
Yeah, yeah! Go, go, Yuno!

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.950
What is this?

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.140
Is that... a person?

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.190
This mana...

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:08.190
I-It's so overwhelming...

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.420
Once I set this final magic stone,

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.150
the tree of life monument will become 
the guide that will awaken our true power.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.920
Yes...

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.370
This day has finally come, Master Licht.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.370
Now we, who have been chosen by the mana,

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.180
will have a tremendous amount 
of magic awaken in us, right?

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.750
I'll show those Magic Knight bastards

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.190
my true power the next time I see them!

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.410
If we magnify our magic powers even 
more with my dark magic items,

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.820
we might be invincible!

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.800
Then we can sweep up Asta, and I can 
run all the experiments I want on him!

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.620
Silence. The magic 
we're about to acquire

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.590
is to be used only for the creation
 of a new kingdom by Master Licht.

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.170
If we hadn't met Master Licht...

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.340
Our very existence would've been disavowed

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.300
and scorned, and we would've 
continued living alone.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:30.450
But Master Licht welcomed us 
into the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:37.350
All I want is to serve Master 
Licht and be of some use to him.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.410
Damn! You're so annoying, 
you goody two-shoes.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.010
But it sounds like we'll be able to raise hell

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.490
even more now, so I guess I'll follow you.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.540
I'll help you out even 
more with my experiments!

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.260
Everyone, you've done amazing work so far.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.930
I thank you.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.490
I'm very proud of all of you.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.850
The time to make our long-cherished 
dream come true is finally here.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.510
Let us be reborn in our true forms 
and create our own country.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:11.820
Yes...

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.930
What I've said up to this point

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.160
has been the words of the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun's leader, Licht.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.790
Huh?

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.540
And from here on out, 
I'll say what I really think.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.930
All of you are greedy and selfish.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.100
You have no qualms about harming others,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.010
although you're terribly 
sensitive to your own pain.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.090
You envy, hate, and discriminate

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.050
against other humans for 
the most trivial reasons.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:47.520
You justify your own weaknesses 
by thoroughly idolizing something.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.230
Everything... Every last thing is for 
the sake of your own filthy selves!

00:18:53.090 --> 00:19:00.990
You humans truly are selfish, hopeless, 
foolish, and ugly creatures.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.890
Master Licht?

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.570
What the hell are you talking about?

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.710
This is goodbye for all of you.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.340
You will serve as the foundation 
of the resurrection.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.030
Huh? What's that light?

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.530
What is that? It's coming from the boonies.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.470
What's...

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.980
Looks like it's begun.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.810
Begun?

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.400
His magic power suddenly skyrocketed...

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.490
Hey, this isn't good.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.990
We're going to regain our true 
forms... and our true power.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.540
Wh-What's going on?

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.460
This terrifying magic power... 
It doesn't belong to a human being!

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.720
E-Everyone... We should all leave for—

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.850
Yuno?

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:36.500
Petit Clover

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.540
Petit Clover!

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Studying

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.850
Studying.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.000
What does this say, Yami?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.380
I dunno.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:47.750
What about this?

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.370
I dunno.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.220
Then...

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.510
I'm telling you, I can't learn all this.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.140
Don't underestimate how terrible 
I am at remembering things!

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.350
Yami, you shouldn't set limits for yourself.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.470
You may think it's impossible right now,

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.860
but as long as you believe, 
you can surpass your limits.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.660
One day, I'm going to make this kingdom 
a place where your magic, status,

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.540
and where you were born don't matter.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.870
A place where we can all smile together.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:22.370
It might sound like a dream, 
but I believe that it's possible.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.670
Surpass my limits...

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.170
How do you write that?

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.960
Feeling motivated now?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.550
Then here's your last question!

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.970
What's this letter?

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.270
Left.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.470
This isn't a vision test.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.060
We walked for many months and years

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.110
consumed by sadness and loneliness.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.940
But now, that comes to an end.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.610
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 95: "Reincarnation."

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 95
 Reincarnation

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.990
We shall destroy the humans!
