WEBVTT

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.060
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.610
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.950
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.610
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.970
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.700
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.660
He continues to diligently 
aim for the top!

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.380
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.900
and to become the Wizard King!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.600
Clues

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.730
Huh? My home?

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.620
Jeez, you're scary.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.790
The Prickly Queen mentioned it,
 but come to think of it,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.340
your family's famous for 
curse magic, isn't it?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.410
Could you go ask them about forbidden magic?

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.420
Forbidden magic?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.550
Yeah.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.080
Forbidden magic uses power

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.100
from another world to meddle with the 
ways of this world or people's lives.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.890
And that other world is where the devils live.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.060
I was hoping we'd be able 
to get some information.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.670
If our investigation about the 
devils doesn't get any further,

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.540
my best friend Asta...

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.360
I was going to try to go again, 
even though I think I'll fail.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.990
For Asta's sake!

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.410
A distinguished family of curse mages...

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.350
Since cursing people was my family's trade,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.250
I never made any friends.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.130
On top of that, my family...

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.140
Even when Asta's arms were cursed 
by a member of the Third Eye...

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.510
I asked them how we could 
break the spell with a letter,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.390
but they wouldn't tell me.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.980
But things are different now.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.190
Today, I have my friends with me,
 so I feel more confident.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.610
My arms are falling asleep!

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.030
But I'm not done yet! My muscles are 
screaming in joy, not in agony!

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.030
Shut up! The only one who gets 
to ride behind me is Marie!

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.410
Just shut up and hang on!

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.530
It's so embarrassing to meet 
someone I don't know!

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.050
My friends give me strength.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.380
Guys! Thanks for doing this for me!

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.640
Tch. Why the hell do I have to do this?

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.710
Looks like Noelle took off 
to the royal capital,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.130
and since you all look so sleepy, 
you guys can head out, too.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.690
You guys are pals, aren't ya?

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.150
I'm definitely not going, 
and I'll kill you if you refuse.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.520
Curse our captain for abusing his power.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.210
So I heard your family's, like, 
really special somehow

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.770
when it comes to curse mages, Gordon.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.320
What the heck are curse mages, anyway?

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.180
They... are mages that made a trade out of

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.670
cursing and bringing misfortune upon others.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.490
But I didn't want any part of that.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.580
I wanted to be friends with 
people, not to curse them.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.690
That's why I pretty much ran away from home.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.050
I see.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.940
You ran away?

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.460
Will you be able to get any 
information from them, then?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.980
Also, they're not gonna curse us, are they?

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.390
Being cursed by someone I 
don't know is so embarrassing!

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.530
The being cursed part doesn't bother you?!

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.310
It'll be okay... I think.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.130
You think?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.380
I wanna go home...

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.770
Let's go.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.340
This is basically a haunted house.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.930
It's so embarrassing to meet 
a ghost I don't know!

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.060
Get off of me! Damn it, Grey!

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.360
I wonder what Gordon's family is like.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.660
It's me. I'm home.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.270
Welcome home, Gordon.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.180
Big Brother...

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.540
So you decided to come home after all.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.840
They all have the same face!

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.840
Let me introduce you.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.490
Father
Nathan

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.260
First, this is my dad, Nathan.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.740
Mother
Jonna

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.530
This is my mom, Jonna.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.200
Grandmother
Nilenia

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.060
My grandmother, Nilenia.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.160
Little Sister
Roxanne

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.550
My little sister, Roxanne.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.350
And...

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.720
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.350
This is our dog, Nunnally.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.300
Even their dog looks like them...

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.650
What are you doing to our guest?!

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.650
Nunnally, stop!

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.380
Whoa! Don't all of you come over here at once!

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.230
Are you all right, Asta?

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.330
Yeah...

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.540
Oh, sorry for the late introduction. I'm Asta.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.630
And this is Gauche and Grey.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.630
They're my friends from the Black Bulls 
that I mentioned in my letter.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.210
I see. Well, now that you're all here...

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.640
Why don't you join us for dinner?

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.280
Weren't you two strangers 
before you got married?

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.890
Why do you look so much alike?!

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.860
Gordon, you haven't had your 
mother's cooking for a while.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.280
It must taste exquisite.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.490
The eyeballs of the creepy-crawly
 snake are superb.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.860
I recommend the raw paralyzing frog, myself.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.490
Bread... Where's the bread?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.160
Grandma, it's in your hands.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.790
Oh, my. And it was on the 
plate just a moment ago...

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.710
Where did the bread go?

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.580
It's in your mouth.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.490
Dad, I want to talk to you about something.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.300
I see. You must want seconds.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.840
No, Dad...

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.860
Th-They're muttering over here 
and muttering over there...

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.620
I have no idea what any of them are saying.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.930
This is so awkward. What the hell is this?

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.180
And it's not easy to make me feel awkward.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.170
Say something, damn it.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.770
Aren't we supposed to ask 
about forbidden magic?

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.350
I-I can't...

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.950
Gordon, please stop shaking and ask!

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.700
Hey, that's the grandma!

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.210
Wow, this stuff looks really gross,
 but it's super yummy!

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.720
It's so good!

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.630
Why the hell are you having 
fun all by yourself?

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.130
H-Huh?

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.220
I think we can become the best of friends.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.220
Y-You want to give me something?

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.060
What is this?!

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.130
Is that you, Nathan? You've grown so big...

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.650
You have to protect the House of Agrippa.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.360
Old lady, seriously...

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.650
Oh, dear, Mother... 
Perhaps it's time for your nap.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.080
I'm counting on Nathan.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:50.270
For the sake of our ancestor who made 
the contract... the curse of Megicula...

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.780
Yes, Mother.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.590
Megi...?

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.340
Thank you for the meal.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.890
I-It suddenly got really quiet...

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.410
All right!

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.690
Gordon! It's the perfect opportunity to ask!

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.790
Dad, I need to talk to you about something.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.670
I basically abandoned the family, 
so I probably have no right to ask...

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.800
But I have a friend that I want 
to save, no matter what.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.660
So could you tell me about 
forbidden magic curses and devils,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.810
for the sake of that friend?

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.350
Sure.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.650
That was easy.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.180
I'll show you hex research 
worthy of a family

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.500
with centuries of expertise 
as curse mages,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.500
as well as secret arts that deal 
with poison, plague, and death.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.010
Are you ready?

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.980
What the hell is this?

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.610
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.830
This is my curse research workshop.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.240
I'm researching every kind of pain there is.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.580
Dad... So you really were 
researching such evil things.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:54.040
Gordon... I've been earnestly 
waiting for your return.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.850
Your poison magic is a talent that makes
you worthy of inheriting my research.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.270
I only came here to ask about 
devil-related curses for Asta.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.180
I'm not coming home to stay!

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.820
Oh, don't be like that.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.010
Death by curses, poisons, drugs...

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.570
If you want to learn those secrets, 
I'll teach you all of them.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.070
What do you think a person's life is?

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.870
Humans die so quickly.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.170
That includes your friends. 
Life is so fleeting.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.130
Black Oil Creation Magic: 
Curse-Filled Nails.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.470
Guys!

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.980
Asta!

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.110
Wait, I'm fine?

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.700
Hm... 36.5 degrees.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.290
Your temperature is normal.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.890
I don't see any physical abnormalities,

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.620
though you really don't have magic.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.160
Dad, what are you...

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.870
Well? I rechanneled what I know about 
poisons that usually harm people,

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.630
as well as our family's hereditary 
expertise in curse killing,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.950
into health management and medical treatment.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.100
That being said, this endeavor 
just started with my generation,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.180
so I'm only able to cure normal diseases.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.390
I wasn't able to help when 
your arms were afflicted

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.690
with an ancient curse, but...

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.940
What's the matter?

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.130
So, uh... You rechanneled your 
knowledge about killing with curses

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.740
toward health management 
and medical treatment...

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.950
So, wait, does that make you a recovery mage?

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.200
Yes, starting with my generation, at least.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.030
I had no idea...

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.270
I totally thought you were 
cursing people to death.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.950
You people need to learn how to communicate!

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.550
You're going to give people the 
wrong idea with those things!

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.960
You really can't judge a book by its cover!

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.470
Dad, does that mean you're 
going to help us out?

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.610
But of course.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.310
What did you want to know about 
devils and forbidden magic?

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.730
Let's hear the details first.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:21.900
Yes, sir!

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.020
Okay. Now I've sent most of the 
large debris into my dreams.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.300
In mere moments!

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.870
That's the Captain of the 
Coral Peacocks for you!

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.410
Thank you so much, Lady Dorothy.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.340
I'm glad you're still awake.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.380
Well, well...

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.630
If it isn't the littlest sister 
of the House of Silva.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.940
Did you need something?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:09.530
I want to know the truth 
behind my mother's death.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.950
Did you hear something from Nozel?

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.820
Yes. When we went to see 
Solid and Nebra yesterday...

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.190
Wh-What did you just say, Nozel?

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.050
What do you mean, Mother didn't 
die because she gave birth to me?

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.990
When she was pregnant with you,

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:35.060
Mother was already haunted by a 
death that she could not escape.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.990
It was not an injury or an illness.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.190
It was a death that should 
not happen in this world.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.440
A death that should not happen in this world?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.460
But that sounds like the work of 
the devils we're currently investi—

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:56.370
Say any more, and your life 
will be in danger, too.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.020
If you still have the courage 
to face the truth knowing that,

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.350
then go speak with Captain Dorothy Unsworth
 of the Coral Peacocks.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.680
Tell me. Why did my mother have to die?

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.640
Sure thing! I could never 
say no to a cute girl!

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.310
She's so easy.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.800
Well, I'm leaving the rest to you guys, then.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.820
Yes, Captain Dorothy!

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.420
Then again, it's not like 
we have anything to do.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.820
Captain Dorothy's amazing 
when she's actually awake!

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.600
Um... Did my mother's death involve a devil?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.910
Shh...

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.120
Didn't Nozel tell you?

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.670
You shouldn't speak of that.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.250
You'll get cursed.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.540
At least, in this world.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.260
Huh?

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.170
Where am I?

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.270
Welcome!

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.360
To Dream Magic: Glamour World!

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.420
This is a world of dreams.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:13.280
A world separated from the outside world.
Everything here is under my control.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.860
Here, have some tea.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.210
Usually, I trap bad people 
in here and punish them,

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.800
or I transport buildings or 
injured people in here, like today.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.680
What in the world is this large-scale spell?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.050
So this is Glamour World?

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.370
Everything's under her control?
 But that's crazy.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.310
This tea is good.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.450
Noelle!

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.520
Heya.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.310
Asta! What are you doing here?

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.230
More importantly... Hup!

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.790
You sure are cute today, Noelle.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.450
Wait, wha—

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.580
I just want to keep staring 
at how cute you are!

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.520
W-Wait, no! Th-This isn't...

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.830
That's the boy I created from your thoughts.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.630
Yup! You think about me all the time!

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.170
What?! I absolutely do not!

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.130
Oh, no!

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.140
Oh, dearie me. You did also come 
here for his sake, didn't you?

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.140
Not at all! Not even a little!

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.650
But just so you know, this is the perfect 
place to have secret conversations.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.310
Secret? You mean...

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.090
It's the perfect place to talk about Mother.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.490
Now it's Nozel?

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.770
Though this is a Nozel that I thought up.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.250
You came to visit me after 
talking to the real him, right?

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.000
About the thing he hasn't 
told any of his siblings.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:57.010
Your mother, Acier Silva, lost her
 life due to a devil's curse.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.010
My mother... But why didn't Nozel tell anyone?

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.820
Because those who speak of 
it will share the same fate.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:12.020
That's the nature of the curse 
that befell your mother.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.370
That's why he didn't tell 
you or your siblings,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.740
and why I told him to come to me in 
this world, because he can only talk

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.370
about this curse in a world that's 
separated from the outside world.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.340
I'm sorry it took me so long 
to tell you this, Noelle.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.630
I didn't want to put you in danger.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.970
Ah, Noelle...

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.060
Nozel?

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.530
Ah, Noelle!

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.190
Noelle!

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.630
My precious little Noelle!

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:46.640
I love you so, so much that I just 
don't know what to do with myself!

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.940
Noelle, Noelle, Noe—

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.810
Nozel!

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.190
Hey! Quit messing around with Nozel!

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.200
Aw, but that's how Nozel always seems to me!

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.450
What in the world was that chill just now?

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.540
Well, now that Nozel's gone 
flying away, let's get back on topic.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.670
The devils that live in the other world

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.550
don't appear in our world unless 
there's been some kind of anomaly.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.490
Mages can use forbidden magic, 
contract them by paying a price

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.970
of some sort, and use their power 
in a limited way, but that's it.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.470
Or that was supposed to be the case,

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.090
but now, their shadow is 
wriggling around in our world.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.150
The devil's name is Megicula.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.910
Megicula... That's the 
devil who killed my mother!

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.580
And the key to saving Asta!

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.660
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.940
After hearing what you said yesterday,

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:57.880
I looked into what our ancestors had
to say about magic that collects curses.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:04.140
Investigating curses... Our magic 
is basically made for that.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.430
Black Oil Creation Magic: 
Curse Candle Ritual Disk.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.670
Is this...

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.410
The Clover Kingdom?

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.030
Holy crap!

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.100
The flames are curses.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.540
Flame intensity shows depth and viciousness.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.080
This is a map of the sickness 
eroding our kingdom.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.530
That flame is insanely fierce! Huh?

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.830
That's our hideout!

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.590
Wait... Then there's someone 
in the Black Bulls who's cursed?

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.130
The only one in our squad 
who's not normal is...

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:46.690
L-Let's see... All Luck ever 
thinks about is fighting,

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:50.060
Finral's always thinking about girls...

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.350
And all Vanessa ever does is drink.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.940
Captain Yami always takes an extremely 
long time in the bathroom.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.520
So basically...

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.660
None of them are normal.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.740
Wait, wait, wait! What kind of curse 
makes you stay in the bathroom forever?

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:08.400
And if we're gonna get into it, everyone 
here is pretty undoubtedly unique, too!

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.200
What?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.410
B-Being called unique is too embarrassing!

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.230
Huh? Bone!

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.900
But I'm completely normal.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.900
At any rate,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.050
you're the last one I want to hear 
that from, you zero-magic meathead!

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.130
Oh, speaking of magic,

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.770
maybe this is reacting to Henry.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.180
Oh, yeah. I guess his condition that 
sucks away everyone else's mana

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.810
could definitely be a curse.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.130
Yeah, he's cursed.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.850
Indeed, he is.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.480
There's a huge flame in 
the royal capital, as well.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:44.330
I can't tell who exactly is cursed,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.490
but if you include the smaller 
flames, that's quite a few.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.330
Can't we get a look at a bigger area?

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.490
If we go too far out, the accuracy falls.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.450
That's...

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.040
The Heart Kingdom...

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.050
And there's a very big flame coming from there.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.250
Maybe there's a clue about the devil there!

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.480
You're my dad, Nathan.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.070
We found some clues 
on devils because of you.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.290
Thanks, Dad-Who's-Also-Nathan!

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.640
My best friends are really happy, too!

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.700
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 128: "To the Heart Kingdom!"

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.950
Page 128
 To the Heart Kingdom!

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.950
Wait, I'm staying home?
