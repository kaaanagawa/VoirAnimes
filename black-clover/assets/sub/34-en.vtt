WEBVTT

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.170
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.140
Granny! Get a grip!

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.150
Don't you dare die, you old hag!

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.300
You're going to make Marie sad if you die!

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.990
I wouldn't like it very much, either!

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.370
T-Take care of the children for me...

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.980
In any battlefield... the victims 
were... always the weak.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.640
It was always the innocent children.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.900
It's because I wanted to protect the children

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.150
that I left the battlefield 
and became a sister.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.360
Granny!

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.520
What are you talking about?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.280
All of you were born sinners.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.370
What?!

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.880
You poor thing... Sally, look at
how much they've hurt you.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.130
Master Licht...

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.380
Rest, my child.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.840
Valtos.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.780
Yes, sir.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.230
See you later, Asta.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.730
You belong to me.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.230
I never want to see her again!

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.740
Forgive me, my lord. All this
 because I let her go alone...

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.990
I never imagined all of this would happen.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.530
There's no need for you to feel responsible.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.120
I'm sure they used some underhanded methods.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.200
Who are you calling underhanded?!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.420
Look at what you did to all 
those innocent children!

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.050
She mentioned earlier that the victims 
on the battlefield are always the weak.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.010
That is incorrect.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.510
The victims are the strong.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.020
Envied, feared, discriminated 
against, persecuted, and...

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.640
stolen from.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.030
What is he talking about?

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.730
That is why we will not 
forgive the Clover Kingdom.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.910
This time, we will destroy you 
and create our own kingdom.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.960
What the hell are you even talking about?!

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.960
You're the ones who attacked first, you jerk!

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.380
Shut your filthy mouth.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.640
You're an eyesore.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.640
Why does someone like you have that grimoire?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.800
Grimoire?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.150
Damn it... I can't see his attacks at all!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.070
They hit me straight-on 
at an incredible speed!

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.680
What do I...

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.550
This is the only way.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.170
If I use my sword as a shield and charge 
at him, I can avoid a fatal injury!

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.830
I'm not done yet!

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.580
That won't work.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.790
I'll be taking that grimoire back.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.250
I'm gonna...

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.760
di—

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.600
Seriously?

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.850
Captain Yami! What are you doing here?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.360
Why am I here? Well, obviously...

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.520
I'm a little lost. Give me 
some directions, damn it.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.800
Light Magic vs. Dark Magic

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.580
Captain, you were lost?!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.340
Of course not, you moron.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.460
I was joking, dumbass.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.410
What?!

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.300
We're Magic Knights. Of course 
we're going to show up.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.460
Everyone back at the base was useless, 
so I decided to come myself.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.360
I'll kill them all later.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.320
What the heck are they doing when 
we're in this much trouble?!

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.320
He dragged me out of bed, 
and now we're in this mess!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.320
By the way, didn't I tell 
you to take the day off?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.960
Want me to give you a permanent vacation?

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.740
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.380
So, what's his deal?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.690
Apparently he's the leader of 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.080
Th-The Eye of the Midnight Sun?!

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.090
Oh?

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.110
I thought he'd be some big, burly guy
who could eat a cow in a single gulp,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.720
but he's just a scrawny-ass beanpole.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.180
Um, I'm pretty sure muscles 
don't really matter.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.730
What's with that guy's creepy, 
infinite amount of magic?!

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.760
Not to mention, he uses light magic?

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.940
That's a super rare magic 
that only a few people

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.860
throughout the history of the 
Clover Kingdom have ever used!

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.870
Without a doubt, he's super 
dangerous! I wanna go home!

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.370
That's the Black Bulls' captain.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.800
Shall I summon the Third Eye?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.630
There's no need.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:29.920
I've always wanted to fight him,
since he uses dark magic.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.970
Finral, please get the kids and 
everyone else back to town.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.850
Sure, leave it to me!

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.110
What are you going to do?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.140
I can still fight!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.520
I finally get a chance to see Captain Yami 
in action! There's no way I'm leaving!

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.450
Gauche and, uh... you there! Can you walk?

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.950
More importantly, get to 
the old hag! Hurry up!

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.030
Got it!

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.830
I've been around longer than you, y'know...

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.250
All right, Yami. I'm leaving the rest to you.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.170
Hey. You better come back.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.440
Gulp...

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.920
I was planning to just 
stay out of harm's way.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.170
You know, I think I'm running low on magic...

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.760
Like, for real!

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.080
What do you mean? I'm for real, too.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.140
Of course you are...

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.650
Huh?

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.190
The hell do you think 
you're doing to my ride?

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.780
Ride?!

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.780
Yeesh! I don't have enough 
lives to stick around here!

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.110
Well, see you, Yami!

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.290
You better come back, damn it!

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.040
So cool! How'd you stop that?

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.900
What's up with that sword?!

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.500
Shut up, brat.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.220
This is a weapon called a "katana" 
from my homeland, the Land of the Sun.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.350
And that was—

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.590
Like I have time to explain all this 
right now. Besides, it's a pain.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.390
Just watch!

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.600
Light Magic: Light Swords of Conviction.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.440
Awesome!

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.230
He's boosting his physical abilities 
with reinforcing magic

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.950
and cutting my light magic with 
a sword cloaked in dark magic.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.200
But that's not all.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.370
How about this, then?

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.880
So this is the power of the 
great Magic Knight heretic.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.470
Huh?

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.890
Hey, have I met you somewhere before?

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.480
I'm pretty sure I don't know 
anyone who uses light magic.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.710
Who the hell are you?

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.450
And what's so fun about all of this?

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.630
Let me tell you a fable.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.720
Long ago, in a certain village, there lived
a people with very strong magic.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.720
They were loved by mana.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.890
They changed the weather 
and manipulated ley lines.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.890
They had power to rival the gods.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.400
The humans from outside the 
village worshipped them as such.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:40.760
However, gradually, the humans 
grew to fear their power.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.160
They envied it and wanted it.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.050
They tricked them, massacred them,
and stole their powers.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.090
What kind of story was that?

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.170
What's that got to do with you?

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.610
Planning to become a bard or something?

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.680
All right, I've got a little story, too.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.390
In a certain place,
there was a pure young man.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:14.230
His folks were fishermen, and they started 
sending him out to fish from a young age.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.900
And then he got shipwrecked...

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.400
Augh!

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.120
Seriously?

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.450
...and washed ashore in a strange country.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.330
Who the hell is this?

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.080
He's wearing grass sandals.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.000
You can't be serious!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.510
Since his race and culture were different, 
he went through some nasty stuff there.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.380
But...

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.520
He kicked all their asses and 
became the boss of a group.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.640
The end!

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.870
Well? What'd you think of my response fable?

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.490
Well, it's half of my life, actually.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.030
You bastard! You dare mock Master Licht?!

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.560
Shut up! Your face is scary!

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.370
Why are there lines on your face?!

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.910
You're bringing that up now?!

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.170
He got faster.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.550
As a foreigner, I suppose my 
story had nothing to do with you.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.840
Would you mind stepping off the stage, then?

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.930
Captain Yami!

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.430
I wonder how long you can 
avoid a fatal blow?

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.190
Are you the guy who took out Fuegoleon?

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:39.900
I am.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:46.730
Although I laid my plans carefully 
and had him walk into a trap.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.240
Yeah, I figured.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:54.040
You'd never take down that King 
of Hardnoses with stuff like this.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.140
Dark Magic:

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:51.890
Dark Cloaked

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.640
Lightless Slash!

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.670
Master Licht!

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.150
A-Amazing... He's so frickin' cool!

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.200
Trap, eh? I'm sure you wouldn't 
have been able to win

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.050
without doing something underhanded.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.030
How dare you?!

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.550
This time, come right at me.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.540
I'll show you the true power 
of a Magic Knight Captain!

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.160
Hey, brat. Were you watching that?

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.600
Y-Yes, sir!

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.200
Good. Now try the same thing.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.210
Yes, sir!

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.720
Wait... Like I could actually do that!

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.350
Of course I can't!

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.300
Oh? Who do you think you're talking to?

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.400
Huh?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.320
I told you to do it, so do it.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.240
Ow, ow, ow, that really hurts! Ow, ow, ow!

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.600
That'll make you a bigger man.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.100
Not only did he manage to stop 
all of Master Licht's attacks,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.870
he even managed to counter.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.430
The Black Bulls' captain...

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:04.250
Does his strength actually 
rival the Wizard King's?!

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.260
I see... So this is dark magic.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.010
Light Recovery Magic: 
Healing Light Particles.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.350
He can use recovery magic, too?

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.770
I haven't seen it in person much,

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:28.820
but apparently, guys loved by 
mana can use all sorts of magic.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.820
It's especially rare for an 
attack-type to also be able to heal.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.210
Anyway, get ready.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.870
He was actually serious!

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.250
No, really! I can't!

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.990
Not in the middle of fighting!

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.130
Not to mention, I don't have any magic!

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.070
I don't mean the last attack I did.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.940
I'm saying do the thing before that, idiot.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.140
And I can't block attacks that I can't see!

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.890
You're hopeless.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.840
I'll explain it just this once.
You'll have to pay me 500 yuls later.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.770
He's charging?!

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.060
The reason I've been able 
to react to the attacks

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.320
is because of something called "ki" 
from back in my homeland.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.520
Ki? Not mana?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.320
Yeah.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:26.840
Ki

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.430
People looking at you,
the sound of their breathing,

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.090
their smell, the motions of their muscles,

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.030
the vague sense that they're there...

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.770
Ki is the blanket term for all of the 
different types of life energy

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.840
the human body emits.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.760
I read that ki and predicted 
his next move, then made mine.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.390
You've done that before, haven't you?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.930
Come to think of it...

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.850
When I do it, I combine it with 
magic and muscle, and fight that way.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.360
I guess it's like being a magic 
swordsman or something.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.900
Muscles! So that's why your neck's 
so thick, Captain Yami!

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.120
Like you can talk, kid.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.420
He has the nerve to converse during a battle.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.910
The insolence...

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.560
He's just full of surprises.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.460
To think he could keep up 
with this speed, as well.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.220
I cannot allow him to trouble 
you any further, Master Licht.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.170
I know this is impertinent of me,
but would you allow me to assist you?

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.560
Thank you, Valtos. You're always so helpful.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.650
In that case, that boy... 
Would you capture him?

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.400
You may injure him slightly if need be.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.900
An easy task.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.950
Huh?

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.190
That was close!

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.960
Perfect timing. Practice on that 
scrawny dude with the slanty eyes.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.370
Huh?! On the scrawny dude 
with the slanty eyes?

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.300
That's too sudden! Of course I can't!

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.160
Where I come from, we've got this saying...

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.640
"A warrior never goes back on his word."

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.450
You said you were going to 
become the Wizard King, didn't you?

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.790
Surpass your limits. Right here, right now.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.820
There's no other way.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.820
Yes, sir!

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.730
I don't get it at all, but...

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.330
For starters, concentrate... Concentrate!

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:31.840
Someone with no magic like you 
could never stop my attacks.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.090
You're there!

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.760
I didn't stop all of it.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.220
Wrong.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.580
You can't fool me, kid.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.040
You just reacted to your ears that time.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.130
That ain't ki.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.230
Use all five senses, and sense it 
with your whole body, you moron!

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.060
With my whole body?

00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.490
Yeah. You can't just rely 
on your ears or your eyes.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.390
Visualize something halfway between 
instinct and a prediction.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.360
If you don't do it right, I'll kill you!

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.750
That's insane.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.330
But I think I kinda get it.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.300
Not just my ears, not just my eyes...

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.600
Then... I'm just going to reset everything.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.690
Concentrate...

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.850
You're there!

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:36.940
Wha—

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.580
I did it!

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.790
I did it, Captain Yami!

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:56.570
Wow, you actually managed to do it?
Talk about creepy, you weirdo.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.710
What?!

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.680
Valtos...

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.330
How dare you... harm Valtos?!

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.940
I cannot allow people like 
you to harm my comrades

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.320
ever again!

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.930
What's your deal? You're the
ones who started this!

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:32.150
The path this spell traces 
resembles the motions of a whip.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.280
Can you predict its movements?

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:44.260
It's said that whips were used to 
punish criminals, once upon a time.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.390
That makes it a perfect fit for you two!

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.270
Light Creation Magic: Light Whip of Judgment!

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.030
It's useless to struggle!

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.410
The cave!

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.930
That nutcase has gone ballistic!

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.970
Oh, dear... I held back most of my magic,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.320
but it's all really too fragile...

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.790
Both this world and you fools.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:54.000
You're amazing, Master Licht!
Your strength is practically divine!

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:59.460
If you felt like it, Master Licht, the Magic 
Knights would be no more than infants!

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.840
What?!

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.480
The leader of the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun... Licht, was it?

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.170
Talk about a huge forehead.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.320
I guess you'd expect that 
from a light magic user.

Going beyond my limits is my magic!
