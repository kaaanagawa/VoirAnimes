00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.800
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.620
The royal capital was thrown into chaos.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.640
The Magic Knights that had been

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.390
reincarnated as elves began 
their assault on the humans.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.270
Also, back at the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's hideout,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.060
Luck and some others turned
on their fellow Royal Knights.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.250
Meanwhile, Raia was somewhat 
moved by Asta's view that

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.200
humans and elves could come 
to understand each other...

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.450
We can come to understand each other.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.830
He wasn't lying, either.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.580
That's why I believed him.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.950
But because I believed him, </i>that<i> happened.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.380
That's why I'll never trust them again.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.630
Rill...?

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.760
Oh, hey, it's Raia.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.390
Them, too?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.850
How are we supposed to win against them?

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.390
In order to protect Asta and Zora,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.610
Mereoleona threw them out of the 
battle and faced the enemy alone.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.650
Well, aren't you nice to 
your friends, Miss Royalty?

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.150
You seem to have the wrong idea.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.720
Those kiddos would've just been in my way.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.290
Stall you? Don't make me laugh.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.020
I intend to kill all of you!

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.810
The Sleeping Lion

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.690
What in the world is going on?

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.500
Regardless, we must protect Lord Fuegoleon!

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.740
Is that all you can do despite the whole 
lot of you coming after me, humans?

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.720
Please stop this, Vice Captain Randall!

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.660
Vice Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Randall Luftair

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.470
That's not happening.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.660
Not until all of you humans are dead.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.660
Also, my name's not Randall.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.010
H-His magic's on a whole different level.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.090
It's no use. H-He's too strong!

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.670
We can't stop him on our own.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.170
Do not falter!

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.180
Have you forgotten?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.180
We have been trained by the best captains.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.600
We are the proudest, most powerful squad!

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.180
We are the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.770
We cannot lose this battle!

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.770
Come on, now.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.260
My air magic's mana has 
basically filled this place up.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.380
You've barely been able 
to use your magic at all.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.130
Usually, he'd add air to my flame magic,
making it burn even brighter.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.710
To think he'd be this 
terrifying as an opponent...

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.970
I will not lose!

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.720
I will defeat you and 
return you to your senses!

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.090
Concentrate...

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.890
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.920
Well, look at you. You were 
able to use magic after all.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.330
But too bad...

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.820
Air Magic: Air Blockade!

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.800
I can wave my hand and put out 
that puny little flame in no time.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.370
Air Magic: Crushing Air Blast!

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.630
Leo!

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.130
Give it up already. You'll be in less 
pain if you just give up and die.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.150
I will not lose.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.640
The flames of the proud Crimson 
Lion Kings cannot be extinguished!

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.560
Leo's right!

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.790
All remaining Senior Magic Knights who 
can still fight will attack him at once!

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.490
We will bring the vice 
captain back to his senses!

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.810
Yeah!

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.370
Iron Creation Magic: Iron Bullet!

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.660
Flame Magic: Burst Javelin!

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.120
Stone Magic: Solid Rock!

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.290
Show him the pride of the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.670
You humans sure are intense.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.260
It doesn't matter how many of you come at me.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.730
You're not getting away!

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.730
Guess it's my turn now.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.490
Air Magic: Explosive Air Wave Palm!

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.070
Forti!

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.910
He's fast!

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.450
He kicks at the air to launch 
himself in any direction,

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.080
then he attacks with a blast 
of air that we can't see!

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.670
Vice Captain Randall's Air Magic...

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.420
We don't stand a chance against it!

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.050
Air Magic: Crushing Air Blast!

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.930
All those Senior Magic Knights 
don't even stand a chance!

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.430
If only Lord Fuegoleon...

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.650
Don't say that!

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.610
This is our moment to prove our true worth!

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.240
We're going to protect him, no matter what.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.830
Endure! If we endure this, 
we'll have our chance to counter!

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.330
No, you won't.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.210
The strongest squad? Don't make me laugh.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.480
Take this!

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.450
What?

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.640
Did you actually think I'd be surprised?

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.960
I wondered why you were being quiet. 
So you were waiting for an opening.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.570
It's time for your nap now.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.070
Air Magic: Crushing Air Blast!

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.990
Don't rely on your eyes. Feel it.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.740
He dodged it!

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.660
Oh?

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.260
The only way to battle against

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.880
the invisible air magic within this 
mana-filled space is to read the mana.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.380
It's not as if I was just 
sitting idly by, watching.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.470
I'm able to feel it more and more.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.310
I've found an ideal way to use my flames.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.310
Don't start celebrating 
just because you got lucky.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.810
Air Magic: Explosive Air Wave Palm!

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.250
You were willing to lessen 
the blow by making it a draw.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.170
And then, as I was stepping back, 
you attacked again with flames.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.340
Guess it wasn't luck after all.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.050
Well done, royal.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.840
You're all so intuitive, 
and you adapt at a terrifying rate.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.470
Precisely!

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.850
Leo, you're going to lead this squad one day.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.160
We'll buy you some time.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.270
Take everyone who can't 
fight right now and survive!

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.740
Guys! I can still fight alongside you!

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.610
Leo!

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.450
Go!

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.780
We're entrusting the squad to you!

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.510
We are the proud Crimson Lion Kings!

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.810
We will boldly fall for the future 
of this squad and this kingdom!

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.290
Yeah!

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:30.610
No!

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.830
You can't do that. We're all 
going to make it through this!

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.310
I feel like I'm almost onto something.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.330
M-My body...

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.150
Leo!

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.240
You awakened a little too late.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.490
Fighting in a manner you're not 
used to drains you instantly.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.000
You won't be able to stand any longer.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.460
So you're going to lead 
this squad one day, eh?

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.000
Sorry, but I'm going to make 
sure that never happens.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.760
Damn it... Damn it!

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.720
Move, body!

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.260
Leo!

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.130
Humans... and royals, especially...

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.270
shall die violent deaths.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.780
I will not... give up!

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.280
I swore an oath...

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.070
I will not...

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.910
Not here...

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.910
Move... Move!

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.710
What is this strange mana?

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.770
This is...

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.950
Another enemy?

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:15.650
No... This warm, embracing flame mana...

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.410
You fought well, Leo.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.920
Brother!

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.530
But the battle's not over yet. 
I'll take over from here.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.680
This mana is what I felt a moment ago...

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.690
Salamander...

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.690
As the captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.770
and as your older brother,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.460
I will never lose... again!

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.750
Where am I?

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.180
I can feel it... their fiery 
mana as they're in battle.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.330
I must go. As a Magic Knight...

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.550
As the captain of the Crimson Lion Kings.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.840
Is this all you have?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.510
Is this the limit of your powers,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.590
Fuegoleon Vermillion?!

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.380
It can't be. The Fire Spirit...
Salamander?

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.750
None shall...

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.640
stand in my way.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.010
Even if I lose an arm, or my 
flesh is burned by flames...

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.650
As long as there are people waiting for me,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.060
I shall go to them, for I 
am Fuegoleon Vermillion,

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.230
the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.080
I can feel it...

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.230
Its mana and life force are flowing into me.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.050
There is something I must do!

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.930
That's what you're telling me, isn't it?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.240
I will be using this power to its 
full extent, my spirit friend.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.060
I apologize for worrying you, Leo.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.410
Please don't apologize!

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.290
I knew you'd wake up, Brother!

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.060
The rest of you fought well, too.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:24.590
Despite my deep sleep, I was 
able to feel your fiery mana.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.970
Lord Fuegoleon!

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.760
So this is the fire spirit, Salamander.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.560
According to Asta, it was accompanying

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.280
one of the members of the upper echelon 
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.600
but then it disappeared after the last battle.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.740
Forever faithful and highly 
trusted by the people,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.580
the eldest brother of the royal 
Vermillion siblings and a great Magic Knight...

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.910
It's no wonder Salamander chose my brother!

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.580
A mere human earned the blessing of a spirit?

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.030
Not only that! Why did it 
have to be a filthy royal?

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.610
Randall!

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.780
I've just woken up, so I may 
not be able to hold back.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.470
Try not to die.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.020
You sure talk big.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.540
You may have been chosen by a spirit, 
but you're still just a human.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.050
There's no way you stand 
a chance against us elves!

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.270
Brother!

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.980
Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath!

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.450
The flames are so strong 
that I can't blow them away!

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.040
I can't breathe because of 
the heat. The air is...

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.010
It's all being swept away!

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:49.060
C-Curse you, royals!

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.390
Flame Binding Magic: Leo Palma!

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.130
You may be inhabiting the 
body of my vice captain,

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.640
but I will not allow any more violence.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.670
Lord Fuegoleon!

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.030
You are truly the ultimate Magic Knight!

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.510
Hurry! Treat the wounded at once!

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.530
Yes, sir!

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.160
He's too amazing.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.220
Way to go, Brother!

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.660
But I'm still going to surpass you someday!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.280
As the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.440
I swear I will bring you 
back to your senses.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.820
Er, however, while you were asleep,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.840
our sister took your spot as captain for now.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.300
What?!

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.820
Is that true?

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.640
Y-Yes...

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.700
You are currently former 
Captain Fuegoleon.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.060
So my sister... That's how it
 should've been to begin with,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.980
but she didn't even bother joining the 
Magic Knights because it was a hassle.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.570
It appears I've made you do 
something out of character.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.490
Salamander is showing me

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.930
all of the mana from those who are 
not human in the royal capital.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.870
It appears as though the situation has 
escalated quite a bit while I was asleep.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.300
The day the royal capital 
was attacked, I learned

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:18.330
that the enemy was after me and decided 
to go along with their scheme.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.540
What is this place?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.350
You're...

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.200
This mana... Is that you, William?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.730
What are you doing here?

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.040
I know you too well.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.240
I was hoping you wouldn't come 
here knowing it was a trap...

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.800
I truly hoped you wouldn't.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.290
What are you...

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.130
Answer my question, William!

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.300
You'll know the answer soon enough...

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:56.900
You're...

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.640
This is a secret that even the man

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.410
who gave me my mask, 
the Wizard King, doesn't know.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.640
...once you've seen the other me.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.180
Who are you?!

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.310
What did you do with William?!

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.710
Ah, the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.700
Though you're always calm, 
this seems to have startled even you.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.330
That moment is all I need.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.090
Back then, he should've 
been able to finish me off.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.610
I was also concerned about William 
when he revealed himself to me.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.890
I will keep this concealed within my 
heart until I find out the truth.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.930
I will not allow any more violence 
to befall the Clover Kingdom!

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.390
We are the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.330
With the proud flames 
that reside in our hearts,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.630
we will stop them, no matter what!

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.950
Yeah!

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.420
The true battle is about to begin.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:18.170
Member of the Golden Dawn
David Swallow

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:18.170
Why the heck are we dressed
 like that one human royal was?

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:26.140
Member of the Golden Dawn
Letoile Becquerel

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:26.140
Oh, I see. Our comrade who summoned 
us here must be rather twisted.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.220
What do you mean by that?

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.810
They're telling us to kill those humans.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.150
Ah, I see.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.950
It does piss me off that 
they killed all of us

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:42.340
and got to live such rich, fulfilling lives.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.990
So you're here, too.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.370
Well, well, it looks like you're all here.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.580
I was imprisoned in a peculiar place 
when I woke up, so I had a little fun.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.170
Those foolish humans...

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.380
Who do they think they are? 
They piss me off so much.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.900
I'm guessing it was your cousin 
who gathered us all here, Latry.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.450
Ah, so it was Patry.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.490
I guess that's why we get along 
so well. We're both twisted.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.690
I can't wait to kill all these royals myself.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.220
The white night is over.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.430
Let us show the humans the golden dawn!

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.200
Brother...

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.530
Brother...

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.700
Langris!

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.410
Thank goodness! 
You've returned to your senses!

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.860
Wait! Hey!

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.290
Don't go, Langris!

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.340
Langris!

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.880
Ow!

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.930
Wh-Wh-What the... Wait, where am I?!

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.140
It's been a while! I'm Finral!

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.240
How long do you plan on sleeping,
 you dumb bastard?

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.640
Y-Yami?!

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.720
As you can see, the royal capital's in trouble.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.440
You feel it, too, don't you?

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:05.570
The inhuman magic that was coming from 
your brother is now coming from all over.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.450
Let's go, Yami.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.430
Langris... This time, I'm going to save you!

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.510
Petit Clover

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.610
Petit Clover!

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.010
Just Woke Up

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.510
Just Woke Up.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.250
Lord Fuegoleon!

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.560
You're finally awake!

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.010
There is something I must do!

00:22:59.010 --> 00:22:59.810
Yes, sir!

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.710
What?!

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:06.420
A man who will not allow a single tangle
 to remain! That is Fuegoleon Vermillion.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.530
Um... I think your bedhead is okay now.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.530
In that case, there is something I must do!

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.570
Yes, sir!

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.500
What?!

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.130
A man who will make sure every 
last tooth is as white as can be!

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.250
That is Fuegoleon Vermillion.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.130
Um... I think you've brushed them enough.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.500
In that case, there is something I must do!

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.170
Just five more minutes.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.490
What?!

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.290
A charming man who always goes back 
to sleep! That is Fuegoleon Vermillio—

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.530
I will not allow any more blasphemy 
against me for the sake of jokes!

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:44.400
I am the Captain of the Crimson 
Lion Kings, Fuegoleon Vermillion!

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.690

 The Desperate Path Toward Survival
