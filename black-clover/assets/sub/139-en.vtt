WEBVTT

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.010
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.570
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.620
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.270
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.970
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.770
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.650
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.830
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.800
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.690
The rest of the Black Bulls and I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.250
are training so that we can

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.210
go up against the Spade Kingdom and that devil.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.060
But at this rate... we don't stand 
a chance against their power.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.480
Rouge...

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.380
That's right. Now's not the time to 
worry about how I get things done.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.730
There ain't no shops open this late.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.550
Have a seat.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.750
You're awake?

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.760
I just wandered down here, and this 
bottle invited me to have a drink.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.270
What? You mad I'm drinking 
from your secret stash?

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.820
No, have as much as you'd like.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.770
You're not drinking?

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.270
Well, this is nice.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.100
I always wanted to enjoy a drink with you alone.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.780
That so?

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.780
But I'm going to have to ask for a rain check.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.780
Sure.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.790
I'd love to have one next time.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.970
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.370
Right. I'll be back soon.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.750
A Witch's Homecoming

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.260
Queen of Witches

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.660
I'm here to ask a favor of you.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.440
I want you to tell me how I can 
strengthen my friends and myself.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.300
We'll be fighting the Spade Kingdom soon.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.450
The Witches' Forest will be in danger, too.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.690
I am fully aware.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.330
Not only of your actions, but also of 
the threat heading toward our forest.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.090
It is unfathomable that 
I would not be aware of this.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.780
Then you understand, don't you?

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.220
They possess mana far greater 
than that of any normal mage.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.600
We're going to have to fight them.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.550
And my friends only know how to 
fight by pushing themselves too far.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.610
It's a miracle that we haven't 
lost anyone yet because of it.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.750
But this time...

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.640
You already have the power to change fate.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.210
What do you fear?

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.210
Rouge is not all-powerful.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.710
If I lose my mana, Rouge also 
loses her power to change fate.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.570
Please... teach me some of the ancient magic

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.180
that lies within the Witches' Forest,
 which only you know of.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.430
I need your powers in order to fight them!

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.320
Even if you could actually use my magic,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.690
I fail to see the point in this.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.490
Then just...

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.820
Teach me the ancient magic 
that lies in this forest.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.390
That doesn't change anything.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.940
You seem to be mistaken.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.330
You're right. I escaped this place,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.050
so I know I'm out of line 
to even ask for your help.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.300
But...

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.890
If I can't gain anything here,
 my friends will...

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.480
Well... I'm not saying there 
isn't a way to give you power.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.400
But there is one condition...

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.410
So you must be, um...

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.430
Samantha Kravitz

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.430
Elvira Aguirre

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.000
I-I'm Samantha.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.430
It's nice to meet you, Miss Vanessa.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.870
So you're Samantha, and you're... Elvira.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.480
The Queen of Witches told me about you.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.140
I'm only doing this because 
the Queen ordered me to.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.090
But you're not my superior, understand?

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.840
Yes, I know that. So it'd be 
great if you could lead the way.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.270
There it is.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.910
We have security golems 
placed outside the forest

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.070
to notify us if the 
Spade Kingdom attacks, but...

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.090
Security golems will react to any threat,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.420
but they can't tell humans 
from magical beasts.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.390
They'd never stop otherwise,

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.470
so the Queen has set them to
stop shooting after three shots.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.050
In that case, when the 
Spade Kingdom actually attacks,

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.140
they won't be much help as an early defense.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.580
And you were told to make them useful, right?

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.810
The Queen of Witches herself 
gave you special treatment,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.650
so I'm sure that'd be an easy task for you.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.770
No, it's not that simple.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.050
U-Um...

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.070
Yes?

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.260
There are magical beasts staring at us.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.610
Shoot attack spells at them!
Any ones you know!

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.720
They should flee after one hit!

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.620
I'm sorry...

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.130
Hey, didn't you defeat the last 
enemy that invaded this place?

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.910
Or what? Are you useless without the 
help of men from the outside world?

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.620
Elvira, that's not very nice.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.900
So?

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.420
Well, back then, we...

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.740
Team Two!

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.920
Don't you dare underestimate us witches!

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.520
Y-You don't need to bring that up!

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:42.430
I guess I never asked what kind of magic 
you two possess. Could you show me?

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.590
Sure...

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.890
Sound magic.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.890
This is all I can do. I'm sorry.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.310
Thanks for showing me. And what about you?

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.370
Magic that projects illusions?

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.510
What else?

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.380
That's it. You've got a problem with that?

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.380
No. It's my fault for not 
confirming your powers first.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.300
I'm sorry. I really can't do this job.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.480
I'm absolutely useless. 
I'm just going to hold you back.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.250
You should just give up this job already.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.690
We're both failures, anyway.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.530
The way Samantha panics is just like Grey.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.990
And Elvira being so proud 
reminds me of Noelle.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.620
What's really so different 
between them and these girls?

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.760
Let's wrap things up for today.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.550
You're free to go. I'll think
 of something by tomorrow.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.640
I'm sorry.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.900
Not like anything's going to change.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.630
Those two won't be enough help!

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.130
When the time for war comes,
I will need everyone out there.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.260
So you want me to train them 
until they'll be useful in battle?

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.020
But who knows how long that'll take?

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.030
I get it now. So that was your plan all along.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.110
Whatever are you talking about?

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.740
You're trying to get me to give up by 
giving me a task that's impossible to do!

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.250
What do you use your magic for?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.330
Hey, did you hear?

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.770
About how the Queen's making her 
deal with those two failures, right?

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.470
Yeah, that's not happening. 
I mean, it's Samantha and Elvira!

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.940
The Queen of Witches can be so mean.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:51.240
No matter how special Vanessa might be, 
there are things even she can't pull off.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.480
I know, right?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.980
I can hear you.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.240
I guess the witches here never change.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.470
That cake shop ended up closing down.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.740
That's a shame.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.470
The witches in this forest love to talk.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.730
But I've never gotten to 
join their conversations.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.000
That probably goes for those two, too.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.090
I'll cut you a deal! Act now, 
and it'll only be 20,000 yuls!

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.150
Are you buying?

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.410
Why, thank you!

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:24.900
Oh...

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.530
Oh, hey. It's been a while. How've you been?

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.310
Wait, Domina?!

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.600
I see. So that's why you're back.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.580
Yes. What about you?

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.640
Dominante Code

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.140
Well, you know that hubby of 
mine can't work a normal job.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.870
He's a wanted man, after all.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.100
He has nothing better to do,
 so he's been farming,

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.340
Fanzell Kruger

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.340
Mariella

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.370
but that's not enough to put food on the table.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.560
Which means I have to peddle these magic items.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.510
It's such a pain.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.890
I'm surprised you got permission.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.390
Yeah, considering I escaped 
this place, just like you did.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.380
I'm guessing the Queen thinks 
it might benefit her, too.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.570
You <i>are</i> a pretty good magic item saleswoman.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.800
Yeah, but sounds like you're having a hard time.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.910
That's for sure. I'm at a loss right now.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.790
Then I have the perfect magic item for you!

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.450
It's a magic washboard that gets any 
stain out, depending on the user's mana.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.290
We're friends, so I'll cut 
the price down to 8,000 yuls!

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.210
How am I supposed to use 
this against magical beasts?

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.120
I dunno.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.550
You're not gonna buy it?

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.910
Look...

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.570
Why would I buy something that I'm 
not even sure will be of any use?

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.810
Aw, it's always about how you use things.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.860
The Queen of Witches manages to 
keep all the witches here in line.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.430
It's just like that!

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.810
Hm? Something wrong?

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.610
No.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.870
What do you use your magic for?

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.830
All right. The three of us are going to get

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.000
those magical beasts away from the forest.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.280
I'm sorry... I can't do it.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.000
This is just a waste of time.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.100
Don't worry. We can do this.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.580
No, we're the only ones who can.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:39.440
You seem pretty confident for 
some reason. Why is that?

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.690
I am. Look at this.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.320
This is the Witches' Forest. 
This is the magical beasts' territory.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.920
Smaller magical beasts gather 
around here to eat nuts.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.170
And bigger magical beasts 
feed on those smaller ones.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.520
And right here...

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.610
There are a lot of trees 
that are loaded with nuts,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.360
so a lot of small magical beasts gather.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.880
I saw a number of bigger magical beasts, too.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.260
You saw them?

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.840
I stayed up all night investigating.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.060
You finally looked at me.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.500
S-So?

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.750
The rest is simple.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:21.030
We'll lead the larger magical beasts that 
come near the Witches' Forest this way.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.980
Then they won't come here anymore.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.220
How is that simple?

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.150
Do you really think we can do that?

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.590
That's impossible.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.700
We can. It's not impossible.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.500
I was just like you two. I'd given up.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:39.870
But...

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.890
What are you doing?

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.090
Dollies?

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.650
They're so little.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.900
Think back... to the first time 
you were able to use magic.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.800
Everyone's thought about what they 
wanted to use their magic for.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.520
As for me...

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.850
I wanted to make everyone smile.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.020
That was the one thing I couldn't give up on.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.020
Even now, I don't want to see anyone cry.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.770
Wouldn't it be even more wonderful 
if the dolls had color?

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:14.790
Yeah!

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.910
O-Oh, fine.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.090
Wow!

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.660
And believe it or not, these dolls talk, too!

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.670
Really?!

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.300
Huh?!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.540
Listen to this. I got hit on 
in town again yesterday.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.820
Really?

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.140
But the only ones who ever talk to 
you are old guys and little kids.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.810
Any type of magic can be used for
all kinds of things, depending on

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.190
how you use and combine it.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:52.340
The thing that made those kids smile 
was none other than our magic.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.700
Are you ready?

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.470
Here we go.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.650
Good, you two. Just like that.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.870
Elvira!

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.580
I know!

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.340
We've been running a while... 
Are we there yet?

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.360
The markers I left last night...

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:55.630
Okay!

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.340
Just a little more!

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.140
Okay!

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:04.640
This is it.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.110
Wh-What are you doing?!

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.200
No! Those are actual little magical beasts!

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.610
But we came this far...

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.200
What should we do? Run?

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.710
Don't give up!

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.590
Elvira! I need you to make this 
as terrifying as possible!

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:36.590
What do you mean?!

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.840
Samantha! Make it roar! 
Make it sound really, really strong!

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.480
O-Okay!

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.240
Our plan worked.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.460
We actually...

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.000
...did it.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.500
Yes, we did.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.410
That's amazing!

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.510
We can't do anything like that.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.790
Huh?

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.510
But why...

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.890
The Queen showed us.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.520
I guess we can do it...

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.010
It's all thanks to you.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.130
You two found something you 
didn't want to give up on.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.160
Make sure you never forget what that is.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.690
Yes.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.480
All of my dummies are absolutely 
terrible at giving up.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.170
Well, then...

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.180
I came here to learn some powerful spell,

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.930
but never mind.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:02.930
Why is that?

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.770
I'm going to train myself 
and gradually raise my mana.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.190
I'll continue thinking about 
the best way to use my magic.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.360
I won't give up.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.480
That's all I can do, and that's fine.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.830
So you were able to tug the 
threads of people's emotions?

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.710
Yes... Those threads were always connected.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.640
I'm going to continue to 
use my magic so that all my

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.000
friends in the Black Bulls 
can always keep smiling.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.690
As you said, I was mistaken.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.550
It wasn't Rouge's magic that could change fate.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.800
Ever since the day I left this forest...

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.300
Choose for yourself.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:51.810
He gave me the opportunity, but he's 
not the one who changed my fate.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.010
I'm the one who chose my path, 
and I'm the one who changed my fate.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.080
I'm going to continue to change 
the worst fate that may befall us.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.790
I'm going to pull together the 
threads that will connect to the fate

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.410
that keeps everyone smiling.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.680
Then go. You have no reason to stay here.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.440
Thank you, Queen.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.920
Oh, you going home already?

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.340
Yes. I wanted to thank you, too.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.890
"Too"?

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.550
Well, whatever.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.680
If you want to thank me, buy this.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.900
This is a magic item that 
you put in the bath, and then

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.390
bubbles flow out of these holes.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.120
It's great for relaxation.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.790
Right now, it's on sale for the 
special low price of 12,000 yuls!

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.950
I'm not buying it.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:47.770
What?!

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.120
I'm sure you've earned plenty 
without me having to buy that.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.840
Well, yeah. It's great that 
I can run my business here.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.070
It's all thanks to the Queen of Witches.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:02.060
Despite what she says, she still looks after us.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.130
Yeah...

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.950
Tell Fanzell and Mariella hi for me.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.150
Tell Asta and the others hi for me, too.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.620
Hey.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.980
Have a seat.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.110
You're awake?

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.230
I woke up.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.740
So, you learn any new spells?

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.970
No, not a single one.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.760
But that's fine.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.490
I see.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:36.120
There seems to be a lot left, 
considering your usual pace.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.130
You said you wanted to have a drink 
with me, so I saved some for ya.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.730
Thank you.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.560
But... I'll have to take a rain check again.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:46.970
Why?

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:51.890
I'm going to lay off for a while
 so I can train properly.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.170
I see.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.020
Okay, I'm heading to bed.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.780
Oh, yeah.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.520
What is it?

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.030
Welcome back.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.100
I'm home!

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.730
Thank you, Queen of Witches.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.500
Thanks to you, I know what path I need to take.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.380
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 140:
 "A Favor for Julius."

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:54.270
Page 140
 A Favor for Julius

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.080
Wait, is that Sally?!
