00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.640
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.550
Here.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.670
This is yours, Asta!

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.250
You don't want it?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.910
I do! I do!

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.660
This is mine...

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.920
Go ahead, try it on.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.020
And while we're at it...

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.770
Looks good on you.
Don't you think so, Mister Yami?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.440
He looks pretty bland.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.430
And now, you're officially a member of 
the Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls!

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.140
You better work hard not to shame 
Mister Yami or the Black Bulls!

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.710
Thanks! It's a pleasure 
to work with all of you!

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.300
Shut up.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.180
Sorry!

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.940
I'll be more careful next time!

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.940
The captain just told you to shut up!

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.510
That's the other new recruit?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.860
What an insect.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.510
The Other New Recruit

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.740
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.240
I know, yeah I know

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.660
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.000
I dreamed it all my life

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.530
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.550
Don't care how much I fall

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.770
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.240
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.590
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.820
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.090
Someday I will write the next page

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.460
You are my hope

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.480
Like that page from someday

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.720
I was able to meet you

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.810
I call this a miracle

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.830
Black Bulls' Base

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.210
This is your room.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.220
Huh?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.580
Well? Isn't it depressing 
how small and filthy it is?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.850
By the way, my room is twice as big—

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.970
My own room!

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.100
He's actually moved?!

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.090
I-I've never had my own room!

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.770
At the church, we all shared a room,
so we'd sleep lined up next to each other.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.690
Hi-yah!

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.780
I'm gonna get you <i>so</i> clean!

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.690
Until you're all sparkly and shiny!

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.740
Better get scrubbin'.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.050
You're free to do whatever 
until we get a mission.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.000
Oh, by the way, Asta.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.420
Yeah?

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.510
Make sure you write letters.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.560
Huh?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.610
To everyone at that church of yours.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.550
They're your family, right? I'm sure they're 
worried about how things turned out.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.040
Right!

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.180
Don't make anyone worry about you.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.560
That's how to be a real man. See ya!

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.050
If you need anything, come see me.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.610
Right! Thanks!

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.280
This is my first castle.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.730
I'm going to climb my way up 
to Wizard King from here.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.050
I'm not going to lose. Got it, Yuno?

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.130
How unfortunate.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.050
This room is wasted on you.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.180
Tomorrow, I'll be lecturing you 
on your duties as a Magic Knight.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.120
I'd rather not be your instructor,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.260
but the captain ordered me to do so, 
and as such, I have no choice.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.390
Are you listening?

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.260
It's Yuno.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.160
I have a name, and it's Yuno, Klaus.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.410
I'm your senior.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.350
You'll address me with respect.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.410
Understood.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.730
Don't be late.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.910
Oh?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.200
Well done, Yuno!

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.720
He made it into the Magic Knights!
 He's truly our pride!

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.090
Yuno's so cool!

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.010
So cool!

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.890
I have to let the whole village know!

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.020
So, Sister, what does the 
letter from Asta say?

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.400
Man, his handwriting sucks. 
When's he coming home?

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.870
We'll have to cheer him up 
when he comes back.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.920
I'm sure even Asta would 
be depressed about that.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.660
We'll have a super tato party.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.410
He says he passed.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.420
Huh?

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.080
Asta passed, too.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.170
What?!

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.340
Seriously?!

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.680
Wow... He really passed.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.920
Th-Then I guess he won't be coming home.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.030
I see... So they both passed.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.500
All right, I'm going to tell the whole village!

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.570
This is the first bit of good news we've
gotten since Hage Village was founded!

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.570
Yeah!

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.030
I see. So Asta passed, too... I see.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.790
Asta, Yuno, congratulations.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.050
Keep doing your best.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.380
It wasn't a dream!

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.990
All right! Let's do thi—

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.930
Ow...

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.110
Was this pillar here yesterday?

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.920
Hey, newbie. Did you sleep well?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.450
Ah, g-good morning!
Um, sir, about this pillar...

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.850
What about it?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.510
I don't think it was here yesterday.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:45.790
Don't worry about a pillar. The base 
itself changes its shape all the time.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.470
Wh-What?!

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.090
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.630
Really?

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.020
All right, let's go.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.220
Okay!

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.380
You're in for a treat.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.560
I'll personally show you around 
the Black Bulls' super cool base!

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.290
Follow me, Shrimpsta!

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.630
Got it, Mr. Sunglasses!

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.440
Moron! You mean the Great Magna!

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.660
Moron! The Great Magna!

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.990
You don't need the "moron" part!

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.360
This is the cafeteria!

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.490
What do you think? It's stupidly huge!

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.120
Yeah! It's really big!

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.180
This is the bath.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.380
It's hot!

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.330
This kind of heat is nothing to 
a member of the Black Bulls!

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.570
What? You're getting out already?

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.620
N-No, not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.850
It's hot. I want to add cold water. 
Hanging out naked is nice, though.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.540
Over there are all the girls' rooms.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.070
If any of us guys go in,
you'll be killed by trap magic.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.520
What?!

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.980
And this is... the toilet!

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.780
I'll kill you.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.280
Sorry!

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:03.970
This is the beasts' room!

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.680
Wh-Why?!

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.390
This is Mister Yami's hobby.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:08.850
Asta!

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.880
Y-Yes?

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.440
I'll let you have the duty of 
taking care of all the animals.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.270
Huh?

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:20.340
It's a very honorable role. I really don't 
want to let you have it, but I will.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.260
Feed 'em twice a day,
in the morning and at night.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.980
Go on, give it a try.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.600
R-Right...

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.740
There, there... Here, eat.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.070
This is the library.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.980
Right!

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.910
This is the playroom.
You can have plenty of fun here.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.200
H-Huh?!

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.850
Come on! Try to keep up!

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.150
Wait up!

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.710
I'm not gonna lose!

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.550
Ow!

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.960
Magna?

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.160
A Black Bulls robe. Which means...

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.890
Hey, Asta. That's your colleague.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.410
She's the other new recruit this year!

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.850
Huh? My colleague?

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.390
I love the sound of that!

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.150
Hey! I'm Asta, from Hage Village!

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.320
Let's do our best together! 
It's nice to meet you!

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.730
I didn't give you permission to speak to me.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.830
I barely sense any mana 
from you, you lowly insect.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.120
Insect?!

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.580
Lowly?!

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.290
My name is Noelle Silva. I belong 
to the royal family of this kingdom.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.930
What?!

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.800
R-R-R-Royal family?!

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.740
I do beg your pardon.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.090
I'm but a puny insect that someone 
could blow away just by breathing.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.990
As long as you understand.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.720
Wait.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.490
Who're you calling an insect, huh?!

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.700
We're supposed to be 
colleagues as Magic Knights!

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.070
Who cares if you're royalty?!

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.910
That's right, Asta! You tell her!
Status means nothing!

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.210
Of course it does.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.840
How do you figure?!

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.590
Are foolish peasants unable to 
understand this with words alone?

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.510
I guess I'll have to show you with the 
difference between our magical powers.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.350
H-Hey!

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.190
Know your place.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.280
I won't make it in ti—

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.010
What?!

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.830
You little bitch!

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.460
You've got some nerve! What do you 
think you're doing to your senior?!

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.770
You were just standing in the wrong spot.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.470
Who gave you permission to stand there?

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.210
What?!

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.280
Why, you little...

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.480
I'm your senior!

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.530
And I'm royalty!

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.040
What?!

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.070
I don't care if you're royalty or the 
Silver Eagles' captain's little sister!

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:22.940
Huh?

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:28.300
I mean, the only person who'd accept 
a spoiled brat like you is Mister Yami!

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.400
Be more thankful, you moron!

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.040
I held back because you're a girl, but now 
I'm gonna have to initiate you, too, damn it!

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.050
Like I want to be in this pathetic squad.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.770
You little...

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.350
Hey! What the hell do 
you think you're doing?!

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.850
Who cares about the Black Bulls?
I don't need that filthy thing.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.270
This is the absolute 
worst Magic Knights Squad,

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.860
and it's not where royalty 
like myself belongs!

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.900
You bastard! Apologize to 
the robe and Mister Yami!

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:12.770
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize, 
damn it! You moron!

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.870
The robe I worked so hard 
to get... She just...

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.740
What the heck was her problem?

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.110
I couldn't find the toilet 
and ended up outside.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.260
Wha...

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.600
What? What? What?!

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.540
Noelle...

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.700
Why?

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.510
Why won't it go the way...

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.190
I want it to?!

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.270
I guess I'm just...

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:30.340
Apparently, the youngest of the Silva family 
can't even control her magical powers.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.530
Who would have thought someone like that 
would be born into the royal family?

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.820
What's with that flimsy little grimoire?

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.410
Are you really royalty?

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:46.130
It's just pathetic that you can't 
even control your powers.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.420
It disgusts me that you're my little sister.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:57.100
I will not have someone as shameful 
as you in the Silver Eagles.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.940
Why couldn't you have died 
instead of our mother?

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.150
You're a complete failure.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:13.780
I'm not a failure!
I'll make them acknowledge me!

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.790
I guess she's got it rough, too.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.550
Hey!

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.000
Insect?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.780
H-How long have you...

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.050
I'm going to be mocked again...

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.080
I...

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.710
I will not have someone as shameful 
as you in the Silver Eagles.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.820
It's just pathetic that you can't 
even control your powers.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.810
Are you really royalty?

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.000
N...

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.810
N?

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.740
No!

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.270
All done taking a dump.
Guess I'll go back to bed now.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.760
What the heck is that?

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.680
Oh, dear...

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.640
Wow.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.200
This is insane.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.040
Someone's magic is out of control.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.250
Such immense magical power...

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.610
This is gonna get bad if 
we don't do something.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:01.660
If we attack it with magic, 
she might not make it out alive.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.350
Could you use your spatial magic
to scoop just her up?

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.280
Please don't be ridiculous. 
I can't get near that.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.360
Right. If only we had someone who 
could nullify magical powers...

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.250
Oh, no!

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.430
You came flying by at the perfect time.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.880
Huh?

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.950
Could you go take care of that?

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.870
Take care of that?!

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.570
Okay!

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:33.490
Wait. How am I supposed to get 
over there, though? I can't fly...

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.090
Quit yer yapping.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:41.510
Now is the time when you need 
to go beyond your limits!

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.040
I'm done for!

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.630
All right! I'm alive!

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.420
That was so much fun, wasn't it?

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.930
Jeez. Now I'm all wet.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.680
Thanks for that spatial magic!

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.850
You're welcome!

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.140
Well done, brat.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.280
Right!

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.020
Hey, you!

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.860
You failure...

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.030
They're going to mock me again.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.040
You...

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.340
...have some insane magical powers!
That's so awesome!

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:56.960
Huh?

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:02.220
I don't have any magical powers, 
so I'm jealous, damn it!

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.290
If you train so you can learn to control them,

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.850
you'll be invincible, Noelle!

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.850
Insec—

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.110
Asta...

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.490
I'm gonna keep doing my 
best so I won't lose, either!

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.700
Really? You just couldn't 
control your magical powers?

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.050
You should've told me earlier, 
you royal failure.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.370
We're the Black Bulls.
We're a whole group of failures!

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:43.720
No one cares if you have 
a flaw or two, you idiot.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.770
Anyway, thank goodness you're safe.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:54.270
By the way, I know a great pasta place.
Want to go sometime?

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.960
Before that, you should try this. 'Kay?

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.100
That was amazing.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.690
If anything, the one thing I'm great 
at is controlling magical powers,

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.520
so I'll help you out.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.500
I'll show you some womanly techniques, too.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.580
I'll tell you how much of an 
angel my little sister Marie is.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.290
Let's start out as friends.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.540
Here.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.550
Let's do our best together.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.050
It's a pleasure to work with you.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.290
No one can escape from here

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:58.040
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:06.020
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.730
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.730
I've thought many times

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.650
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:27.380
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:34.860
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:41.660
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:49.000
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.170
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.280
Petit Clover

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.530
Petit Clover!

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.790
Honor Me

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.580
Honor Me.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.730
I am Noelle Silva, and I am a royal (ouzoku).

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.800
A bandit (sanzoku)?

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.750
Who are you calling a bandit?

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.460
I'm a royal.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.530
A pirate (kaizoku)?

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.470
Who are you calling a pirate?

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.920
I'm a royal!

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.330
Family (Kazoku)?

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.130
Y-You idiot...

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:41.370
Our first mission as Magic Knights!

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.860
All right! I'll kick ass and go 
straight to being Wizard King!

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.150
Huh? The mission is to hunt boars?

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.050

Not giving up is my magic!
