WEBVTT

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.820
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demon.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.370
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.410
His name was Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.800
He would eventually be called the first 
Wizard King, and he became a legend.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.740
The Final Attack

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.380
What was that shaking just now?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.290
Did something happen up above?

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.260
What in the world are these 
creepy crawly things, anyway?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.910
If not for Gueldre's transparency magic, 
we would've been done for immediately.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.420
Not to mention, there are 
ridiculously powerful

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.370
mages lurking everywhere around here.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.610
I knew I shouldn't have come here.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.460
There's always some danger 
in anything you do.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.880
But we need to get out of here 
before I run out of mana.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.540
Where's the exit?

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.310
Licht's ultimate spell...

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.320
Those things just couldn't 
bear it any longer.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.760
How crazy strong is that spell, anyway?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.300
It pretty much saved our asses, though.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.820
But we ended up way further down.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.450
Thanks for fixing my arm, Prickly Queen.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.330
Now we're even.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.900
I can probably manage another Dimension Slash.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.110
I can feel the evil mana and 
ki even this far away...

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.010
So you're telling me that 
insane attack wasn't enough?

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.490
I wanna hurry up and get back there,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.270
but jumping in without 
a plan isn't a great idea.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.110
I'm not sure why, but my darkness 
magic works against that devil.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.430
If I can get the chance to 
land a final blow on him...

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.820
I think the only other one who stands a chance

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.350
is our lively little kid.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.830
The sword that boy is using... That's Licht's.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.090
After Licht's grimoire became

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.140
a five-leaf grimoire that
 could be used by devils,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.840
it apparently acquired anti-magic 
from a different devil.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.220
Crap... There's too much power!

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.060
You clearly don't have control.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.960
He just shattered a spear 
from the other world.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.460
Its effects can trap light magic and 
warp space, and it even ignored that!

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.120
I don't know what devil this power belongs to,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.870
but you need to learn your 
place in the pecking order!

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.220
Word Soul Magic...

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.340
"Voizuiinemidoren..."

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.510
"Futogerueofu..."

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.640
"Snoittnedeidoog."

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.740
Thank you for—

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.630
First Wizard King!

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.010
Light Magic: Light Swords of Conviction!

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.510
Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.050
Damn it!

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.220
As I thought, our magic has no 
effect against the devil's magic.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.750
Even though we also have four-leaf 
magic, he's on another level.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.480
The only thing I can do right now...

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.680
I should be able to do it...

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.730
This time, not to hurt others...

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.060
but to protect!

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.120
Demon Light Magic: 
Light Swords of Conviction!

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.620
Yes!

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.650
You may be rotten now, but you're 
still an elf chosen by the four-leaf.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.710
Not bad at all,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.630
though it's all for naught, of course.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.720
I should be able to do... what everyone 
else is doing with their magic!

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.350
So should I make it take 
shape... and hold it there?

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.540
Are you all right, Your Highness?

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.610
Ow, ow, ow...

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.790
Anti-magic sure is something!

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.870
I don't think I'll be able 
to use magic for a while.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.980
So you're not all right, then.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.460
There's little chance it'll work...

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.500
But I'll use my sealing magic to bind it, 
and then I'll try to control it.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.340
No.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.100
I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.720
Why are you taking forever 
over there, Asta?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.930
If you can't even use your 
power to its full extent,

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.290
then you've still got a long way to go...

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.620
before you can become the Wizard King!

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.320
Yu...no?

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.010
He used the wind to condense the dregs of 
our magic, which had returned to the air,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.700
and managed to create a sword from it
 that should work on the devil's spells.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.460
And that's since our battle started. 
His growth is incredibly fast!

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.340
Wind Spirit Creation Magic:
 Spirit of Zephyr.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.910
Hey, I was just about to get it, okay?!

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.850
See? You can do it if you try.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.360
Yeah. Because...

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.110
I'm gonna be the Wizard King!

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.360
Anti-Magic Demon-Slayer Sword:
 Black Divider!

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.570
Unbelievable!

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.820
How are they able to evolve so fast?

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.570
A wind attribute and sword magic?

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.790
I see. So he's...

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.070
But who's the boy using the five-leaf grimoire?

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:15.490
A foolish little boy who was born without 
any magic and doesn't know his place.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.720
He worked harder than anyone in this 
kingdom and never knew when to give up.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.260
He truly is a foolish boy.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.050
Did you see that, Yuno, you jerk?!

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:33.490
I managed to give it shape, but I doubt 
I'm gonna last long at all!

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.990
Make sure you last until we cut him down, Asta!

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.740
I'll finish this in an instant!

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.710
I'll admit, you're rather lively.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.840
But do you think you'll be able 
to reach me at that speed?

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.610
He became even faster... 
because of the wind magic.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.270
The anti-magic pursued the wind, and the
 wind magic raced through the void.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.120
What a magnificent combination!

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.620
They... did it?

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.390
You trash...

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.500
How dare you?

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.450
Really, how dare you?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.180
You filthy maggot with no magic...

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.890
I'm done with this.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.970
Despair and resistance are 
merely my playthings.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.410
It's over. I'll kill you all.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.880
This can't be...

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.190
You're nothing more than a ripple in a pond.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.740
My powers...

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.490
I pierced his heart... but it just 
appeared somewhere else?

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.480
"Voizuiinemidoren."

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.660
"Futogerueofu."

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.250
"Snoittnedeidoog."

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.930
I'll make sure to exterminate 
every single last one of you.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.090
That devil's actually getting serious.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.300
At this rate, he's going 
to swallow up everything!

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.410
Come on, you can't be serious!

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.160
We can't even get close to this thing now.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.330
This is proving difficult even for 
those of us who can stand against him.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.370
At this rate, everyone down below...

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.710
Patry...

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.130
Sorry, but I'll need you to 
hold the perimeter for a bit.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.800
We cannot let the people of the present die.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.480
They are the mages who carry the future 
of the Clover Kingdom, after all.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.460
You're nothing more than a lump 
of meat! Foolish and useless!

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.460
Goodbye.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.610
I'll kill all of you.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.440
I'll slaughter all of you.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.440
Humanity is finished.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.440
Bring down the curtain.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.660
Who said you get to end this, you dark,
 creepy freak covered in mouths?!

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.080
You still good to go, Yuno?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.080
That's my line, Asta!

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.820
Let's shut that guy up!

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.020
You're no better than vomit.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.250
You just swarm grossly in front of me.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.690
And yet you

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.180
had the nerve to bite me.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.280
Die.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.720
You'll have to pay with your deaths.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.520
No other way.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.290
You're just maggots hiding under a rock.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.140
I'll twist off your arms and legs.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.130
I'll rot your mana and lives, then kill you.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.130
Die!

00:11:59.130 --> 00:11:59.700
Die!

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.360
Die!

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:00.770
Die!

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:01.290
Die!

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.070
Die!

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.900
Because the anti-magic is so effective on him...

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.750
That's why he avoided that attack to his heart

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.000
and why that damage has gotten him so furious.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.620
If we can get Asta's sword to 
actually pierce his heart...

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.590
Damn it! There's no end to this!

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.430
Crap! My body's nearing its limit...

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.350
The anti-magic boy,

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.360
and the wind-magic boy he's fighting 
alongside, who he trusts so much...

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.730
We must leave this in their hands.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.820
We'll go save their friends.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.180
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.260
It's almost time...

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.590
Soon I'll be able to sever
 her healing magic, too!

00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.900
Wait a sec!

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.260
We really shouldn't be fighting here right now!

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.520
Nozel! Mimosa!

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.540
This place is about to be 
flooded with inhuman magic!

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.400
Evacuate immediately, all of you!

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:23.150
Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium Barrage!

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.030
Lady Mereoleona, too?

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.940
To think magic like this even existed...

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.540
The world certainly is vast!

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.290
La! What's all this yucky-looking stuff?!

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.130
It's getting even more intense!

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.240
Not good!

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.380
It's going to swallow me up!

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.440
The Demon-Dweller Sword bestows

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.390
and stores up magic for those who have 
bonds with each other, and connects them.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.020
Since my magic has a chance against the devil,

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.400
we'll send it through the 
sword to everyone else.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.900
Combo Spell: Demon-Dweller Sword
 ~ Protecting Light!

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.080
What is this?

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.590
This is Licht and your prince's magic.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.340
Prince?

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.730
My connection with Licht shows 
me what's going on up above.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:32.350
Looks like the prince got 
to have a touching reunion.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.850
He's making me jealous.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.270
As long as my magic lasts, I won't 
let a single one of them die!

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.240
Demon Light Creation Magic: 
Light Whip of Judgment!

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.240
The bond between them...

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.980
I won't doubt it this time!

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.920
As long as we have this light, 
we can concentrate on attacking!

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.300
Hey, what's with that light? No fair, Yuno!

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.510
You just need to concentrate on finishing 
the devil, you one-and-done moron.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.430
I know that, you multi-talented, 
handsome jerk!

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.240
It's so much fun when you die pathetically.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.320
Your sword still hasn't reached me.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.860
It's utterly useless.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.110
Already...

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.110
Right here...

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:29.440
Just like this...

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.700
Finally...

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.450
It's over.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.430
You're finished.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.530
Again, keep your distance, human.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.560
Hey, you still owe me from earlier. Let me in.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.860
By the way, you said you can see 
what's going on above, right?

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.160
I was just thinking that having nothing

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.840
but mana detection and ki 
to rely on is really unsafe.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.100
Tell me what that creepy thing 
is doing, Prickly Queen.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.190
You can't possibly be... From here?

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.350
I don't like how you asked,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.360
but I'll at least add momentum to your strike.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.860
Don't you dare miss!

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.090
Yeah.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.530
We'll do an all-out attack...

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.360
and finish this!

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.740
At first, I only got close to 
you so that I could use you.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.530
You coincidentally managed to obtain

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.530
the five-leaf grimoire that kept magic away.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.400
A boy with no magic...

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.420
But the longer I stayed with you,
and the more I saw you fight,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.640
the more I wanted to believe in you.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.760
I wanted to bet on you!

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.510
Please...

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.970
Win this, Asta!

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.990
This light... I can feel my power welling forth.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.390
Is Asta at his limit?

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.880
Asta, I'm gonna leave you 
behind if you can't keep up!

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.960
Where do you think you're going, Yuno?!

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.190
You're just a human.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.880
Yet you're using spirit power

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.100
and elven powers...

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.520
To fight my magic...

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.210
But you cannot pierce my heart with that wind.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.840
That anti-magic brat 
is merely letting himself

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.780
be pulled along, following that 
wind magic. He's hopeless.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.470
And he isn't even following properly.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.280
They're nothing to worry about... hmm?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.290
Where'd the anti-magic brat go?

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.790
He hid in the shadows of the severed magic!

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.420
He's in my blind spot, coming from
 a different direction!

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.260
They're pulling each other in and speeding up!

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.570
"Sto—"

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.500
"Stop."

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.290
"Weaken!"

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.400
"Go back!"

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.400
"Hold back!"

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.180
"Stop!"

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.440
I reached my... limit?

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.650
Asta!

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.690
Too bad!

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.560
His... His concentration is astounding!

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.580
But it's still not possible. 
Not from this distance!

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.770
You sure about this?

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.090
Making a foreigner like me a 
Magic Knights Squad captain?

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.090
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll do fine.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.140
I mean, I'm gonna do whatever I want.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.600
I'm sure the higher-ups aren't gonna like this.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.100
Just because my magic's a bit rare...

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.500
I know.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.610
Because I've watched you all this time.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.570
Yami...

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.630
I know you can do this.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.420
Mana Zone...

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.020
Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash ~ Equinox!

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.780
Equinox

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:50.050
Dark magic can interfere with the other world!

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.290
This ki...

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.290
It's... Captain Yami!

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.550
You maggots!

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.810
Sealing Recovery Magic...
Heavenly Prison: Faint Omen.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.760
I've sealed his physical damage.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.950
Now it's just a question of whether he 
can draw out his anti-magic power.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.570
Asta!

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.320
Die!

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.070
Perish!

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.080
Disappear!

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.970
You go ahead and do that!

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.340
You pieces of trash!

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.090
Asta...

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.500
You're going to be...

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.410
You're going to be the Wizard King, right?

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.070
Yeah!

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.930
Right here, right now...

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.680
I'll surpass my limits!

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.810
Asta... Did we do it?

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.060
This is exactly why you're my rival!

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.110
The Shadow Palace is starting to crumble?

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.990
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 120: "Dawn."

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 120
 Dawn

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.990
The battle ends, and a new morning comes!
