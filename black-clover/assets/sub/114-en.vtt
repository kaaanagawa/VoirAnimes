00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.820
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.090
Here we go!

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.220
To the Shadow Palace!

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.490
In order to save the souls of those 
who had reincarnated as elves,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.360
Asta and the others stormed 
the Shadow Palace.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.070
These pictures...

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.110
Welcome!

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.650
Rill!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.450
Just wait! I'll wake you up right now!

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.700
Inside the Shadow Palace, 
Asta and Mimosa encountered Rill,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.620
while Noelle ran into Fana.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.210
Fana? Wh-What are you doing here?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.460
I may be Fana, but I'm not the Fana you know.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.970
Watch your mouth. I guess I'll have 
to teach you some manners, brat.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.510
Mereoleona faced off with Vetto,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.480
while Fuegoleon faced off with Kaiser.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.140
Both of them ended up in a heated battle.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.980
Be...

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.730
...gone!

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.690
Be...

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.530
...gone!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.150
No.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.370
I must...

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.700
...be strong!

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.710
The Final Invaders

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.380
Aw, I lost her.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.520
My Valkyrie Armor... I'm not able to 
use it to its full potential yet...

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.270
But I'm far more mobile than she is.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.740
She must be the complete 
version of Fana the Hateful,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.490
who once possessed Fana 
of the Diamond Kingdom.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.740
In that case...

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.230
Up until now, I was afraid 
of its overall power,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.150
so I've been concentrating on control 
and held back on my attacks...

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.890
but I guess I can go all-out!

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.980
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.660
Huh?

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.070
Huh?! I-I-I'm so sorry!

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.510
Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.390
Wow, that was pretty intense! 
I lost my clothes again.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.620
We ended up using forbidden magic,

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.400
so we get to use some magic from the 
other world to cast supernatural spells.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.030
What am I...

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.370
Sorry... I sorta got sick of dying.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.870
What am I supposed to do about this?!

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.960
Plant Magic: Magic Cannon Flower!

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.640
There's no end to this!

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.360
Damn it... I don't have time 
to go into my black form!

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.450
And even if I could, if I can't land a 
hit on Rill for sure, there's no point!

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.450
Hm... Maybe the color's too light here.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.820
Oh, you're still alive?

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.620
At this rate...

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.660
Asta!

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.930
I'm so sorry! I'll heal you—

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.190
Yeah...

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.050
But it doesn't look like we're going 
to get a break anytime soon.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.030
Mimosa! Get on my back, and then 
tie us together with vines!

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.970
Huh?

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.060
We have no choice but to combine!

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.140
C-Combine?

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.220
Hurry!

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.020
A-All right...

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.190
Plant Recovery Magic: 
Princess-Healing Flower Robe!

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.410
All right! Come at us!

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.670
Whoopsie!

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.930
Aw.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.530
The elves from the Golden Dawn
 are really strong.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.610
We've been close, but we haven't 
managed to strike a decisive blow!

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.230
Not yet!

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.670
This magic...

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.100
Expand your Mana Zones and form magic paths.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.200
I want all of you to join the 
Magic Knights who are already fighting

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.050
and focus all your energy 
on supporting them

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.410
with long-range offensive spells.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.420
Let's go!

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.230
La?

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.390
He's...

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.200
He's beautiful.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.650
He's no match for my beauty... 
But he's beautiful.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.520
He...

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.880
Are you telling me he gathered all 
the Magic Knights that had been

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.500
scattered all over the kingdom 
in this short amount of time?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.160
Yuno!

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.660
I'm so glad you're here!

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.580
Please, have some food!

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.970
I don't think now's the time for...

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.140
What are you doing here, you raccoon?!

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.970
The castle was in trouble, 
and they needed my help.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.580
This food...

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.490
It recovers your magic?

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.220
That's amazing. Thank you.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.350
That's amazing... Thank you...

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.840
He said it was amazing!

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.730
That's amazing

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.730
That's amazing

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.260
You're very welcome!

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.710
What's the current situation?

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.650
Um, Asta and the captains are 
fighting their last battle with

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.540
the enemy's strongest members 
in that pitch-black castle.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.280
The entrance has already closed, though.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.380
Asta's already in there?

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.630
What is that light?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.700
Hey! Get away from Yuno this instant!

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.640
But he hasn't had dessert yet!

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.190
Dessert, my butt! I'm his dessert!

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.890
I'll follow you to the ends of the 
world and cook you nummy nums!

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.390
Sit tight, Asta.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.950
Um, Asta's hot rival friend 
just got into the castle.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.540
So did Charmy. No fair.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.450
Yuno! Where'd you go, Yuno?!

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.550
And what was that weird place we just 
went through? And where am I now?!

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.390
Oh, I'm in hell.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.140
La?!

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.830
What the heck is this place?!

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.920
Miz Charmy!

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.670
Asta!

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.170
How'd you get in here?

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.270
La!

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.840
I have no idea! I was just hanging on to Yuno!

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.310
Yuno's here, too?

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.890
Where are you, Yuno? What is all of this?

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.270
These monsters are spells that Rill drew.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.740
We have to do something about him!

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.950
Huh?

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.910
Miz Charmy?

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.570
That's not it... This just isn't right.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.040
I can't draw it right!

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.930
I drew some monsters because I thought

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.870
they'd be fitting for the end of all humans...

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.040
But I actually want to 
draw something prettier.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.240
I don't want to draw something so warped.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.550
This is all... This is all the humans' fault!

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.880
Look at you, all aggravated.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.480
You must be starving. La?

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.440
Have some food and calm down. La?

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.750
When did she...

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.190
Shut up!

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.700
Get away from me, human.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.580
I would never eat anything 
you humans made.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.170
Hey.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.810
What do you think you're 
doing to that food?

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.590
Cotton Creation Magic: 
Strike of the Sleeping Sheep!

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.970
In order for me to create, 
I need to destroy them first!

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.060
Both the humans and all 
the things they create!

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.910
Mi...

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.690
Miz Charmy!

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.210
Miz Charmy!

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.130
What was that chill?

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.510
What is this mana?

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.690
Miz... Charmy?

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.690
Hey... Can I come out now?

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.300
What in the world is this magic?

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.700
It doesn't belong to a normal human.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.050
Wait!

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.380
She got bigger?!

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.260
This magic... I've felt it before.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:53.270
You were born to a human and a dwarf...

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.240
And you have characteristics of both.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.130
You're a hybrid!

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.470
Between a human and...

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.020
...a d-dwarf?

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:02.870
D...

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.560
Dwarf?!

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.110
She didn't know, either?!

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.220
Wait! What the heck's a dwarf, anyway?!

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.620
Well...

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.810
I-I don't know too many details, 
since I only heard about them

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.120
from folktales our elderly 
butler would tell us, but...

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.880
They were another race that lived long ago,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.090
separate from the elves, 
who also had special skills.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.300
Hey! Weren't you a sheep?!

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.100
Shut up.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.390
It spoke!

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.170
None of that matters right now.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.400
T-True, you have a point.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.330
More importantly... I'm starving.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.010
Jeez, you're annoying.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.990
You may be half dwarf, but if 
you're going to get in my way...

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.370
You can disappear, too!

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.460
Well, I hope you make lots of those.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.590
They're all my food!

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.380
Food Magic: Glutton's Banquet!

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.530
It's... eating magic!

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.760
Isn't Miz Charmy's magic 
supposed to be cotton magic?

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.260
No...

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.350
I've heard of this before...

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.520
That hybrids can end up with 
two magical attributes.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.060
This is...

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.880
The magic of mine that the wolf ate...
It's becoming hers!

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.700
It's being eaten faster than I can draw it!

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.490
My imagination won't be 
beaten by your appetite!

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.040
You're going to regret...

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.410
wasting that food earlier!

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.210
This is for the protein!

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.090
This is for the fat!

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:55.430
They're just punches enhanced by 
magic... but they're so powerful!

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.630
And this one's...

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.890
for the carbs!

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.230
You can't be serious...

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.110
This isn't enough to get rid 
of my hatred of humans!

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.450
La! I'm not done yet, either!

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:14.820
This is for the vitamins!

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.210
This is for the fiber!

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.660
This is for the collagen!

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.830
This is for the sodium!

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.510
Th-This is...

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.510
This is for the potassium!

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.910
This is for the calcium!

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.500
This is insane!

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.500
This is for the magnesium!

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.000
Asta! You go on ahead!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.010
I'm gonna pound the importance 
of food into his body!

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.010
We have to hurry.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.660
I'm counting on you, Miz Charmy!

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.010
Leave it to me!

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.240
Which way, Mimosa?

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.180
There were a number of paths,

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.520
but a few of them are blocked 
because of all the intense fighting.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.520
If we can just move up...

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.970
Let's use that way!

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:49.900
Got it!

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.550
Too bad. It's useless, no matter 
how many times you attack.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.830
I'm gonna turn you into ashes soon, 'kay?

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.960
I-If only Stupidsta was here...

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.840
Ast... Huh?!

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.550
I found a chick that looks like
 she's worth slicing up!

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.310
Why did it have to be you?!

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.140
Huh?! You got a problem, little girl?!

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:29.030
Who's that?

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.110
David!

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.320
He's a senior of mine from the Golden Dawn.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.400
He was possessed by an elf...

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.660
I wonder if someone defeated him.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.630
Well, this is the perfect opportunity.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.380
There are faint traces of magic here.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:55.380
But it doesn't seem to belong to 
humans or elves... What's going on?

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.300
I'll use Magic Flower Guidepost again.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.300
This is... Below the strongest magic,

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.530
there's a space with something 
that looks like a pedestal.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.520
There are three elves there!

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.850
And this magic is... Yuno!

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.610
Let's go!

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.050
Wait for me, Yuno!

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.620
Well, this is a surprise...

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.530
We sent Ado's group to pick you up,

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.120
but you took them out instead,
then got here on your own.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.130
I mean, I'm glad you got 
here safely on your own.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.130
You'll be giving us that magic stone now.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.550
I've been waiting for this moment...

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.850
As usual, Ronne, you're so quiet that 
I have no idea what you're saying!

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.200
And now, finally... everything will return.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.850
Including our future...

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.860
And Licht's smile.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.050
Light Creation Magic: 
Light Swords of Conviction.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.870
Copy Light Magic: 
Light Swords of Conviction.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.530
Mana Zone: Spirit's Hushed Dance.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.720
What?

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.370
He managed to evade all those attacks?

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.010
Mana Zone: Spirit Storm Double!

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.810
In the time it took to get here,

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.570
this kid managed to level up his power 
both as a human and as an elf...

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.930
This kid...

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.730
In terms of sheer native talent, 
he might actually surpass Licht.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.610
My Mana Zone couldn't detect him?

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.310
It wasn't super speed.
He just suddenly appeared there!

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:44.240
Again!

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.690
No... He forced me to move.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:52.940
He can forcibly change the position 
of someone he's touched once.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.890
I don't know if it's a magic stone 
or not, but that belongs to me.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.820
Give it back!

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.560
Nice job, Ronne!

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.280
No one ever could beat you at tag.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.280
Now... we'll finally make things right.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.710
Yeah.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.710
I can tell when someone's lying.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.750
Why was what you just said a lie, Ronne?

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.380
Raia?

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.090
Who the hell are you?

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.560
Huh?

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.910
Don't tell me this reincarnation is...

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.510
Petit Clover

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.260
Petit Clover!

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.010
I Can Tell When Someone's Lying

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.710
I Can Tell When Someone's Lying.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.390
You can tell when someone's 
lying, right, Raia?

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.460
Yeah, I can tell when someone's lying.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.620
So if a liar said that they were a liar,

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.900
you'd be able to figure 
out if that's true or not.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.630
Yeah, I can tell when someone's lying.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.800
I mean, if a liar is telling 
you that they're lying,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.040
they're just honestly telling you that 
they're lying, but it's hard to tell?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.690
But wait. Maybe they're 
lying about being a liar?

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:21.710
But that would mean they're honest,
 and honest people don't lie...

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.890
So that would make them a liar,

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.880
but liars wouldn't just come out 
and say that they're liars...

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.640
So, um... uh... I... 
I don't know. I don't know.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.380
I don't know... I don't know...
 I don't know...

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:37.380
This is a famous paradox. All of 
you should think about it, too.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.030
That guy isn't Ronne.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.310
This magic... Who is that guy?

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.880
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 115: "Mastermind."

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 115
 Mastermind

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.990
Wait... What have we been 
trying to do this whole time?
