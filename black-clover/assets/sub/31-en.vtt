00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.640
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.800
Asta visited Nean, the town where 
Rebecca and her siblings lived,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.770
but it turned out to be where Gauche's 
beloved little sister Marie lived, as well.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.020
All right! Are you read—

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.350
Huh? What?

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.990
Get away from her this instant, you trash!

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.110
That night, a certain incident struck Nean.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.820
Die, Asta.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.670
That's not even your house!

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.200
Snow? When did it pile up so much?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.670
It's not even the season for that yet.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.460
Hey! What do you two think you're doing?!

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.090
The kids are gone!

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.810
Starting today,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990
you're all my friends.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.790
Pursuit Over the Snow

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.510
Luca, Marco, where could 
you have gone at this hour?

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.580
Barshim!

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.650
Helen, where are you?

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.460
Guess they didn't just go out to pee—

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.580
Die!

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.630
I'll never let you marry my sister.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.880
Now's not the time for that!

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.940
There's nothing more important 
than Marie, damn it!

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.470
I'll kill you!

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.770
Hey, what the heck's going on in this town?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.810
Why is it snowing this time 
of year? This is absurd!

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.460
Noelle? What are you doing here?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.460
I-I just happened to be in the area.
It's just a coincidence.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.380
Who's this, Asta?

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.150
She's one of my Magic Knight buddies.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.320
And Noelle, this is my friend Rebecca.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.450
Friend...

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.580
Buddy...

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.260
Huh...

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.180
What's wrong?

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.710
N-Nothing...

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.960
More importantly,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.510
I saw a whole bunch of kids go 
up to the mountains earlier.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.460
What's that about?

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.290
Do you guys have some 
festival this late at night?

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.720
That must be...

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.970
I'm going to make you bleed.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.380
Stop it.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.620
Old hag...

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.980
The old Sister!

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.350
I feel magical power in this snow.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.980
There is magic at work here.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.480
Magic that can control others...

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.630
and that only affects children 
whose magic hasn't matured.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.740
What?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.120
A number of ours were taken, too.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.210
What do they mean to do, 
taking all these children?

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.750
Hey, old hag, what do you mean, "taken"?

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.750
Don't tell me Marie was, too!

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.470
Sadly, that is what I'm saying.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.580
You old hag!

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.420
Sister Theresa!

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.540
How could you let that happen,
you stupid old hag?!

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.720
Please stop!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.330
So quick to resort to violence... 
You really are a failure.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.020
If you want to hit me, go ahead.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.330
But that won't bring back the children.
It won't bring back Marie.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.270
You're right.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.380
But I won't feel better until I do!

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.780
Asta! Are you all right?!

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.280
Asta, you bastard.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.470
Oh, come on now, Gauche.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.690
Just cool down a little, okay?

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.630
A Magic Knight needs to 
stay calm at all times.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.630
Well, listen to you.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.070
Calm, eh? You're right.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.140
So you finally understand?

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.700
I'll calmly kill you.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.730
I went too far!

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.030
That hurt, you stupid little brat!

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.660
Wait, wait, wait! 
Now's not the time for this!

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.970
We need to find some clues!

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.350
What? As if it'll be that easy!

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.860
The magic mirror that I have Marie 
keep with her at all times...

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.610
I wouldn't be able to transmit 
to it because of this snow,

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.120
but if I search for the 
mana in that mirror...

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.260
I should be able to figure out where she is.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.710
That's it!

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.100
All right! I may have figured
that out, but I'm still killing you.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.380
I'll kill you while giving thanks.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.890
I'm going, as well. I'm going to get the 
kids from the church and the town back.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.610
Old Sister, leave this to us.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.780
No. As much as it pains me to 
say it, this old hag will be useful.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.940
Huh? She's not just an ordinary old lady?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.110
I'm not going to lose to 
you young'uns just yet.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.080
Asta... Marco's an idiot and Luca's too
headstrong, so I'm worried about them...

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.000
What should I do? If something 
were to happen to them...

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.910
Get a hold of yourself, Rebecca!

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.670
Take that!

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.420
It'll be fine! I'll get them 
back, no matter what!

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.700
They'll laugh at you if you're 
all panicky when we get back.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.180
Y-You're right.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.060
Let's go.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.810
Hey, I'm going, too!

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.810
You can't fly on your own either, can you? 
Do you want to dangle, like him?

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.950
The town might be attacked again.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.780
Would you mind staying behind?

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.060
And could you report back 
to the Magic Knights?

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.060
I'm counting on you, Asta!

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.040
I have to stay behind with her?

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.490
I'm so happy I made so many friends.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.910
L-Let's all get along.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.660
Where am I?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.080
This isn't the church. What am I doing here?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.080
Everyone seems out of it. What's wrong?

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.860
Who is that?

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.280
Make sure you stay good boys and 
girls with the spell I'm using.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.310
Did he put a spell on everyone?

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.030
Come to think of it, Brother did say that

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.550
the mirror he gave me would 
protect me from magic a little.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.600
Hang on to this mirror as if it were me.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.460
So that's why I...

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.050
Looks like my spell on you has been broken.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.320
I wonder why. You bad little girl...

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:37.320
We can't be friends if you won't be 
a good girl and stay under my spell.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.490
But you're wrong. Putting someone under 
a spell and making them do what you say

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.120
doesn't make them a real friend.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.980
How could you say something so cruel?

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.130
A friend would never say that!

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.760
Neige...

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.550
I told you not to damage the goods.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.600
Honestly, you're so hopeless.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.600
I'm sorry, Baro!

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.690
She's the prize this time. Imagine
having that much magic at her age!

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.010
Having this many brats means a big payday!

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.210
That brat barely has any magic.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.350
I told you to only bring ones 
with a lot of magic, Neige!

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.750
Sorry, Baro.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.800
Just gonna have to throw 
trash like this away.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.650
Sheesh. Stop wasting my time.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.110
Now, then... Let's draw the magic out of you.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.410
We're close. The mana's getting stronger.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.000
Right!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.290
These enemies must possess 
powerful magic. Be on your guard.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.840
Wait for me, Marie.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.880
Please be safe, everyone!

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.820
Everyone, please stay calm. 
We, the Magic Knights, will find all the kids.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.110
The Magic Knights!

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.060
Please get my son back!

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.670
What's going on?

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.110
Where are Luca and Marco?

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.240
Well...

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.370
Don't worry. Asta and Gauche 
will bring them all back soon.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.050
Y-Yeah! So don't you worry.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:50.870
Also...

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.380
Why's our house broken?

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.380
S-Stupidsta and Gauche will fix 
that when they get back, too.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.190
We should do what we can 
to fix it up for now.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.590
There's snow everywhere inside.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.640
Oh, I need to contact 
the other Magic Knights.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.550
Magic Knights' Headquarters here, bah-ha!

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.650
Haven't I seen you before?

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.010
A-Are you really from headquarters?

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:25.070
Bah-ha! It's not my main job, but 
Captain Jack ordered me to help out here.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.870
I've been doing so good lately that they're 
letting me take a break from all the battles.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.700
Or something like that, bah-ha!

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.370
I don't care! We have an emergency!

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.670
There's snow! There's snow in Nean!

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.670
Snow? How romantic!

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.390
Are you stupid?!

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.030
Someone made this snow fall 
on the town using magic

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.820
so they could kidnap all the kids here!

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.680
What? You should hurry up and 
contact the Magic Knights.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.160
That's what I'm doing right now!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.010
R-Right!

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.690
There's nothing to worry 
about anymore! Bah-ha!

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.940
Somehow, I'm even more worried now.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.870
I sense mana in there.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.370
A cave. That must be where 
all the abducted children are!

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.340
That's...

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.340
Gauche, could you let me down a sec?

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.470
Not my problem. I don't care 
about anyone besides Marie.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.720
If you want to go, then jump off.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.420
Hup!

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.610
Asta! How can you call 
yourself a Magic Knight?!

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.870
I don't care what happens to the others, 
as long as I can protect Marie.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:55.080
On the day that I, a former prisoner,
joined the Black Bulls, the captain told me...

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.210
You can just protect whoever 
you want to protect.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.220
And that's exactly what I'll be doing.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.850
Marco!

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.470
Wake up.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.120
This is awful. He's covered in 
wounds, and he's frostbitten.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.220
Marco?

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.590
It's no use. He's under a spell
and still unconscious.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.110
All right... Leave it to me!

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.110
What are you—

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.300
Huh? Asta... Sister...

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.540
Are you all right, Marco?

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.270
What was that just now? He erased the magic?

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.300
It hurts...

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.410
Just a second...

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.870
Flame Recovery Magic: Sacred Healing Light.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.890
It's so warm...

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.160
You're amazing, old lady! 
You can even heal wounds?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.340
What in the world happened?

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.400
I... don't know.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.940
He's so hurt.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.830
Marco...

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.930
We have to go save your 
sister and the other kids.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.160
Can you wait in that cave by yourself?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.820
Huh? No! I'm scared, Asta.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.910
Stay with me, please.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.170
What are you talking about? 
You're a man, too, aren't you?

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.050
Just this once, I'll let you 
borrow my Black Bulls robe!

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.840
As long as you have this on, you'll be fine!

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.680
It's got Magic Knight 
courage in it, after all!

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.470
You can wait until we get back, right?

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.190
Yeah!

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.060
But don't forget! I'm only 
letting you borrow it!

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.040
You're going to give it back to me later!

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.190
You'll give it back, right? 
And don't get any snot on it!

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.740
Y-Yup.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.870
All right, we have to hurry. 
I'm worried about the others.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.430
It's like a damn maze in here.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.210
But the mana's getting stronger and stronger.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.460
Just wait a little longer, Marie.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.970
Good, good. More, more!

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.660
I'm going to squeeze every last
drop of magic out of you brats!

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.970
And done.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.240
Now, then... Are we going 
to use our prize next?

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.980
N-No! S-Stop!

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.110
Please! Let me go!

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.980
You can't defy Baro.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.790
Just give it up. I'm gonna make 
a fortune off of your magic.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.260
Marie!

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.890
Brother!

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.140
Thank goodness! You're sa—

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.890
What did you do to Marie, you bastards?!

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.970
I-It's an enemy, Baro! He has
a Magic Knight robe on!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.680
Damn it! How'd they find us so quickly?

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.930
Do something! Use your magic, Neige!

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.160
R-Right.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Snow Magic: Snow Cry!

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.250
Mirror Magic: Mirror Shift.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.260
Wh-What the heck is that spell?!

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.700
I-I can't hit him at all!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.060
Marie!

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.480
H-Hurry up and use a 
different spell, you oaf!

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:48.750
S-Snow Creation Magic: Snow Friends!

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.230
Go, my friends!

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.060
Damn it!

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.370
Defeating one or two won't make a difference!

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:14.680
Neige can keep creating an 
infinite number of these guys!

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.550
Brother!

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.010
Give me a break!

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.020
Mirror Magic:

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.720
Reflect Refrain!

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.520
Time for a massacre.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.880
All of my friends...

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.380
That guy's too strong. And he's scary!

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.270
Damn it... This isn't what we were told about.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.970
I only accepted this job
because we were told that

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.300
it'd just be draining brats of their magic!

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.300
What's the deal with this guy's magic?!

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.900
What should we do, Baro?

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.870
Shut up, you moron!

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.810
Th-Think! There has to be some way! Something...

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.620
Move an inch, and see what happens to her!

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.710
You bastard!

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.070
What's with that look?

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.240
What are you going to do

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.090
if I get annoyed and put a little 
too much strength into my grip?

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.340
Neige, beat him to a pulp—

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.500
Crap!

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.400
Marie!

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.920
Everything's okay now!

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.770
Thank you, Asta!

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.420
Are you okay, Marie?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.800
Hey!

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:15.800
Asta!

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.180
You bastard! How dare you 
throw something so dangerous?!

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.630
What if it had hit Marie?!

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.530
Wait, wait, wait. This was to save Marie.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.350
More importantly, what if <i>you</i> had hit Marie?!

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.730
There's no way I'd ever hit her.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.310
My love for Marie is too great.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.010
Huh?!

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.480
Brother, please stop!

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.730
Stay away, Marie!

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.770
No!

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.700
These children have had their 
magic sucked out of them.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.710
If left like this, they may never 
be able to use magic again.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.710
Th-Their magic...

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.660
That man was saying how it'd 
be worth a lot of money.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.380
How could you do something so cruel?

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.930
Crap. This is not good. Not good at all.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:06.930
Baro?

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.890
We had enough on our hands 
with that monster of a guy,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.190
but now that his friends have
shown up, we don't stand a chance!

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.710
This boy...

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:26.480
What the heck? He doesn't 
have any magic at all!

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.110
Unbelievable! I've never 
seen trash like you!

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.330
Now that I take a closer look,

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.460
you're just some peon that doesn't 
even have a Magic Knight's robe!

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.380
Neige, you take care of 
that sister complex freak.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.460
Huh?

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.050
I guess I'll just have to take 
care of this peon myself.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.530
I won't...

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.790
forgive you!

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:39.420
Petit Clover

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.670
Petit Clover!

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.880
Staying Behind

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.610
Staying Behind.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.170
Luca... Marco...

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.450
It'll be okay. I'm sure Asta and the 
others will bring them back safely.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.430
Why don't we do a quiz to lighten the mood?

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.660
Huh?

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.860
Then... Where is Asta from?

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.690
H-Hage Village.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.030
Correct.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.450
I'll go next.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.410
How old is Asta?

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.450
Fifteen, right?

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.690
Then when is Asta's birthday?

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.530
October 4th.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.420
What is Asta's dream?

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.420
Becoming the Wizard King someday... I think.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.430
You're pretty knowledgeable.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.220
You, too.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.150
I really don't want to lose!

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.100
Hey, everyone, bah-ha!

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.690
Oh, I can't hear you. Ready, and... bah-ha!

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.210
Next time, I get to be the star again!

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.390
<i>Bah-ha Bah-ha-ho-ha</i>, Page 32:
"Three-Leaf Sprouts."

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:54.500
Page 32
 Three-Leaf Sprouts

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.820
I'll show you the true bah-ha!
