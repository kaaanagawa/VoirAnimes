WEBVTT

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.040
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.600
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.630
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.320
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.950
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.800
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.590
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.410
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.810
and to become the Wizard King!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.290
To Tomorrow!

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.840
The Magic Knights Squads.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.580
Nine squads of Magic Knights 
who specialize in combat,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.720
all in direct service to the Wizard King.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.600
They are an army of heroes who dedicate 
their lives to protecting their kingdom.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.530
It is said that a Magic Knights Squad Captain 
possesses the strength of a hundred mages.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.240
The Wizard King and the Magic Knights Squads 
are the idols of the Clover Kingdom.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.320
These squad captains 
faced each other in battle!

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.170
It was a mock tournament held 
by Julius, the Wizard King,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.500
meant to strengthen the fighting 
spirit of the Magic Knights Squads.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.080
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked—

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880
Yoo-hoo!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.430
Welcome to Dream Magic: Glamour World!

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.770
Guess that just means I'm gonna 
have to face you head-on.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.980
Dark Cloaked...

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.190
Dark Cloaked...

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.690
...Lightless Slash!

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.440
Mercury Magic: Silver Shining Regal Spear!

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.850
Are you still functional?

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.490
Don't compare me to the small fry!

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.250
We'll have no other chances. 
We're ending this now.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.250
Who do you think you're ordering 
around, Mr. Sparkle Pants?

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.540
Now!

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.760
Not happening.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.810
I shall burn you and your 
meddlesome plan to ash!

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.570
As a royal who protects the masses, 
and as the Captain of the Silver Eagles,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.190
I cannot let myself lose so pathetically!

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.990
I'm sure you're watching, my squad!

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.380
There is nothing the flames 
of the Crimson Lion Kings

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.990
cannot incinerate!

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.620
I'll show you the spell I used back then...

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.750
when I truly surpassed my limits!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.920
Mana Zone...

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.540
Dark Cloaked...

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.380
Dimension Slash ~ Equinox!

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.550
Asta and the other Magic Knights renewed 
their promise to protect the Clover Kingdom

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.280
and its people from the threat of 
the Spade Kingdom and the devil,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.450
and to become much, much stronger.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.060
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.420
In September, the Magic Knights trained daily

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.270
to prepare for the upcoming battle 
with the Spade Kingdom and the devil.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.480
After seeing the captains fight, 
Asta and Noelle felt even more motivated,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.350
and continued their own training as 
they awaited the day they would train

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.730
with the Heart Kingdom's Spirit Guardians.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.080
Asta! Noelle!

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.150
Hey, let's go.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.160
Yes, sir!

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.660
It's already time?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.190
I get to go out with my friends.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.250
My heart leaps with joy. 
I can't help but smile.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.670
Sure thing!

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.200
Clover Kingdom

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.930
Castle Town Kikka

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.330
Looks like the town has mostly recovered 
from the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.620
Captain Yami, thank you for 
bringing us along with you!

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.000
I just brought you along because you 
wouldn't shut up about wanting to come.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.700
I wanted to go back to my roots!

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.380
It's already been a year.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.020
It feels so long, yet somehow,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.080
it feels like it passed in the blink of an eye.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.790
On this day, the annual Magic Knights 
Entrance Exam was being held in the coliseum.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.910
Good luck on the Entrance Exam!

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.900
You're the Clover Kingdom's stars of hope!

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.410
The kingdom's future is in your hands!

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.040
Partially because of all the chaos caused by

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.010
the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.060
there were fewer applicants than in years prior.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.600
Listen up! Whatever you do, don't interfere.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.400
Right!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.740
That's obvious.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.110
Look, Noelle! That was us a year ago!

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.530
Someone out of that crowd 
might end up being our junior.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.900
Miss Noelle!

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.980
I wonder if they'll call 
me something like that.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.400
That wouldn't be so bad.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.190
Asta! Above you!

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.250
Huh?

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.470
Ack! What the heck's with these birds?!

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.330
Wait, are these the 
anti-birds I've heard about?

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.560
What? The ones that peck at you 
if you don't have much mana?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.820
Hey! Get away from me!

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.340
Get away from me!

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.480
Get off me!

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.580
What the heck was that?

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.940
How little mana do you have if 
a swarm that big pecks at you?

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.160
I guess someone always has it worse.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.690
What the heck is Stupidsta doing?

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:19.950
Noelle.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.740
Nozel.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.000
You came.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.700
Yes. Stupids—

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.780
Asta invited me.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.870
He thought we may be able to go 
back to our roots as Magic Knights

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.650
in order to prepare for our upcoming battle.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.140
So it's already been a year.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.640
Okay!

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.190
What are you doing?

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.610
Oh, I'm... um...

00:08:54.610 --> 00:09:00.900
I told you. There's no need for royalty 
to take the same exam as the peasants.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.740
But...

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.400
Your destination has already been decided.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.550
Do not take unnecessary action.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.240
Yes, Brother Nozel.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.050
Your existence itself is unnecessary.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.550
I understand now, though.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:26.920
That was all my brother's kindness. 
He just didn't want me to go to the battlefield.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.500
What is it?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.590
N-Nothing. I was just...

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:37.700
At first, I couldn't help but wonder 
why I got put in the Black Bulls.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.500
But now, I can truly say that I'm grateful

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.220
that you put me with the Black Bulls.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.940
I now have precious friends 
and a precious family.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.830
I was able to share experiences 
I wouldn't trade for the world.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.260
You've grown, Noelle.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.130
Thank you very much!

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.570
And you have the potential to grow even more.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.100
You will probably become even stronger.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.860
Yes... Just like Mother.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.510
I said get away from me!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.210
Ugh!

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.520
The Magic Knights Squad Captains...

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.830
Th-They have such presence.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.220
I am the Captain of the Golden Dawn,
 William Vangeance.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.150
I will be conducting the Magic 
Knights Entrance Exam.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.890
First, I would like to commend you all for 
participating in this exam to protect

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:38.160
this kingdom and its people after the 
attack by the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.110
The hero, Lord Vangeance...

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.220
...is praising us?

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.240
And I want you to know this.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.910
Even if you do not pass, that is not the end.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.450
Anyone can retry as many times as they'd like.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.510
Now, then...

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.830
Magic Tree Descends!

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.870
Let us now begin the 
Magic Knights Entrance Exam!

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.930
Wow, this takes me back!

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.390
Remember how you couldn't fly 
at all back then, Stupidsta?

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.730
You were watching me?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.720
Well, you stuck out like a sore thumb.
 Of course I noticed you.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.150
Not only could you not fly, 
but you had no mana at all,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.690
so I thought you were going to fail for sure.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.330
But then...

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.490
You're funny, kid.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.810
Join my squad.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.840
Huh?

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.590
I'm telling you that I'll let 
you join the Black Bulls.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.050
Captain Yami acknowledged you. And then...

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.680
Even if you got hurt and battered,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.480
you never gave up.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.860
No matter how many times you fell,

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.780
you always, always got back up again.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.030
Right here, right now...

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.900
I'll surpass my limits!

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.510
You were able to overcome any obstacle.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.580
You truly are amazing.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.260
Wha?

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.840
O-Only a little bit, though!

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.090
Thanks, Noelle! 
You're pretty amazing yourself!

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.760
You have an insane amount of mana,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.140
and you keep learning how to use 
one new spell after another.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.940
That water armor's super cool, too!

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.400
That's not water armor. 
That's my Valkyrie Armor.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.030
Yeah, exactly. That water armor!

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.580
You're super amazing!

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.120
I'm not that impressive.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.230
We went through so many hardships.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.100
Yeah.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:54.370
And I'm sure there are many more hardships 
we can't even imagine awaiting us.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.100
But we have the captains 
and a bunch of our friends!

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.220
And new strength!

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.380
We're going to protect the 
people no matter what!

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.700
By combining our strengths!

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.110
Let's become stronger.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.740
Much, much stronger.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.750
Say, Yuno. What's so fun about this?

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.750
Oh, you're just so cool!

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.680
Hey, wait, Stupidsta. Where are you going?

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.610
Hey, Yuno!

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.180
Gah, it's him again.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.730
You're here too, Yuno?

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:48.100
Don't just wander off without 
saying anything, you silent stud.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.820
Shrug.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.840
Did you just say "shrug" at me?!

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.240
You seriously just spoke a sound effect?!

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.070
He's just so cool.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.500
Yeah, right! He's not cool at all! 
He's just trying to act cool!

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.910
What do you mean, trying?

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:07.750
Yuno doesn't have to try to 
be cool. He <i>is</i> cool, right?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:13.240
Though I guess since you're here, 
you felt the same way I did.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.740
The same?

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.760
We both swore that we'd 
become the Wizard King!

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.280
You?!

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.560
Not just me!

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.480
I'll... never cry again.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.210
Maybe I... no...

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.490
Yuno?

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.800
I will...

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.420
I'll become the Wizard King, too!

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.050
I'll get stronger, and protect 
you and everyone else!

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.280
I'm gonna make everyone happier! 
So we can have nicer things!

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.520
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.070
Though I'm going to be the one who wins.

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.810
Say what?! I'm gonna win!

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.820
No, me.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.210
Me!

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.240
So...

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.950
Were you able to go back 
to your roots or whatever?

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.380
Yes! Thank you so much!

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.460
I see.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.900
I'm feeling more motivated, too.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.800
I'm going to become even stronger 
and make even more friends.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.540
I'm going to become stronger, too!

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.950
So I can make the Black Bulls 
the best Magic Knights Squad ever!

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.350
And so I can defeat this curse 
and win Miss Finnes's trust.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.850
Let's all do our best!

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.900
So, Captain, did you recruit anyone new?

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.400
Do I have a junior now?

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.990
Well, there was someone interesting, but...

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.320
But?!

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.830
Another squad swiped them.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.990
What?!

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.340
Which means you two are at 
the bottom for another year.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.000
What?!

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.120
Come on, let's go home.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.800
I knew I'd find you here.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.380
Hey there, Marx. What a coincidence.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.060
You left the castle. 
There's nothing coincidental about it.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.190
Let's hurry back. Your work 
just continues to pile up.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.320
I know.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.410
But...

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.210
But?

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.440
Young people are joining the 
Magic Knights Squads to work hard

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.450
to protect the people and this kingdom.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:52.390
Just seeing them seems to give me courage.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:57.460
Yes, you're right. They give 
us hope for the future.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.010
Yes.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.520
All right, let's head back.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.930
Marx, do you like grilled purple snake?

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.980
What are you talking about?

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.730
If you do, I thought I'd catch 
one and grill it up for you.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.480
There's no need for that.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.060
Aw... Asta would be more 
than happy to eat it.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.240
Yuno.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.060
There's something I want to give you.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.960
What is it?

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.470
My pendant... But how?

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.580
A man named Revchi brought it.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.590
He did?

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.310
Apparently, it was among

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.650
the treasures that he and Gueldre 
took from the Shadow Palace.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:05.260
He was probably afraid of what 
you'd do to him if you ever found out.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.490
This magic stone belongs to you.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.910
Yes.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:16.130
To think it'd come back to me because 
of him. You can't be serious.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.270
Good for you, Yuno.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.430
Today marks exactly a year. 
You've helped me out so much.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.850
Thank you.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:32.860
I expect great things from you. 
Well, everyone is waiting. Let's go.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.510
All right, let's do this.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.490
More training?! Let's do it!

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.870
The hell are you talking about?
 We're having a party.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.500
A party?

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:58.130
We're celebrating the first 
anniversary since you two joined.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.590
A lot is happening right now, 
but it's the least we can do.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.580
Magna and the others 
should be back soon, too.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.010
Thanks!

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.760
I guess I'll let you celebrate, for my sake.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.810
All right! Forget about fighting 
just for tonight, and eat and drink!

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.330
Right!

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.220
Let's have fun tonight.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.470
Let's talk friendship until morning.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:24.750
We're back!

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.430
We're back, Charmy.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.120
I've gotten stronger since then.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.460
But...

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.580
...it's not enough.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.540
I'm going to rise even higher 
and become the Wizard King.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:01.100
I'm going to rise even higher 
and become the Wizard King!

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.670
It's been a year since the kid and 
Noelle joined the Black Bulls.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.750
Time sure does fly.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:49.670
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 153: "The Chosen Ones."

 The Chosen Ones

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.660
If you want to get even stronger, 
what else are you gonna do?
