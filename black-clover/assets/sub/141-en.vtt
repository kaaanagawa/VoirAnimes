WEBVTT

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.980
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.580
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.970
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.630
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.990
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.810
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.590
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.820
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.770
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.940
Yuno, we're family, right?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.250
Yeah.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.310
But we're not related by blood.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.250
Yeah...

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.020
But we're closer than anyone who's 
related by blood, aren't we?

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.130
What brought all this on?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.590
What I'm saying...

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.510
is that we don't have any blood relatives,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680
but all of the friends we've met,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.290
and all of the friends we'll meet someday,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.350
are people we should treasure as family.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.870
Yeah.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.230
The Golden Family

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.780
Golden Dawn Headquarters

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.330
Ah, are you here to deliver 
your reports, as well?

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.880
Yes. We just returned from Kiten.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.400
Member of the Golden Dawn
Shiren Tium

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.400
Member of the Golden Dawn
Hamon Caseus

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.280
Ah, yes. Kiten is famous for

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.890
being a gourmet town, due to the 
Diamond Kingdom's influence there.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.640
Member of the Golden Dawn
David Slower

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.640
Member of the Golden Dawn
Letoile Becquerel

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.640
For real? I wish I could've gone there 
instead of patrolling the royal capital.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.890
Member of the Golden Dawn
Alecdora Sandler

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.930
This isn't a game, David.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.620
Yuno, aren't you tired from 
these back-to-back missions?

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.570
I'm fine.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.120
Getting enough calories is 
important at times like this.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.760
Would you like one?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.120
I'm fine.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.990
This conversation's going nowhere.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.700
There's that insolent attitude of his again.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.670
After insisting he was 
going to be the Wizard King,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.960
he earned more merit during the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun conflict,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.840
and now he's grown even more impudent.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.720
If only I hadn't been possessed by an elf, 
I could've helped Lord Vangeance!

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.150
You were just lucky! That's it!

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.310
The captain is waiting. Let's go.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.640
Sure.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.400
Yuno, why not try to be a bit friendlier?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.250
What? I am, though.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.710
He doesn't even realize it.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.660
I know... Why not try to smile more when 
speaking, or throw in a joke here and there?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.250
I know I'm the one who just suggested it,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.230
but I can't even picture you doing that myself.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.190
I apologize.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.170
Sure.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.030
Looks like we have a long road ahead of us.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.320
Indeed.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.830
But that cool side of Yuno 
is what makes him so amazing!

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.920
Thank you all for your reports.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.690
Klaus, Mimosa, Yuno...

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.290
We've received thanks yet again 
from the people of Kiten.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.390
Captain of the Golden Dawn
William Vangeance

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.430
Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn
Langris Vaude

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.430
It looks like you did well.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.460
Yes, sir.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.350
You honor us with those words.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.150
Now, I realize that you've just come back,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.980
but I have another mission for you.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.190
It seems a herd of wild boars 
has come down from the mountains

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.300
to Saussy Village, putting it in danger.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.080
I'd like to send another squad there, 
but everyone else is already out.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.500
Allow me to handle it! I can 
handle wild boars on my own!

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.940
If they were regular wild boars, perhaps.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.220
According to reports,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.460
the wild boars near Saussy Village are 
magical beasts covered in flames.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.860
The villagers are anxious.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.320
I'd like all of you to go there as a 
squad and take care of the situation.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.950
I will have Alecdora lead this mission.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.640
Yes, sir!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.210
I'm counting on all of you.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.020
Yes, sir!

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.440
I don't care who or what we're up against!

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.440
Saussy Village

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.440
I will earn more merit than you!

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.950
T-To think that the Golden Dawn 
would come to our rescue.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.300
I guess it's not the Black Bulls...

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.950
Yeah. I was hoping to see Asta again.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.130
You know Asta?

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.950
Yeah!

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.960
Asta, Noelle, and Magna protected 
this village from the bad guys!

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.030
Come to think of it, 
Saussy Village was the place

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.960
where the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun was first sighted.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.470
But did you know? The Black Bulls 
beat up some wild boars, too!

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.270
Oh? Then why don't we make a little bet?

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.890
Let's see who can beat up more wild 
boars: the Golden Dawn or the Black—

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.100
David.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.380
We've heard the boars are covered 
in flames and very dangerous.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.270
Yes, and they've grown even 
more violent than last time.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.490
We just don't know what to do anymore.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.970
Yikes, what's that?

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.830
I sense a powerful mana from them 
that's unique to magical beasts.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.190
The villagers stand no chance against them.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.840
Shiren, get us a closer look.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.880
As you wish.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.390
Stone Creation Magic: Stone Model of the World.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.410
We'll split up and take care of those 
things before they harm the villagers.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.280
Yes, sir!

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.520
Please wait.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.200
If we don't find out what 
caused them to grow violent,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.740
the same thing will happen again.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.840
He does bring up a fair point.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.750
Know your place, Yuno!

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.120
It is I that Lord Vangeance put 
in charge of this mission, not you.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.710
If merely defeating them would suffice,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.540
the Black Bulls would be capable of that, too.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.000
Why, you...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.640
Y-Yuno...

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.360
If you feel that strongly 
about it, then prove it!

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.200
The rest of us will wipe out the boars!

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.000
Yes, sir.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.150
Roger!

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.490
Let us make a grand entrance.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.330
So what do you plan on doing?

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.990
There's something I want to find.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.040
Mimosa...

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.080
Y-Yes?

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.690
Sand Magic: Suppressing Sand Mass!

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.240
I am quite curious as to 
how these creatures taste.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.140
Dice Magic: Gambler's Fallacy.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.050
A one, eh? Too bad.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.140
I guess this is enough for you guys, though.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.140
Wind Magic: Crescent Moon Sickle!

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.990
Steel Magic: Blazing Spiral Lance!

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.660
There's an area just ahead where
mana is highly concentrated.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.110
Let's go.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.280
Right.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.330
It looks like that fruit is 
what's causing all this.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.420
I see. No wonder they've turned violent.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.250
We'll have to get rid of all 
the trees that bear this fruit.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.110
All right. You and I will take 
care of the trees in this area.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.970
Mimosa, try to find out if there are 
any trees with the fruit around here.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.050
Of course.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.940
I was worried about what 
might happen earlier, but...

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.710
If it's to protect the people,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.940
he's willing to defy his superiors 
to do what he needs to do.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.510
I doubt he even realizes 
he showed any defiance.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.200
Thank you so much, 
knights of the Golden Dawn!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.210
I can't believe you even tracked down 
the reason these things went berserk!

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.460
Now we probably won't need 
to trouble you again!

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.090
I'm glad to hear that.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.220
You think you got one up on me, do you?!

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.430
What in the world are those collars?

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.880
Aren't they adorable?

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.190
Apparently they decided to keep the 
boars that have now calmed down.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.180
Tell Asta, will ya?

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.900
I want him to know I'm training 
real hard with my magic!

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.240
I'm gonna become a Magic Knight, 
so he has to become the Wizard King!

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.230
Okay. I'll be sure to tell him.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.760
But it's not Asta who's going to 
become the Wizard King. It's me.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.580
Wait, really?

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.510
Well done, everyone.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.590
Now the villagers won't have 
to live in fear anymore.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.390
I'd like you to be able to relax now,
 but I have an urgent mission.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.380
A newly-appeared dungeon has 
been occupied by someone.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.540
It is located near the 
Diamond Kingdom's border.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.980
It's near Kiten.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.790
There are reports that people have 
seen Spade soldiers fighting in this area.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.650
We can't deny that the Spade 
Kingdom may be involved.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.450
This is an emergency,

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.280
but as long as the chaos continues 
in the kingdom, I cannot make a move.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.550
Langris, I'd like you to take the lead if you can.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:35.190
I'd love to, but my wounds have yet to heal.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.050
Why not let someone else handle it?

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.890
I see. If you insist.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.510
Alecdora, I ask that you 
take the lead once again.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.510
Yes, sir!

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.700
This time I'll prove once and for all

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.810
that I am the one more useful 
to Lord Vangeance!

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.640
Are you sure Alecdora was the right choice?

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.010
What do you mean?

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.320
I was just thinking there's another 
candidate who may be more qualified.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.320
And who might that be?

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.690
I heard that he was able to 
wrangle countless Magic Knights

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.950
from around the kingdom in 
mere moments during the battle

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.740
with the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.330
He also has plenty of talent 
and the skill to lead.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.800
Though he is rather impertinent and annoying.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.340
Wh-What is it, sir?

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.090
You've changed. Of course, 
I mean that in a good way.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.430
I-I'm just thinking of the best way
to ensure the mission succeeds.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.850
You see, Langris,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.270
I want Alecdora to change, too.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.540
Like you have.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.700
Ah, it appears as though we 
have some bandits on our hands.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.750
It's probably in our favor that 
they aren't from the Spade Kingdom.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.190
Want me to go take care of them real quick?

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.500
Leave it to me.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.450
Sand Binding Magic: Sand Box!

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.930
Well done!

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.260
Mimosa, show us the inside of the dungeon.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.430
Yes, sir.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.770
This is most likely where the treasure room is.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.210
There are two paths leading to it.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.440
So we come in from either the front or the top.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.190
We'll split up into two teams.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.270
Shiren, Hamon, Letoile, 
and I will go from the front.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.950
Klaus, Mimosa, David, and...

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.120
Yuno. You'll go from the top.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.750
Understood.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.350
Magic Knights?!

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.630
What the hell are the lookouts doing?

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.550
Wind Magic: Crescent Moon Sickle!

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.950
I don't think so!

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.260
He stopped Yuno's spell?!

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.930
I'm not done yet!

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.640
Steel Creation Magic: Full Metal Fortress!

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.480
They sure have some decent 
magic for a bunch of bandits.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.130
Those are magic items.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.690
They must be enhancing their mana with them.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:07.770
But...

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.940
Wind Creation Magic: Wind Blade Shower!

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.110
That won't be enough to stop us.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.960
We'll hold them off here!

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.670
Take this!

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.840
Stone Creation Magic: Pursuing Crushed Rock!

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.840
What?!

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.600
The treasures in this dungeon belong to us!

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.590
I must say, there's nothing 
beautiful about being a bandit.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.510
Glass Creation Magic: Verre Épée!

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.230
Letoile!

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.810
Die!

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.370
Willful Compass!

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.080
How dare you use wind magic in front of me?!

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.210
Sand Magic: Sand-Armored Guard!

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.070
I will not shy away from fighting these bandits!

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.630
I will get back all of those magic items!

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.490
It appears we arrived at the same time.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.940
Boo! I was hoping I could get 
you to treat me to something.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.220
What? You're here already?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.740
I guess peasant bandits aren't 
even useful for stalling.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.850
I even let them borrow some magic items.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.540
Though they're just trash 
compared to what I have.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.050
Then I'm assuming you're 
aware that you're also trash.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:51.300
That's not a nice thing to say 
to a former senior Magic Knight,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.340
you wannabe Magic Knights.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.970
You have no chance of winning!

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.620
It'd be in your interest to cooperate.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.940
I have to wonder about that.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.810
Sand Binding Magic: Sand-Armored Heavy Guard!

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.460
Oh? Sand magic, eh?

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.950
A perfect match for my black earth magic.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.700
Black Earth Creation Magic: Sludge Erosion!

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.920
Alecdora!

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.420
Plant Recovery Magic: 
Dream-Healing Flower Cradle!

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.940
Guess you're tougher than you look.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.760
Looks like you're down one now, though.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.030
Well, this is rather troublesome.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.680
Someone with enough talent 
to become a Magic Knight

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.310
has a magic item that increases his mana.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.120
But there's only one of him.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.770
We still have the advantage.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.490
I'm sure he's aware of that, too.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.590
That confidence... Is he hiding something?

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.070
Well, no use thinking about it.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.710
Regardless of what our enemy may do, 
we shall strike back beautifully.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.970
Glass Creation Magic: Verre Fleur!

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.290
Whoa, now!

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.380
Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.260
Come on, now. Is this all you 
new Magic Knights can do?

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.850
Compass Magic: Willful Compass!

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.260
Huh... Well, that magic's interesting.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.270
This is even more interesting!

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.270
Dice Magic: Gambler's Fallacy!

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.000
Looks like my luck's turning around.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.570
But your luck ends right here.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.570
What?!

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.910
This is the biggest prize in this dungeon.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.750
No matter how powerful a 
spell is, it sucks it right up.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:50.340
What?!

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.430
Bell...

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.050
Yes, sir! Guess it's finally my turn.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.980
Wind Magic: Swift White Bow!

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.230
That goes for spirit magic, too.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.690
That just felt like a gentle breeze to me.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.190
Ugh! What is that stupid thing?!

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.940
So what will you do now? I think 
you understand what's going on here.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.300
Yeah, it's crystal clear.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.750
That's the best you've got as a mage, 
despite having help from magic items.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.940
You're no match for the Golden Dawn.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.720
I think hunting wild boars would be 
more enjoyable than fighting you.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.420
If you're trying to piss me off, 
it's not gonna work, you stupid brat.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.500
You look pretty mad to me.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.220
It's just as Yuno said.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.680
We're not going to lose to a sad man 
who has to rely on magic items.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.770
We'd bring shame to the 
Golden Dawn if we backed down now.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.860
Now, let us have a beautiful battle.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.610
I'll suck up all of your mana, just as you asked!

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.910
We're not done yet!

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.710
You guys don't know when to give up, do you?

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.570
You shouldn't move yet, Alecdora.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.880
I'm fine now, Mimosa.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.260
More importantly, please support Shiren.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.880
Find a spot with faint mana.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.260
I will look for weak spots in the cave.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.600
Right.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.940
Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.810
How long are you gonna keep this up?

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.190
Impossible... He's...

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.070
Damn it. Guess you aren't dead yet.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.440
I'll end it with this strike!

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.160
Steel Magic: Blazing Spiral Lance!

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.080
Dice Magic: Gambler's Fallacy!

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.580
I think this'll be enough.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.190
All right, fine! Let's find out what'll come first:

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.560
my magic items breaking or 
you running out of mana!

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.220
We're not aiming for you.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.970
Compass Magic: Willful Compass!

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.520
A pitfall? This is what they were after?

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.730
Ugh, you sure don't know how 
to treat spirits properly.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.770
I still have this!

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.950
This is the end of the line for you.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:29.410
I told you! I have the obvious 
advantage against your magic!

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.710
And I'm sure I told you, too...

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.480
that you're no match for the Golden Dawn.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.980
Thank you for leading the group, Alecdora.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:02.460
I became unable to fight at one point 
in our battle against the bandits.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.240
This mission was only successful 
because of the others.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.950
Is that so, Yuno?

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.800
Alecdora's orders were meticulous.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.730
Why are you defending me?

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.460
I'm only speaking the truth.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.500
Then allow me to say this, too.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.230
There were many members of the 
Golden Dawn who looked down on you

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.360
for being a peasant.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.470
They despised you and were 
jealous of your powers.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.470
That includes myself, too.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.190
Why in the world would you have 
to defend the likes of them?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.600
Because they're my comrades.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.380
I don't need a reason to know that my 
comrades are important to me.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:45.810
I also looked down on peasants 
just because of their status.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.740
But after being rescued by 
a peasant with no magic,

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.450
I decided to reconsider some things.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.430
Please don't compare me to <i>him</i>.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.500
Y-Yuno!

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.020
I'm sorry.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.140
I don't know why you're apologizing.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.900
I'm sure you really don't.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.510
But I won't be satisfied if I don't say it.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.600
Just so you know, I still haven't 
acknowledged you, though.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.110
Are you here to report to Lord Vangeance?

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.090
Yes.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.610
Then let's all go get something 
to eat after we're done reporting.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.490
This is the perfect opportunity for 
Yuno to bond with the others!

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.890
Yes, we'd be happy to!

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:28.970
Yuno, wait!

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:29.930
Yuno...

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.500
We're also inviting you... rather, 
this invitation was specifically for you, Yuno.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.260
Huh? No, I...

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.000
Hamon knows a number of places around 
the royal capital that serve delicious food.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.880
Let's just invite the whole 
gang and have a blast!

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.640
We don't have any blood relatives,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.940
but all of the friends we've met,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.860
and all of the friends we'll meet someday,

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.220
are people we should treasure as family.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.880
What do you think, Yuno?

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.980
Yuno, are you embarrassed?

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.130
I am not.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.270
You are, though.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.240
I am not.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.960
Ooh, let me see!

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.170
Absolutely not!

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.810
In order to fight against the threats 
of the Spade Kingdom and the devil,

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.500
we're going to get even stronger!

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.880
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, 
Page 142: "Those Remaining."

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:54.270
Page 142
 Those Remaining

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.180
Who the heck are you guys?

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.200
Those who wish the devil to perish?
