00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.720
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.270
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.430
Asta and the other Royal Knights
 finally got to the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.850
Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.220
The fight to get to the 
center of the hideout,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.170
where their leader Licht 
should be, had begun.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.730
Around the same time, the Black Bulls' 
hideout was being attacked.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.450
The ones who attacked were 
Rades, Sally, and Valtos

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.150
from the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.290
Gauche, Gordon, and Grey stepped
up to protect their hideout,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.410
but the enemy's brutal attack 
put them in a dire situation.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500
Don't give up, Gauche.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.290
We're going to protect our hideout!

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770
Now, I'm gonna finish you off!

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.060
Emergency! Emergency!

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.060
What's... going... on... here?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.050
Crazy Magic Battle

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.120
What was that shaking?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.740
Curse that Rades. He must be 
doing something reckless again.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.940
Who the hell are you?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.810
Wh-What are you doing in our hideout?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.510
He's creepy.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.110
You're in no place to say that!

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.340
Answer me! Who the hell are you?!

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.270
Well... you... see... my... name... is...

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.430
He talks so slow...

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.770
What are you doing in our hideout?

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.900
Who are you?!

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.800
Well... you... see...

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.600
We didn't get to hear his name 
because you talked to him again!

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.740
Not my problem!

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.860
Oh? I was pretty sure there were only

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.700
three people at the Black Bulls' 
hideout right now.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.140
Like it even matters.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.670
We just need to kill anyone 
who gets in our way!

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.540
Get him, Mikael Caesar!

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.820
Wha?!

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.520
He dodged it by rearranging the hideout?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.770
What the hell was that, you jackass?!

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.980
Well... you... see... my... name... is...

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.400
We're starting from there again?!

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.230
So slow!

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.890
Charmy and Vanessa were 
talking about some ghost

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.200
that rearranged our hideout...

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.450
Could he actually be that ghost?

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.580
You actually exist?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.510
No... He's still alive. 
No doubt about it. I can feel it.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.210
How the hell can you tell?!

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.150
Also, when did I start to 
understand what you're saying?!

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.540
I'm incredible!

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.580
His hair!

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.310
Wow...

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.230
Hey... little... friends.
You're... so... warm.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.340
He keeps birds in his hair...

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.440
I want to be friends with them.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.950
I don't know what kind of 
ability that's supposed to be,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.690
but if all you can do is shake up a 
building, you can't attack or defend!

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.860
What?

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.020
What's going on?

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.530
What?! He blocked it?

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.180
Wow, that's awesome!

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.460
That thing looks like a hand!

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.980
Now's not the time to be happy!

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.930
The hideout...

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.820
He's got complete control over it.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.320
Well done, my new friend.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.370
You... need... to... stop... 
attacking... now.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.690
You talk too damn slow!

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.740
Talk faster, damn it!

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.170
This must be similar to that geezer's 
game magic from the Underwater Temple.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.000
Magic that utilizes 
specific things and places.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.790
The mage is usually very 
familiar with the object

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.850
and has been pouring magic into it 
regularly, making it immensely potent.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.940
To use magic on such a huge scale... 
How long has he been in our hideout?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.470
The hideout is always changing around inside.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.750
Does that mean he's always been there?!

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.100
Has his magic always...

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:29.150
Gordon... Grey... Gauche...

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.280
You...

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.240
You know us?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.140
Of... course... I... do.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.870
I... mean...

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.820
Because... I...

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.180
Are you the resident ghost that 
everyone keeps talking about?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.680
Well... I'm... not... 
actually... a... ghost.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.140
Heya, I'm Yami Sukehiro.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.530
I just became a Magic Knights
Squad captain recently,

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.150
and I'm looking for a hideout.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.740
This place is pretty sweet.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.360
I like it. You mind if I have it?

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.790
I didn't mind giving it to him.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.240
But I was born with a strange 
illness that left me unable to move,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.370
so I told him that.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.480
I told him that I can only 
live within this house,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.170
that I can't interact with others very much,

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.590
and that, to top it off, 
I unfortunately had to borrow

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.490
bits of magical power from 
others in order to survive.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.680
I told him all about my strange disease.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.530
I'm unsure if I was abandoned or 
they were in some kind of accident,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.690
but my parents had disappeared a few 
months before Yami showed up.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.200
No one would bother to come and see 
someone as troublesome as me.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200
That's how I felt.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:58.470
I was going to die soon... 
so I asked him to wait until then.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.790
But then he said...

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.710
Yeah, no.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.660
Huh?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.320
It'd be creepy to have a 
hideout that someone died in,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.030
not to mention unlucky.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.590
I need you to live.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.130
But... I...

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:19.640
Basically, you just need a lively bunch 
of people to live here, right?

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.070
You probably had no idea,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.540
but I know about all of you.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:37.070
You probably had no idea, 
but all of you kept me alive.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.980
You probably had no idea about me,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.490
but you're all my precious friends.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:53.070
Well... you... see... 
my... name... is...

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.010
Henry Legolant

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.820
Henry.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.670
Henry?

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.430
That's a great name. 
I'll make a Henry doll right away.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.460
I don't give a damn who you are!

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.440
Destroy that rickety building!

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.030
I... won't... let... you... do... that.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.870
I sense mana coming from here.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.590
There it is.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.590
Back then...

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:38.300
This is the magic stone that Heath 
failed to retrieve from Saussy.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.350
To think it was here... 
And we finally have it.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.980
What's going on?

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.540
Recombination Magic:
The Raging Black Bull

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.980
Recombination Magic: 
The Raging Black Bull.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.690
I... won't... forgive...

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.550
I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.340
my precious friends.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.480
He transformed the hideout?!

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.070
What the hell?!

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.990
Wow! How's he doing that?

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.990
I want him for a specimen!

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.880
Well done, my good friend!

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.250
What kind of magic does he have that 
lets him move something that big?!

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:54.090
Well... it's not just... my magical powers.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.740
It's the accumulation of all the magical power

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.010
that I've received from all of you,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.300
and I'm using it all at once!

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:08.430
This is the mana power of 
all of the Black Bulls!

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.770
Thanks to all of you, 
even though I was bedridden,

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:22.240
I could start wandering around 
the hideout a few years ago.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.220
So you really were the "ghost"!

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.870
I still can't control my condition,

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.080
so if I get too close, I'll end up taking too 
much magical power away from them.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.610
So I can't go see them face-to-face.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.510
But...

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:49.350
One of them got lost in the hideout 
once and ended up in my room.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.060
He found out about me.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.860
And he told me that he 
didn't have any magic,

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.360
so I didn't have to worry 
about stealing any from him.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.320
He'd come by my room sometimes to visit.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.210
That's right...

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:10.210
I'm one of the Black Bulls, too.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.080
Crap. You're sucking quite a bit of magical 
power from me, so I'm gonna head out.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.970
I don't see a way around it, 
so you're a member of my squad now.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.090
Huh?

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.020
One day, when you can move and 
want to protect your buddies,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.100
you can put that on.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.230
When I want to protect... them?

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.790
Now is that time!

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.410
A Black Bulls' robe?

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.530
He's one of us?

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.070
Just because you're huge

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.990
doesn't mean you're any 
match for my Number Zero!

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.260
Mana Corkscrew!

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.800
Wh-What?!

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.290
Mana Rocket Punch!

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.100
What the heck is this insane magic?!

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.060
What are you doing, Mikael Caesar?!

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.790
I know that's not all you've got!

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.550
Quit dawdling! Get your 
ass back up and fight!

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.870
It's a pretty sturdy corpse 
that doesn't feel any pain...

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.580
But if he takes another hit like that,
he might be crushed to bits.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.130
He seems like he'd be 
pretty fun to dissect.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.130
I guess it wouldn't hurt to show 
off the results of my research.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.890
Dark Magic Item: 
Magic Scorpion Necklace!

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.490
It only lasts about ten minutes...

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.890
But it multiplies my 
magical power tenfold!

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.490
Gel Magic:

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.630
Big Ol' Sticky Salamander!

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.380
What?! That thing just became huge!

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.840
Here we go!

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.960
Go...

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.930
Raging Black Bull!

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.930
Mana Corkscrew!

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.020
Like punching gel is going 
to accomplish anything.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.360
Now it's my turn!

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.930
Hup!

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.860
Dark Magic Item: Special 
Properties Plus Alpha!

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.580
Raise the gel's viscosity!

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.130
Whoa...

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.750
That weird magic of yours is interesting,

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.630
but so is that bizarre body of yours!

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.180
Now, what should I do next?

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.310
Good work, Sally! Get him!

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.960
That's not good! We need to back him up!

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.390
Right!

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.190
We're coming, my dear friend!

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.690
B-B-But how?!

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.000
Gordon's magic and mine are 
horrible matches with that woman's!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.700
Grey, use your magic to change 
the attribute of her magic!

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.700
I-I can't! N-Not with 
something that big!

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.150
You'll be fine! Hey, Grey!

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.200
Y-Yes?!

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.350
Look at me!

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.170
Mirror Magic: Mirror Brigade!

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.550
Sh-She multiplied?!

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.140
Wowie!

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.810
P-Please don't look at me!

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.520
Transformation Magic: Magic Conversion!

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.910
Gel to Plant!

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.160
N-Now poison should be super effective!

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.160
I'm counting on you,

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.990
Gordon!

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.640
Leave it to me!

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.390
Poison Curse Magic: 
Dwelling of the Poison Cloud!

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.130
Good work!

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.890
That's enough, you pieces of trash!

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.910
Mikael Caesar!

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.970
Wha—

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.480
Don't you dare...

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.730
lay a finger on my friends!

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.450
What?!

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.770
All right!

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.940
All right!

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.960
D-D-Don't...

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.100
Don't screw with me!

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.170
I'm gonna have to show you 
losers my trump card now!

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.970
Whoopsie... I'm feeling kinda dizzy.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.480
Maybe I used a little too much mana.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.350
Wait.

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.440
Valtos!

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.690
That guy again... Where the 
hell was he this whole time?

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.190
I've obtained what we came here for.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.630
Let's go.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.250
Huh?! You can't be serious!

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.740
We can't go back like this!

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.780
We cannot let this mission fail,
 no matter what.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.750
I will not indulge your 
selfishness this time.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.290
Screw you, Black Bulls!

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.300
Just so we're clear, 
I'm not running away!

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.130
Bye-bye. Let's play 
together again sometime!

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.140
I'm gonna kill you next time, 
so you better be ready!

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.890
All is as Master Licht wills it...

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.230
You can't be serious!

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.150
Come back here, you Eye of 
the Midnight Sun bastards!

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.070
What the hell was all that?

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.690
What did they take from our hideout?!

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.170
I'm not sure, but we won!

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.770
We worked so well together in this fight.
 It'll be a wonderful memory.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:30.250
Th-Thank goodness we and 
the hideout are all safe!

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.460
I'm not sure if we can call this "safe."

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.620
Hey! Can you turn the hideout back to normal?

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.930
Well... you... see...

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.560
If my Marie collection's 
damaged, I'll kill you!

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.480
We... might... be... screwed.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.360
What?!

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.070
Marie!

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.700
Could you tell me more about yourself?

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.030
I don't have enough energy 
to transform anymore!

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.730
Master Licht...

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.330
Leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun
Licht

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.480
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.330
It appears you've obtained it.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.390
Well, duh!

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.550
I have it here.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.970
Excellent work.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.350
What a beautiful day.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.190
The laundry should be dry in no time.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.440
You're right.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.730
Something is...

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.930
What's the matter, Sister?

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.460
Oh, it's nothing.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:57.460
Man, that golden weird 
mask captain sure is late.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.840
Now only two remain...

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:08.590
Until the monument of the Tree of Life
 can bring forth our true power.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:15.040
And then, the day that our dream 
will come true shall be upon us.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.060
Yes.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.720
Finally!

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.070
We can finally kill 
all those Magic Knights!

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.070
I can't wait!

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.110
Where are the remaining magic stones?

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.570
We'll go get those for you, too.
 Leave it to us!

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.940
We await your orders.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.080
Yes, thank you.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.090
But I am the only one who 
can obtain the last two.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.260
Master Licht...

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.350
You should get some rest.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.830
I shall go...

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.260
Myself.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.710
The leader of the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun, Licht,

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.020
continues the preparations 
necessary to his ambitions...

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.360
while Asta and the others are 
fighting to stop those ambitions!

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.650
Eye of the Midnight Sun, we've come...

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.850
...to get our revenge.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.450
How dare you do that to my rival...

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.990
To my foolish little brother...

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.330
You shall pay dearly!

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.080
I will be the one to take your leader's head!

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.750
Looks like someone dangerous has shown up.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.180
Licht is gone right now, too.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.630
Guess I've gotta stop being lazy and just go.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.520
Petit Clover

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.340
Petit Clover!

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.020
Around That Time, Valtos Was...

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.370
Around That Time, Valtos Was...

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.770
Back then...

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.530
This is the magic stone that 
Heath failed to retrieve...

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.170
To think it was here... 
And we finally have—

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:17.200
What's going on?

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.080
What?!

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.420
You can't be serious!

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.010
Wait.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.090
Valtos!

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.290
I've obtained what we came here for.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.840
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.310
Something bad is going to happen.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:49.650
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 91: 
"Mereoleona vs. Raia the Disloyal."

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 91
 Mereoleona vs. Raia the Disloyal

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.070
What's about to happen to our kingdom?
