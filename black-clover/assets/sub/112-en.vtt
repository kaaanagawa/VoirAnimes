00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.780
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.510
Licht and the other elves 
headed to the Shadow Palace,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.100
which lies between this 
world and the next,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.350
in order to complete the 
elves' reincarnation.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.980
Once the process is complete,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.430
the souls of the humans being inhabited 
by elves will be sent to the next world.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.030
I'm sure you dumbasses can handle this!
 Surpass your damn limits!

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.860
Yes, sir!

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.160
And so Yami and Jack followed 
Licht and the elves,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.170
while Asta and some of the Black 
Bulls ended up fighting Gauche

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.700
and his sister Marie, 
who had reincarnated as elves.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.670
Meanwhile, Vanessa and the other 
Black Bulls were taken to Glamour World

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.940
and struggled in a face-off with 
the Captain of the Coral Peacocks,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.760
Dorothy, who had reincarnated 
as an elf, and her dream magic.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.720
Everything that exists in Glamour World 
will eventually get drowsy.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.590
But Dorothy's dream magic has the 
ability to make anything materialize,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.400
and Sally uses that to their advantage.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.070
What this world needs... is an 
exit, exit, exit! Make one, please?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.780
Hell yeah!

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.410
Meanwhile, Asta and the others struggled

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.450
against Marie's magic, which made anyone 
who looked into her eyes unable to move.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.370
But the Black Bulls worked 
together to continue the fight!

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.200
I'm gonna stop you two, no matter what,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.420
and turn you back into the 
normal Gauche and Marie!

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.710
I'm going to save my friend!

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.850
Since I know that form's secret,
dealing with it won't be a problem.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.140
It homes in on powerful magic, doesn't it?

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.600
M-My sword is reacting to the magic!

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600
So just keep flying around...

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.480
Asta!

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.480
Asta!

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.690
Humans Who Can Be Trusted

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.130
Hell yeah! Let's just take a 
door and get the hell outta here!

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.170
Yeah!

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.830
Okay, get on this, la!

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.250
It's so fluffy and interesting!

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.300
Luck, pull the rest of us.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.720
Roger!

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.130
Go!

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.420
You're not leaving.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.250
That destiny avoidance thing is amazing,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.720
no matter how many times I see it!

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.600
And it's bad for my heart, 
no matter how many times it happens!

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.700
Go, go!

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.880
Just a little further!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.260
Okay, we're here!

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.320
If I can't make them disappear, 
I just have to seal them up.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.660
Huh?

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.660
N... No...

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.840
Aw, and we were so close!

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.160
You're taking this way 
too lightly, stupid Luck!

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.860
Damn it, we were almost out!

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.360
Exit! Exit, exit!

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.170
Give us another exit, damn it!

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.210
If she's concentrating that hard to close them,

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.640
we're screwed, exploding protozoan.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.040
Look at this delicious meal...

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.100
That's your own damn cotton magic!

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.900
Charmy, wake up! If you fall asleep, 
you'll never wake up again!

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.030
Oh, no... If we don't get out, 
this might actually be the end for us.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.660
Anything goes in the dream world...

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.450
Oh, I know! If anything goes, 
let's just have her take care of this herself.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.460
Huh? Herself?

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.370
The hell are you talking about, you mor—

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.510
Just shut up for a while, Magna, 'kay?

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.250
Hey, what's the big idea?!

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.590
Hey, I wanna ask you something.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.530
If we did this, then that...

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.730
Oho! That sounds fun!

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.200
True, that's definitely worth a try!

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.000
La!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.680
Hey! Talk louder, damn it!

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.090
You're making me even more tired!

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.940
If I said it any louder, she'd hear me.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.030
So is there a good way to make this plan work?

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.070
Of course!

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.000
I don't know what you could 
possibly be discussing,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.980
but no matter what you try,
 you can't escape this place.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.830
You will all fall into 
your eternal slumber here.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.380
Okay! Now it's your turn, stupid Magna!

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.870
I don't know what the hell is going on, but...

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.620
Flame Magic: Time Bomb Explosive Scattershot!

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.470
Trying to hide from me in 
this world? How futile.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.540
Is this...

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.810
What we created isn't real, of course. 
It's not like the stuff you make.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.570
It's a doll made out of Charmy's 
cotton and Vanessa's thread!

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.990
Then we used the exploding 
protozoan's flames

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.510
to create a heat mirage and blur it.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.950
It's just a fake version of you.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.180
But for a brief moment...

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.830
...it must've crossed your mind.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.330
The possibility that it 
might be the real thing!

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.730
Because right now, just like when 
I was reincarnated as an elf,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.800
there are two souls connected 
inside the same body!

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.050
So that mirage is probably making you 
think of her, even if you don't want to...

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.550
Oh, no...

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.820
The real Dorothy Unsworth!

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.210
Hell yeah! The Captain of the 
Coral Peacocks has arrived!

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.810
We couldn't ask for a better helper!

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.570
But I think she's asleep!

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.850
Come to think of it, I heard 
that captain's always asleep.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.690
Wait, don't tell me she's already 
fallen into that eternal slumber...

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.080
She woke up!

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.620
Don't freak us out like that!

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.180
Also, hurry up! I can 
barely keep my eyes open!

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.170
Are you the ones who summoned me here?

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.050
That was...

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.930
Fantastic, Black Bulls and Glasses Girl!

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:33.550
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
Dorothy Unsworth

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.550
Just leave the rest to me!
Your big sister is a captain, after all!

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.060
Holy crap, she's chipper!

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.210
So, how old are you, Big Sister?

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.310
You totally look younger than us.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.990
Should you be asking that right now?

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.560
I mean, I'm curious, but...

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.820
I'm 27! I'm right at my peak!

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.760
She's older than me?! Oh, no!

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.820
My role as the "little cutie
who's actually older"!

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.330
Go to sleep within the depths 
of my soul once more.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.510
We've each finally found someone 
we can share our dreams with...

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.830
So let's have a little fun!

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.840
Like I would ever play with a human!

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.590
Take that!

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.130
Whoa!

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.820
Holy crap!

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.430
I guess anything goes since 
we're in the dream world!

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.280
I wanna research this so bad!

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.980
Drool... That shark looks so nummy.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.370
Amazing... She's a match for her
 elf counterpart in this battle.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.130
This is our chance to recover some mana.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.750
Charmy, get cooking!

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.110
Roger!

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.520
We'll make it out for sure this time!

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.630
Wait for us, guys!

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.990
I can't get to Gauche!

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.790
Not to mention...

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.420
And while you're at it...

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.790
Keep your eyes shut.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.050
Oh, no! I'm—

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.550
See ya, brat.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.140
Thanks, guys!

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.110
We gave some of our mana to Henry!

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.770
He's sucking away our mana 
at an incredible speed!

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.600
Get... inside... quickly!

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.650
Comin' through!

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.660
What do I do? Right now, I can 
only go black about 2.5 times!

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.570
I used it once before coming to the capital,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.570
so next time, it'll come undone pretty fast!

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.460
Transformation Magic!

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.790
Magic Conversion: Mirrored Mini Black Bull!

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.500
Go!

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.490
Like it'd actually be that easy.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.970
You didn't actually mirror the 
parts that are expelling magic.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.180
At this distance, I could...

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.640
This is where we say goodbye.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.390
Henry?!

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.130
This is where we say goodbye.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.450
Henry?!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.410
Going to die in a blaze of glory?

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.410
And try to take me with you?

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.920
No...

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.000
I'm the only one who's going to die.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.260
I only lived this long... 
so I could save my friends.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.740
What?

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.260
He's absorbing my mana...

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.930
Outside the hideout, my magic 
absorption rate skyrockets.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.770
This isn't magic, either, 
so her eye magic can't stop it.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.130
But this is all useless.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.320
My mana's not so weak that this 
is enough to undermine it.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.320
You can disappear all on your own.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.200
That's just fine. My job ends here.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.350
I'm just happy I got to fight 
alongside everyone in the end.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.700
I'm sure they'll be able 
to stop you after this.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.480
The rest is...

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.370
...up... to... you.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.330
Not yet, Henry!

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.020
Live!

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.430
You must be Henry, the one with the 
weird illness that sucks up magic.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.490
Heya! I'm the new squad member, Asta!

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.060
Captain Yami told me about this place 
after I accidentally wandered in!

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.440
Don't you worry! I don't have any magic!

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.710
You're always getting magic from them,
so you're embarrassed to go see them?

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.610
I don't think you need to worry about that!

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.610
I mean, I'm not one to talk,

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.120
but they're all pretty crazy.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.850
Once I have better control 
over my magic absorption...

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:39.460
One... day... I'll... go... 
see... them... all... myself.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.880
You will? Then we'll be waiting for you!

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.920
I'm sure it'll be even more fun 
once you meet them in person!

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.340
It's like a dream.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.230
Until I met all of them, I was all alone.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.310
I didn't care about when I'd die.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.920
And yet...

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.490
I don't want to die.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.660
I want to continue living with my friends.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.160
Let's continue living together!

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.290
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.780
Transformation... released!

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.040
I don't want to lose a 
single one of my friends!

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.800
That goes for you, too...

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.470
Gauche!

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.330
The binding spell...

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.320
It's gone.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.610
I need you to return those 
bodies to Gauche and Marie.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.110
They're our precious friends.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.620
You damned humans...

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.630
I can't use any magic!

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.650
Our magic has been sealed!

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.380
They put up a barrier! We can't go—

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.630
No, wait. Our magic is being taken away...

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.240
This is... It goes against all natural law!

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.390
It couldn't be...

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.700
It's the power of a human magic item?!

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.390
That's...

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.900
Excellent...

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.420
I'm overflowing with power.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.030
Now the elves' magic will be ours!

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.230
The princess is of no use to us now.
 She's carrying their child.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.490
She's no longer fit to be a royal!

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.000
How dare anyone other than us humans 
possess strong magical powers?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.510
Even the idea of coexisting with 
such creatures is dreadful.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.000
We must make them pay for 
leading one of our own astray!

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.750
The human royals shall become 
the gods of this land!

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.950
I'll never forget those 
humans' faces, even in death!

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.240
Tense with fear, but ecstatic!

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.770
Unreasonable anger...

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.990
They kill us because of their greed,

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.610
and their rotten brains warp 
the truth to fit their needs!

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.280
Their filthy, disgusting laughter...

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.940
How could you do something like that?!
 I just can't understand!

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.120
I will never forgive you!

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.540
It makes me sick!

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.630
My malice is out of control...

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.230
I won't be satisfied until 
I rip them all to shreds!

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.210
You filthy, disgusting humans!

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.840
But that...

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.340
isn't them.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.430
They're just like us.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.100
They're fighting for their precious friends.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.600
I'm sorry, everyone...

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.380
At this rate, my malice will take over,
 and I won't be myself anymore.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.110
Do as you will.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.540
I'm sorry, Eclat.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.870
No... I'll always stay with 
my gentle big brother.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.830
Then I'm sorry about this,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.290
but I'm taking my friends back.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:08.090
This is even erasing the forbidden magic.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.970
Licht, why did you...

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:18.280
Well, whatever. I know you worked 
really hard, so I'm sorry, Patry and Raia.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.350
I'm going to bow out here.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.030
This also goes for the forbidden 
spell that brought us back, but...

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.600
A convenient power that can make it 
so that something never happened...

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.390
Do you think such a thing exists?

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:39.040
Actions come with consequences. 
You can't escape that.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.170
Make sure you never forget that, human.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.170
Yeah.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.860
I'll never forget you two.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:07.320
You're exactly right. There isn't 
a single human you can trust.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.450
No matter how close you try 
to get, they're still strangers.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.930
Everyone looks out for themselves first.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.660
They want to have it easier 
than the rest of the world.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.830
And to make that happen, they'd betray 
anyone without even a second thought.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.270
I'm the same way.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:28.010
I don't care what happens as 
long as Marie and I are happy.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.300
That was... enough.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.200
Gauche...

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.090
Gauche!

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.250
Gauche!

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.310
Gauche!

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.760
Gauche!

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.060
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.160
So close...

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.470
Are you okay?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.900
Marie!

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.280
I... I'm so glad I didn't... hurt anyone.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.530
Yeah! And I'm glad you guys are okay, too!

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.660
How stupid are you people?!

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.350
If you're safe, that's all that matters!

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.020
You were about to die for someone else!

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.380
And now, our precious hideout 
is reduced to rubble!

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.820
I'm only ever thinking about Marie and myself!

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.410
As long as we're safe, 
I don't care about anything else!

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.890
I only joined the Black Bulls
 for our own sake!

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.330
I never planned on being 
buddy-buddy with all of you!

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.660
And deep down inside, I don't trust 
a single one of you bastards!

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.640
Big Brother!

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.150
You should've just left me alone!

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.980
He really doesn't get it, does he?

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.280
I thought he was smarter than that.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.510
W-We obviously know he only cares about 
himself and his little sister by now!

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.410
You're... the... moron.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.290
That's not what you're 
supposed to say right now!

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.540
Come on! Look at us!

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.050
Big Brother!

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.830
Ugh, damn it!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.590
Thanks... you jerks.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.320
It's our pleasure, you sister-loving jerk!

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.080
Get off me, you numbskulls!

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.240
Oh, come on! Give in to the love, you jerk!

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.410
You're suddenly calling me "jerk" a lot!

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.970
I'm so embarrassed!

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.610
Then get off of me already!

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.530
But we're the Go-Gau Duo!

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.020
Don't give us a name!

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.320
That's...

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.330
Things are getting exciting!

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.330
Shut up!

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.860
Uh... things are getting really crazy!

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.220
We'd be dead by now if it 
weren't for this kitty-cat!

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.420
Look!

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.420
It can't withstand the dreams of two people?

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.720
Glamour World...

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.350
is collapsing!

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.110
Ah, that was so much fun!

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.810
I feel so much better now!

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.870
Take care of my body, 'kay?

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.070
See you later!

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.570
I'm glad I got to meet you.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.320
Not all humans are consumed 
by betrayal and greed.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.580
Don't you think so after seeing those kids?

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.880
Our enemy's got an 
insane amount of magic...

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.010
So we can go all out, right?!

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.510
Hell yeah, we can!

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:22.480
Her power and magic were top class, 
but the compatibility was just awful.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.330
She didn't finish us off in one blow, 
so we had time to come up with a plan.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.770
We're all working together, la!

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.020
True...

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.270
Combo Spell: Flame Lightning 
Exploding Cannon!

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.050
Welcome back, everyone!

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.540
I'm so glad you're safe!

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.180
Oh, Gauche! You're back to normal!

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.550
Thank goodness!

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.750
Now we're all best friends again.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.710
For now, just eat this, 'kay?

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.350
Don't go stuffing food in my mouth, domehead!

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.610
Damn it, that's good!

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.690
It's a magical nummy 
that recovers your mana!

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.790
Eat up, sweet child.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.390
This food is so yummy!

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.940
The psycho woman?! What the 
hell is she doing here?!

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.390
Stay away from Marie!

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.610
Aw, I can't research her?

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:16.690
I'll murder you!

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.240
Never mind that! Since we both got 
taken over, let's fight each other next time!

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.170
No!

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.580
And now, the Captain of the 
Coral Peacocks is back, too!

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.290
And right back to sleep.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.050
Tch! Guess all the tension's gone.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.540
Y-Yeah...

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.290
Whoops, I slipped!

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.410
Now it's raining Noelle and Zora!

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.400
What the hell's the big idea?!

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.690
I-It's not like I was jealous 
that you all looked like

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.850
you were having so much fun or anything.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.140
Yeah, whatever! You're stepping 
on me, so get the hell off, Lady Noe!

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.850
I'm royalty. I have every 
right to step on you.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.180
I have seniority, damn it!

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.340
Miz Charmy! Please go feed Henry!

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.060
Are you the one who's hungry for nummies?!

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.110
I'm... starving.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:09.280
All right! Finral's sorta missing right now,

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.380
but the rest of the Black Bulls are all here!

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.530
Once we're all recovered, 
we're gonna go after Captain Yami!

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.310
Yeah!

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.510
Petit Clover

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.990
Petit Clover!

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:56.020
Leave It to Me!

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.870
Leave It to Me!

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.180
Thank you all for your hard work!

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:04.980
gLaMoUr
wOrLd

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.180
This is my dream world, Glamour World!

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.980
To thank you, I'll grant you any wish!

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.320
Then I want meat! Please bless 
us with some nummy meat!

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.070
Sure thing! Meat coming right up!

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.780
La?!

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.540
I wanna go all-out with someone!

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.450
Sure thing!

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.660
With these on, you can hit anyone as 
much as you want, and they'll be fine!

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.460
Huh?

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.580
I think we're going to be fighting all night,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.340
so I'd like to take care of my skin.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.590
I want some serious muscles 
like Captain Yami!

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.430
I got you both!

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.960
You just keep doing whatever!

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.990
This is a nightmare! A nightmare!

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.150
All right! Let's go to the Shadow Palace!

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.770
We need to end this! And then, 
we're gonna all come back here!

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:50.980
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 113:
 "Storming the Shadow Palace."

Page 113
 Storming the Shadow Palace

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.990
Not giving up is my magic!
