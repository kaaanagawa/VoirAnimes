00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.940
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.540
Yuno, we're family, right?

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.870
Yeah.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.810
But we don't share the same blood.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.140
Yeah.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.070
But we're more connected than
people who share the same blood.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.150
What brought this on?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.900
I'm saying...

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.980
We don't have any blood relatives,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.370
but all of the friends we've made...

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.450
And all the friends we're going to make...

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.870
Let's treat them just like they're family.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.360
Yeah.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.350
We're almost there. Once we
get through this tunnel...

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.140
How amazing!

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.150
That's all there is to dungeons?

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.240
I wonder how you get in.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.900
It appears the Black Bulls aren't here yet.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.330
Of course not. There's no way they'd beat us.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.830
Indeed.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.880
Mimosa!

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.550
She's an expert at sensing mana,
but she didn't notice?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.040
That wasn't a trap spell... 
What is this magic?

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.680
Who are you?!

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.520
Who stands in my way?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.700
Move.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.320
Friends you can trust are 
worth their weight in gold.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.130
Sorry, but stay there a while and get weaker.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.050
Win...

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.330
Win...

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.340
Keep winning, Luck!

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.390
Wait.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.450
It's been a while

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.780
since things actually got interesting.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.590
More... More!

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.950
Let's fight some more!

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.250
I'd rather not pluck a bud 
that's still so young...

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.810
I would always close my eyes

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.010
And cower at reality

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.770
I can't stand the idea

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.160
Of just making excuses to give up

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.410
Stand right there

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.490
I don't want to be near you

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.520
Any minute now

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.880
Just wait right there

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.880
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.040
Black and blue

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.990
I'll give up on giving up

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.410
And get the world on my side

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.760
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.100
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.400
And head where the light shines

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.230
I want to keep my promise

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.790
I'll deliver it to you

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.820
shape of love

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.530
Friends

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.890
Luck!

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.100
Why can't you do something so simple?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.810
How many times must I tell you?

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.040
Why are you smiling like that?

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.160
Why can't you cry or get angry?

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.740
Why were you born that way?!

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.930
H-Hey...

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.400
You're kidding, right?

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.350
One of the common students defeated a noble...

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.690
That's never happened before in our 
school's magic exchange competition.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.930
It's not normal for a 
commoner to beat a noble.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.810
Crap, I was picking on him. 
He might try to get me back.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.550
He's always smiling... He's super creepy.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.250
Don't get involved with him. 
He'll beat you to a pulp.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.710
You won against a noble using magic?

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.170
That's amazing, Luck!

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.470
I had no idea you had such powers!

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.990
Normally, no one can beat a noble.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.370
You must be special!

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.970
Keep winning.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.580
Win, win, and keep on 
winning with your powers.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.050
No one will help you in this world.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.490
You must use your own powers.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.750
If that will make you happy, Mother.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.400
Win...

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.950
So dangerous.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.670
You've become faster and sharper.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.520
Win...

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.410
I'll keep winning!

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.510
With my powers!

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.270
Sorry, but I can't afford to lose, either.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.320
Smoke Creation Magic: Binding Cross Prison.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.200
Solid smoke? I can't move.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.700
This uses up a lot of magic,
so I really didn't want to use it.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.460
I'm out of gas.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.220
You won't be able to zip around anymore, kid.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.630
Now, then... I wonder how our kid is doing.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.850
Ouchie!

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.250
He's not very good at communicating...

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.980
Maybe it's the generation gap?

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.990
Plant Recovery Magic:

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.280
Dream-Healing Flower Cradle.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.170
I'm so sorry... I'm supposed to be 
the healer, and I went down first.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.930
Don't think about unnecessary things.
Right now, concentrate on healing yourself.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.930
That crest... Is he one of the invading
mages from the Diamond Kingdom?

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.940
You scoundrel!

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.320
You dare attack someone from behind? 
Is that something a warrior should do?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.280
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.530
What?

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.690
You're all the same.
Just pebbles by the wayside.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.130
Back me up, Yuno!

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.040
Right.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.140
You Diamond scum! I'll show you the 
true power of Clover's Golden Dawn!

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.640
All right! This path is a cinch to go down!

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.460
The mana is getting denser.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.070
Is the treasure chamber really this way?

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.700
Whoa... What's wrong?

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:21.190
This magic is probably Luck's. 
I think he's fighting.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.630
Seriously?

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.010
I wonder if that means the 
enemy really did invade.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.290
The enemy? We have to go help him out!

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.840
But...

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.460
Maybe it's better to just 
leave the fighting to Luck.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.370
If the enemy really got in, I'm sure 
they're after the treasure chamber.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.060
It might be better to head over there first.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:49.560
We need to take care of this mission fast 
so Diamond's people won't steal anything.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.570
At this rate, the Golden Dawn 
will get ahead of us, too.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.090
Win... I have to keep 
winning with my powers...

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.300
Looks like there's something tying you down.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.810
What I want... is going away...

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.810
Huh? What was the thing I wanted?

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:47.040
He's using such powerful 
attacks without a grimoire.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.040
Not only that, it doesn't appear 
that he's losing any magic.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.290
If this goes on...

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.760
Yuno! You head to the treasure 
chamber while I'm fighting him!

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.510
He's strong. If you fight him 
without support, even you won't...

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.940
Just hurry up and go!

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.520
Frankly, I'd rather not leave 
this to a peasant like you!

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.480
But it's for our kingdom! Fulfill our duty!

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.820
That's right, you fool.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.030
Curses!

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.750
I'll set you free...

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.800
Yuno, we're family, right?

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.560
But we're more connected than
people who share the same blood.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.710
Looks like we've got another lively one.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.570
What brought this on?

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.560
Why did you come back?!

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.280
I'm saying...

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.780
And who might you be?

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.730
I'm...

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.890
We don't have any blood relatives,

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.460
but all of the friends we've made...

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.330
You should be concentrating on the mission!

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.500
And all the friends we're going to make...

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.060
Let's treat them just like they're family.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.510
No...

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.350
...his friend!

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.350
We're friends!

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.070
Yuno! You head to the treasure 
chamber while I'm fighting him!

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.370
That's right, you fool.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.600
Curses!

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.470
I'll set you free...

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.520
Why did you come back, you fool?!

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.690
You need to hurry up and 
get to the treasure chamber,

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.960
for the sake of the Clover Kingdom!

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.140
Let's defeat him and go together.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.240
All three of us!

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.020
Now you're gonna have to face us, old man!

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.690
Oh, dear... Having your friends show 
up is definitely not in my favor.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.310
Apparently, she just suddenly dropped dead.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.210
She always seemed to be 
under a lot of stress.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.330
And now her kid's all alone... How awful.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.130
Well, I'm not so sure. 
Her kid's sort of weird.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.840
Despite the fact that his mother just died...

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.090
He's...

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.720
Luck?

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.830
He's my prey.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.260
Win...

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.730
I'm going to win and keep offering 
those victories to my mom.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.610
I'll take care of him myself.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:51.240
I don't need any friends. Just my powers...

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.950
Hey, what are you—

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.580
Otherwise, Mom won't accept me.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.920
Have it your way.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.750
Hey!

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.420
Guess I shouldn't be holding back anymore.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.840
I... I... I need to...

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.530
make Mom accept me...

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.020
or I'll be all alone!

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.530
Do whatever you want! 
And I'll do what I want!

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.740
I'll do this alone...

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.620
I won't leave you alone!

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.630
Not yet!

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.130
Some part of me...

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.110
I don't care what you think about me!

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.640
Do whatever you want!

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.240
...was trying not to realize...

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:07.900
I've already acknowledged 
you as my... as our friend!

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.170
...that I had friends I could rely on.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.320
I'm sorry, Mom. I...

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.790
wasn't alone.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.440
True, it seems like it'd be more 
fun if we all fought together.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.810
Yeah!

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.690
Well, this isn't good at all.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.360
You're going to make an old man get serious.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.080
Smoke Creation Magic: 
Prison of the Fallen King.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.410
You won't be able to get away anymore, kids.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.430
No matter who we're facing,

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.430
we, the Black Bulls, will win!

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.440
I'm going to get serious now.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.940
What are you...

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:42.450
Wind Creation Magic: Swift White Hawk
and Wind Blade Shower.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.460
Simultaneous spell activation?!

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.960
And this power... H-He's...

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.090
It will be the Golden Dawn that 
reaches the treasure chamber first!

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.850
Take that!

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.520
I cut and cut, but there's 
no end! It keeps coming back!

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.290
I'm getting dizzy...

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.990
The smoke just keeps getting thicker.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.340
At this rate, we're going to suffocate.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.720
This isn't good. We have to 
hurry up and defeat that mage.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:47.050
I can pretty much tell 
where he is with my magic,

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.890
but he'll probably dodge, even if I attack.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.980
Thinking back on our battle so far,

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.930
he's able to travel at high 
speed within the smoke.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.410
And his ability to sense magic is high.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.540
If we're to land a hit on him,
we'll have to surprise him.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.370
But how do we do that without 
him noticing our magic?

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.050
The downside of this magic is 
that it drains my powers a lot.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.360
My magic level is still fine, though.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.300
Well, that and the fact that
I can't see the enemy.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.600
But that's no problem.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.180
Because I can sense your magic just fine.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.900
Whoa, there!

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:45.530
Wow, a barrage. Are you getting desperate?

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:51.080
That's not going to hit me 
or get rid of the smoke.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.710
You're just wasting magic.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.700
I think the difference in our 
experience levels is starting to show.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.210
After all, I've fought far
more mages than you have.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.720
Huh?

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.150
I chased him over.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.570
And I suppressed my magic so 
he wouldn't notice, and then...

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.430
Go!

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.500
He can't sense Asta, so Asta attacked.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.550
It went well.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.280
I guess teamwork really is important.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.260
H-How can this be?

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.730
Begone.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.570
And push me forward

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.610
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:59.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:05.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.640
(Break free yourself)

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:41.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.270
Petit Clover

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.330
Petit Clover!

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.770
Family

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.040
Family.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.600
Oh, my...

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.030
So you decided that you would treat all of 
the friends you encountered like family.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.180
That's so wonderful.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.200
Yeah.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.070
Family... So basically, it's like this...

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.610
Big Brother Klaus!

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.300
That tickles!

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.530
Little Brother, allow me 
to bestow these upon you.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.260
Yay, glasses!

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.260
Thanks, Big Brother!

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.820
Not a chance...

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.100
He's strong...

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:47.230
But if I'm going to become the Wizard King,
 I can't be defeated here.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.530

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:55.250
Page 17
Destroyer

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.700
Not giving up is my magic.
