00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.670
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.890
Vetto cast an ancient curse on Asta's arms.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.220
The only hope of healing his arms was

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.120
the Queen of Witches, 
who lives in the Witches' Forest.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.050
But...

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.950
To be blunt, the queen is supreme.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.650
She's so powerful that even the 
Diamond Kingdom won't try to deal with her.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.950
Not to mention that it's impossible 
to reason with her.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.160
We're going.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.120
If there's a clue to healing
 Asta's arms there...

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.330
Meanwhile, Vanessa was 
also visiting her home,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.830
the Witches' Forest,
in order to fix Asta's arms.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.750
There it is!

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.290
Yeah!

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.090
When Asta and the others reached 
the Queen of Witches, they saw...

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.370
Now get your foot off of her!

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.390
Miz Vanessa is one of us!

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.680
You fools.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.770
What could imperfect creatures 
such as yourselves possibly do?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.730
They were much faster than I expected.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.260
The Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.710
Battlefield Decision

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.790
The Eye of the Midnight Sun

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.440
The Eye of the Midnight Sun?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.220
Why are they heading here?

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.790
Y-You're not just saying 
that to trick us, are you?

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.380
How imperfect.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.760
If I chose to do so, I could end your 
pathetic lives at this very moment.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.400
Why would I need to lie?

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.720
She was at Nean!

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.730
She's from the Third Eye or whatever, 
just like the hairy gorilla

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.130
that did this to my arms! 
She's super bad news!

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.610
Then she's probably as powerful as Vetto.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.290
She could be even more powerful!

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.670
You can't be serious!
 Please tell me you're lying!

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.830
It matters not.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.450
I will be more than happy to rid this 
world of any imperfect creatures.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.230
Warn the others.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600
The Eye of the Midnight Sun
<font size="30">Fana the Hateful</c>

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.560
The Queen of Witches, who pilfered one 
of the magic stones, lives in that forest.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.280
The humans that stole Vetto's 
life are also there.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.910
The Eye of the Midnight Sun
<font size="30">Shidan</c>

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.910
Indeed. They might have realized 
the magic stone is there, as well.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.670
They're unforgivable. I'll destroy everything
 and take the magic stone.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.770
I'm sure Master Licht will be pleased.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.200
It seems they are with the queen 
in the middle of the forest.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.100
Let us burn them all and make examples 
of them to the rest of the world.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.600
Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.820
Flames!

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.080
We're being attacked!

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.330
The forest...

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.360
S-Such powerful flame magic...

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.480
The Flame Spirit, Salamander.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.800
Its form is still not complete,
 and yet it's this powerful...

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.120
It's much stronger than I predicted.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.310
My readings were slightly off.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.050
Any time fate veers off-course, 
more deviations follow.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.810
It can't be...

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.990
There are more of them!

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.650
Th-That's...

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.210
Near the border of the Diamond Kingdom.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.330
Yeah.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.030
As I suspected...

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.870
I thought this fate would 
come to pass much later,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.110
but the other force that wishes 
to attack this forest...

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.340
The Diamond Kingdom.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.930
You can't be serious. They're coming here?

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.940
One of the Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals
Ladros

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.170
Man... and just as I was relaxing 
in a nice aromatherapy bath.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.940
What's with the emergency summons?

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.250
We got word that the

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.050
One of the Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals
Mars

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.530
Eye of the Midnight Sun is going 
to attack the Witches' Forest.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.950
We have been ordered to take advantage
 of the chaos that will cause

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.370
to capture the Queen of Witches.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.430
We could do that easily 
without being so sneaky.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.750
Orders are orders.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.740
That really pale guy...

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.390
It's the super strong guy 
we fought in the dungeon!

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.600
Thank goodness... He's alive!

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.980
Should you be happy about that?!

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.650
S-Seriously?! What's going on?

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.810
This was already bad enough,
 but it just keeps getting worse!

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.490
Why does this keep happening lately?!

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.460
Is that... Mars?

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.910
Then the one next to him must be Ladros.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.410
Zell...

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.800
Anyway, we have to protect 
the Witches' Forest!

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.720
I'll defeat both the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun and the Diamonds!

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.690
And how are you going to 
do that with those arms?

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.300
That's right!

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.470
The whole reason we even came 
here was to fix your arms.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.330
Right...

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.490
So much is going on that I totally forgot!

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.350
He's got a point.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.610
Damn it all!

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.790
Captain?

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.700
Asta? Wait, what are you doing here?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.660
Miz Vanessa!

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.040
Thank goodness! You're awake!

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.670
Vanessa!

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.950
Honestly, you were trying to 
do way too much by yourself.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.300
Noelle... Finral...

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.590
You're here, too?

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.590
Huh? And some other familiar faces...

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.730
Though one appears to have lost his shirt.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.320
Well, you see...

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.190
That's just his hobby.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.390
No, really, it isn't.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.790
It's been a while, Vanessa.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.930
We were also looking for 
a way to cure Asta's arms

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.280
and ended up in the same place as you.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.280
That's right!

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.510
Just you wait, Asta. 
I'm going to talk to the queen

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.950
and have her fix your arms!

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.210
I decline your offer!

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.080
Huh?

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.480
It would be in exchange 
for your freedom, right?

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.380
I refuse to let you do that!

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.200
Wha... How can you be so selfish?!

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.840
This is the only way, you moron!

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.100
You're the one being 
selfish here, Miz Vanessa!

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.960
How could you sneak back home 
without telling anyone, you drunk?!

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.450
Well, what was I supposed to do, you shrimp?!

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.560
U-Uh, calm down, you two...

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.790
I'll figure it out!

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.560
And how are you going to do that?!

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.900
Shut up!

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.030
Even Asta told me to shut up!

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.930
But I have seniority...

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.830
You don't have to go through all this.
I still have my last resort!

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
H-Hey, Asta!

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.440
H-His eyes look a little crazed, don't they?

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.090
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.350
Wh-What are you trying to do?

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.060
This!

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.560
That sword...

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.360
Ow!

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.360
Asta!

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.410
What are you doing, you moron?!

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.670
That curse has sunk deep into your arms!

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.900
No matter how crazy you try to get,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.960
you can't always compete 
with the fate you're dealt!

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.960
So you're telling me that
 it's my fate to sacrifice

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.960
one of my friends for my arms to get better?!

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.720
Who the hell's gonna abide by that?!

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.220
I don't care if I have to crush fate itself!
 I'm gonna fight with these arms!

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.770
Huh? It's your fate to stay here?

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.610
Oh, yeah, yeah. Good ol' fate.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.720
I hate that crap.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.100
Who the hell's gonna abide by that?

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.890
I'm gonna do what I want, even if it 
means I have to crush fate itself.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.500
He just said the same 
thing Captain Yami did.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.540
One more time!

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.920
You idiot!

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.920
That's enough!

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.670
Your friends aren't here to be sacrificed!

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.020
They're here to win against a fate 
that you can't fight on your own!

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.970
I have no intention of sacrificing 
myself for you, either!

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.140
After I use the queen to fix your arms,

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.470
I'm going to use that anti-magic of yours

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.780
to get the hell out of here!

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.790
Crap...

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.070
Oh, then you should've just said so.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.160
Uh, I'm pretty sure you shouldn't 
have said that out loud...

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.780
Hey, Queenie.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.010
If you can actually dispel Asta's curse, 
could you go ahead and do it already?

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.970
Looks like your forest's in a lot of trouble.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.100
He wants to save the people 
out there as soon as possible.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.110
He's an idiot, but he's strong.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.200
I'm sure he'll be useful to you if you heal him!

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.230
And if he goes,

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.730
we'll follow.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.860
The enemy is immense.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.000
Couldn't you use all the manpower 
you can get right now?

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.160
If you're truly a queen, you should be 
doing whatever's best for your forest!

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:16.170
It's true. We currently lack the strength 
to deal with the impending attackers.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.920
Very well. I shall heal that brat's arms.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.130
I'll even make them sturdier than before.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:30.430
Sturdier? Really? Are they gonna be 
huge like Captain Yami's, then?

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.490
I highly doubt that.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.250
Sturdiness isn't necessarily 
equal to how big they are.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.260
Aw, come on!

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.280
What am I supposed to do about it?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.770
You've got some guts, Noelle!

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.580
Yeah! I've never seen anyone 
talk down to the queen before!

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.140
I'm royalty myself.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.620
My legs are still shaking...

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.470
Be merry while you still can.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.210
But in the end, both Vanessa

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:06.380
and that boy's anti-magic 
sword's powers shall be mine.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.860
Blood Recovery Magic: 
Curse-Breaking Blood-Filled Cocoon.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.940
My arms feel so light! This is awesome!

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.660
She performed such a powerful 
spell in a mere instant?

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.560
This is the power of the queen?

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.160
This is great! They're completely better!

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.420
Look! Look, look, look, look!

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.220
Asta!

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.220
Look, look, look, look!

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.570
Now, when my back itches, I don't 
have to scratch it against a pole!

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.130
And I can pick my nose!

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.930
But what I'm happiest about is that 
I'll be able to work out again!

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.960
Asta...

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.430
He's still an idiot.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.930
Well, I don't know if they're 
actually sturdier or not,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.810
but I can feel strength welling up inside me!

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.270
All right! Let's go, guys!

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.970
Yeah!

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.290
All right! Let's go, guys!

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.200
Yeah!

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.450
Or...

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.800
"Let's go," my ass!

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.550
Do you know how worried we were?!

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.730
You crazy moron!

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.230
You could barely move a second ago!

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.430
Take that! And that! And that! And that!

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.430
Here! Take your stupid robe!

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:36.430
Thank you so much, guys! And I'm sorry!

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.110
No effect!

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.960
They're so hard!

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.230
What the heck? Did she use 
a strengthening spell?!

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.050
No! They're just pure muscle! Hurgh!

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.490
Congrats, Asta.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.770
Yeah! Thank you all for what you did, too!

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.610
I've fulfilled my end of the bargain.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.410
Now let us see this so-called power of yours.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.800
Yeah! Leave this to us!

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.950
Thanks for fixing my arms!

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.340
Hmph.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.720
Asta, leave the Diamond forces to us.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.140
Mars and Ladros... I have some 
unfinished business with them.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.550
All right, Old Man Zell. Don't die.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.390
Yeah.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.850
And put some clothes on.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.850
Right...

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.270
You, too!

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.190
Burn! Burn!

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.930
Have they given up after a 
single attack by Lady Fana?

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.560
They're weaker than I thought.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.660
L-Look!

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.240
They must be the enemies 
you warned us about!

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.080
How dare you do this?!

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.590
Let's go, Akimo!

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.470
Yeah! Let's protect the forest!

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.510
Wh-What's that monster?

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.690
Stay calm.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.240
The queen's golem!

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.740
Wh-Who are those guys?

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.710
The great Third Eye is magnificent!

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.740
Lady Fana is not only immensely 
powerful, but also beautiful.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.420
I'd love to have a shot at her 
if I ever get the chance.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:37.390
But I guess I'll just have to settle 
for these lowly witches today.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.070
Attack!

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.020
Yes, sir!

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.920
Make sure you capture the lookers alive.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.650
These witches possess powerful magic. 
They'll make excellent slaves.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.400
N-No!

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.630
Are you okay?!

00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.740
Huh?

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.000
Eek! I was saved by a man!

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.660
Your muscles are gross!

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.980
Hmph.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.950
What the heck was that for?!

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:14.030
The witches firmly believe 
that women are superior.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.220
Sorry she acted like that 
after you saved her.

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:20.080
I'll put out all the flames.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.180
Thanks, Noelle.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.600
I'll rescue all the witchies!

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.890
I'm counting on you, Finral!

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.270
You've got some nerve, 
doing this to the forest.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.890
This place isn't the best, 
but it was still my home.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.900
I'll protect it, no matter what.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.870
Let's go, Asta!

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.910
You got it!

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.220
Oh, hey. There it is.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.580
I can't wait!

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.940
Diamond Kingdom
Mohawq

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.480
We are prepared to attack at any time.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.970
Well, aren't you psyched?

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.260
But... Tsk, tsk, tsk... Hold your horses.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.010
Where's the fun in dealing with the peons?

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.810
We're going to enjoy whoever's 
left from both sides later on.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.730
Yes, sir!

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.470
They're here.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:16.740
Those numbers... Even with all the witches,
 we're still vastly outnumbered.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.480
But what's important is how 
you fight. Right, Master?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.850
Yeah.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.050
Let's all split up.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.960
B-But I swore that I'd protect you.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.010
Thanks, Zell. But this 
isn't the time for that.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.980
You were considered a genius strategist,
 so you should already know...

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.570
This is the only way we can win.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.470
All right.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.090
So many excellent slave 
ladies to choose from!

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.110
Let us go!

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.220
That bastard! What does he 
think he's doing to my cuties?!

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.700
The number of guards he has around him...
 He must be the commander.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.950
Miz Vanessa!

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.420
Use your threads to blast me up to them!

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.480
What? But I won't be able to 
pull you back at that distance!

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.300
You'd be fighting in the air 
with nothing to hold you up!

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.050
I'll be fine!

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.220
Well, if you're sure... I'll trust you!

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.430
Who the heck is that?

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.480
Fool! He's headed right toward us!

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.430
Take this!

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.400
No, you take this!

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.690
That's... the anti-magic brat 
who defeated Lord Vetto!

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.860
Kill him!

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.450
There!

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.250
He's using the enemies as stepping stones.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.380
I can't believe that boy! 
Then again, I guess I can.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.880
You guys cause trouble every single time!

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.630
Wh-What's with this brat?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.470
Now no one...

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.570
will be able to stop Asta!

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.680
Quit it already!

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.940
Now's your chance to run!

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.950
Stop bossing me around, you stupid man!

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.690
I'm not thanking you!

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.070
Let's go!

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.070
Seriously?!

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.580
There you are.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.160
How dare you kill Vetto?

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.450
I'll kill you!

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.700
Crap! I'm gonna die!

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.790
As if...

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.580
I'd be scared!

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.640
Made it just in time.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.730
Thanks!

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.410
You keep getting in our way
 over and over again.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.910
I'll kill you once and for all.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.830
Bring it on! I'll just keep throwing 
your attacks right back at you!

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.350
Petit Clover

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.430
Petit Clover!

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.850
Not Yet!

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.850
Not Yet!

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.480
Cup o' <c.colorca5356>Magic </c><c.colorfafa6d>Noodles</c>

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.790
Nothing beats eating a Cup o' Magic Noodles
 while everyone else is fighting.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.490
But... Tsk, tsk, tsk. 
It's too early to eat them yet!

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:12.370
Magic in 3 Minutes

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:12.370
They won't be ready until three 
minutes after you pour the magic in.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.200
Ladros, is it time yet?

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.200
Cup o' <c.colorca5356>Magic </c><c.colorfafa6d>Noodles</c>

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.610
Not yet!

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.450
Cup o' <c.colorca5356>Magic </c><c.colorfafa6d>Noodles</c>

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.450
Cup o' <c.colorca5356>Magic </c><c.colorfafa6d>Noodles</c>

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.450
But I like my noodles a little firm.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.090
No! Not yet!

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.050
But—

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:21.870
Not yet!

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.630
I can do what I want—

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.630
Not yet!

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.130
Hey—

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.380
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.650
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.880
And they're done!

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.080
Let's eat!

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.890
Thanks for the meal.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.530
So fast!

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.520
I'm so glad your arms are better now, Asta!

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.210
But the Queen of Witches is amazing.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.190
Scary, but get a good look
 at her, and she's pretty.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.530
I guess older ladies can be charming, too.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.370
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 59: "Flames of Hatred."

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.740
My magic is liking <i>all</i> of the ladies!
