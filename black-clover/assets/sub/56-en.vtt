00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.640
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.730
The Man Named Fanzell Continued

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.700
Fanzell Kruger: the former instructor 
of the Diamond Kingdom's magic soldiers,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.860
who also happened to be the one who 
taught Asta how to use his sword.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.110
You're following up too late 
with your left foot.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.820
If you're going to attack consecutively, 
don't pause between each slash.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.080
Got it!

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.580
Some time had passed since they met,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.960
and Asta was gravely injured in the battle 
against the Diamond Kingdom's assassin,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.330
Mars, in the dungeon exploration mission.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.880
Noelle was gathering nourishing herbs 
that would help him recover faster.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.170
Herbs, herbs...

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.620
Here we go!

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.850
Hey, you, silver-haired girl...

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.100
Yes, you. You have a second?

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.400
There's something I'd like to ask you.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.750
Do you have a sec?

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.180
I just want you to let me see for 
a second. Just a quick second.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.320
Just a tiny bit.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.320
Why, you...

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.680
Huh?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.370
...pervert!

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.840
Wait! I promise I'm not someone suspicious!

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.280
Just for a second!

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.130
You're obviously very suspicious!

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.440
Damn it, what's all that racket?

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.290
Get away from me!

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.290
I can't get any sleep.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.740
Lady Noe?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.690
La?

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.180
Please stop!

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.680
You've got it all wrong.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.520
Just for a second, miss... 
I'm even willing to pay.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.070
"Pan" and "pants" might sound similar, 
but pants aren't edible! La!

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.120
You poor girl, running into a pervert like that.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.150
There, there...

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.070
You twisted bastard. What were you 
trying to do to my squad member?

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.840
You better be thankful we didn't kill you.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.860
Y-You've got the wrong idea.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.440
I was the victim of a robbery, and...

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.180
No excuses!

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.180
Hey, let's fight some more! 
I haven't had enough yet!

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.850
Before he ever has a chance to 
appear in front of Marie...

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.780
I'll kill him.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.620
Hello? Magic Knights HQ?

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.610
This is Finral, the hottie from the Black Bulls.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.860
We've apprehended someone suspicious, 
so we're coming to hand him over to you.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.110
Wait! Please, wait! 
Honestly, this is all a mistake!

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.820
I'm not falling for that.
I only use bait when I'm fishing.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.290
Uh, I don't know much about fishing, but...

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.120
Zell?

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.660
That voice...

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.740
Asta!

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.790
What are you doing here, Zell?

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.170
I see.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.450
So you were able to join the Magic Knights.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.520
Congratulations.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.060
Oh, so it was just a misunderstanding.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.050
To think that you really were robbed...

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.340
You should've said so earlier!

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.400
I'm pretty sure you guys
 weren't going to listen.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.520
Who cares about the minor details?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.740
Eat up.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.060
This is the kind of pan 
you can actually eat, la.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.560
Thanks.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.610
You're my new friend.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.030
I want to know more about you. 
Let's talk into the morning.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.030
Um, can I help you?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.200
Zell, was it? Have we met before?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.430
No, I'm pretty sure this is 
the first time we've ever met.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.060
So what are you doing here, old man?

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.100
Oh, right.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.000
Noelle, was it?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.840
I'm truly sorry for scaring you.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.170
I wanted to ask you about your wand.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.470
My wand?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.900
Yes.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.720
I'm fairly certain that the wand

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.760
you're using was created by 
Domina, who I'm looking for.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.970
Domina?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.720
Isn't that your fiancée?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.730
But the person who gave me 
this wand was named Code.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.130
Right. It wasn't Domina.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.560
So I was right. There's no doubt about it.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.720
Her full name is Dominante Code.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.660
Where'd you get that?

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.660
The black market in the castle city.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.250
I see...

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:55.800
Thank goodness.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.290
Thank goodness.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.320
Old man! That means Domina's alive!

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.960
That's great! Hurry up and go see her!

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.570
Yeah, I will.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.970
Thank you. Thank you!

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.390
I'll lead you there.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.410
Thank you, Noelle.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.460
Because of you, I should be able to reunite 
with someone very important to me.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.810
Thank you so much.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.480
I-I didn't do that much.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.050
So, can I go, Captain?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.170
Huh? Sure, why not?

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.990
Oh, but don't blab about us trying 
to get you arrested by mistake.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.690
You actually just admitted 
you made a mistake.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.060
Shut up.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.930
Oh, yeah. Finral, take them to their 
destination with your spatial magic.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.500
Then we're even.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.950
I'm gonna take a dump and go to bed.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.040
Sure.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.500
Thanks.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.590
Well, if I stick around too long, 
it'll make it harder to say goodbye.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.300
See you, Asta.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.610
It wasn't for very long, but I'm 
glad I got to see you again.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.950
Let's meet again. And make 
sure you become the Wizard King!

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.200
Heck yeah! And you better 
live happily ever after!

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.480
Everyone, get down!

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.360
La!

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.860
Whoa, what? Are we being attacked?

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.740
They're probably the assassins 
who were after me.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.370
I'll leave immediately.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.850
The hell is this? Who do I 
need to kill for this, and how?

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.880
I don't see any movement.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.890
Knowing Instructor Fanzell, 
I thought he'd come straight out.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.310
Let's see how things play out.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:41.580
Diamond Kingdom Assassination Squad Commander
Galleo

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.990
Squads 1 through 4,
maintain formation and advance.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.100
Squads 5 and 6, stand by.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.410
Is that building some kind 
of apartment complex?

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.310
I'm not sure. I'm going now.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.110
Commander Galleo, could you 
use your spatial magic?

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.260
For insurance, just in case this 
surprise attack fails, huh?

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.370
I don't think that's necessary, but fine.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.670
We'd be a laughing stock if a 
plan like this actually failed.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:09.650
What's with the glare? Did you
forget who let you live?

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.470
I know I owe you my life.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.300
Don't forget it.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.790
So I'd like to give you some advice.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.310
My instructor...

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.560
is very strong.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.890
Scout from Unit 1 reporting.
We're within twenty meters of the building.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.280
All right, prepare to attack.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.370
There's the target. Don't let
 him get away. After him!

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.910
Lightning Creation Magic: 
Thunderbolt Destruction!

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.590
Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.570
Hey, what the hell? Our surprise 
attack actually worked.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.640
Maybe these guys aren't so strong after all.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.320
That works for me. Looks like 
there are plenty of them,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.440
so let's have them play with us 
until their kneecaps shatter!

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.330
Squads 1 and 2, continue pursuing the target.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.000
Are you the commander?

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.780
I'm going to end this quickly 
so I can go see Marie.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.970
Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.720
Wh-What is this magic?

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.800
Guess I'll get things started.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.670
Darkness Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.490
None shall ever lay a finger on my food.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.120
Don't go too overboard.
Make sure you leave some for me.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.170
That water barrier...

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.770
It wasn't created to stop our attacks,

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.860
but so their own magic 
wouldn't destroy the place.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.440
You the commander?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.070
You're Fanzell!

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.860
Don't! You can't lay a finger on me!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.690
Don't you care what happens to the hostage?

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.350
Hostage? Who?

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.840
Dominante Code...
 Mariella's heading to her now.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.560
Did you think we didn't 
know where Code was hiding?

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.040
Now, let go of me, or—

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.440
Man, the captain's amazing.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.830
To think he was exactly 
right about what's going on.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.410
What?

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.740
My teammates are heading out to protect

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.200
Domina via spatial magic as we speak.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.630
They've probably already found her.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.440
Wh-Who are you?

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.390
Just how long does it take you to 
come get me, you worthless fiancé?!

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:10.500
How dare you leave a delicate 
flower like me alone for so long?!

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:17.820
Dominante Code

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:17.820
I... was so worried! I was 
afraid you were hurt!

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.410
You're kind of hurting me right now...

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.380
Thank you, young lady.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.930
I never thought you'd do this much for me 
just because I gave you a little extra.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.720
Looks like Bruce was right about you.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.430
I'm not so sure about that...

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.340
And you must be Asta.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.330
Huh? How do you—

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.280
You look as gutsy as I've heard!

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.740
Who told you that?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.760
Who?

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.060
You're Mariella!

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.330
I won't do anything violent.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.320
What are you expecting a 
single girl to do, anyway?

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.390
You and your buddies beat the 
crap out of your instructor!

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.120
You're probably plotting 
the same thing again!

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.870
I mean no harm, 
but please allow me to use you.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.080
Huh?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.460
What do you mean?

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.500
Ah, so you're the Black Bulls...

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.930
Did Mariella have us attack 
without knowing who they were?

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:29.770
You had those guys attack the Black Bulls' 
base so we'd take care of them?

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.140
While that was happening,
 I headed to the black market

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.100
to tell Miss Domina that 
the instructor was coming,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.310
so we were getting prepared.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.490
Though I didn't think you'd get here so fast.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.280
I've drawn out a safe 
escape route on this map.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.780
Why are you doing this for us?

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.180
Mariella?

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.750
Including the ones that 
were sent to the city,

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.970
we'll be able to take care of 
about sixty assassins at once.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.590
On top of that, Instructor Fanzell and 
Miss Domina will be able to escape.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.370
I'm sure these incidents will set 
the organization back substantially.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.670
This is my revenge against the organization.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.130
Revenge?

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:13.810
Just like Instructor Fanzell... 
I'm tired of this job.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.710
But I'm also not prepared to be 
on the run for the rest of my life

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.700
like Instructor Fanzell and Miss Domina.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.530
In the end, I decided to exact a huge revenge,

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.700
then present myself to the 
Clover Kingdom's Magic Knights.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.830
You just... decided that?

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.040
I was waiting for all of 
these circumstances to align.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.410
And then,

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.330
I just happened to see Instructor Fanzell 
being dragged into the Black Bulls' base.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.050
I thought if I got you involved, 
you'd annihilate the assassins.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.390
Did you, now?

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.130
You make it sound so easy.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.680
So please, capture me. Then this 
will end happily ever after.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.270
Do you really think it'll work out that well?

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.000
Considering everything you've done,
 you'll probably be severely punished,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.940
and you might face retaliation from the 
organization while you're serving time.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.250
And that's perfectly fine.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.950
I'll be content with accepting 
anything other than death.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:19.420
Remember when you said, "You're supposed 
to find a reason to live for yourself"?

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.180
What about it?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.000
It was condescending. 
Who do you think you are?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.800
Huh?!

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.760
But your words resonated with me.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.800
You were really cool.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.760
R-Really?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.450
The punishment I receive

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.530
will be the cost for me to restart 
and atone for everything I've done.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.400
That's why I believe I need to accept the
 punishment, no matter how severe it may be.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.940
Mariella...

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.320
I don't think so!

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.120
Galleo!

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.110
You're a commander,
and you deserted your squads?

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.070
That's awful!

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.120
You're the last person I 
want to hear that from!

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.880
If you want to be executed so badly,

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.620
I'll personally do it for you,
 right here, right now!

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.330
Everyone, please run.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.130
He might not sound too dangerous, 
but his magic is a bit troublesome.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.300
Spatial Creation Magic: Unopening Red Room!

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.010
Asta!

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.960
Spatial Creation Magic: Crevice Men!

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.120
Who the heck are these creepy guys?

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.060
And what's this creepy room?

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.870
This is a room that Galleo 
created with magic,

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.890
and those things are magic soldiers 
that he can only create in here.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.470
They're strong. But more importantly, 
what were you doing?

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.430
Why would you throw yourself in front of 
a spell without knowing the consequences?

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.060
If that had been an attack spell, 
you might be dead right now.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.210
Are you stupid?

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.750
Stupid?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.080
Oh, shut up!

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.810
If it means just letting 
someone die, I'd rather be stupid!

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.420
Not to mention, I'm not 
the same person anymore!

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.100
Now I'm Asta, a member of the 
Magic Knights squad, the Black Bulls!

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.200
B-But I'm your enemy!

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.480
I don't care!

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.980
When there's someone in need, I can help 
them out as much as I want, whenever I want!

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.470
So take that!

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.240
Now that you get that, let me 
save you while you support me!

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.200
I can't be as big-hearted as him,

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.290
but I can't just sit back and watch 
when my student's in trouble.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.030
Let's work together and get through this!

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.040
Get through this... Can we, though?

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.290
This is nothing!

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.140
Th-These two...

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.170
Magic Knights HQ?

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.950
Hey, this is Yami from the Black Bulls.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:44.390
I captured a bunch of troublemakers.
Could you hurry and come get them?

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.030
That guy had this many people after him?

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.870
Who the hell is that Fanzell guy?

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.060
Fanzell? Wasn't his name Zell?

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.580
Uh, Grey said that his real name is Fanzell.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.910
Oh!

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.750
He's Fanzell Kruger.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.020
He was one of the commanders of 
the Diamond Kingdom's armies.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.260
I met him a long time ago during a battle.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:13.970
Captain...

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.330
I'd heard he became an instructor for 
other soldiers, but he must've defected.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.390
So that's why all these guys were after him.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.590
You're making this sound 
like it's not our problem...

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:32.010
Wait, does that mean we ended up 
aiding a major enemy's escape?

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.400
That'd be correct.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.460
Hey, Gauche...

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.220
Yes, sir?

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.240
Don't mention this to anyone.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.740
I won't tell a soul, so please give 
me a week of Marie vacation.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.540
You're only allowed to see her 
once a month, aren't you?

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:50.670
I'll spend 168 hours of the week staring at
 Marie in such a way that I won't get caught!

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.170
Oh, for crying out loud...

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:58.480
And so, the mysterious incident in 
which the Black Bulls' base got attacked

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.920
came to an end.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.920
Are you sure it's all right for us to leave?

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.940
I have a feeling we'd be causing you 
trouble if we just disappeared.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.340
Captain Yami didn't seem to 
care about that, so it's fine.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.150
Right, Finral?

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.700
Y-Y-Yeah, sure...

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.430
I'm pretty sure it's not fine!

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.750
I have a really bad feeling about this.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.210
And are you guys sure you 
want to take that brat

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.460
with the terrible personality with you?

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.520
I didn't choose to have
 this terrible personality.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:39.570
I heard that they were going to try to 
kidnap me, but she put a stop to that.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.960
And if you think about it,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.740
she's the reason I was able
 to be reunited with Zell.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.060
I'm not sure if you're just too nice, or...

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.800
Honestly, you're all pushovers.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.680
That's why I can trick you all so easily.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.820
Besides, I didn't ask you to do all of this.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.610
Even if I don't have help 
from you pushovers...

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.700
You can survive on your own?

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.010
Just like you have been?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.530
It's actually a lot easier to carry 
all the burden yourself, isn't it?

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.230
You can just tell yourself that as long as 
you can get through it, you'll be fine.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.600
And you don't have to think 
about everyone around you,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.720
so you don't have to think 
about anything else.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.370
But that's not possible anymore.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.020
When people care for you,

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.890
none of your problems are 
just your own anymore.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.570
You have to think about them, too.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.450
So I hope you suffer.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.910
You seem to have a terrible 
personality yourself.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.080
I don't want people to think I 
have a good personality, anyway.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.380
Hmph!

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.320
Well, if we linger too long,
 the goodbyes will be—

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.460
Stop getting all emotional!

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.700
Go on, old man!

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.650
Time flows differently for 
those who actually try

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.580
to get stuff done and 
those who don't, right?

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.150
So get going, and make Domina happy!

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.770
Yeah, I will.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.430
I won't waste this precious 
time that's been given to me.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.730
From now on, I'll do my best 
to live along with these two.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.230
That's the spirit!

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.740
I'll write you a letter once 
everything settles down.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.910
Sure! Take care!

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.660
So, uh... I hate to ask 
at a time like this...

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.510
But you know how I lost all 
my belongings to the assassins

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.620
right before you guys hauled 
me off to your hideout?

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.440
Don't tell me...

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.170
Could you lend me some money?

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.080
I never should've saved you!

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:47.930
This was how Fanzell, Domina, 
Mariella, and the Black Bulls met.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.760
And currently, Noelle and 
Finral have come to visit Fanzell

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.850
in search of a way to heal Asta's arms.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.040
Domina, Mariella, how have you be—

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.780
You worthless husband! Would you fix 
your bad habit of getting naked already?!

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.550
Hey, stop! That's something I can't control!

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:08.530
This house is already pretty run-down. 
Could you not mess it up more?

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.850
I see... So something like 
that happened to Asta?

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.870
He's been through a lot 
for someone so young.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.170
His streak of bad luck is quite 
the contrast to his height.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:25.630
Do you have any ideas on how to fix 
Asta's arms? Even if it's just a rumor?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.740
An ancient curse, huh?

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.810
There's one thing I can think of.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.890
My home, the Witches' Forest.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.600
The Witches' Forest?

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.360
With the magic of the queen there...

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.120
Hey!

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.010
The smartest witch to ever grace this world

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.370
since the creation of the 
land of witches is back!

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.890
I need something, so open up!

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.940
We might be able to fix Asta's arms!

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.110
All right! Let's infiltrate 
the Witches' Forest!

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.410
Ooh, so many pretty witchies!

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.410
I'm gonna infiltrate that girl's heart!

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.320

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.820
I'm going to fill your heart with me!
