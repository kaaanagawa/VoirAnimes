00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.350
The strong will survive...

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.790
and the weak...

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.020
Mimosa!

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.650
Your opponent...

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.920
is me!

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.160
Disappear!

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.410
As long as he has that recovery magic,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.230
I won't be able to finish him off!

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.610
What should I do?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.630
What are you doing, Stupidsta?

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.890
You're the first peasant...

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.020
that I, a royal, ever acknowledged.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.390
Hurry up and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.860
defeat that guy, Asta!

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.430
Yeah, leave it to me.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.990
I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.490
...that weakling, disappear!

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.470
Like hell I'll let that happen!

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.720
I don't have any magic,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.290
but I've got...

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.950
my friends!

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.340
I don't really get it, but I did it!

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.810
I would always close my eyes

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.010
And cower at reality

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.770
I can't stand the idea

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.140
Of just making excuses to give up

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.260
Stand right there

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.420
I don't want to be near you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.450
Any minute now

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.880
Just wait right there

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.880
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.060
Black and blue

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.990
I'll give up on giving up

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.110
And get the world on my side

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.780
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.120
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.420
And head where the light shines

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.260
I want to keep my promise

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.050
I'll deliver it to you

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.820
shape of love

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.530
Destruction and Salvation

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.810
I messed up...

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.580
Asta...

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.830
Asta!

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.520
Mimosa, I'm fine now, so please 
just take care of Asta!

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.090
R-Right!

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.220
I'm not sure if my remaining 
magic will be enough.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.250
Asta!

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.700
Brat! Open your eyes!

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.380
Where's all that energy you just had?!

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.080
You can't die before I kill you!

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.050
Asta!

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.860
Can you hear me, Asta?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.980
You're not alone!

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.190
Mars, is the training painful?

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.750
When things get rough,
remember the faces of those you love.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.250
We were born to protect the people 
of this kingdom that we love so much.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.770
Once we become strong enough to protect
this kingdom, we'll be allowed to go outside.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.040
You'll probably make it out first, Mars.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.030
Lucky.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.550
I mean, you're the strongest 
out of all of us, Mars.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.040
I'll be waiting for you when that happens.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.280
Huh?

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.900
Until you get out, too, Fana.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.210
Sure! Let's go see the 
outside world together.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.470
This is your final test.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.700
Kill each other.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.440
The sole survivor will be allowed to go 
outside as our kingdom's mage warrior.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.140
If you refuse, you'll all be disposed of.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.900
I'm sorry, Mars.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.420
Fana...

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.810
I have no other choice.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.560
Please die.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.040
Looks like Mars is the one who survived.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.060
Then let's implant him with the magic stones.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.250
Let's go ahead and give him
Fana's powers, too, since she was

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.190
the last one he killed.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.290
Now we'll finally have the 
ultimate mage warrior.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.380
I'm... fine alone,

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.380
because I have extremely powerful magic.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.540
Those without magic are weak.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.470
And the weak will die.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.220
He's...

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.810
...still moving!

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.310
It can't happen...

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.810
Someone as naïve as you 
cannot win against me!

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.670
Asta!

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.960
His flame recovery magic should've 
been negated by Asta's attack.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.670
This is the perfect opportunity 
to finish him, but...

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.050
Just a little more... Just a little more, 
and I can break through these restraints.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.170
Die!

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.540
Asta!

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.040
No matter what spell I pick from
my grimoire, I won't make it in time.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.610
I won't let him die here!

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.570
Did Yuno just do that?

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.990
What just happened?

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.400
The spell... has been broken.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.830
Yuno! What did you do?

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.720
Was that magic? What did you use?

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.850
I'm not sure.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.410
You're not sure?

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.050
There was a little girl, and...

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.610
A little girl?

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.820
Well...

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.510
You must be tired.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.460
Let us talk later.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:12.880
More importantly,

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.380
we've defeated him for sure this time.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.850
These are...

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.810
the characters from that scroll.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.570
Asta...

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.490
What's...

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.250
Is this a trap?

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.770
The dungeon is falling apart!

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.650
Celestial Wind Ark!

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.750
Everyone, get on!

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.060
We're getting out.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.410
We're ready, Yuno.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.280
Mimosa, take care of Asta.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.300
I will.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.430
Him...

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.860
You shouldn't talk now.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.300
Save him... please.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.010
What are you saying?

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.890
He tried to kill us!

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.630
We...

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.150
came to conquer this dungeon.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.270
Not... to kill...

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.160
an enemy.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:15.170
It might be a waste to let 
someone that strong die here.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.030
It's too late! We won't make 
it out in time. Let's go!

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.450
Where's the exit?

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.940
Mimosa can't use her 
Magic Flower Guidepost right now.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.530
Go right. I'll guide us out.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.360
Got it.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.660
Left.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.620
Okay.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.270
Keep going straight.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.070
Okay.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.460
I managed to hit it.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.740
More coming!

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.690
Got it!

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:39.630
I've already acknowledged 
you as my... as our friend!

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.290
We won't let...

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.510
...Asta die.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.470
We'll save Asta!

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.130
We'll get out of here...

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.800
...alive!

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.480
We made it out.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.590
We did it.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.550
That was fun!

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.750
Honestly...

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.810
We'll head over there.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.820
Man... We sure were lucky 
they created a path for us.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.570
Because of this old man's ultimate 
trump card, Hermit's Thick Smoke,

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.830
they never realized we were 
close by the whole time.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.540
Anyway, thank goodness you're alive.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.590
I'm sorry, Mars.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.530
Fana...

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.430
I have no other choice.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.550
Please die.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.500
Why...

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.290
Why?

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.930
My wounds...

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.270
If I didn't do that, you wouldn't have...

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.150
Fana...

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.460
Fana!

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.170
Oh? Are you awake, Mars?

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.430
Lotus...

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.790
Great work back there.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.180
Thanks to you, I was able 
to get all this treasure.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.720
Now the people of our kingdom, 
as well as my daughters,

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.700
will be able to eat delicious things.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.450
I remember everything.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.550
Make sure you go see the world outside.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.970
For me... as well.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.720
Lotus...

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.980
You saved me. Thank you.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.480
Well, how about that?

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.780
You can actually say things like that.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:46.740
Everyone...

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.920
Asta.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.060
Asta!

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.250
Asta!

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.960
Hooray.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.830
Ow...

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.700
Hmph! As long as you're okay, Stupidsta.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.550
It's unbelievable.
Your recuperative ability is amazing.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.510
He's resilient, if nothing else.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.560
What'd you say, Yuno?!

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:14.880
I'm more than just resilient... ow, ow, ow...

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.240
I-I'm so sorry! I didn't have 
enough magic to fully heal you.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.470
I just did what I could for now, 
so you probably shouldn't move.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.540
N-No worries.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.970
You saved me. Thanks.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.530
N-No problem at all!

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.630
R-Really...

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.580
I thought you were going to 
die before I got to kill you.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.850
I won't die. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.310
Not until I become the Wizard King.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.250
Not a chance.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.110
I'm the one who's going 
to be the Wizard King.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.630
Hup. Ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.110
Don't use my body as a crutch.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.860
What's the big deal? 
It's not like I'm hurting you.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.370
You two...

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.930
Klaus.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.590
I'm so...

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.150
sorry!

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:29.030
I'm so ashamed that I didn't acknowledge 
you just because you were peasants!

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.650
Both of you are...

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.940
magnificent Magic Knights 
of the Clover Kingdom!

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.160
Klaus...

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.730
Klaus.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.430
You're suffocating us.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.090
Lord Four-Eyes... it hurts.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.050
What?! And after I just...

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.980
Who knew you were such a good four-eyes?

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.540
What do you mean by that, you fool?!

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.250
You're just too serious, Klaus.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.170
Hey, hey, Yuno!

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.690
Let's fight sometime.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.690
No.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.380
Hey, Noelle. Your clothes are all ripped up.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.460
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.030
Oh, he died.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.040
Asta!

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.060
I couldn't help myself! Stupidsta!

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.420
Wake up!

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.260
Asta!

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.680
What are you staring at?

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.110
Ow!

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:56.440
Hmph.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.780
Ow, ow, ow...

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.700
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.670
And push me forward

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.610
(I can't find a place to go)

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:45.990
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:51.490
And change the flow of time

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.910
(I will keep believing in you)

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.790
In this ever-vivid place

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.630
(Break free yourself)

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.630
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.290
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.350
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.260
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.750
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.430
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.450
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.810
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:27.810
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.090
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.340
Petit Clover

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.470
Petit Clover!

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.840
So You Can Actually
Say Things Like That

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.260
So You Can Actually Say Things Like That.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.100
You saved me. Thank you.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.870
Well, how about that?

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.260
You can actually say things like that.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.110
I can.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.110
Then how about this?

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.340
She sells seashells by the seashore.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.210
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.780
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck 
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.120
I can.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.610
She sells... she shells... seashore.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.350
Peter Piper picked... 
a pick of peckled pippers.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.380
How much wood could... 
a woodchuck... chuck...

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.630
So you can't.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.380
I can.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.750
She sells she shells by the she shore.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.950
Peter Piper pipped a 
pep of pippled peppers.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.820
How much wood could a 
woodchuck... could... chuck...

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.020
I can't!

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.350
We did it! Did you see that?!

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.190
I did it, Sister!

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.190
Wait, what?! We just met the Wizard King!

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.360

Being loud is my magic!
