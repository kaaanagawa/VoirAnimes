00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.070
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.120
We will now begin the finals 
for the Selection Exam.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.410
I Team: Rill, Nils, and Ruben, come forward!

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.620
Young Master Rill,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.150
here's some herbal tea that will clear 
your mind and help you concentrate.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.710
Yay, thank you!

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.810
I'm sure the mistress will be pleased

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.620
when she hears about all of 
your ventures this time around.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470
What? Mother will?

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.830
You think so?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.830
But of course.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.670
Then I definitely need to win.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550
Please show the world why 
you were able to become

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.840
the youngest Magic Knights Squad
 captain in history.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.870
That's the Captain of the Aqua Deer for you.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.760
He seems so relaxed despite 
the big battle coming up.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.850
Well, he crushed the other 
teams in his last two rounds.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.940
We made it this far without doing 
much at all because of him.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.520
At this rate, even if our team wins,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.260
there's no guarantee that we'll 
be selected as Royal Knights.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.110
Who were those two again?

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.490
We have to stand out more!

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.990
Next, P Team: En, Yuno, 
and Noelle, come forward.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.870
Dear members of I Team, please go easy on us.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.710
I'm gonna crush all of you!

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.750
I'm gonna crush you all into sawdust!

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.190
Uh, your inner voice is spilling out.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.180
I'm just so excited, I can't contain myself.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.820
Let's do this, Noelle!

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.810
My expression is as hard as rock truffles!

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.890
Let's fire things up!

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.230
Mushrooms double in flavor 
when you cook them!

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.220
You can even dry them or freeze them!

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.660
Let's mushle, mushle to victory!
 All together now!

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.890
Mushle—

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.900
Shut up.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.700
Huh?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.080
Honestly... I'm already distracted 
enough because of Asta.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.530
I mean, I'm only worried 
because he's part of my squad.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.520
It's not like it bothers me that 
Mimosa gets to be by his side!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.090
Your face is red! Are you 
finally getting fired up?!

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.660
Shut your mouth.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.930
Ugh, you're both so noisy. 
You'd better not hold Yuno back!

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.850
Bell...

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.310
We're going full force in the next round.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.310
Yes! It's finally my turn to shine!

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.950
What?

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.690
You mean he wasn't at full strength yet?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.290
He's so cool.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.280
That's what draws people to him,
 and makes them admire him...

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.360
I can't wait!

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.940
With you as my next opponent,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.980
I might finally be able to paint 
my ultimate masterpiece!

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.080
I'll also be able to see 
just how much I've grown.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.280
Young Master Rill will be the victor.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.080
It'll be Yuno!

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.460
It'll be Master Rill.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.340
Yuno!

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.340
The young master.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.140
Yu—

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.710
The—

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.090
Ruben  Nils  Rill

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.090
I Team

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.090
Yuno  En  Noelle

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.090
P Team

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.600
So it finally begins.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.100
This will determine the winning team.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.060
Though I, the protagonist, am absent, 
I hope to see a beautiful match.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.370
I'm going to watch every second of this 
match so I can further my horizons!

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.980
The Victors

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.210
Asta!

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.010
So you finally woke up.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.130
Where am I?

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.100
Langris!

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.730
You need to lie down.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.020
Yeah, but—

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.020
It's over.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.890
That's right. Our team...

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.390
How's Finral?

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.450
His wounds are quite deep... He's been 
taken to the castle's medical tower.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.030
What about Yuno and his team?

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.610
They had a quick victory 
again in stage two, la.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.830
They're about to start the match 
to decide the winning team.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.060
Yuno...

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.750
And now, the final match with I Team...

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.770
I can't wait!

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.090
We'll stand out this time!

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.530
...and P Team!

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.990
I'll take care of the 
Captain of the Aqua Deer.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.640
He's all yours.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.390
Begin!

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.360
Whoa! Here he comes!

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.610
I'm right here!

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.540
He doesn't have to call him over!

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.390
Hey! Right over here!

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.770
As we suspected, that newcomer 
is heading for Captain Rill.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.770
I said, I'm right over here!

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.040
Now's our chance.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.370
Hey!

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.390
Wind Magic: Wind Blade Shower!

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.250
Picture Magic: Game of the Gods!

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.630
What?!

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.270
He's definitely not like 
anyone I've faced before.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.520
That's our number one newbie! 
I expect nothing less!

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.670
Ah, so they just greeted 
each other with their magic.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.940
By the looks of it, 
neither of them is even trying yet.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.970
That's what you call a greeting?! 
Th-They're on a whole different level!

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:13.860
Look!

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.830
Bah-ha?!

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.950
There's a battle beginning over there, too.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.960
The enemy team's crystal 
is right in front of us!

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.210
Let's do this!

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.960
Ice Magic: Ice Needle!

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.220
Sandstone Magic: Rock Fall!

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.780
They're both attacking at once?!

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.740
Leave the ice magic to me!

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.440
Noelle, if you'd take care of the 
fellow with the sandstone magic.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.730
Fungus Magic: Towering Mister Mushroom.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.230
Heyo.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.840
Bring it!

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.650
Ha-ni-wat?!

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.530
What?!

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.560
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.790
Their defense is strong!

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.330
Then we'll just have to strengthen 
our defense as well, and take them on!

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.150
No matter what it takes...

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.220
We're going to destroy their crystal...

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.550
...and stand out!

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.000
They split up, just like we planned.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.570
We're going to protect our crystal,
 no matter what.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.730
So...

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.520
We're counting on you over there!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.740
Wind Magic: Tornado Fang...

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.250
Plus Crescent Moon Sickle!

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.830
Hup!

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.290
Here we go!

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.440
Bell!

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.640
You got it!

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.230
Wind Magic: Swift White Bow!

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.990
Nice, nice!

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.120
Whoa, there!

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.330
Oopsie-daisy...

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.860
Here we go!

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.950
Hup!

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.050
One more time!

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.870
Maybe I was wrong about you.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.820
I seem to be missing a little something.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.470
Such versatile and powerful wind magic!

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.340
I guess we should expect that from the 
newbie who has the four-leaf grimoire.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.480
He's powerful!

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.340
But he's up against the 
Captain of the Aqua Deer.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.110
He's blocking everything beautifully.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.610
Your little spirit friend is a cutie.
 This is starting to get really fun!

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:28.620
But this still isn't enough for me to get the 
inspiration for my ultimate masterpiece!

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.610
What's his problem?

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.880
He keeps blocking everything 
with his weird paintings! Ugh!

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.130
Bell, we're going to do the thing.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.510
I planned to use it against 
Asta in the finals,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.010
but I'm up against a Magic 
Knights Squad captain.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.100
You're a worthy opponent.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.670
In the battle where he lost his five senses,

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.900
his concentration was 
heightened to its peak.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.940
That along with his experience 
in controlling mana

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.220
and the training he underwent to use 
Mana Skin to protect himself at all times...

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:09.830
Yuno learned to control the excessive 
amount of mana within his body.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.300
He then refined that technique

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.290
so that he could hold the 
spirit's power within him, too.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.960
This feeling of becoming one with Yuno...

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.300
I just can't get enough of it!

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.060
Asta...

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.810
I'm about to pull far ahead 
of you with this one move.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.450
I am always the one who will win against you!

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.890
Spirit Assimilation: Spirit Dive.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.550
Wh-What is that overwhelming 
amount of magic?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.410
So beautiful...

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:10.670
This power was born from your overwhelming 
instinct and astounding efforts.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.170
Yuno, you're...

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.980
Wow...

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.350
Young Master...

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.100
That's amazing, Yuno!

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.440
I feel like I can draw anything right now!

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.840
Wind Spirit Magic...

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.570
Picture Magic...

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.830
Spirit Storm!

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.150
Scream of the Mystical Dragon Vouivre!

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.820
It's amazing... So amazing!

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.890
Please don't draw anymore, Rill!

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.440
No one will be able to accept you!

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.440
Someday, your mother will 
understand your talents, too.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.070
This is the best!

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.650
I never knew that going 
all-out against someone...

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.130
...could make me so happy!

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.380
La...

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.870
Y-Yuno is amazing.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.020
Damn it... Damn it...

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.170
Why... am I not the one facing Yuno?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.700
I'm going to win

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.680
against a Magic Knights Squad captain!

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.180
I'm going to win!

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.330
Good...

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.420
Good, good!

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.040
More! More, more!

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.440
Let's draw the ultimate masterpiece

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.420
together!

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.190
Huh?

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.470
Huh?! Wait, why?!

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.270
Things were just about to 
get even more interesting!

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.340
His attack didn't hit the crystal, though!

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.030
What in the world?! Why did it break?!

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.590
I'm guessing that with the intense amount 
of magical power Rill was emitting,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.350
the crystal just couldn't take it anymore.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.480
His own magical powers...

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.840
...made him self-destruct?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.870
We couldn't...

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.180
Captain Rill has destroyed 
his own team's crystal.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.850
...stand out...

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:10.780
Therefore, P Team—Yuno, 
Noelle, and En—wins!

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.180
Th-That battle was unbelievable.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.470
That final push of their magical 
powers gave me goosebumps.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.210
That newbie is on the same 
level as Captain Rill... no.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.000
He might have even more magic!

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.250
Yes!

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.450
Ahem... Well, he won, but only because 
his opponent self-destructed.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.780
We can't have him getting 
a big head because of that.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.230
I'm not about to lose! I'm going 
back and training even harder!

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.900
This isn't fair!

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.480
Young Master.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.970
Please, wipe away those tears.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.530
If I were the judge, I would've proclaimed 
you the victor, Master Rill.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.960
Huh? Really?

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.280
I win?!

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.290
By a landslide.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.070
Oh, come on! There's no way!

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.160
You can't be serious.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.670
Well, to others, you probably didn't win.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.530
But you should use this 
frustration as motivation

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.520
to draw your next ultimate masterpiece.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.550
I'm sure that's just what 
your mother would want.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.190
You're right... Thank you, Walter.

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:24.810
And...

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.100
Yuno.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.460
We won!

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.700
We did it, Noelle.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.700
Mushle, mushle! Mushle, mush—

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.400
What did you expect?

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.910
Oh, my gosh! I can't believe we actually won!

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.950
This concludes the Selection Exam.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.830
First of all, let me congratulate 
you on your victory.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:53.210
You may have lost by a hair,
 but you also did amazingly well.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.210
Also, the other teams may have been defeated,

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.470
but it doesn't mean you're out of the race.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.720
I'm going to go over all 
of your battles from today,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.230
and will probably select and announce about 
10 to 20 Royal Knights at a later date.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.110
That means we still have a chance!

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:18.100
They're all extremely gifted Magic Knights.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.490
I'm going to have a hard time choosing.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.860
Finally, His Majesty has something to say.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.000
Ahem.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.730
Excellent work today.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.830
You displayed high levels of magical power

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.900
and versatility in dealing 
with various obstacles,

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.700
not to mention the use of careful 
planning and combination attacks.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.760
Any one of your teams could 
have easily been the winner.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.460
He actually said something decent.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.330
That was decent.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.630
Way too decent.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.520
He almost sounds like a real king.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.520
However! <i>I</i> worked harder than anyone else!

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.130
Without me, this day would've never come!

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.970
I am the one who decided 
and announced the formation

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.100
of the ultimate squad of Magic Knights,
 the Royal Knights!

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.780
I am the great one who made 
this exam happen, so praise me!

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.030
What are you doing?! Hurry up and praise me!

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.860
Your Majesty, please calm yourself.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.620
They all gathered here because they all 
supported the idea of the Royal Knights

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.310
from the bottom of their hearts.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.550
They gathered here

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.150
determined to protect this kingdom 
from the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.100
Don't you think their thoughts and actions 
show that they are ready for anything?

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.100
If only the Wizard King 
was actually the king.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.250
If only the Wizard King 
was actually the king.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.810
Shouldn't we just make the 
Wizard King the actual king?

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:36.320
Now, then... I'll be counting on you 
if you're chosen to be a Royal Knight.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.070
Yes, sir.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.070
Curse you! You're always 
standing out more than me!

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.370
We will now bring the Royal Knights 
Selection Exam to a close.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.710
I would say that today's 
exam was a huge success.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.950
Yes. Your other objective,

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.300
to find out which Magic 
Knight was being manipulated

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.930
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun, 
was also a success.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.980
We can begin questioning once 
Langris recovers from his wounds.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:12.010
I'd rather not suspect everyone, but there 
might be something more going on.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.060
We can't let our guard down.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.230
Thanks for staying by my side, Mimosa.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.700
Asta...

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.550
My magic can heal physical wounds,
 but not his heart.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.130
We're going back, Mimosa.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.410
Yuno!

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.410
B-But...

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.960
I see... Asta's...

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.420
Mimosa, it'll be okay. I'll take over.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.770
D-Don't get the wrong idea!

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.610
It's only natural for me to look 
after another member of my squad!

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.930
Yuno...

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.210
Are you sure, Yuno?

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.710
Yuno!

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.360
I'm going to catch up to you!

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.190
I'm the one who's going 
to become the Wizard King!

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.450
Like I'd let you catch up to me.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.350
Hey, Yuno!

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.960
Yuno!

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.200
Yuno...

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.460
You made this?

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.640
Super Magic Knight Zora has a mouth 
on him, but he's as good as his word.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.800
He's a warrior who protects 
the country behind the scenes!

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.530
We all believe in each other and get 
through life-or-death situations!

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.810
Companions who believe in each other, huh?

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.060
What the hell am I thinking?

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.010
Leaving already?

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.820
Thank you for pointing out the 
faults of everyone who lost.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.030
Though you could've said 
things a little more nicely,

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.040
those who want to improve can 
actually take those words

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.610
to heart and become stronger.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.590
Your trap magic and knowledge are vital.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.860
You will probably pass the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam,

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.710
so I'll be counting on you.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.230
What the hell are you talking about?

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.660
I'm sure you already knew this, but I'm 
not the Vice Captain of the Purple Orcas

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.960
or Xerx Lügner. See ya.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.310
True. I can't commend you for 
pretending to be someone else.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.590
But I wouldn't say it's that big an issue, 
given that you're a Magic Knight yourself,

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.620
Zora.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.030
A long time ago, I met a certain 
Magic Knight on the battlefield.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.490
His name was Zara Ideale.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:38.370
He gave his all to protect this country
and was a model Magic Knight.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.130
I ended up alongside this amazing 
guy on the battlefield today.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.420
He could use time magic.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.300
He's the kind of guy who's gonna succeed.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.320
His name was cool, too! Novachrono!

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.550
We thought up the star system 
so that people like him

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.900
would be acknowledged for their efforts,
 rather than their upbringing.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.650
Despite that, we sadly still have some 
misguided Magic Knights among us.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.520
I think it's about time you put on the 
robe from your own squad, don't you,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.160
Zora Ideale?

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.040
Zora Ideale?

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.420
Who the hell is that jerk?

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:31.350
I'm just a guy passing through 
who couldn't become a super mage.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.060
Hello there. 'Tis I, the beautiful 
Kirsch Vermillion, once again.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:47.070
In <i>Black Clover</i>, we always strive for beauty.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.420
And we will reach the peak of beauty 
in Page 85: "Together In the Bath."

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 85
 Together In the Bath

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.990
My naked body is beautiful enough 
to be a national treasure!
