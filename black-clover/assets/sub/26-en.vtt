00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.890
You're right there!

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.090
I'm impressed you found me.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.270
What are you, an animal?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.230
But it appears that it's over now.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.750
Over?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.720
What's over?

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.750
We've completed our mission.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.340
We're leaving before the other 
Magic Knights come back, Rades.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.570
Asta, wasn't it?

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.890
I'll eventually kill you and make
you into one of my toys.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.850
Look forward to that, you little brat!

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.910
Not giving up is my magic!

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.930
And my sword can...

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.060
Cut through magic!

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.120
What?!

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.130
Ow! What the hell are
you doing, you little shit?!

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.000
Not good...

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.680
You have the nerve to say that 
after hurting all those people?!

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.590
This...

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.050
is pain!

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.690
This is what you did to innocent people 
as you laughed about it!

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.860
This isn't good... We can't 
afford to lose Rades, too.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.070
Pathetic.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.130
We received orders from Master 
to come here, and look at you...

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.260
You're struggling against 
this lot. How pathetic.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.700
There are five new enemies!

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.020
I was only scratched... but thanks to 
that curse, the bleeding won't stop.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.290
It looks like the tables have turned!

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.750
I would always close my eyes

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.090
And cower at reality

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.770
I can't stand the idea

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.140
Of just making excuses to give up

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.240
Stand right there

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.400
I don't want to be near you

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.540
Any minute now

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.940
Just wait right there

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.940
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.020
Black and blue

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.940
I'll give up on giving up

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.450
And get the world on my side

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.330
Every time somewhere under this sky

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.180
Break through the tearful nights

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.460
And head where the light shines

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.300
I want to keep my promise

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.850
I'll deliver it to you

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.820
shape of love

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.570
Wounded Beasts

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.590
Things have quieted down.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.300
Has the enemy been taken care of?

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.240
Yum, yum, can't move.
Can't move, can't move...

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.120
My meal-saving prince...

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.730
I hope the Magic Knights are okay.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.120
Asta!

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.330
You...

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.430
Now I can keep fighting!

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.590
Please watch me, sir!

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.910
This brat... He struck himself with his 
own swords to get rid of the curse?

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.520
Unbelievable... He's so stupid!

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.210
Wow, he's fun. Can I dissect him later?

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.520
Quiet.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.320
Boo. You're such a spoilsport.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.080
All I've ever faced since 
I was born... was adversity.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.840
No matter how many come at me,
no matter what happens,

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.040
I'll blast them all away!

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.050
All right! Come at me!

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.620
It seems he's lost his mind
 in the face of our numbers.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.350
Whatever. He's about to die anyway.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.150
There's no use in fighting.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.900
You need to learn when to give up.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.660
Oh, so that's him.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.910
So this is the anti-magic 
brat our master spoke of.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.170
Your exuberance may be your greatest
weapon, but keep a cool head, too.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.330
If you truly wish to become 
the Wizard King, that is.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.560
Keep a cool head... Right, sir?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.060
I'll stay calm... while I kick their butts!

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.530
This little...

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.590
Flame Magic: Exploding Flames!

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.510
Wow!

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.580
You think I'm going to let you people 
throw your weight around

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.330
after what you did to my brother?!

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.830
Let me join you, my rival!

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.840
Sure! Go right ahead!

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.850
They say beasts are more formidable 
when they're wounded. These two...

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.620
are dangerous.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.200
What the hell are you doing?! 
Hurry up and kill them!

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.530
We know.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.280
They aren't our targets...

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.030
But we'll kill them now!

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.540
Noelle!

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.290
Don't think that you can 
kill my friends so easily!

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.130
Wow...

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.220
That's quite the defensive spell.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.430
Judging from your appearance, you must 
be a member of the royal Silva family.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.690
In that case, I'll use my grimoire 
against you. I wouldn't want to be rude.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.590
Tree Creation Magic: Magic-Draining Roots!

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.040
Asta!

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.200
I know.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.200
What are you planning to do?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.750
No... They swallowed my torrent.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.500
Your fighting instincts are admirable.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.730
Wind Creation Magic: Tornado Needles!

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.310
He's...

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.990
He's too fast.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.700
Asta! Leopold!

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.700
Now, let's end this.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.580
N-No way...

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.580
No!

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.720
Ooh, what's this magic? I've never 
seen anything like this before!

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.520
E-Everyone...

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.980
The Magic Knights...

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.730
How dare you send us that far away?

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.610
Impossible... They managed to return 
here from that distance so quickly?

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:02.030
We really didn't want to, but we 
all worked together to get back.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.450
I suppose you could call it 
super compound magic.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.540
Joining forces once in a while isn't so bad.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.860
Well, I guess men aren't completely useless.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.550
I'll acknowledge their abilities.
Nothing more.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.390
I'm never working with them again.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.640
We really don't play well with others.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.970
But our nine Magic Knights squads exist

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.320
solely to protect the peace 
of the Clover Kingdom!

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.870
Noelle!

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.070
Mimosa, please take care 
of Captain Fuegoleon.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.900
No... How could something like this happen 
to someone like Captain Fuegoleon?

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.090
Not to mention Leopold and Asta...

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.090
Hey, wake up!

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.620
You're alive!

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.410
They put Captain Fuegoleon 
and the others in such a state.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.600
Who...

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.730
It'll cost us if we keep fighting. Let's retreat.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.800
Don't be in such a hurry.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.110
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver!

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.990
Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.740
My magic will just pierce 
through magic like that.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.490
And then...

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:33.400
Dark Magic Item: Special 
Properties Plus Alpha... absorbed!

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.260
They managed to deflect the captain's 
magic as if it were nothing!

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.010
What... is that magic item?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.500
No—

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.770
Mine!

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.310
What do you plan to do with him?

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.810
It's a secret!

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.530
Remember this, Magic Knights.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.290
We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.880
The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.790
Asta!

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.300
Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.060
My magic will just pierce 
through magic like that.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.810
And then...

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.710
Dark Magic Item: Special 
Properties Plus Alpha... absorbed!

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.570
They managed to deflect the captain's 
magic as if it were nothing!

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.320
What... is that magic item?

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.830
No—

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.080
Mine!

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.620
What do you plan on doing with him?

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.230
It's a secret!

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.840
Remember this, Magic Knights.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.670
We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.160
The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.110
Asta!

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.820
They took... Asta.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.270
We have to save him!

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.950
Noelle, we can't.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.820
But—

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.830
It's unfortunate, but we have 
no way of tracking them.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.450
Yes, but—

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.350
No.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.600
Right now, strengthening the royal 
capital's defenses takes priority.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.610
There's no guarantee that 
those were the only enemies.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.630
We don't have any time or magic 
to spare on someone like him.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.340
How are Fuegoleon and Leopold doing?

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.640
The best I can do with 
my magic is first aid!

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.640
He needs to be taken to the medical ward 
for more advanced healing magic, or he'll...

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.650
Some captain he is. How pathetic.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.650
The Vermillions sure aren't what they used 
to be. Makes me embarrassed to be a royal.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.870
Solid, how could you say that?

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.420
We are Magic Knights.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.160
Our existence is pointless unless we win.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.710
Nozel...

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.460
That's right! This is going to ruin the 
reputation of the Crimson Lion Kings...

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.460
But Solid...

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.110
As we were not present at the fight,
we are even less than he is.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.470
Strengthen the defenses so that 
there won't be further damages.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.470
Right.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.750
They've spread around magic that 
blocks transmission spells,

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.980
and the chain of command is in chaos.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.190
Because of that, reinforcements from outside 
the Noble Realm couldn't arrive.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.860
We can't let our guard down yet.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.880
Sol, we're going to reinforce the area.
Don't let your guard down.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.140
You got it, Sis!

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.380
Call me "Captain."

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.200
I know, Captain Sis!

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.760
My goodness. Looks like we'll have to 
wait on dessert a little while longer.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.830
Klaus, go to headquarters 
and get reinforcements.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.890
Yes, sir.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.700
Asta...

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.900
Rades, we ended up with a huge headache 
because you stepped out of line.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.650
Don't get carried away just because 
the master has taken a liking to you.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.760
How dare you say, "I want 
to fight a captain alone.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.660
I want to lay waste to the capital"?
You conceited fool!

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.790
Shut up.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.100
If you'd just done what you were told, we
wouldn't have to go through all this trouble.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.600
My toys were the victims in all of this!

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.670
This doesn't concern any of you!

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:51.140
I heard that Catherine was captured, though.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.870
Who the hell cares about that old hag?

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.250
Hag...

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.430
We got what we went there for, so who cares?

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.940
By the way, Sally...

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.890
We won't be able to take that brat with us.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.770
Kill him.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.010
What? No way!

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.430
He uses anti-magic!

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.230
This is on a different level than a 
mere magic-weakening effect!

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.640
I'm going to use him in my research!

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.950
Let me take him! Please? Please?

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.950
Where am I...? What is this? 
It feels sorta nice.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:25.430
Only those acknowledged by 
the master can go there.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.200
Don't cause any more unnecessary trouble. 
Kill him before our master arrives.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.210
What?

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.450
Aw...

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.930
I know! Let me kill him! 
I'll make him into my toy!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.510
Crap, I've...

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.880
Shut up, Rades.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.790
What?!

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.740
I've been captured by the enemy?

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.770
Hey, you're awake.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.030
A-A girl?

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.270
You should help me convince them!

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:54.530
I want to study everything about you and 
your grimoire, and do some experiments,

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.870
and then dissect you in the end!

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.740
You want every last cell of yours 
to help with my research, right?

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.790
She's really bad news!

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.790
Right? Right? Right?

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.370
And this is a super bad situation!

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.500
I can't move! I can't run!

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.300
Please? I'll ask properly, so please?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.840
Don't blame me for whatever happens.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.800
Give him to me!

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.650
Nope!

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.130
Hi there.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.470
I've been waiting for you.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.790
Wha—

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.020
Ooh!

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.570
H-He's...

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.070
The Wizard King, Julius Novachrono?!

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.530
What's he doing here?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.030
How was the royal capital?

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.740
Kill him!

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.230
I-Impossible!

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.710
I killed them.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.880
It would've been too difficult 
with your numbers...

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.550
Restraining all of you, I mean.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.740
Wait, what?

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.900
You guys attacked the royal capital, right?

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.410
You didn't actually kill people without
being ready to die yourselves, did you?

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.760
Such power...

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.370
This is the Wizard King?

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.720
Crap... I don't have any magic left...

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.210
That being said, you all seem pretty skilled.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.210
You'll probably give me some trouble.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.130
How about it? I'll let one of you 
survive, so why not surrender?

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.100
It'll be first come, first served.
What do you think?

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.390
Don't underestimate us!

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.900
Wha... How is he moving like 
that?! I can't keep up!

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.120
I guess I don't have a choice.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.120
I might be able to handle these numbers.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:10.250
Time Binding Magic: Chrono Stasis.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.670
What... is this?

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.170
I can't move...

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.170
...at all.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.010
I guess I was able to restrain all of you.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.180
Were you more worn out than I thought?

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.930
See how it feels to live 
in one unending moment.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.820
Ow...

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.440
Hey there, Asta.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.150
We seem to be connected by fate somehow.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.940
R-Right...

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.950
He managed to take care of all of 
them despite how strong they were.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.700
This is the Wizard King's power?

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.190
This is...

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.960
You want to become the 
Wizard King someday, right?

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.190
In that case, watch carefully 
and don't look away.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.720
This is only a small fraction 
of what you'll have to surpass.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.220
He's my goal! The strongest guy there is!

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.480
He's the strongest mage in the 
kingdom that I need to surpass!

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.480
Can you stand?

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.740
I can't stop shaking after witnessing 
the Wizard King's power firsthand!

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.210
You idiot!

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.990
Stop shaking! Stop!

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.800
You can't lose here!

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.000
I guess you didn't need my help.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.820
All of you had some interesting 
magic. I was surprised.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.010
Now, then... I have some 
questions for you all.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.020
What are these jewels and this stone slab?

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.130
I've never seen these characters 
or patterns before.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.030
What are you trying to accomplish with this?

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:07.030
Well, it's not like you can answer 
that while you're in that spell.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.540
I guess we can take our time back at 
the Clover Kingdom to talk about this.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.040
Something's coming?

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.720
That's blinding!

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.100
What is this light?!

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:02.600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.570
And push me forward

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.630
(I can't find a place to go)

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:12.890
Even the faintest light can 
still break through the darkness

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:18.390
And change the flow of time

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.810
(I will keep believing in you)

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.690
In this ever-vivid place

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.650
(Break free yourself)

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.530
In order to grasp my endless dream

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.190
If there is a path that I should choose

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:37.160
Wherever it may lead us

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.650
Until my life comes to an end

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.350
(We can try again, we can try again)

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:54.260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.280
Petit Clover

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.740
Petit Clover!

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.790
Cringing at Salamander Bowls

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.790
Cringing at Salamander Bowls!

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.620
Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.070
Mander!

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.290
How adorable!

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.230
That's no big deal! Nero's much cuter.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.050
If you put him in a bowl, he's delicious.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.220
Ma?!

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.090
She's dangerous!

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.140
Looks nummy!

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.770
They're all dangerous!

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.370
Wow! The Wizard King himself showed up!

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.440
I wanna research him. I wonder 
if he'd become my sample.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.690
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 27: "Light."

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:55.250
Page 27
 Light

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.700
If you want to be researched, 
come see me, Sally!
