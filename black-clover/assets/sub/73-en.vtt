00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.150
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.640
After the Star Festival, the king 
made a very important announcement.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.560
The Eye of the Midnight Sun's 
hideout has been located.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.520
We are going to launch an 
all-out attack on the enemy!

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.020
To that end,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.820
I have decided to gather an even more 
select group from the Magic Knights

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.150
to form the ultimate hand-picked unit.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.410
They will be called... the Royal Knights!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.530
The

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.780
The Ro

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.030
The Royal

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.280
The Royal Kni

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.410
The Royal Knights

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.200
A test involving all of the Magic Knights

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.870
for a chance to join the Royal 
Knights was about to begin!

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.020
The Royal Knights Selection Test

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.300
Good grief. We finally return from 
our expedition, and now this.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.600
Do anything else, and you'll 
be obstructing public duties.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.890
As a Magic Knight, 
I'll have to dispose of you.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.580
Do you have any idea who this is?

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.030
Vice Captain of the Purple Orcas
Xerx Lügner

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.030
This is the Vice Captain of the 
Purple Orcas, Lord Xerx Lügner!

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.720
His power and virtue are what made 
the Purple Orcas who they are today!

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.200
He's the Saint of Pure Ice!

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.750
Why the hell would I know 
about this pompous jackass?

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.540
"The Saint of Pure Ice"? 
Where's this ice of yours, then?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.540
He looks more like a zombie 
covered in mud to me.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.110
What?!

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.510
Two-bit flunkies shouldn't be boasting 
about supposed glories.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.510
Is your great master there such 
a piece of trash that he needs you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.840
to make introductions for him?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.640
Wha—

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.440
Obstruction of public duties? 
Must be nice being such a bigshot.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.710
You can say whatever the hell you 
want about things you don't like.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.960
Go on. Give it a try.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.360
Try to strike me down in the name of justice 
with this all-powerful magic of yours,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.910
great vice captain of some band of thugs
who likes to throw his weight around.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.580
You swine!

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.830
How dare you insult the Magic Knights?

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.860
I shall make you regret your very 
existence with my magic!

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.840
Ice Magic: Ice Slicer!

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.390
The Saint of Pure Ice...

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.690
Really?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.860
Yet you lost to someone like me? 
Your title as vice captain is obviously a joke.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.040
That Magic Knight's robe is wasted on you.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.830
Now, then... Let's see if there's anyone 
else around worth humiliating even more.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.060
The Royal Knights Exam! I don't know what 
kind of exam it is, but I'm all fired up!

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.890
I can finally show everyone my true powers!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.790
I beg your pardon, 
but even that level of power

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.580
is enough to disturb the people around you,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.480
so could you consider calming down a bit?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.150
M-My apologies.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.930
The Golden Dawn 5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Mimosa Vermillion

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.090
That's Mimosa Vermillion!

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.040
I hear she's an expert 
at healing and support,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.840
but she's been learning attack 
spells lately, too.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.540
So she's a jack of all trades? 
That's royalty for you!

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.960
Mimosa, don't start any 
trouble before the exam.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.820
Pointing out the lower magic level 
of someone who's your elder...

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.320
I see you're as obliviously rude as ever.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.970
And you're so serious, a worrywart, 
and a four-eyes, Klaus.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.970
Four-eye—

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.000
The Golden Dawn 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Klaus Lunettes

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.220
That's Klaus Lunettes.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.660
He's powered up a lot in the past 
few months, and his steel magic

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.140
is real tough to break through.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.690
I heard he's also working out.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.220
The Golden Dawn 5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Yuno

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.560
That's... the number one rookie this year!

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.710
The Wind Spirit user Yuno!

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.740
Hey! We had a date today, Yuno!

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.940
I never agreed to that.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.470
What?! Then promise you'll take me 
out on a date tomorrow! Right now!

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.370
No.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.300
Ugh! Fine! The day after tomorrow works, too!

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.890
I don't know what'll happen 
that far into the future.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.850
What's your problem?! 
Now I'm going to mess up your hair!

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.730
The Golden Dawn 2nd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Hamon Caseus

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.730
Well, aren't they a delight, Alecdora?

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.210
Right.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.270
The Golden Dawn 4th Class Senior Magic Knight
Alecdora Sandler

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.270
So many other top contenders 
that we all know!

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.240
There's a good chance a bunch of the Golden 
Dawn's members are going to pass this exam.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.900
The Golden Dawn Vice Captain
Langris Vaude

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.720
Everyone seems quite on edge, don't they?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.750
They should all relax a little bit more.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.910
You're far too relaxed.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.530
Hey! Klaus, Mimosa!

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.960
Long time no see!

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.630
A-A-A... A-Ashta!

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.420
Have you been well, Asta?

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.870
I've been working out and getting stronger!

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.700
I won't lose to you!

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.440
Really? I'm getting fired up!

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.680
Asta! L-L-Let's give it our all!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.050
Heck yeah! Hey, your face is a little red.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.660
You feelin' okay, Mimosa?

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.530
Y-Yes! I-I'm fine!

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.190
I'm nervous since I haven't seen 
him in so, so, so, so, so, so long!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.760
I see you're as loud as ever.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.200
Heya, Yuno! Weren't the hot 
springs great the other day?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.580
Yeah.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.620
H-Hot springs? What's this 
about hot springs, Yuno?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.150
I lost to you in that race up the volcano,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.210
but I won't lose to you today, Yuno!

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.240
Did you do some image training to 
prepare for when you fail today?

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.480
We wouldn't want you crying.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.020
What?!

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.840
Y-Yuno, what's this about hot springs?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.180
You seem to be having fun, Yuno.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.520
You too, Asta.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.160
What's this about hot springs?!

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.360
Asta! Yuno! Don't forget about me!

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.440
The Crimson Lion Kings 2nd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Leopold Vermillion

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.610
Leo!

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.440
I'm the one who's going to pass this exam!

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.580
It's me!

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.380
It's me.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.490
No, it's me!

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.620
Seriously, what's this about hot springs?!

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.920
Wow, am I ever nervous.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.620
I guess I just have to give it all I can.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.680
Who the hell are you? You've got some nerve 
wearing a Black Bulls robe, jerk face.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.960
Who gave you permission, huh?!

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.630
I dunno who you are, but wanna fight?

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.470
It's me, Finral!

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.970
I wanted to pump myself up, 
so I changed up my hairstyle!

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.780
You want to change your hairstyle? 
What brought this on?

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.770
Change of mood? Did you get dumped again?

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.310
No.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.500
Oh, of course. If you changed your 
hairstyle every time you got dumped,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.790
you wouldn't have any hair left.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.820
So mean...

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.920
In all seriousness, 
I wanted to pump myself up.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.680
You got it! I've got just the thing!

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.630
Whoa, wait! S-Stop!

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.430
So, yeah. I wanted a fresh start,
so I came here with a new hairstyle.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.360
Stop lyin'! Like that wuss 
would ever come here.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.300
I'm not lying, and I have seniority here!

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.140
"Wuss"?! That's so mean!

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.580
Oh, come on, you two! Stop being so mean!

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.280
It's obviously Finral!

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.140
Asta!

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.480
But I think that's a bit over the top.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.580
Yeah, it totally is!

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.920
The fact that you changed your hairstyle 
to pump yourself up is over the top!

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.440
Yeah, totally over the top.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.910
The fact that you frosted 
your tips is way over the top.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.430
Who cares if it's over the top?! 
"I'm only human!" by Finral.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.460
Ugh, they're so noisy. How embarrassing.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.460
Over the top! Over the top! Over the top!

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.720
The Silver Eagles 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight
Solid Silva

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.720
Solid...

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.890
Really? You came to embarrass us again?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.640
Give me a break.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.220
When you lose so miserably,
it tarnishes the Silva family name.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.980
There's still time. Hurry up and leave.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.060
Her magic was refined beyond belief,

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.570
and it had dignity.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.100
Your magic is so crude and unsightly, 
it's hard to believe you're royalty.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.740
And that's why you must surpass her.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.420
I-I'm not leaving!

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.640
N-Now, if you'll excuse me...

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.340
That's right. I'm not afraid anymore.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.010
I'm going to show my brothers 
and sister that I've grown!

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.930
You failure.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.220
Thank you all for gathering here today.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:30.690
28th Wizard King
Julius Novachrono

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:30.690
Wizard King's Attendant
Marx Francois

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.060
Now, let us begin the 
Royal Knights Selection Exam.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.520
I shall explain the details of the exam.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:41.590
The King of the Clover Kingdom
Augustus Kira Clover XIII

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.250
I am royalty, and this is the Royal 
Knights Selection Exam, after all.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.030
All of you, work harder to make 
me more popular with the people.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.660
The exam will consist

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:53.170
of a team competition: a magic 
crystal destruction battle tournament!

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.260
Team competition?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.750
Crystal?

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.260
What kind of rules does that have?

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.220
Huh? We aren't going 
head-to-head with each other?

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.810
Don't make the rules too complicated, okay?

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.270
The rules are simple!

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.360
Protect your own team's crystal, 
which will be placed in your area,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.880
and destroy the other team's crystal. 
The first team to do this wins!

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.950
You're right! That <i>is</i> simple! Heck yeah!

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.460
If no team is able to destroy a crystal 
within the 30-minute time limit,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.040
the one that has done the most 
damage to its target wins.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.060
Er... We've chosen this format because...

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.080
Er... Um...

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.340
Let's see...

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.130
I believe it's...

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.010
Ahem.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.580
In battles against the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.760
several squads will have to work together.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.560
He took the best part!

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.280
We thought this would be 
the best way to measure

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.990
the cooperation and strategy skills 
you'll need at times like that,

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.730
rather than simply fighting with brute force.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.100
Precisely!

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.990
Also, I bet I'll get to see lots of their 
non-combat spells this way, too.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.380
Ah, I see.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.620
Which means we'll have to team up 
with members of the other squads.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.870
Now, let us announce the teams.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.310
Let's see, I'm...

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.340
Mimosa Vermillion

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.340
Asta

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.340
Oh, hey! I'm on the same team as Mimosa!

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.570
I-I'm on the same team as Asta?!

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.830
I'm happy, I'm oh so happy,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.820
but I need to concentrate! 
I need to concentrate on the exam!

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.060
But again, what's this about hot springs?!

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.810
Asta

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.320
Mimosa Vermillion

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.320
And...

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.320
Xerx Lügner

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.150
Xerx Lügner? Who the heck is that?

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.880
Oh, my bad! I'm a little late!

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:55.250
But I bet our great Wizard King will 
forgive me for being a tiny bit late.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.290
Who's that guy?

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.640
I'm Xerx Lügner. It's a pleasure.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.550
I'm Xerx Lügner. It's a pleasure.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.450
Man, I just happened to run into 
a little old lady in distress.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.680
I helped her out, since I'm a Magic Knight,
 so I ended up a little late.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.000
My bad.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.860
I see. Is the old lady all right?

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.380
Yup! She's doing great!

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.160
Who is that guy?

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.830
Step away, you cur.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.570
Hey, come on, now. That's not very nice.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.460
What's the big idea?

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.910
That would be my line.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.740
Xerx Lügner? But that's—

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.510
Wizard King?

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.260
What are you trying to pull, you bastard?

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.890
How dare you act like that after arriving late?

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.810
The Wizard King is one of 
the only guys Sis respects!

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.190
What do you think you're 
doing to the Wizard King?!

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.490
Now, now. Calm down, everyone.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.640
Oh, right. I guess everyone 
respects the Wizard King.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.950
But I don't.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:19.210
Don't push your values on me, 
you worthless rabble.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.500
That's definitely Xerx's robe.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.410
Looks like he gave himself quite the 
makeover after that long expedition of his.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.890
This is no laughing matter, sir!

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.590
Well, it looks like we're on the same team,

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.890
so let's get along.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.150
Sure.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.400
That stinks!

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.940
The stinkiest bug in all the 
Clover Kingdom, the rainbow stinkbug.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.580
I'm being assaulted by 
the scent of the rainbow!

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.320
Are you actually trying 
to get along with me?!

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.080
Of course not.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.800
Why would I bother getting along 
with an airhead with a moronic face,

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.630
who's a hyperactive dumbass, too?

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.480
You're just a noisy shrimp.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.720
That's pretty smelly.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.870
Why, you...

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.860
You jerk with a cool-looking 
thing wrapped around your face!

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.730
Why are you complimenting him?

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.420
Are you even trying at all?!

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.560
Looks like all you can do is try.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.030
Didn't you come here to get 
chosen as a Royal Knight?!

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.240
Me?

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.540
I came here to make fun of you people.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.080
Huh?!

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.630
Was Vice Captain Xerx always like that?

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.330
He's not at all like the rumors.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.820
I heard he was the Saint of Pure Ice,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.010
but he's been stationed in the borderlands, 
so only a few people actually know him.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.560
Are you really okay with this?

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.160
Yup. It looks fun.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.160
Pardon me!

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.820
I don't wanna be on the 
same team as this guy!

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:13.110
Now, now... We're all Magic Knights here,
 so let's all just get along.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.620
Hey... Haven't you forgotten about me?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.620
All right, everyone. 
Have you confirmed your teams?

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.620
C Team
Sol Marron   Magna Swing   Kirsch Vermillion

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.740
Who the heck is this tiny delinquent?

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.840
You're just too big!

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.670
What'd you say?! Don't make me smack 
those lame glasses off your face!

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:37.230
What?! How about I bury you in the 
ground to make you a little shorter?!

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.900
My attribute is actually earth!

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.060
Just try and bury me!

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.640
Ugh! Men are so stupid!

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.650
P Team
En Ringard   Noelle Silva   Yuno

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:53.360
So I'm with the noisy little 
girl who's always with Asta.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.610
Well, aren't you cute?

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.270
But just so you know, Yuno belongs to me.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.080
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.010
I'm on the same team as the lofty 
guy who's Asta's childhood friend?

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.780
Hey, are you listening? Don't even 
think about getting in the way!

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.550
If you dare hold Yuno back, 
I'll make you regret it!

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.630
Ugh, shut up already!

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.640
K Team
Puli Angel   Luck Voltia   Klaus Lunettes

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.990
H-How can this be?

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.430
I'm on the same team as the 
self-centered Luck, the Cheery Berserker?

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.770
Pleased to meet ya!

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.320
Let's work together and do our best!

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.030
Huh? Work together?

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.320
S-Sure.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.160
We're gonna be great teammates!

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.160
E Team
Finral Roulacase   Leopold Vermillion   Hamon Caseus

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.580
He's laughing.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.090
And so is he...

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.210
I-Is this team going to be okay?

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.010
O Team
Dimitri Blint   Solid Silva   Alecdora Sandler

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.310
I'm not a fan of yours, but you do 
have skill, so I guess I can live with it.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.850
Don't go running off to act on your own.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.280
All right, let's head over to the main stage.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.020
Cob, I'm counting on you.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.270
Magic Knight Who Accompanies the Wizard King
Cob Portaport

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.270
Yes, yes, yes, sir!

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.610
Whoa! Spatial magic!

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.160
Right this way! Have fun.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.230
This is the stage for the crystal 
destruction tournament?!

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.090
It's huge!

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.480
The battlefield has a wide 
range of different areas.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.280
Use them to display your 
powers to the fullest.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.100
Got it!

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:47.100
And here's the tournament chart, 
which we determined by lottery in advance.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.370
Battle wins and losses won't directly 
affect whether you pass or fail.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.360
That said, the more you win, the more 
you'll be able to show your true skills.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.610
Since you have the chance, 
I hope you all strive to win.

Noelle

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.700
I'm facing off with Solid's 
team right off the bat?

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:08.280
I'll happily finish you off myself, Noelle.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.960

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.960

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.210
If we win the first round, 
I'll be facing off with Langris.

Xerx

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:13.810

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.880
Noelle

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.240
So we'd take on Yuno's 
team in the finals, huh?

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.760
I'm going to win until then, no matter what!

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.890
No, I'm gonna win this whole thing!

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.760
All right, we're about to begin round one.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.190
Whoa! And we're up first!

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.150
You may attack your opponents!

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.900
Though I'm sure this goes without saying, 
make sure you guys don't kill anyone!

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.650
Let me stand out some more!

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:45.140
We've got a high-level recovery mage on 
standby, so fight to your hearts' content!

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:51.250
Oh, hey! It's Owen! Clover Kingdom's 
super-famous sketchy doctor!

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:56.210
My arms are all better now! 
I'm sorry I worried you!

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:07.780
Yoohoo! The beautiful ladies of the 
Black Bulls came to cheer you on!

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.060
La!

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.890
I'll do my best cheering!

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.070
Thank you so much, ladies.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.270
But are you sure it was okay 
for all of you to come at once?

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.990
The captain gave us a heartfelt send-off.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.800
Oh, really? That's our captain!

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.990
We're actually just about to start.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.380
Oh? So Asta's team is the first round?

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.710
Well, that's definitely fitting for him.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.060
Asta! You'd better show them who's boss!

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.490
La! La!

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.920
I can't see, la!

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.480
At this rate, I'm going to miss my 
meal-saving prince's heroic deeds!

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.930
La?!

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.890
All right. Are both teams ready?

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.690
Yup.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.780
I'm getting hyped!

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.330
Petit Clover

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.320
Petit Clover!

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.840
What's This
 About Hot Springs!?

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.290
What's This About Hot Springs?!

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.840
Heya, Yuno! Weren't the hot 
springs great the other day?

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.880
Yeah.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.850
H-Hot springs? What's this 
about hot springs, Yuno?

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.350
Soon.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.300
What do you mean, "soon"? Is it 
a secret just between you two?

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.100
Your own private hot springs?

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.690
The water's great!

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.490
Yeah.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.530
They bathe together...

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.350
Does it itch anywhere?

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.680
A bit below the back of my right ear.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.690
This must be it!

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.910
It is.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.910
They shampoo each other's hair!

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.890
So what did I write?

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:19.930
Tatoes.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.100
Correct!

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.780
It's your turn next, Yuno.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.500
Then they draw words on 
each other's backs!

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.510
Hot springs? Hot springs?

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:34.390
Is she okay? Looks like she got overheated
 just thinking about the hot springs.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.300
She must love hot springs.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.520
Hot springs...

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.020
Our battle is about to begin.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.960
I, Mimosa Vermillion, will do my 
best not to get in anyone's way!

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.820
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 74: 
"Flower of Resolution."

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:54.000
Page 74
 Flower of Resolution

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.740
I will make my flower bloom.
