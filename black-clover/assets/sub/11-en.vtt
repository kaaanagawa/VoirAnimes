00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.640
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.970
How'd you like that?
Some lowly commoners just won.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.220
How'd you like that, damn it?!

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.110
Asta!

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.320
Honestly, he's so ridiculous.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.360
You finally awake, you jerk?

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.660
So my magic is sealed.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.790
You're going to spill everything 
to the Magic Knights,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.730
including who you guys are 
and what your motives are!

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.040
I refuse.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.250
It appears the end has come.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.940
Ice Magic: Ice Burial.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.480
Talk about resolve.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.150
You idiot!

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.860
What do...

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.860
What do you think life is?!

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.520
What Happened on a Certain 
Day in the Castle Town

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.760
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.400
I know, yeah I know

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.680
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.650
I dreamed it all my life

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.420
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.570
Don't care how much I fall

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.060
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.300
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.470
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.850
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.100
Someday I will write the next page

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.610
You are my hope

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.360
Like that page from someday

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.690
I was able to meet you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.660
I call this a miracle

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Sounds like you guys went through hell!

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.610
Why does he sound so happy about that?

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.040
Someone even died.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.010
Hey, Captain, I don't think 
this is a laughing matter.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.600
Being depressed isn't going to 
bring Old Man Seihi back. Right?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.270
Yes, sir! It's just as you say, sir.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.990
Old Man Seihi liked to see 
everyone happy and energetic.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.290
Come on. You guys should be laughing, too.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.030
Come on!

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.900
Louder!

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.670
You, too, Lady Noe!

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.250
That's how it should be.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.130
What happened to
Old Man Seihi really is a shame,

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.990
but you three were able 
to protect the villagers.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.300
Be proud of that.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.310
Well done. Great job, you idiots.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.710
Yes, sir!

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.480
Thanks.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.230
What's that?

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.330
You moron! You don't even know 
the Magic Knights' salute?!

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.620
Take a good look!

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.370
These fingers symbolize the clover.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.790
Go on, give it a try.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.180
Yes, sir!

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.960
Well done!

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.710
We're back.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.220
Great job, you three.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.280
Miss Vanessa! Finral!

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.470
Captain, we went to the
Magic Investigation Department.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.140
Good. Did you find anything out?

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.410
Who the heck's behind all this?!

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.450
I'll find their hideout and raid it!

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.460
I'll beat the crap out of 
the guy who got away, too!

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.940
Well, you see,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.450
they investigated the item he left behind,

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.620
but still don't have a clue.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.950
How useless can they be?

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.540
You fools!

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.150
Stop breaking stuff!

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.010
Sorry!

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.420
But that pocket watch is pretty nice.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.370
Yes, and from what you said 
about how they were acting,

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.640
they were all of very high status.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.670
So they're royalty or nobles.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.060
Oh, who's this little guy? He's adorable.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.780
How's it adorable?!

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.500
I-It <i>is</i> adorable!

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.520
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.570
Why, you little!

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.380
Hey, come here.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.540
You ugly little bird! 
I'll turn you into fried chicken!

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.170
I won't let you turn him into fried chicken!

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.700
Say your prayers!

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.090
Don't you dare!

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.370
Are you two trying to break the building?!

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.430
We're sorry!

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.680
You're the one breaking everything, though.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.650
All right, listen up.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.290
It doesn't matter if the ones behind 
this are royalty or nobility.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.310
We're going to let the 
Investigation Department

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.440
take care of this, 
and we'll wait for their report.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.700
More importantly, I've got some good news.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.970
Good news?

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.200
Wanna hear it?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.040
Of course!

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.750
Your actions have been acknowledged 
by the Wizard King himself!

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.750
The Wizard King?!

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.260
You've been given a star!

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.300
Whoa, seriously?!

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.450
All right!

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.780
Yeah!

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.890
Wow.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.770
Heck yeah!

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.270
Congrats.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.100
So, what are stars?

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.590
Don't get so excited if you 
don't know what they are!

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.440
Stars are awarded by the Wizard 
King based on our performance.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.610
What are they good for?

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.580
Well... They're like an honor.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.860
Honor?!

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.390
That's right, Asta! Honor!

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.410
It's a badge of honor for a man!

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.980
There's a lady here, too.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.210
It's a badge of honor for a man and a woman!

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.840
That makes no sense.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.840
The various Magic Knights squads
 compete to get the most stars.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.940
The number of stars indicates 
how much work a squad has done.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.350
I see!

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.550
Speaking of, the Golden Dawn is currently 
at the top with seventy stars.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.230
Seventy?!

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.830
What about us? How many 
do the Black Bulls have?

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.190
We can't lose to the Golden Dawn!

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.200
We...

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.000
finally have a nice, even negative thirty.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.190
Negative?!

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.330
What?

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.870
We're finally only a hundred 
away from the Golden Dawn.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.110
A hundred?!

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:17.240
It's going to take forever to catch 
up and beat them! Damn it, Yuno!

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.850
Not happening.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.060
Should I really be in this squad?

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.150
One other thing.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.780
Here's your pay for this month.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.200
Huh?

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.950
It's money! There's at 
least 200,000 yuls here!

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.740
Thanks!

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.540
Thanks, Captain! I'm going to eat 
lots of yummy things with this!

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.520
Yeah, eat up.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.450
Hey, Captain! How much would 
it take for you to fight me?

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.780
Well? Well?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.950
I won't.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.550
Aw, come on!

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.980
I was thinking about buying new clothes 
for my goddess, my little sister, Marie.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.930
What do you think will look best on her?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.180
Don't ask me.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.600
No idea.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.020
Tomorrow's gonna be a day off, 
so don't let it go to waste.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.910
I'm gonna go on tons of dates!

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.210
Do whatever you want.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.020
Thanks!

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.220
Thank you for everything, Captain.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.960
We should all go out somewhere and 
have fun. What do you guys think?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.820
This isn't much.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.500
You moron!

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.810
You could buy at least ten years' 
worth of tatoes with this money!

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.720
Tatoes? What are those?

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.720
Potatoes from Hage Village that taste 
bland and have a questionable texture.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.010
That sounds awful.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.910
They aren't! Sister Lily can 
make anything taste good!

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.850
And who's that?

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.310
The woman I'm going to marry someday!

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.610
What?

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.730
But aren't sisters women of the cloth? 
I don't think they can get married.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.990
I-It'll work out somehow! 
I'll go beyond all limitations!

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.450
Are you stupid?

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.230
Congrats on your first payday!

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.430
What do you plan to do with it?

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.250
I haven't decided.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.070
What about you, little boy?

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.250
I-I'm going to send some money 
back to the church in Hage.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.970
That's a great idea, Asta! 
That's the manly thing to do!

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.830
Right?! Do you send money back, too?

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.490
Of course I do! But...

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.890
But?

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.480
Only after I've increased it a hundredfold!

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.730
You never learn, do you?

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.820
A man's gotta take risks!

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.790
By "man," you must mean "moron."

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.130
Sending some money back is 
fine, but don't send it all.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.510
Use a little bit for yourself.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.330
Sh-Should I?

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.450
But what should I use it for?

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.350
Let's go shopping in the 
castle town tomorrow.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.580
You, too.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.750
Shopping?

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.050
I'll take you both.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.690
Sister Lily, how are you doing?

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.670
I'm doing well.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.150
All of the kind senior squad members 
are taking good care of me.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.940
Asta, stand right here.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.540
What are we doing?

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.440
Don't move.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.860
Flame Magic:

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.200
Exploding...

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.750
Fireball!

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.530
Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.460
I told you not to move!

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.130
I didn't!

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.060
Also, I did really well on my first mission,

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.420
and received a star from the Wizard King 
for my excellent performance.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:55.160
At this rate, I might be able to 
become the Wizard King by next month.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.520
I want to become the Wizard King and make 
this a world where everyone can be happy.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.570
Then I'll come for you, so please marry me.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.750
"Oh, I just had my first payday, 
so I'm sending you the money."

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.740
I'm done!

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.290
This is an awesome letter, 
if I do say so myself.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.810
I wonder if Sister Lily 
will be moved to tears.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.590
The Wizard King...

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.130
The Wizard King, huh?

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.800
I wonder what he's like...

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.080
Have you ever been to the castle town?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.370
I haven't.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.910
I guess royals and nobles wouldn't 
really have reason to go very often.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.130
How about you, little boy?

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.280
I just passed through when I went to 
take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.250
Then let's have a lot of fun today.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.870
Hey, stop touching me.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.730
I can't help it! Do you want me to fall?

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.430
I can't stop thinking about 
him for some reason. Ugh...

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.900
Again?!

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:18.150
The Clover Kingdom is split between the 
Noble Realm, where royalty and nobility live,

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:23.690
Saussy

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:23.690
Spade Kingdom

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:23.690
Forsaken Realm

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:23.690
Rayaka

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:23.690
Heart
 Kingdom

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:23.690
Common Realm

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:23.690
Noble Realm

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:23.690
Diamond
 Kingdom

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.850
the Common Realm, where the commoners live,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.690
and the Forsaken Realm, 
where the peasants live.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.780
The Castle Town of Kikka, 
where Asta and Yuno took

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.200
the Magic Knights Entrance Exam, 
is in the Common Realm.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.490
It's still amazing!

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.940
It's very lively.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.540
I hope I can bring Sister Lily and the 
kids from the church here someday.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:55.930
What about me?!

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.580
Oh?

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.140
Marie, my goddess, I'll be there soon.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.280
I want to see your smiling face as soon 
as possible. I can't contain myself.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.230
Mister!

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.420
That voice...

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.560
So you've come again.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.340
I have.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.810
I'm not going to lose this month!

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.270
I won't, either!

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.290
The ultra ultimate super 
large serving of everything!

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.690
I dare you to eat all of it!

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.940
Thanks for the nummies!

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.620
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.950
I'm getting heartburn just watching her.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.770
Do you have some time, miss?

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.540
Want to have some tea with me?

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.960
Do I look like I have time?

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.880
You can bring your kids along. 
I know a great place—

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.810
You actually think they're my kids?!

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.590
They're my brother and sister!

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.050
I have to hurry home so we can open the shop.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.940
I don't have any time to mess around.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.610
Man, I love tough young ladies.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.900
Miss, want to have some fun with me?

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.680
Don't get too far ahead, little boy.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.110
I'm so excited!

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.110
Don't you two want to buy anything?

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.870
There are just so many things, 
I don't know what to get.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.750
I don't really...

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.540
Hey, those robes... They're Magic Knights.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.120
That mark... Ugh, it's the Black Bulls!

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.430
That's the lush witch Vanessa.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.250
Are the cute girl next to her and 
the little kid also Black Bulls?

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.100
It's probably best to stay away.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.700
They're starting to get a bit restless.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.230
It's fine. Magic Knights being 
in town helps deter crime.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.060
Not to mention, some fine 
gentlemen might approach us.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.410
I've bought some healing herbs,

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.280
as well as some shique ointment, 
which acts as a poison antidote.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.750
That should do it.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.690
I bought what I needed, so why don't 
we go somewhere a bit more quiet?

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:30.960
Somewhere quiet?

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.700
I know just the place.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.040
This way.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.420
That way?

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.310
Isn't this just some alley?

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.860
It's a dead end.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.050
Huh?!

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.590
Come now.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.710
Whoa!

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:09.150
Black Market

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.830
This is the Black Market.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.690
The Black Market?

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:17.260
It's a bit dangerous, but they have 
some very effective magical items.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.070
Hey, Vanessa. I got some good stuff in.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.560
Hey! I'll take a look later.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.190
Awesome!

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.620
Oh, you don't seem too excited.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.800
Well, no.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.620
I guess I can't blame you.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.200
Royals and nobles won't set foot 
in here because of their prejudices.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.370
But you can't control your 
magical powers yet, right?

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.190
Th-That's right. Why?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.210
They have items that can help you 
control your magical powers here.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.970
If you can find an item that's a good
 fit for you, and adjust your powers,

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.590
you might be able to control them.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.970
Control my powers...

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.720
Why don't we take a look around?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.850
S-Sure.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.290
It's really lively over there.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.730
You two are a bit too 
young to go in there yet.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.400
Amateurs shouldn't spend too much time 
in there, or it could ruin their lives.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.320
All right!

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.820
Let's do this! Let's do this!

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.740
I'm going to make my paycheck
 grow a hundredfold!

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.220
Hey, I know that guy!

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.460
Damn it, I lost again! Bah-ha...

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.460
I can see the future.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.470
Bah-ha! That old lady's strong.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:45.520
I really shouldn't be wasting time 
here, anyway. I have work to do.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.420
Well, the job's to catch a purse-snatcher.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.490
Is that even a job for a Magic Knight?

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.530
Bah-ha...

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.450
But the captain would get 
real scary if I refused.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:06.290
You got a problem with that?
I'll slice you in two!

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:12.120
Bah-ha! I finally managed 
to join the Magic Knights,

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.990
but it's the Green Praying Mantises.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.880
I'm a praying mantis. A frickin' bug.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.120
All I do every day is run errands.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.550
When I finally got an actual mission, 
I got used as bait and almost died.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.350
I'm constipated and my hair's thinning.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.540
Bah-ha, damn it.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.310
Hey, she's cute!

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.360
What about this? You could probably 
use this to stabilize your powers.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.460
It looks so cheesy.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.780
Well, just give it a try.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.070
Bah-ha?!

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.340
You shouldn't have been walking there!

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.850
Bah-ha! Well, well,
 what brings you two down here?

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:13.420
The Black Market is no place 
for you lovely ladies. Bah-ha!

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.300
Did you get lost?

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.150
As an elite member of the Magic Knights, 
I shall guide you out of here.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.370
Get lost, you insect.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.860
Bah-ha...

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.160
Hey! I found something really cool!

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.870
You didn't actually buy that, did you?

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.490
It talks!

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:34.670
So you did.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.560
Look!

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.430
We are hoomans.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.250
See?

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.840
What, exactly?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.600
Bah-ha!

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.450
Th-That's...

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.420
Huh? Hey, you're Bah-ha!

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.360
It's Sekke! Bah-ha!

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.230
How've you been, Bah-ha?

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.390
The name's Bah-ha! No, wait, Sekke!

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.170
Who's that?

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.730
I took the Entrance Exam with him.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.650
Ah, you're a member of the 
Green Praying Mantises.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:06.600
He's with two beautiful girls?! Wait, no...

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.540
They're both members of 
the Black Bulls, too.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:14.340
Asta, you bastard! 
You're making me jealous.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:20.830
Besides, it's all your fault that 
I ended up in the Green Praying Mantises.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.670
Bah-ha! You infuriating bah-hastard!

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.190
Th-Thief!

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.940
My winnings! Stop!

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:58.980
No one can escape from here

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:05.500
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:13.600
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:20.610
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.480
I've thought many times

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.150
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:34.870
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:41.630
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:48.880
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:55.770
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:00.660
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:19.290
Petit Clover

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.310
Petit Clover!

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.790
Sekke's Bah-Ha Seminar

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.180
Sekke's Bah-Ha Seminar!

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.290
Bah-ha!

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.050
Bah-ha.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.540
Wrong! It's...

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.800
Bah-ha!

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.640
Bah-ha!

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.300
Asta, you have yet to learn 
the ways of the bah-ha.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.800
Bah-ha!

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.590
The ways of the bah-ha?!

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.150
Bah-ha! This is my chance 
to make a name for myself!

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.180
I'm going to catch the thief and 
get praise from the Wizard King, ha!

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.220
<i>Black Clover</i>, Page 12:
"The Wizard King Saw."

Page 10
The Wizard King Saw

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.700
Not giving up is my bah-ha!
