WEBVTT

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.010
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.610
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.560
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.250
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.920
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.790
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.620
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.500
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.810
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.020
We need to reassure them that the Magic 
Knights have the strength to protect them,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.270
and raise the morale of the captains 
and Magic Knights, too.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.050
So that we can face the impending threat 
of the Spade Kingdom and the devil.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.320
Um... If I may, what exactly 
are you planning to do?

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.250
I'm going to have the 
captains fight each other.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.640
Ahem...

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.820
We will now commence

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.100
a team battle between 
Magic Knights Squad Captains!

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.250
Captain of the Purple Orcas
Kaiser Granvorka

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.250
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.250
Captain of the Black Bulls
Yami Sukehiro

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.250
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises
Jack the Ripper

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.510
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Fuegoleon Vermillion

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.510
Captain of the Blue Rose Knights
Charlotte Roselei

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.510
Captain of the Golden Dawn
William Vangeance

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.510
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
Dorothy Unsworth

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.530
Ooh!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.030
Begin!

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.290
Clash! The Battle of the 
Magic Knights Squad Captains

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.000
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom!

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.760
Allow your beloved king to 
explain the rules personally!

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.760
The time limit is 30 minutes!

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.670
The team that destroys 
the enemy team's crystal

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.270
while protecting theirs will be the winner!

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.020
This match between the captains

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.520
is being broadcast throughout 
the entire kingdom!

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.280
A Village Out in the Boonies: Hage

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.220
Behold as the Magic Knights Squad Captains

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.530
Saussy Village

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.100
that I personally spilled blood, 
sweat, and tears to train

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.100
battle it out before your very eyes!

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.370
Also,

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.990
due to unforeseen circumstances, the 
Captain of the Aqua Deer, Rill Boismortier,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.790
will not be participating in the match.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.110
Master Rill, those melancholy sighs 
are a sign that you're in love,

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.560
and the first step into adulthood!

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.600
Miss... Who are you? Where are you now?

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.320
Thanks, Marx.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.320
Everyone in the kingdom
 is able to watch this match

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.990
because of your communication magic.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.970
I'm glad to hear it...

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.090
How long do I have to wear this disguise?

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.610
Ah, Julius! Do not force yourself too much.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.960
Because this is a prime opportunity 
for me to gain the favor of the citizens

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.090
without Julius getting in the way!

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.910
Oh, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.240
We should probably figure something 
else out for Owen's sake, too.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.240
How are you feeling? 
How are you feeling right now?

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.320
World Tree Magic: Magic Tree Descends!

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.590
Do not touch the World Tree Magic!

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.870
You're starting off with that?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.890
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.090
Not bad, Beanpole Monster.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.350
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked—

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.790
You're mine!

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.420
I guess this was never going to be simple.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.130
Indeed.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.930
Then we'll just have to follow our plan.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.290
Understood.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.650
I know we talked about doing a joint 
training session with the Black Bulls,

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.890
but to think I'd end up 
having to fight Yami...

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.510
No, don't think about that now.
Keep calm! Keep calm!

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.940
Let's do our best, Charlotte!

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.950
O-Of course!

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.950
I don't remember the last 
time I had so much fun.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.540
You're not getting away!

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.410
Something, something, moth to the flame...

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.400
Hold it!

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.100
You accursed foreigner and former commoner...

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.660
Let us strengthen our defense of our crystal.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.980
Where ya hidin'?

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.430
Where do you think you're going,
 Beanpole Monster?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.500
Huh? Don't order me around.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.250
This sure is a prime spot to get attacked.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.000
Who cares if it's a trap or not?

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.760
It won't matter if we slice them all up!

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.780
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.040
You should know that this spell is 
not powerful enough to defeat me!

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.290
And you should know as well...

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.450
that I wouldn't run away without a plan.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.560
In that case...

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.140
I shall burn you and your 
meddlesome plan to ash!

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.570
Sir Nozel, I shall assist you.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.860
When we previously fought, despite having 
vortex magic amplified by the elf's mana,

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.580
I was no match for Sir Fuegoleon.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.330
I will now get my revenge!

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.080
Hmph.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.540
I have a plan. Follow my lead.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.840
I'm getting used to being 
the king's attendant.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.250
After the amazing things I've done, 
I'm sure the citizens are all wondering,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.600
"Who's that really hot guy 
next to the king?" For sure!

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.430
Swoon.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:37.710
Sekke, if by any chance the captains' spells 
come this way, protect me with your life.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.740
Bah-ha?!

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.870
Yeah, right! That ain't bah-happening!

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.060
You two seem to be pretty 
good at poking and prodding

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.290
while keeping your distance!

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.370
Dark Magic: Black Hole!

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.200
This is...

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:25.660
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:25.660
Severing Magic: Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.340
Mercury Creation Magic: 
Silver Star of Execution!

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:41.620
Sorry about that. You guys were hiding 
in the forest, and we sorta leveled it.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.430
That's quite all right.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.180
As long as we made you use up some magic.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.450
Hold it!

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.700
Yoo-hoo!

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.330
Yami!

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.480
Beautiful!

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.150
Our captain lured Captain Yami into 
the dream world... How amazing!

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:44.020
But alas, the communication magic 
doesn't extend into the dream world.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.220
Sadly, we and the rest of the citizens 
will not be able to see this

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.490
beautiful battle take place!

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.750
Ah...

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.260
Being so beautiful is such a burden...

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.260
Welcome to Dream Magic: Glamour World!

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Sit back and relax until 
the time limit is up,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.100
Yami dear.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.780
I've heard from my squad 
that if you fall asleep here,

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.770
you won't be able to go back outside.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.240
And whatever you think up appears here.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.520
It sure does!

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.280
In that case...

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.780
Outdoor bath!

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.280
Sushi on a boat!

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.470
Daiginjo sake!

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.350
Stuff I can't imagine isn't 
going to show up here.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.390
Aw, you really got my hopes up, too.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.550
In that case...

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.550
Exit!

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.870
The little elf that took over my body

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.560
had a rough time playing the 
word association game before.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.060
I've made sure I won't make the same mistake.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.390
Guess that just means I'm gonna 
have to face you head-on.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.070
That's more like it.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.570
Then...

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.570
How about this?

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.840
Dark Cloaked...

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.340
Dark Cloaked...

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.840
...Lightless Slash!

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.100
Howdy doody!

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.850
I'm the great Captain of 
the Black Bulls, Yami! Yar!

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.600
Is that how I sound in her damn head?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.570
The foreigner's mana disappeared.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:48.860
He must've been captured by the dream magic.
 He won't be back out for a while.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We need to avoid any more setbacks.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.620
We will take care of him right here and now!

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.120
Leave this to me!

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.170
In most cases, I would have the 
upper hand against mercury magic.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.380
But because he's constantly using 
an immense amount of mana,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.410
this cage is instantly repaired.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.910
Though I'd like to take 
down the spellcasters,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.330
they're both outside the vortex magic.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.140
An excellent strategy!

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.640
Brother!

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.550
Thanks to the combination of wide-range 
silver magic and vortex magic,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.650
they have the advantage 
against Captain Fuegoleon.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.910
So this is what it looks 
like when captains fight...

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.240
No...

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.540
My brother's just getting warmed up!

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.760
What is he going to do with all those flames?

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.760
He can't be...

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.760
Though the flames won't 
reach us, the heat will...

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.020
But what is he...

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.590
How hot is he planning to...

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.790
Where did Sir Fuegoleon go?

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.310
He used Salamander as a decoy 
to get by our mana detection.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.060
I'm not done yet!

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.320
Howdy doody...

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.500
I mean, we all know a copy 
could never beat the original.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.580
Nay! You are still within the caster's spell!

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.090
The best thing about copies is 
you can just keep making them!

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.090
It doesn't matter how many 
fakes you send after... me...

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.600
Aw... shit.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.850
Dark Cloaked... Dark Cloaked... Dark 
Cloaked... Dark Cloaked... Dark Cloaked...

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.610
...Lightless Slash!

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.240
Kaiser!

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.120
It's weak, but I sense Sir Jack's mana!

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.700
Things are grim...

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.990
If we can hit him with even 
a single magical attack,

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.130
we still have a chance.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.270
So you still have enough 
strength to keep struggling.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.880
Mercury Magic: Silver Shining Regal Spear!

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.910
I cannot hold out much longer!

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.410
After all that talk...

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.910
Is this all you've got, you former commoner?

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.180
Well done, Yami dear! 
You're tougher than I thought!

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.680
But you're probably nearing your limit now.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.280
My limit, eh?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.190
Guess you've still got a lot 
to learn about me...

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.190
Little Miss Pointy Hat.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.690
I'll show you the spell I used back then...

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.700
when I truly surpassed my limits!

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.270
Are you still functional?

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.200
Don't compare me to the small fry!

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.200
We'll have no other chances. 
We're ending this now.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.500
Who do you think you're ordering 
around, Mr. Sparkle Pants?

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.210
Now!

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.400
Not happening.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:50.150
As a royal who protects the masses, 
and as the Captain of the Silver Eagles,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.630
I cannot let myself lose so pathetically!

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.300
I'm sure you're watching, my squad!

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.130
There is nothing the flames 
of the Crimson Lion Kings

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.760
cannot incinerate!

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.680
Ooh!

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.130
I'm a Magic Knights Squad Captain, too!

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:22.030
I have to get strong enough that I can 
trap even a devil in my dream world!

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.750
Y'all are the image of the past me, 
who Miss Pointy Hat imagined me to be.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.450
But I've already...

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.540
grown beyond that!

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.460
Mana Zone...

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.810
Dark Cloaked...

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.550
Dimension Slash ~ Equinox!

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.860
Wow, that was such a fantastic battle!

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.610
I can't believe I got to see an 
exchange of magic like that!

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.540
Especially that last one!

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.870
To think that Yami's Dimension Slash ended 
up slicing through both teams' crystals!

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.930
You made us do all that, and it's a draw?

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.720
All because you were too busy 
playing around in a dream!

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.590
Those fools are beyond saving.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.920
That's because you guys had Golden Weird 
Mask Guy sucking up all of your damn mana!

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:26.890
I'm surprised they have the strength to 
keep arguing after going all-out like that.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.330
What? You want a piece of me, meathead?

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.050
Aw... Yami dear wouldn't 
let up in Glamour World,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.050
What? Come at me!

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.640
so I didn't get to be on the broadcast at all.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.650
Y-Yami dear?! What happened 
between these two?!

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.750
It was amazing! To think your magic 
still had so many possibilities!

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.700
I'm almost certain he just wanted 
to see the captains use their magic.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.760
You did great too, Marx!

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.160
I'm glad the whole kingdom got to see 
this battle between the captains.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.550
And I'm sure the citizens are 
relieved to know they have

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.170
amazing Magic Knights such as 
yourselves protecting this kingdom.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.670
And I'm sure after seeing 
all of you captains... no,

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.770
Grand Magic Knights in action, 
your squad members' image of you will change.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.940
The battle against the Spade Kingdom 
and the devil is drawing near.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:23.410
Use this battle to propel you and your 
Magic Knights to even greater heights!

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.470
Yes, sir!

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.420
Petit Clover

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.400
Petit Clover!

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.920
Yami and Yami

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.380
Yami and Yami.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.230
A-Ahem... Yami, it seems that dream 
magic gave you quite a bit of trouble.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.940
What exactly were you doing in there?

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.680
Oh, that.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.940
Another me showed up, 
and he was stupidly strong.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.960
Another Yami, you say?!

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.930
You've got the Sexy Yami.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.990
And the Wild Yami.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.590
Which do you prefer?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.960
Huh?

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.040
The days pass... Time continues to flow.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.000
Even I cannot turn back time.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.950
Tomorrow will always come.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:50.380

To Tomorrow!

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.340

will carry it into tomorrow.
