00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.670
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.280
The Wizard King Saw, Continued

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.740
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.420
I know, yeah I know

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.660
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.000
I dreamed it all my life

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.470
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.550
Don't care how much I fall

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.020
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.560
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.490
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.870
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.120
Someday I will write the next page

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.620
You are my hope

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.380
Like that page from someday

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.710
I was able to meet you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.670
I call this a miracle

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.060
So these are Hage's famous tatoes.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.090
I'm not sure if they'll be to your liking, 
Lord Salim, but help yourself.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.510
They're so dry and flaky. I've never had 
anything that made me so thirsty before.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.300
But... it's delicious.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.510
Oh, thank goodness!

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.100
It would seem that you're 
a splendid cook, Miss Lily.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.320
I'm not all that good, really...

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.130
Please, eat as much as you'd like.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.400
You too, Klaus, Mimosa.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.840
Right...

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.240
Why must a noble such as myself 
eat this unknown thing?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.610
Oh, this makes me so thirsty.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.660
Yes, isn't it wonderful?

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.920
Both Yuno and Asta sent us money 
from their first pay as Magic Knights.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.820
And then... We were able to 
buy so many tatoes that we can

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.200
feed the children as much as 
they want to eat every day.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.640
Actually, couldn't you feed us 
something besides tatoes, too?

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.570
Don't be picky! Look how big 
Yuno got from eating tatoes!

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.020
Yuno, it's wonderful that you're sending 
money home when you're just a newcomer.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.990
It's nothing.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.970
Yuno, thank you for everything.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.370
You've helped us out a lot.
And not just with the tatoes.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.470
We were able to plug up 
that hole in the floor.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.200
We even dug up a well in the yard.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.940
Thanks, Yuno!

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.170
Thanks!

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.960
Asta's been sending money, too?

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.210
Yes. To think he'd be able to do that...

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.500
How much is Asta sending?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.990
Huh? Um...

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.440
Whisper, whisper, whisper...

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.110
I win!

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.860
Starting next month,

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.140
I'll send all of my pay.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.280
Huh?! Really, you don't have to.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.360
We'll be fine for a while 
with the amount you sent us.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.580
I appreciate the thought.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.110
I'll send it!

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.710
R-Really? Thanks...

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.540
Lord Salim, we should be on our way.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.200
Oh, it won't hurt to stay a bit longer.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.730
In the future, it'll be important for nobles
to have more knowledge of the world.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.240
Miss Lily, may I have some more water?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.750
Of course.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.630
Oh, it's empty. I'll go get some more.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.760
I'll do it.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.010
It's fine. You relax, Yuno.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.940
Oh, one moment.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.610
It's chilly at night.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.970
Thank you very much.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.610
I guess you're a gentleman.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.160
Oh, it's nothing. My body 
just acted on its own.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.350
It's just proper etiquette for a noble.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.830
Yuno...

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.380
What happened?

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.020
Where's Sister?

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.670
That brooch...

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.320
It's the same one the men who were 
after Lord Salim were wearing.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.790
H-How awful!

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.210
Of course! It must be because 
I put my robe on her.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.880
Miss Lily was taken instead of me!

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.360
Yes, that must be it.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.290
Is Sister going to be okay? Is she, Yuno?

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.890
Yuno...

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.160
Don't worry. I'll go save her.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.390
Yuno! I'll go, too!

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.320
Me, too!

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.650
Me, too!

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.000
No.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.210
I need all of you to stay here.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.530
I'll be fine on my own.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.070
Wait.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.310
Our mission is to escort Lord Salim.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.560
We don't know when the enemy 
will come after him again.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.890
We must leave at once.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.840
B-But...

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.290
But Sister...

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.350
Hey, Four-eyes!

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.810
Who are you calling "Four-eyes"?

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.040
Um, Four... Er, Klaus, um...

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.570
You stay out of this, Mimosa.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.170
Yuno, I'm sure you're 
worried about the sister,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.300
but let's leave her to the authorities 
who have jurisdiction here.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.790
We're leaving immediately.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.850
Let us go, Lord Salim.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.200
Yuno, Mimosa.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.330
Yes, sir.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.550
Yuno.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.610
I'm not leaving.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.890
Huh?

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.020
We must fulfill our mission.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.810
Disobeying an order is a crime.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.950
Even so, I'm going to go save her.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.810
Yuno!

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.940
How dare he...

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.950
You're confusing recklessness 
with courage, Yuno.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.750
You know my name?

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.260
Take this!

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.550
Meha!

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.590
Towering Tornado.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.390
What?!

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.980
One down,

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.690
four to go.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.610
I'm not going to kill you or anything,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.210
but I've got to at least 
rough you up a little bit.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.520
I see. So you were after me all along.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.600
You're brighter than you look.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.390
Can't breathe, eh? Then drown!

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.500
How is this magic supposed to drown me?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.590
He's...

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.610
This is how

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.650
you're supposed to drown.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.570
That's two.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.350
Looks like you completely 
fell for the footsteps I laid.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.590
Take that, and that, and that, and that!

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.860
Not bad. In that case...

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.160
There! Think you can stop that?!

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.010
Take that!

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.370
What?!

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.380
Why is size the only thing 
that matters to you people?

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.620
Damn it! In that case...

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.770
Too late.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.070
That's three. Two more to go.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.640
Sister...

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.270
Hold it right there.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.440
Good boy.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.410
It'd be a shame

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.750
if the sister's pretty face got burned.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.850
Yuno.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.400
It looks like you have a talent for magic.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.650
If you see someone in need, 
make sure you help them.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.320
Promise me.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.550
You too, Asta.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.390
Huh? Did you say something?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.790
Now then, Yuno. Why don't 
you hand over your grimoire?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.510
You won't be able to do anything without it.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.260
What do you plan to do with my grimoire?

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.650
Maybe I'll sell it. Maybe I'll burn it.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.260
I honestly don't care.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.270
Without your grimoire,
you'll be useless as a Magic Knight.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.060
Is that your plan?

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.650
What if I refuse?

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.180
Are you going to?

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.940
That's a good boy. Hand it over.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.930
Then I'll let you take 
your precious sister home.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.600
I refuse.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.360
What?! Don't you get it? The sister—

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.350
I won't let you harm her.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:25.230
Are you going to attack me? 
No matter how you attack—

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.940
I'm not the one who's going to attack.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.010
Huh? Then who—

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.010
Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.240
Mimosa.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.340
Yes, sir.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.070
She's all right.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.570
I hope you defeated all of them.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.830
There should be one more.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.250
Did he flee?

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.270
What would you have done if I hadn't come?

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.180
Why did you come?

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.460
Do you think I'm some kind of fool?

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.560
He does!

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:17.430
Listen well, Yuno. Our duty as Magic 
Knights is to protect the people.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.410
I thought it was strange.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.780
These men were after you, not Salim.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.080
Do you think a noble would want 
to come to a village like this?

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.850
Do you think they'd happily eat those tatoes?

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.710
Sorry to say it, but I definitely wouldn't.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.280
There's no way they'd accidentally take 
Sister Lily instead of Salim, either.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.260
Besides...

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.100
It was strange for Salim, whom you defeated, 
to specifically ask you to escort him.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:56.600
And that's when we used my Plant 
Creation Magic: Flower of Truth.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.150
It's all your fault I wasn't able 
to join the Magic Knights, Yuno!

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:07.740
Who cares about your stupid four-leaf 
grimoire, damn it?! I'll steal it from you!

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.450
I'll get my daddy to hurt you!

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.250
I'll get my revenge!

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.850
He coughed up everything.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.630
I'm still surprised you managed to find me.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.920
That was also thanks to Mimosa's abilities.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.850
Flower Creation Magic: 
Magic Flower Guidepost.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.720
Let's see...

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.290
Oh, there he is.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.910
That's why we were able to back you up.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.800
Thank you.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.450
You helped me out a lot, Klaus, Mimosa.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.850
No problem.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.230
Shut up!

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.700
Honestly, revenge? How pathetic!

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.620
It's only natural that you lost to Yuno.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:05.670
Our honorable captain of the Golden Dawn, 
William Vangeance, chose him!

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.230
That means he's truly that talented!

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.590
Klaus...

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.200
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.350
I still haven't acknowledged you.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.690
Oh, dear.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.940
Right...

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:31.130
But I'll overlook your insolence this time, 
since this was all Salim's doing.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.700
So what shall we do?

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.050
Take him to the royal capital?

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.900
No, let's just leave them.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.460
Are you sure?

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.210
As long as they don't go 
near Hage Village again.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.050
You heard him. You're free to go.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.600
Don't ever try anything like this again.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.320
Do you understand?

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.170
You're just a peasant.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.410
Getting you to let your guard 
down was all part of my plan!

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:11.680
Huh?

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.150
God of Lighting Rising Salim!

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.570
Water Creation Magic: Holy Strike of Love!

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.650
Stop this! Show some remorse 
for what you've done!

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.200
All of you, too!

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.460
Y-Yes, ma'am!

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.860
I almost want to scout the 
sister for the Magic Knights.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:36.340
Yuno, we're going to take them 
to the royal capital after all.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.200
By the way, where did the other one go?

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.480
No idea.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.530
Man, that was fun.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.860
If they were actually in trouble, I was 
going save them, but I didn't need to at all.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:04.330
William's newbie is pretty impressive, too.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.770
How long do you intend to fool around?

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.280
You're too loud!

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.130
You need to return at once! 
Your work is piling up!

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.210
All right, all right.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.560
It's not healthy to be so 
irritated all the time.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.810
Whose fault do you think that is, huh?!

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:26.270
Thank goodness you're safe!

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.480
Thank goodness!

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.570
Goodness!

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.410
Awesome as usual, Yuno.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.320
Well, he is a Magic Knight.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.170
Klaus, Mimosa, thank you both very much.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.510
Don't mention it.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.340
Salim was behind all of this. How unsightly.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.440
Please, please, help yourselves.
Let me repay you with more tato dishes.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.080
They've gotten a bit cold,
but please eat as much as you'd like!

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.670
It's not bad.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.420
You're not very honest, are you, Klaus?

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.870
It's good.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.800
A star?

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.140
The Wizard King was pleased with 
your work, and we received a star.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.790
Thank you very much! It's an honor!

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:47.130
I never thought I'd get 
one on my first mission.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.020
But I don't feel as if we did 
enough to earn a star.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.960
After you brought Salim in, 
he ended up confessing

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.370
to various evil deeds Lord Hapshass had done.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.210
Bribes, fraudulent accounts, 
and shady deals.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.080
You made quite the catch.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.170
It's all thanks to you three.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.800
Sir, did you happen to take on this mission 
because you knew this would happen?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.180
We mustn't allow any evil deeds 
to be done in the Clover Kingdom.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.550
Yes, sir.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:29.620
Klaus, Yuno, and Mimosa, I look forward 
to all of your future great deeds.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.310
Yes, sir.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.620
Yuno and Mimosa...

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.220
It appears that the newbies this year are... 
well, at least slightly competent.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.550
I'm counting on you all. 
Especially you, Yuno.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.890
So, a star...

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:02.390
Everything ended well this time, but don't 
ever act on your own again, Yuno.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.300
Yes, sir.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.530
Why was there a pause? Yuno, look at me!

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.910
Look me in the eyes and say that 
you won't act on your own again.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.880
Yes, sir.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.220
Yuno! Hey, Yuno!

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:23.240
What?! The Golden Dawn received a star?!

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.570
We are hoomans.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.700
And I thought we were finally only 
100 away. Now we're 101 away again.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.550
Damn it! I thought we'd 
finally caught up to them!

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.810
So close.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.090
How is that close? We're at minus 30.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.200
We are hoomans.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.220
Shut up!

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.260
I'm not going to lose!

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.080
They're only ahead by 101! 
I'll catch up in no time!

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.480
Just you wait, Golden Dawn!

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.730
Yuno!

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.070
Sir, there's trouble. An anomaly—

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.720
An anomaly has occurred, right?

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:23.390
Well... Let's have them work on this mission.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.770
Them?

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:42.540
No one can escape from here

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:49.290
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:57.620
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:03.980
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.510
I've thought many times

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.220
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:18.720
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.650
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:32.930
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:39.790
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:44.420
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.360
Petit Clover

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.920
Petit Clover!

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.860
My Steed

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.410
"My Steed."

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:14.210
Well, isn't it beautiful? Its eyes,
its beak... Perfection.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.540
Sure.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.510
Doesn't it just scream "Golden Dawn"?

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.640
Sure.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.210
Whoa, that's so cool! What is that?!

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:29.670
It's as cool as Magna's Crazy Cyclone
 and Bah-ha's Shooting Star!

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.510
Isn't it? I have no idea 
who you are, but thank you.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.360
Not a chance.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.770
What? Explore a dungeon?

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.060
Along with Stupidsta and Luck?

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.940
Leave it to me. Exploring 
a dungeon will be easy!

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.010

Dungeon

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.740
Not giving up is my magic.
