00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.170
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.300
This is the Black Market.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.310
It's a bit dangerous, but they have 
some very effective magical items.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.310
Damn it, I lost again! Bah-ha...

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.320
I can see the future.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.820
That old lady's good.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.410
I really shouldn't be 
wasting time here, anyway.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.530
Hey, she's cute!

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.700
Bah-ha!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.750
The Black Market is no place 
for you lovely ladies. Bah-ha!

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.540
Get lost, you insect.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.710
Bah-ha...

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.590
Hey! I found something really cool!

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.390
Bah-ha!

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.220
Th-That's...

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.210
Huh? Hey, you're Bah-ha!

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.640
It's Sekke! Bah-ha!

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.780
How've you been, Bah-ha?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.140
The name's Bah-ha! No, wait, Sekke!

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.350
Who's that?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.090
I took the Entrance Exam with him.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.860
Ah, you're a member of the 
Green Praying Mantises.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.880
He's with two beautiful girls?! Wait, no...

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.870
They're both members of 
the Black Bulls, too.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.220
Asta, you bastard! 
You're making me jealous.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.090
Besides, it's all your fault that 
I ended up in the Green Praying Mantises.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.920
Bah-ha! You infuriating bah-hastard!

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.410
The Wizard King Saw

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.740
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.410
I know, yeah I know

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.660
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.000
I dreamed it all my life

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.550
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.550
Don't care how much I fall

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.020
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.310
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.780
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.860
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.120
Someday I will write the next page

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.620
You are my hope

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.380
Like that page from someday

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.710
I was able to meet you

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.670
I call this a miracle

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.770
Are you out shopping with these girls?

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.530
Well, today's our day off.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.560
Bah-ha! Must be nice.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.650
Even if it's your day off, shouldn't 
you be finding some basic tasks

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.210
to do for points,
instead of messing around?

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.950
I heard the Black Bulls 
have negative stars—

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.510
Stars! Oh, yeah! Listen to this!

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.080
We got a star from the
 Wizard King on our first mission!

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.620
What?! You can't be serious!

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.140
Well done, you two.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.260
They're serious?!

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.760
Calm down, me.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.780
Bah-ha, bah-ha...

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.010
I-I see! Seems like you're working hard.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.220
What about you, Bah-ha?

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.630
It's Sekke!

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.410
W-Well, I... The other day...

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.090
I-I got my second star...

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.990
Th-Thief!

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.740
My winnings! Stop!

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.080
That old lady...

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.580
He's got some nerve,
 stealing in front of Magic Knights.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.430
No kidding. But everything will be 
fine if we leave it to the little boy.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.240
I'm counting on you.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.220
Bah-ha!

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.670
I'm not going to let you 
steal all the glory, Asta!

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.170
Bronze Creation Magic: Sekke Shooting Star!

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.890
Lame!

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.020
Gross!

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.870
Leave this to me. You lovely ladies 
can go relax with that old lady.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.060
Ew!

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.020
No!

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.540
Bah-ha!

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.530
Hold it!

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.060
Just try and catch me.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.090
Stop, dang it!

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.090
What the...

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.690
Sorry!

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.130
I finally lost him.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.490
Not yet!

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.810
He's so damn persistent!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.910
I-I can't see!

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.710
I'm not letting you get away!

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.300
How is he catching up to me 
when he's only running?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.970
I have to do something about that cloud,
or I'll never catch up.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.350
If it's a cloud created by magic...

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.060
Right!

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.700
Do you actually think you can cut 
through my Bandit's Cloud Wind—

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.940
What?!

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.820
You're not getting away!

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.990
Bah-ha!

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.250
Bah-ha!

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.790
I'm going to take the glory on this one!

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.520
That's awesome!

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.090
Bah-ha!

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.100
Bah-ha! You're under arrest!

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.590
He's my prey! Bah-hahaha!

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.970
Bah-hahaha... huh?

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.980
Bah-ha?

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.250
That's...

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.400
Knock off that stupid laugh of yours!

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.820
I'm taking you down with me...

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.490
What's wrong, Bah-ha?

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.040
Poison... Poison's coursing through me.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.970
Hang in there, Bah-ha!

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.750
Bah... ha...

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.760
Am I going to die?

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.010
Now that I think about it, I was 
once trying to get to the top, too...

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.770
Bah-ha!

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.440
I hate that I have to leave 
everything to him, but...

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.940
You're the man who defeated me.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.700
Make it all the way to the 
top for my sake, too.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.610
I'm leaving my dream to you!

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.700
Bah-ha...

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.040
Bah-haha...

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:06.110
I guess going out like this isn't so bad.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.550
Bah... ha...

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.220
Bah-ha! Bah-ha!

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.940
Huh? I'm not dying?

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.660
Bah-ha?!

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.100
Wh-What are you—

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.730
Don't leave something so important with me!

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.490
Survive and make your own dream come true!

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.110
Don't give up, you idiot!

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.160
Come on. There's no way this would kill you.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:42.710
Bah-ha?

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.290
It's just a momentary numbing poison.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.740
Put this Shique ointment on it,
and you'll be better in no time.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.830
Bah-ha! Make sure you stay diligent 
until the next time I see you, Asta!

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.270
See ya, bah-ha!

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.270
See ya, Bah-ha!

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.690
On the outside, our little boy 
definitely looks younger than him,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.790
but it seems our little boy is 
much stronger on the inside.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.670
Don't let it get taken again, ma'am.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.790
Thank you, Magic Knights.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.080
See ya, ma'am.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.570
Be careful.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.060
Live a long, happy life.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.550
Magic negation, eh?

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.390
That's a type of magic 
I've never seen before.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.810
Actually... is that even magic?

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.810
Yami sure took in an interesting kid.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.900
This is why I can't stop 
wandering around in disguise.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.890
I finally found you!

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.120
Uh-oh...

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.570
What in the world are you doing, Wizard King?

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:06.600
28th Wizard King
Julius Novachrono

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:07.870
What am I doing? I'm strolling through 
the castle town looking for new magic.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.670
What?! Have you any 
awareness of your position?!

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.090
Encounters with magic are once in a lifetime.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.330
That doesn't—

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.610
You never know what kind of magic 
you're going to encounter and where.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.390
Listen to me, you magic nerd!

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.770
Now, now, calm down, Marx.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.270
Isn't that the new kid from William's squad?

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:40.100
Well, I'm off to encounter even 
more new magic. I'll be back later.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.490
Wait, damn it!

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.510
Member of the Golden Dawn
<font size="30">Klaus Lunettes</c>

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.390
The Golden Dawn's new recruit, Yuno...

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.550
Member of the Golden Dawn
Yuno

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.850
The candidate that every Magic Knight 
Captain wanted at the Entrance Exam.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.690
Member of the Golden Dawn
<font size="30">Mimosa Vermillion</c>

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.980
And then we have the other new recruit,
 Mimosa Vermillion, from the royal family.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.850
Their first mission is...

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.430
to act as bodyguards 
for Salim de Hapshass.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.120
We are to escort the son of Hapshass,
who serves in the House of Lords,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.650
to our ally, the Heart Kingdom?

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.040
You know who Lord Hapshass is, don't you?

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.580
I know his name.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:37.550
I've only heard negative things about him,
such as that he's new money.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.000
I'm sure that's why he's worried that his son, 
who is going to study in the Heart Kingdom,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.060
might be attacked by bandits on the way.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.730
But there are many powerful mages 
among the lord's family...

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:58.220
Apparently, he feels having Magic Knights
act as his bodyguards will be safer.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.830
Lord Hapshass makes very generous 
donations to the Magic Knights every year,

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.880
so it's rather hard to decline.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.090
Do you object?

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.410
N-No!

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:15.630
We need to accept every kind of mission. 
That will also benefit the Clover Kingdom.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.950
Yes, sir. I am aware of that.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.380
Take Mimosa with you, too.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.050
I'm sure with you along as their mentor,
 they'll be more than enough.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.260
I'm counting on you to 
look after the new recruits.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:35.730
Salim de Hapshass lost to Yuno in the final 
part of the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.610
He ended up being unable 
to join the Magic Knights.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.950
So why was Yuno appointed 
as one of his bodyguards?

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.950
My first mission... I'm so nervous.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.160
Klaus, Yuno, it's a 
pleasure to work with you.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.000
Yeah.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.130
Don't let your guard down, Mimosa.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.650
Y-Yes, sir.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.630
That goes for you, too.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.460
I know.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.530
You insolent newbie.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.470
How have you been, Yuno?

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.050
Don't look so scary.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.980
I requested you as my bodyguard 
because I want to apologize.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.860
I hear that you intend to 
become the Wizard King.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.860
How did you know?

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.390
You were chosen by all of the captains. 
You could've joined any squad,

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.370
and you ended up choosing the 
Golden Dawn, so I had a feeling.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.130
The more you achieve from now on,

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.220
the more your name will spread 
throughout the kingdom...

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.150
Yuno, the one who bears the 
four-leaf clover grimoire.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.310
Make sure your dream of becoming 
the Wizard King comes true.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.910
And then I'll be able to 
brag to my future children

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.140
that I once fought the Wizard King.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.400
And then they'll say, "Daddy, you're so cool!"

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.060
We have some time before we 
get to the Heart Kingdom.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.890
Could you tell me a little 
more about yourself?

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.410
I won't pester you if you're not up for it.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.080
I'm from Hage Village.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.750
I've heard of it. It's a village 
in the Forsaken Realm, isn't it?

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.810
I think that's where the legend 
of the first Wizard King

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.100
who defeated the demons comes from.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.110
It's not just a legend. A giant 
demon skull is actually still there.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.010
Oh?

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.440
Apparently, I was found abandoned in 
front of a church when I was a baby.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.440
I've never seen my parents,
and I have no idea who they are.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:50.700
The church was very poor, but the father 
and sister there took very good care of me.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.290
I'm very grateful to them.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.770
No problems so far,

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.420
but there must be someone 
in the Hapshass family

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.110
who can use transportation magic.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.710
How did we get stuck with this?

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.710
Not to mention, we're the only bodyguards.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:07.420
If there was a real threat of an attack, 
wouldn't they have more bodyguards?

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.820
There are too many unknowns on this mission.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.820
Oh?

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.890
What's that?

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.390
Those clouds...

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.730
They're a little creepy.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.520
I'll go check them out.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.180
Hey! No one said you could—

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.740
Be on your guard, Mimosa.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.230
Y-Yes, sir.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.760
Yuno, protect the ship!

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.010
I intend to.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.770
Go!

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.520
That was magnificent!

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.530
Were those men not after Salim?

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.790
You saved me back there. Well done, Yuno.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.500
I didn't even have the opportunity 
to use my Lightning God Rising Salim.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.430
I'm even more interested in you now.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.500
I know. Why don't you take me to your town?

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.130
I want to see the place where you were born.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.860
I want to know where you had 
to live to grow up so strong.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.730
Lord Salim, that's rather out of the way.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.330
Besides, given what just happened,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.610
we don't know what else 
might happen along the way,

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.960
so we should head straight 
for the Heart Kingdom—

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.010
No matter who may come after me,
 you three will protect me, won't you?

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.130
Well, yes, of course.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.120
But for nobility to go to a peasant 
village in the Forsaken Realm...

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.700
It'll just be a quick stop.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.910
Right...

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:52.800
I'm sure Yuno would like to see 
everyone back at his church, too. Right?

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.890
That's not your concern.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.220
Now, now...

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.560
So that's the demon's skull!

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:13.810
It's quite big. And on top of it is 
a statue of the first Wizard King.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.450
I see. So where is this church?

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.900
There.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.460
Oh?

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.290
Yuno!

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.450
Welcome back!

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.300
Thanks.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.390
You've grown so much!

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:41.820
I haven't changed. It's only 
been two months since I left.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.310
Really? But... Yes. Your face has matured.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.640
You look more like an adult.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.480
What brings you here today?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.310
We're stopping by briefly during our mission.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.930
Why must I visit this village 
in the Forsaken Realm?

00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.570
Oh, um, hello. I'm Sister Lily.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:08.330
I'm Klaus Lunettes of the honorable 
Golden Dawn, led by William Vangeance.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.080
I'm a mentor to these new recruits.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.170
Hello, Klaus. Thank you 
for looking after Yuno.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.090
I've heard of you from Yuno's letters.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.490
Letters?

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.840
What did you write about me?

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.100
Honestly...

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.180
I'm Mimosa Vermillion,
 one of Yuno's colleagues.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.690
I've heard of you, too, Mimosa.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.560
Oh!

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.330
What did you write about me?

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.820
Ah, what a beauty.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.500
Huh?

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.140
I am from Hapshass Village,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:49.580
the son of Lord Hapshass and the heir to 
the Hapshass family, Salim de Hapshass.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.330
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.540
Oh, I-I'm so sorry! I just...

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.740
N-No, it's all right, Sister.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.100
Yuno! It's Yuno!

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.410
How are you?!

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.480
Welcome back!

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.370
What are you doing here, Yuno?

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.430
Whoa, that robe's awesome! 
That's the Golden Dawn's.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.780
It's the real thing!

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.900
Yay, it's Yuno! Yay! Yay!

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.160
Yay!

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.770
Hey, where's Asta?

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.990
Where's Asta?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.710
Are you keeping in contact with Asta?

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.880
No.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.950
Are you staying the night tonight?
 You are, right?

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.000
Um...

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.100
Unfortunately, we're just stopping by.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.710
We have to hurry on our way.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.340
Aww!

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.060
Now, now, we don't have 
to be in such a hurry.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.460
We can spare an hour or so.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.430
But—

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.890
In that case, I'll prepare 
some famous Hage tato dishes.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.440
Yuno, stay and have some food.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.320
That goes for all of you. Please, come in.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.980
Wow, what a splendid church.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.890
I've never seen such a 
tiny church. It's so cute.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.110
Tiny?!

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.910
It's like a playhouse.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.350
Wha—

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.910
Yuno, tell us about the Magic Knights.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.370
Yeah, tell us!

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.620
Us!

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.290
Why must I enter such a filthy little church?

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:41.540
No one can escape from here

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:48.290
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:56.580
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:02.980
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.470
I've thought many times

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:10.180
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:17.720
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:24.610
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:31.870
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:38.750
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:43.420
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.270
Petit Clover

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.290
Petit Clover!

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.000
Sekke's Bah-ha Seminar! Part 2

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.770
Sekke's Bah-ha Seminar, Part 2!

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.530
We're still doing this?

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.890
But of course, Asta.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.620
You haven't learned the 
ways of bah-ha at all yet.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.560
Your Shooting Star's pretty cool!

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.710
Ah, so you understand how grand it is!

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:22.170
That part in front is especially awesome!

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.920
Good. You are starting to 
understand the ways of bah-ha!

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.600
I see. So that's bah-ha.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.380
Yes. Starting today, you have attained bah-ha!

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:34.430
Bah-hahaha! Bah-hahaha!

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.430
Bah-hahaha!

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.430
Men are so stupid.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.590
Curse that Yuno! He's so 
insolent for a new recruit.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:47.360
I'm your senior! If you don't listen to me,
you'll feel the wrath of my glasses!

Not giving up is my magic!
