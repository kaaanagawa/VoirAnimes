00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.640
Xerx

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.640
Mimosa

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.640
Asta

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.640
Kirsch

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.640
Sol

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.640
Magna

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.260
It's the first round of stage two of 
the Royal Knights Selection Exam.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.510
B Team was overwhelmed

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.350
by Kirsch's extraordinary magical 
powers as a royal, but...

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.850
Black Hurricane!

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.860
Asta used his black powers and 
instantly nullified Kirsch's magic.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.110
At the same time, he nullified all the 
traps set by the mysterious mage,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.950
setting the state of the match
 back to where it began.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.620
I want to work with all the powerful guys 
here and beat some other powerful people!

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.460
I can't think of any way 
around it, so I'll use you.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.370
The two worked together for the first time 
and were able to lure Kirsch into a trap

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.130
that was very appropriate for B Team,
managing to strike him down.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.550
Now we finally feel like a team.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.980
Mister Delinquent vs. Muscle Brains

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.270
According to the signal from 
the Magic Flower Guidepost,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.820
the enemy's crystal is inside Sol's golem.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.120
If I mix the seeds of my magic-controlling 
weeds into an attack spell and plant them,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.170
I'll be able to control Sol's golem for a 
little while, since its attribute is earth.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.420
It'll take a while for the seeds to take root,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.790
and I'll have to fight and plant 
the seeds without being noticed.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.980
I wonder if I can manage all of that.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.560
Plant Magic: Magic Cannon Flower!

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.980
Not bad! But...

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.540
Earth Magic: Clod Seal!

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.200
Hurting women isn't my style, 
so just take a little break there.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.320
Asta! Xerx!

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.790
Let's see what Funglasquent can do.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.670
Looks like you got a bit overconfident 
with your awesome magical powers,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.500
you damn royal.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.630
You actually fell for this primitive trap.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.040
You're seriously a vice captain?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.090
You should quit, you moron.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.130
How disgusting can you be, 
you damn narcissistic dumbass?

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.640
Not so beautiful now, are ya?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.930
Come on! The dude's out cold!
Cut him some slack already!

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.380
I'm amazed you thought of 
making an actual pitfall.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.770
Talk about sneaky!

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.570
I never thought I'd use my sword as a shovel.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.950
I'm more amazed at the fact that 
you're somehow not worn out

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.610
from digging a hole in so little time.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.970
You hyper, muscle-bound monster runt.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.870
Well, I train, so...

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.120
Now, then... No matter how 
gross he is, he's got skills.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.380
There's no telling what he'll do, so I'm gonna 
set a magic circle near the entrance.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.890
So that's how you were setting them!
That's so cool!

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.640
Now if anyone tries to save this bastard,
 they're gonna go kaboom.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.060
And, just in case, we should bury him alive.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.400
Hey!

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.040
That's going way too far!

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.290
My sword's in there, too!

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.300
That noise... It's coming from over there!

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.490
That voice...

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.550
Flame Reinforcement Magic: Risky Stolen Base!

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.370
Come on, come on, come on!

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.990
I found the crystal, damn it!

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.080
Magna, you're so fast!

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.840
I'm not getting close enough 
to let you fight, Asta.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.010
At this distance, I'm guaranteed to win!

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.680
I'm gonna get some payback for your baptism!

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.130
Don't think I'm the same 
guy I was back then!

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.020
Bring it on, Magna!

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.230
Die!

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.350
Okay.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.070
I can totally hit this!

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.120
It's mine, Magna!

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.790
Wha—

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.250
Ya missed, you jackass!

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.750
My new spell, Annihilation Massacre Fireball,
is able to disappear!

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.880
Ain't no way you're gonna hit it if I 
make it disappear right in front of you!

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.210
That spell's insane!

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.140
You're amazing, Magna!

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.820
That's so interesting!

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.850
He's far more talented than he looks.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.400
He's amazing at barbecues, too.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.110
Even if I try to get closer to him,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.820
he's just gonna use that 
super-speedy spell to run away,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.160
and that'll leave the crystal wide open!

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.370
I'm gonna have to go black in order 
to get close to him instantly.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.570
But I still need more time.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.180
Oh, crap! Mimosa! Come back!

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.420
Hey, you little shit.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.670
Hang on for another ten... no, five minutes.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.670
Yeah! You got it!

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.180
Hold it, you stupid brat!

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.640
Did you see that, Mimosa?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.520
Even the tiny ones are criminals.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.720
The peasants' hearts are 
as shallow as their wealth.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.930
They are vile inside and out.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.530
Those who are vile when they're young will 
be forever vile, even when they're older.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.540
Hey, you okay? Wake up. Hey!

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.550
I said wake up!

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.550
You finally awake, narcissist?

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.210
What do you think you're 
doing to my beautiful face?

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.560
You were plenty ugly before I slugged you.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.050
How dare you mock my beauty?!

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.650
You aren't beautiful at all.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.520
Huh?

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.080
The truly beautiful are people like my sis.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.490
Four Years Ago

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.240
The Greatest City in the Common Realm
Hecairo

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.420
We're counting on you to look 
after the city while we're gone.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.940
Sol Marron

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.490
Leave it to me!

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.670
I'll protect this town, so you guys 
can go to work without worrying, Dad.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.570
I see Sol's as lively as ever.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.520
I'm pretty sure our town has some promising,
 brave young lads, as well.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.180
Yeah! We're here, too.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.520
We'll protect the town 
while you guys are gone.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.670
You can just go help out your mom, Sol.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.360
Huh? Who're the ones who were 
crying and running around

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.670
while some giant stray dog chased 
after them the other day?

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.910
I'm way, way stronger than all you guys!

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.910
Still...

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.000
You may be strong, but you're still a girl.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.300
We guys need to protect you.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.050
Wh-What?! I don't need your protection!

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.770
But I'm a bit worried.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.270
They say there are some 
bandits targeting towns

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.270
that are far away from the royal capital.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.540
I heard they even attacked a town 
on the outskirts to the east.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.180
Don't worry.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.070
Apparently, the bandits are almost 
completely gone because of the Magic Knights.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.100
Contact the Magic Knights 
if anything happens.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.570
They should get here immediately.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.770
Take everything that looks 
like it's worth something!

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.100
Take any women that look like 
they'll sell for a high price!

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.930
Hurry it up! We need to get the hell outta 
here before the Magic Knights show up!

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.900
Everyone, run to the church!

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.520
What are you talking about? 
You're coming, too!

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.900
I'll be fine! Just go!

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.990
Those cowards...

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.810
Hey there, little girl. 
It's dangerous over here.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:04.660
Well, aren't you a pretty little thing? 
I'm sure you're going to get even prettier.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.200
Let's take her. Come on, now.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.750
If you don't resist, we'll be nice.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.010
Get out of my town!

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.260
Well, she's a rowdy little one.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.520
Then I guess we'll just 
have to use some force.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.150
Looks like we had a little mouse hiding.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.900
What's the matter? Not gonna run away, kid?

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.240
You wanna save her? Or are 
you too scared to even move?

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.670
Well, if you want to save her, come on over.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.500
I mean, I'm just going to kill you, but...

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.460
We guys need to protect you.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.980
I-I'm sorry!

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.710
Aw, he ran away.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.620
Too bad, little girlie.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.290
Forget about that worthless kid.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.430
I'll teach you everything you need 
to know about being an adult.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.480
Captain Charlotte went to protect 
such a poor little town?

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.820
The Wizard King said it, too! We need 
to get over our differences and fight!

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.930
That's right. Sis gave me the
 hope I needed to keep living.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.430
Can you stand?

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.920
Were you scared?

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.430
I wasn't scared.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.430
I had every intention of 
fighting and winning.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.190
I wanted to protect everyone... 
to protect this town.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.460
It's just...

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.290
I didn't stand a chance.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.900
I'm so angry... at how weak I am.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.450
I can't believe I trusted my friends.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.750
I'm so pathetic.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.960
How can I be strong like you?

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.130
How...

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.170
can I be beautiful like you?

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.020
You are already beautiful enough.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.020
Now you just need to train 
your body and your magic.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.620
You can become stronger.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.820
I'm sure of it.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.320
Become stronger, and join the Magic Knights.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.950
The Magic Knights? Me?

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.370
I'll be waiting for you 
with the Blue Rose Knights.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.050
Thank goodness you're safe.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.330
You—

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.680
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.730
What are you apologizing for?

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.530
I wasn't counting on you guys to begin with!

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.820
I guess you guys saw my pathetic side, too.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:32.240
I was gonna take care of them with a single 
blow, but I totally let my guard down.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.320
Next time, I'll definitely 
protect you guys and this town,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.380
so don't you worry!

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.720
Sol...

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.420
I've made up my mind.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.420
I'm gonna get even stronger 
and join the Magic Knights!

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.980
And...

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.230
I didn't get her name.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.560
Oh, well.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.610
Please wait for me... Sis!

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.820
Don't you have a reason to fight 
beyond your own selfishness?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.890
I missed again!

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.180
It's too fast for me to pick up its ki, and 
they're small enough that I keep missing!

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.250
I don't have anything like 
Asta's anti-magic sword

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:31.490
or a crap ton of magic power to 
let loose like some noble or royal.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.430
That's exactly why I came up with 
this surefire technical spell!

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.900
They might be small, but this 
is how I'm gonna fight, dumbass!

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.190
What the?!

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.910
Yes! I finally hit one!

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.410
Bring it on, Magna!

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.280
You got it, you little shit! Die!

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.450
Asta's not half bad after all,
 that damn punk!

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.670
You're hardly letting 
any of them through now!

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.250
He's still getting one out
 of every five through.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.110
At this rate, the crystal's 
not gonna hold up.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.340
You're so awesome, Magna!

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.580
Magna and Asta are relentless.
They're not letting up!

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.480
Neither one of them knows 
how to hold back. I love it!

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.840
They look like they're having so much fun!

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.690
Man, I'm so jealous! I wanna play, too!

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.490
Asta, you really are incredible, you bastard!

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:37.300
Thanks for... Thanks for making me and 
the others stronger, you piece of shit!

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:43.380
But Asta, the ones who'll be fighting in 
the finals aren't you and that Yuno kid.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.880
It'll be me and Luck!

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.260
What do you think you're doing without me?

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.970
What the?! He's back!

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.050
And it's ready.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:58.970
Wounding my beautiful face 
is punishable by death!

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.060
Crap! I'm not gonna be able 
to take both of them on!

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.650
Our crystal's gonna crack any second now!

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.610
What should I do?

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.780
Attack the cherry blossom 
guy, you little shit!

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.620
I don't know where your 
spells are gonna pop up...

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.040
So I put up a magic circle 
on the crystal itself.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.890
My original spell is gonna knock your 
phony imitation spell right back at ya!

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.510
It can even mimic the effects?!

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.520
My spell... is wicked awesome.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.250
Erasing magic, the beauty 
of this world itself...

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.940
Anti-magic. What a vile and atrocious power!

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.760
I will not underestimate you again!

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.700
Peasant brat, I will blow both you 
and the crystal away from up here!

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.050
Crap! If he goes up any higher,
 I won't be able to block

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.660
all the cherry blossoms, 
even if I throw my sword up!

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.520
He's gonna break the crystal!

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.460
I don't care if it's a disgrace! 
This is my full power!

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:13.930
Wha—

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.720
This is trap magic!

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.390
You shouldn't let your magic 
detection slide like that.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.640
I can set my trap spells mid-air, too.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.920
I'll take care of this in an instant!

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.730
And that instant's all I need!

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.320
Yikes... Twice in one match.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.750
You can't call that anything but humiliating.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.000
I'll make sure your sacrifice 
won't be in vain!

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.040
Wha—

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.840
Crap! The crystal!

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.800
Hey, what gives?! Move already!

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.350
I made it... in time.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.560
Great job, Mimosa!

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.570
Hey! Come on, listen to me!

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.900
Hey, you idiot! Stop!

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.710
It's mine!

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.700
The crystal has been destroyed.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.750
B Team wins!

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.020
That was so much fun!

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.210
Both Magna and Asta were awesome!

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.420
You both did great!

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.180
We need to celebrate when we all get back.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.200
You're not afraid to go all-out 
because you're true friends.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.950
All of you are true friends.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.690
We did it, Cool Masked Dude!

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.550
See? I knew you could 
handle teamwork, ya jerk!

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.320
Hey, come on! Hey, what the hell?

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.370
How long are you gonna leave me hangin'?

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.510
So it ended up just like he wanted.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.510
Hey, come on! High five me!

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.960
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.580
This would've ended much quicker 
if you hadn't busted all my traps.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.580
Come on, man!

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.210
What?! High five me, damn it!

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.500
Come on! Don't leave me hangin'!

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:15.090
All right. Listen up, losers.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.740
Hey, giant girl in blue.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.650
You're too sloppy, dumbass.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:26.140
If you'd been more sensitive to subtleties 
in magic, you might not have lost.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.990
The explosive delinquent over there latches 
on too hard when he gets all fired up.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.530
I don't know if it's peasant grit or what,

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.190
but you need to know when 
to pull back, you moron.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.050
And Mr. Royal Narcissist over here...

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.200
You're too damn proud all the time.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:47.640
You fell apart as soon as something 
you'd denied struck back.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.110
You're the ugliest one here.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.210
Come on, that's going too far, 
you jerk! Be a little nicer!

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.710
Brother...

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.310
Mimosa...

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:07.960
It's true that sometimes poverty 
makes peasants hard-hearted.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.960
But their true beauty is something 
that can't be taken away.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.920
Don't look at me, Mimosa.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.670
Dun look at dis unsighdly brudder of yours...

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.910
That was indeed a very unsightly loss.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:38.180
But you acknowledged a peasant's strength 
and kept fighting, even as you got dirty.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.420
So right now, you're more beautiful 
than I've ever seen you before.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.180
I didn't want to admit it, but...

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.790
That was...

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.510
beautiful.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.360
A royal losing to a peasant? 
How unbelievably pathetic!

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:02.040
Next, please prepare for the 
second round of stage two!

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.700
I'm up next!

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.600
I'm not gonna lose either,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.990
Langris!

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.510
Petit Clover

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.350
Petit Clover!

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.010
Choosing a Lover for Sis

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.350
Choosing a Lover for Sis.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.260
What? Who would I pick as a lover 
for Sis out of these guys?

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.890
This guy's way shorter than Sis,
 so that's not happening.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.020
Delinquents are lame.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.520
There's no way I'm gonna let a 
gaudy guy like that near Sis.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.290
Narcissists are gross.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.280
Guys who don't talk much are boring.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.410
Weak guys are a definite no.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:17.790
The Wizard King is one of the few I could 
almost accept, but he loves everyone.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.920
I need someone who will only 
love Sis and Sis alone.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.850
So that means I need a guy 
who's taller than Sis,

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.220
not a delinquent, not gaudy or a narcissist,

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.380
who can have fun conversations with Sis,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.940
is strong, and will probably 
love Sis and Sis alone...

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.510
That means...

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.630
There's no one other than me, Sis!

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.270
Finral's next opponent is his 
own younger brother, Langris.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.270
Be confident in yourself, and fight!

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.300

Little Brother vs. Failed Big Brother."

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 80
 Special Little Brother vs. Failed Big Brother

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.990
Finral, you're not a loser.
