00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.510
Vetto of the Third Eye, a part 
of the organization known as

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.390
the Eye of the Midnight Sun that 
seeks to destroy the Clover Kingdom,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.130
infiltrated the Underwater Temple.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.480
His power was so great that Asta and the 
others fell to him, one after another.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.030
Kahono!

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.450
Let her go!

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.990
But Noelle diligently faced off with Vetto

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.830
in order to protect her friends!

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.100
I'm Noelle Silva of the Black Bulls!

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.420
How dare you hurt my friends and comrades?!

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.580
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.450
I did it!

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.170
It looked as though Noelle's attack 
had finally defeated Vetto,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.290
but the battle wasn't over yet!

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.130
Impressive... You managed 
to draw me out, human.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.970
What's with that eye?

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.940
Mythical Beast Magic...

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.860
N-No way!

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.860
La?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.320
Bah-ha! I'm going to go get help.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.890
You two tend to as many people as you can.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.890
Bah-ha?

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.690
What's this horrifying mana I'm sensing 
from the bottom of the sea?

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.250
Is it the beast from earlier?

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.290
No, this is even worse. It's no beast.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.260
It's a monster that's way 
more powerful than a beast!

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.770
What is this ominous mana? 
I've never felt anything like it before...

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.060
Does Lord Vetto's power concern you?

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.320
You must be buzzing with confidence, 
to look away from me.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.860
Vetto?

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.740
That's one of the people 
the captain mentioned.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.970
One of the Third Eye, the strongest group 
in the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.750
He's the one who infiltrated the temple?

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.460
Sucks for you, though.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.340
You'll be exterminated here.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.570
I'm going to suck all the magic out of you.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.510
That's not going to happen.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.770
I'm going to defeat you and find my comrades!

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.090
The way he looks...

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.440
It's almost like one of the fairy tales 
Granny used to tell me.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.690
Long ago, there were evil fiends 
that lived in this world.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.130
They wanted to make this world 
and all of its magic their own.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.470
The strongest among them used forbidden magic

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.460
to turn himself into a 
demon of incredible power

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.340
and tried to exterminate humanity.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.420
The one who stood against him
later became the first Wizard King.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.230
This man is just like one of 
the fiends from that story.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.540
Vanish!

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.340
Mythical Beast Magic...

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.560
Sea Dragon's...

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.530
That last spell drained all my magic!

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.740
A-Asta!

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.200
Kid!

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.910
Not yet...

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.710
Not yet, damn it!

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.090
We haven't given up yet!

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.090
Not yet? Yes, not yet!

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.770
Now is when I show you true despair!

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.640
The Only Weapon

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.050
Wh-What are you planning to do? 
You can't leave this room.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.050
I can't leave them alone!

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.320
Useless, useless, it's useless!

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.930
I told you.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:39.320
No one's ever escaped my Spatial Magic:
 Different Dimension Sphere.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.110
You bastard! Hurry up and let me 
out of here, or you'll be sorry!

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.650
Got it?

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.020
You hear me?

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.780
Answer me, you bastard!

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.530
Ooh, well, aren't you scary?

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.270
What the hell are you laughing at?

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.540
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you later!

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.730
You bastard! It's too late to apologize now!

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.030
Wow...

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.880
I'm going to kill you!

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.750
Man, this guy is violent.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.370
Mosquito Magic: Mosquito Hum!

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.040
Can't you tell? You're trying
to suck blood from a stone!

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.590
This sound's going to make me go crazy!

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.810
What's the matter? It's like
you've suffered a painful bite.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.600
Mosquito Magic: Mana-Sucker!

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.670
Let's see how long you 
can keep buzzing around.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.450
We're going to destroy you Magic Knights

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.870
so that we, the Eye of the Midnight 
Sun, can fulfill our great desire!

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.830
Not able to run anymore?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.510
M-My arm won't move?

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.220
Is it just your arm that won't move?

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.400
Wh-What's going on?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.860
Thanks for moving closer to me.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.530
If you were too far away,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.330
my threads would've been 
blown away by the sound waves.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.530
I told you, didn't I? That I was going to 
defeat you and go to my comrades.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.290
Wh-Why, you...

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.660
Thread Magic: Dancing Doll!

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.200
M-My body's bugging out on its own!

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.420
Y-You pest!

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.920
Suck up as much magic as you want!

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.220
But you'll have to settle for your own.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:30.190
M-My magic's... being sucked away...

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:41.950
Goodness. I'm going to replenish 
all the mana that was wasted on you.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.210
Now, then...

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.750
Wait for me.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.710
I'm surprised you can still stand,
anti-magic brat.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.060
But it's futile.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.970
What can you do when you're so beat up?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.630
My overflowing mana

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.980
whispers to me that I should show you 
vermin what true despair looks like.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.990
Asta... You're badly hurt. How did you get up?

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.810
Kahono... used the last of 
her strength to heal me.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.580
Huh?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.150
With a faint song...

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.930
Little by little.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.610
Kahono...

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:01.720
Let's pulverize this guy and heal 
both Kahono's throat and Kiato's leg.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.520
Huh?

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.490
I mean, even he managed to regrow an arm.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.230
I'm sure there's someone out there 
who can use magic to heal them!

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.830
Oh, yeah, Noelle...

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.960
That insane spell you did earlier... 
It helped me get back onto my feet.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.720
You're just as awesome as I thought you were!

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.290
Leave the rest to me!

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.160
Asta!

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.330
Nope, nope, nope, nope, 
nope, nope, nope, nope!

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.800
What the hell are you talking about, Asta?!

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.350
Nope, nope, nope, nope, 
nope, nope, nope, nope!

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.910
What the hell are you talking about, Asta?!

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.730
Leave the rest to you? 
Look how beat up you are!

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.190
What can you do in that state?

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.370
Especially against a monster like that?!

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.210
Not to mention...

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.130
Allow me to introduce them.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.260
They are the strongest three 
in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.590
The strongest?

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:12.390
Yes... In combat, they surpass me.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.770
The Third Eye!

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.480
They're more powerful than you?

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.110
Third Eye, eh?

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.940
He has to be bluffing when he says 
they're stronger than him.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.240
He wasn't bluffing!

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.350
He does have much stronger magic than Licht,

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.140
the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.450
There's no way we could beat this guy,
even if we ganged up on him!

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.870
Everyone else is already down for the count...

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.210
And he made this giant 
hole with no problem!

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.870
Okay... I'm going to escape through that hole.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.470
I can't! There's no way I can save them!

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.720
I need to at least escape,
or we'll all be wiped out!

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.320
Brat, how pathetic you are.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.070
What can you do in that condition?

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:08.280
Shut up! Don't get cocky just 
because you got another eye!

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.580
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, 
nope, nope! That guy's totally right!

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.280
Asta, this is impossible! 
That guy's magic is insane!

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.960
There's no way you can win!

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.040
You should hurry up and run! 
No, seriously, run away!

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.680
You mentioned earlier that one of my 
weak points is that I won't give up.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.390
It's not a weakness!

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.680
Not giving up is my only weapon!

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.190
And I'm never going to give 
up until I fulfill my wish!

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.170
No matter what!

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.770
Not giving up is a weapon?

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.580
I will show you just how 
useless that weapon is.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.040
I'll show you exactly what despair means!

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:09.770
Before I defeat you lot, I should 
probably take out the trash first.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.880
You bastard!

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.140
Mythical Beast Magic...

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.010
Don't!

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.250
Oh, dear... Big and hairy over there

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.330
must be the insane guy named Vetto 
the captain was talking about.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.090
You're way more ugly than I thought you'd be.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.840
Definitely not my type.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.930
Vanessa!

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.930
Vanessa!

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.690
Maybe I should've just passed out drunk.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.440
But you really are insane, little boy.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.760
Still...

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.880
You didn't give up, and that's why I'm here.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.450
Go on and pull me along with you!

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.660
Thanks!

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.110
I was wondering why the other 
Black Bulls liked you so much,

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.770
and I think I finally get it.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.960
Right, Captain?

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.460
That's right, kid.
Just like what Vanessa said.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.970
Because you didn't give up, Noelle,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.550
Gauche,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.720
Magna, and Luck

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.230
were all able to go beyond their limits.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.600
And... me, too.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.200
A heart that refuses to 
give up is your only weapon?

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.230
Rubbish!

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.740
Did you really think that these cobwebs

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.040
could keep a beast like me tied down?

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.690
What fun would it be if you 
actually stayed tied down?

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:08.670
Shut your mouth.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:14.790
Do you truly think you can defeat me just 
because another insect joined your cause?

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.260
Mythical Beast Magic...

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.770
I won't make it in time!

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.980
So there was still another mouse hiding?

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.440
Ugh, honestly...

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.030
You guys are so into this.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.240
Finral!

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.550
Oh, my.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.910
My juniors are working hard.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.700
That means I have to
act like a proper senior.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.040
Crap! What the heck am I doing?!

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.960
I'm gonna die!

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.470
I'm impressed you actually showed up.
Good job, Finral the wuss.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:01.640
O-Of course I showed up! 
I'm no wuss, Vanessa!

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.140
Don't give up! Don't give up! 
Don't give up! Don't give up! Don't give up!

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.980
You vermin...

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:14.150
No, you're ants. Less than vermin. 
No matter how many of you gather,

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.780
you won't even be able to scratch me.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.630
Noelle, you have enough magic 
to protect everyone, right?

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:21.740
Y-Yes.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.790
We're counting on you.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:30.090
Still... his magic is unbelievable. Honestly...

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.710
Yeah.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.610
But you can't see it, right?

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.710
Of course, I can't see it,

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.560
but I definitely feel his ki.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.930
If he manages to hit us head-on with any 
of his attacks, it'll instantly be over.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.320
It's life or death right off the bat!

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.720
It hurts, damn it! I want to cry!

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.820
If we get out of this alive, 
I'll give you a hug.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.190
A hug?!

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.820
You can cry all you want right into my bosom.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.820
For real?!

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.830
Finral's ki just blew the hell up!

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.490
Controlling guys is child's play.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.330
And for you, ordinary magic attacks 
won't work on him at all.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.960
You and your anti-magic will 
just have to take care of this.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.340
Make sure you don't let go of 
that sword, no matter what.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.340
Got it!

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.580
Go give it all you've got. 
Put your life on the line.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.310
Yeah, Asta!

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.560
I swear that we won't let you die!

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.190
Asta... Everyone...

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.700
Mythical Beast Magic...

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080
Let's go!

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.330
My long-range attacks never 
even touch the anti-magic sword.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.810
The spatial magic user just 
sends them right back at me.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.070
For a mere human,
he's quite fast and accurate.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.180
Jeez, this is scary!

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.070
But I've gotta do this!

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.070
In that case...

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.820
I'll just have to pick 
them off at close range!

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.540
You wish!

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:44.590
The power of the spatial magic and
your aura are gushing all over the place!

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.720
What?

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.640
The thread changed his trajectory...

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.250
You scuttling little insects!

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.800
I'm going to defeat you...

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.510
with this weapon!

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:59.270
Petit Clover

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.450
Petit Clover!

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.770
Service Magic

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.180
Service Magic.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.160
What's service magic?

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.400
Just like it sounds, it's magic 
that's a service to everyone.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.080
Let's give it a shot!

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.250
Okay!

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.240
All we've had lately is smelly 
and hairy guys like Vetto

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.790
hogging up all the screen time.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.550
Okay, here we go.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.460
So this is service magic!
I wonder how Mimosa's doing.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.420
Woohoo! That was a total success!

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.790
Look at those perfect bodies!

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.050
I... I... The Black Bulls—

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.810
Wh-What is this?! Stupidsta, you dumbass!

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:37.970
Why me?!

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.090
We're going to work 
together and defeat Vetto!

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.290
Finral and I will assist you, Asta.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.220
You should be able... no, 
I know you can do it!

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.170

Despair vs. Hope

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.700
Not giving up is our magic!
