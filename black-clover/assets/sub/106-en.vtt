00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.820
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.560
I'm going to unleash all my magic! 
Then all of you, this human,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.220
and I will all be done for!

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.430
Disappear! Disappear! Die, humans!

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.150
What the hell is this ki?!

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.860
Asta, Magna, and Vanessa fought Luck, 
who had reincarnated as an elf.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.720
Humans... I will make you pay!

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.350
I don't know what the 
heck you're talking about,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.120
but if we humans really 
are at fault, I'm sorry.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.370
I'm really sorry!

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.380
But for us... Luck is our precious friend!

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.720
So please... Don't take him from us!

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.090
Please!

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.670
Give him back to us!

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.950
And I'm pretty sure all those 
people who are important to you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.680
wouldn't want you to be like this!

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.090
Luck!

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.420
Their feelings for Luck

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.990
and Luck's feelings for the 
Black Bulls connected, and then...

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.410
I...

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.100
I'm...

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.210
still one of the Black Bulls, right?

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.530
Of course you are, you dumbass.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.680
Path of Revenge, Path of Atonement

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.510
Go!

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.510
Asta, Magna, Vanessa, and Luck

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.170
reunited with the other Black Bulls: 
Gordon, Grey, Henry, and Charmy.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.630
Aboard the Raging Black Bull,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.630
they raced full speed ahead 
for the royal capital.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.220
I sense them.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.270
There are three elves in the town up ahead.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.980
The Greatest City in the Common Realm
Hecairo

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.230
Member of the Blue Rose Knights
Risakka Ondell

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.230
That was pathetic.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.520
A shame, considering how 
glorious this town is.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.740
Vice Captain of the Purple Orcas
 Xerx Lügner

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.740
But even that is a mere 
shadow of what it once was.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.240
Member of the Coral Peacocks
Protobe Collina

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.240
They're just about finished.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.450
Mom! Dad!

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.210
I-It's no use... They're too powerful.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.810
Lord Xerx...

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.140
Why is the Saint of Pure Ice attacking 
the people he's supposed to protect?

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.910
Magic Knights doing something like this...

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.550
Is the Clover Kingdom finally finished?

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.500
Sol, I'm sorry... I couldn't 
protect everyone.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.860
But I won't give up until the very end!

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.590
I'm going to purify everything now.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.060
Including you filthy humans.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.310
Ice Magic...

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.870
What's the matter?

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.910
Something's charging this way.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.450
What is that? An enemy?

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.300
The humans can resist all they want.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.460
Whatever it may be, it shall not pass.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.430
Stone Magic: Ground Wall!

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.150
Re...combi...nation... Magic...

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.440
Recombination Magic: 
Raging Black Bull ~ Combat Style!

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.370
A giant...

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.910
...bull?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.160
Rescue!

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.790
La!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.130
Transformation Magic: Magic Conversion!

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.130
Ice to Water!

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.130
Stone to Sand!

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.070
Mom! Dad!

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.910
Thank you so much!

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.390
Th-Thank goodness!

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.390
Please hurry and get to safety!

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.730
That robe... Is she a Black Bull?

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.410
Don't get a big head, you humans.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.700
I'll destroy that piece 
of garbage in an instant!

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.660
Water Magic: Surging Waves!

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.770
Stone Magic: Rising Ground!

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.250
It won't connect.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.500
Our attacks are being diverted.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.240
What are you two doing?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.010
Ice Magic: Ice Slicer!

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.180
Wh-What's going on?

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.400
As long as I have any magic left,

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.270
the Black Bulls will remain unharmed!

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.820
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.550
Okay. Here... we... go...

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.830
Flame Magic: Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.710
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.750
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.910
The destructive force of our 
magic is being magnified...

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.010
...to take you down!

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.220
Not bad, hideout guy!

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.430
Great job!

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.750
Did you see just how 
powerful my new friend is?

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.630
I... totally... know... everything...

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.630
Holy crap! That was so powerful! Damn!

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.870
there... is... to... know... 
about... my... friends.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.870
You guys are so awesome! The coolest!

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.080
I'm so happy. I finally get 
to fight alongside everyone.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.650
Let's go, everyone!

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.880
Let's go, Henry!

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.050
That's enough foolishness 
from you humans!

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.430
<i>You</i> may be able to dodge this...

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.680
But this town will be blown away.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.300
Take this! Combo Magic...

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.640
Asta Cannon!

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.070
Heck yeah!

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.820
The Black Bulls are invincible!

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.590
For as long as I could remember, I felt it.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.460
There was someone sleeping inside me.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.830
It felt as though they were terribly hurt,

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.780
terribly angry,

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.860
and terribly sad.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.950
Because I felt that I needed 
to protect this weak being...

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.140
Because I knew that this 
wasn't just my body...

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.700
Because I felt as though I wasn't alone...

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.820
I was able to survive my 
painful and lonely childhood.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.850
Around the time I turned nine, 
I started to have the same dream...

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.210
Of days filled with happiness.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.450
They were your past memories.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.650
And then an ending of disloyalty... 
despair... and hatred.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.070
I believed it was my duty to protect you.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.910
And then, when I was thirteen...

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.570
I met Lord Julius.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.540
William! Join the Magic Knights!

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.550
He was rather strange, but he was 
the first person to acknowledge me.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.140
Oh, but I guess you haven't 
received your grimoire yet.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.980
In that case, I'll keep dropping by until 
you turn fifteen and get your grimoire.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.360
He was a kind and great person.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.590
I'm sure you'll become a 
magnificent Magic Knight.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.360
When I was sixteen, you awakened.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.660
Where am I?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.180
Didn't I die?

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.460
Around that time, I was working 
as a newcomer in the Gray Deer,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.470
which was led by Lord Julius.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.600
Because you had received 
a grimoire as well,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:02.020
I confirmed the fact that we 
were two souls sharing one body.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.560
We were eventually able to share 
our thoughts through our souls,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.770
and we could even swap souls.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.110
You had a mission that you 
had to complete at all costs.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.450
And that was going to make 
me betray the other person

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.450
who was most important to me, 
as well as my kingdom.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.070
You, the person I had shared my life 
and body with as if we were twins,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.130
or the person who stood at the top of

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.740
the Magic Knights and showed 
me how to live my life...

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.490
I was conflicted over who I should choose.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.660
I took both sides as I hurt my comrades.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.040
In the end, I couldn't completely choose a side

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.140
and let the two of them decide the outcome.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.730
I'm the worst.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.110
And you won.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.060
I'm so sorry, Lord Julius.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.570
Congratulations, Patry.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.160
And since your wish came true,

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.790
this is where we say goodbye.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.910
Goodbye, Patry.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.860
If possible, I...

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.850
Did I fall asleep after 
using too much of my power?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.430
My incomplete reincarnation 
is also now complete.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.390
William has now fallen into 
a deep, endless sleep.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.610
Thank you, my one and only human friend.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.590
William... Goodbye.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.210
Now there is no longer any human I cannot kill.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.790
Licht should be heading to the 
royal capital along with Raia.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.760
I must hurry, too.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.340
Clover Castle... The center of
 the humans' foolish bigotry...

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.180
It's where the royalty, 
our most hated enemies, live,

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.060
and where we shall exact our revenge.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.650
In the moment of reincarnation, 
the fear for his life,

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.660
immense hatred, and anger

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.250
made Rades's magic, which could only 
control the dead up until that point, grow.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.730
This was the perfection of true wraith magic.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.740
This evolved magic was just barely 
able to return the souls

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.260
that were about to be sacrificed 
for reincarnation to their bodies.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.940
Licht!

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.650
How dare you trick me, 
use me, and then kill me?!

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.830
You'll pay for this! You'll pay for 
this if it's the last thing I do!

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.070
Right, guys?!

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.990
Valtos!

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.700
Sally!

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.500
You got lucky. You two just barely made it.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.340
We're going to kill him together.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.050
Heck yeah!

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.840
All three of them have been freed!

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.020
Heck yeah!

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.570
Spatial magic?

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.100
You guys...

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.730
What are you doing here?

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.570
Heya, Black Bulls.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.490
I'm gonna use you guys to get my revenge.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.720
Th-The Eye of the...

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.370
They attacked our base.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:15:00.350
Are you the ones who destroyed my 
vegetable garden back at the base?!

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.590
Those who waste food shall pay, la!

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.790
Shut up!

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.530
You guys piss me off, too, but right now,
 I want to kill that bastard Licht.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.680
Huh?

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.350
He tricked me, tricked <i>us</i>, 
used us however he wanted,

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.150
and then sacrificed us for his own goals.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.980
He's going to pay for this...

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.190
No matter what, if it's the last thing I do!

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.220
Licht is heading to the royal capital.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.530
He's probably there by now.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:37.540
If we power up Valtos's spatial magic 
with Sally's Dark Magic Items,

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:42.040
we'll be able to transport 
this moving base of yours.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.700
We'd be in the royal capital in an instant.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.100
You guys want to hurry to the 
royal capital, too, don't you? Right?

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.530
Then we have the same goal.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.220
Lend me your strength.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.430
Not a bad deal, right?

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.270
I'll kill you, I'll kill you...

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.600
I'll kill you, Licht!

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.640
Judging from the mana, it feels like all 
the elves are heading to the royal capital.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.830
But isn't it too convenient that you 
just suddenly showed up to ask for help?

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.400
I see you're going to coopera—

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.080
You're so annoying!

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.700
What?!

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.000
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.230
We have the same goal?! 
It's not the same at all!

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.160
Wha?

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.770
We're fighting to protect!

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.010
We're not helping anyone 
for the sake of revenge!

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.930
More importantly...

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:41.470
You're the guy who attacked all those 
innocent people at the royal capital before!

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.790
And now you want revenge? 
You can't be serious!

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.420
"Revenge," my ass, you stupid jerk!

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.690
First, you need to atone for everything!

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.240
From now on, you're going 
to help save the kingdom!

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.540
Huh?! You can't be serious, you bastard!

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.370
I'm totally serious!

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.500
With that, we're in a hurry to get to 
the royal capital, so thanks for your help!

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.990
Huh?! Who died and made you the boss?!

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.460
This deal is null and void! Null and void!

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.930
You're not getting away! 
You're gonna help us now!

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.890
Why are you so strong, damn it?!

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.050
That's so Asta.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.640
Hell yeah, Asta! You get him!

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.050
But hey, if we're just heading to the 
royal capital, do we really need that guy?

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.130
Oh, good point.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.980
Huh?!

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.660
Luck's exactly right. I'll just 
make a deal with these two.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.610
You bastard!

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.460
Hey! What do you think about all this?

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.700
I...

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:45.770
I just want to see Master Licht 
again and find out the truth.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.460
I'll help you for that reason.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.500
If Master Licht's words were nothing but lies,

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.120
then I am nothing more than a sinner.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.970
Seeking atonement might be good for me.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.750
Valtos, you jerk!

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.230
S-Sally! You want revenge, too, don't you?!

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.620
I don't have my glasses, so I can't see too well.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.500
Who cares about your glasses right now?!

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.970
I was only with Master Licht because he 
let me do all the experiments I wanted.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.670
The Magic Knights always get in my way.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.870
But I guess I'm happy that I'm 
alive again and can do my research.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.790
I saw a whole bunch of stuff when I was dying,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.140
so I think I'm about to have 
some kind of breakthrough!

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.460
You're only alive again because of me, Sally!

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.100
Yeah, I guess. Thanks, Rades.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.110
You wanted to examine my body, right?!

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.920
If you help us out and this battle ends,
 you can examine me all you want!

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.720
Huh?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.860
Really, Asta?! Yay!

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.650
On one condition. 
Nothing that hurts really bad!

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.610
Aw...

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.770
Don't "Aw..." me!

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.430
You can do all the experiments 
and research you want,

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.550
as long as you don't harm or bother anyone!

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.650
Actually, if you did research 
that'd help everyone out,

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.200
we'd all be happy to help!

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.790
That'd make you happy, too, right?

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.220
I don't really get it,

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.570
but if that'll let me do more research,
 I guess I'll do that.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.790
Yeah, you should!

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.680
You don't need any anesthesia 
when I cut you apart, right?

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.820
Yes, I do!

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.830
You can't be serious, Sally!

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.800
I'm the one who brought you back to life!

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.800
Did you have enough time to reflect?

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.810
Eat up. You're nothing but skin and bones.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.570
La? La?

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.380
Th-This is... My magic is recovering.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.590
What?! That's amazing!

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.320
I'm starving! Gimme, please!

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.840
No one can fight on an empty stomach!

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.080
Eat up!

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:53.460
It's so yummy! I want to dissect 
something even more now!

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.960
Make sure you use anesthesia, okay?!

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.130
Y-You jerks...

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.860
Well? Feel like saving the kingdom yet?

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.430
Go on... You know you're hungry.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.140
La?

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.290
It's so good. My magic's recovering.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.500
And I feel more energetic. 
Nothing beats eating with friends!

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.460
I can't imagine why you wouldn't 
want to eat something so yummy.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.420
This is so good! So fricking good!

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.830
Yeah! I feel totally motivated now.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.660
De...li...cious.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.090
I'm so happy I'm alive.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.090
Oh, wait, you were dead up until a while ago?

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.830
The only reason I'm able to eat 
yummy things is because I'm alive!

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.380
Right?

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.890
Fine!

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.130
I'll go to the royal capital with you!

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.450
But I'm not gonna do whatever you want me to!

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.390
I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want!

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.020
You're supposed to ask us to take you with us!

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.610
Too bad! You're gonna 
save the kingdom with us!

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.900
Shut up!

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.790
Go on, eat up! There's plenty 
more where that came from, la!

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.140
Come on! Hurry up and eat so 
you can get back on your feet!

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.630
Recover all your magic, and let's 
head to the royal capital!

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.260
Yeah!

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.740
Damn it!

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.430
Petit Clover

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.900
Petit Clover!

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.930
Rades,
Sally,
Valtos

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.490
Rades.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.410
Sally.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.930
Valtos.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.700
We're fighting to protect!

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.140
We're not helping anyone 
for the sake of revenge!

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.220
Take this!

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.860
Clover Twist!

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.320
Reverse Clover Hold!

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.320
Clover Backbreaker!

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.320
Clover Hold!

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.540
Tombstone Clover Driver!

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:24.140
One, two, three, four, 
five, six, seven, eight...

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.470
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.530
Maybe I won't have to use anesthesia now!

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.010
I think I'll give it a try!

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.140
Piss off!

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.960
Not yet!

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.800
Clover OLAP!

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:34.180
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, 
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.270
I can dissect you now without 
using anesthesia, right?

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.410
Heck yes!

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.180
Don't "Heck yes!" me!

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.710
And what the hell are you even counting?!

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.930
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen...
