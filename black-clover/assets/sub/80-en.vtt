00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.110
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.180
It's the first round of the second stage 
of the Royal Knights Selection Exam.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.180
Sol's attack left Mimosa unable to move.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.510
Asta was forced to face off with Magna, 
who came to attack their crystal on his own.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.400
Also...

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.280
What do you think you're doing without me?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.450
Crap! I'm not gonna be able 
to take both of them on!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.820
The one who saved Asta was a 
mysterious mage named Xerx.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.540
Attack the cherry blossom guy,
you little shit!

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.410
I'll take care of this in an instant!

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.920
And that instant's all I need!

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.210
With the help of Mimosa's plant spell that 
lets her control the enemy's movements,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.290
Asta and the rest of B Team 
were able to claim victory.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.150
And now, the destined battle between the
brothers Finral and Langris is about to begin.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.030
Special Little Brother
 vs.
 Failed Big Brother

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.840
There you go.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.740
Th-Thank you, Vanessa.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.220
That's perfect! You look awesome!

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.180
Could you do mine, too?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.250
You already lost, though.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.330
It looks fine. You look like 
the failure that you are.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.800
What?! Who're you calling a failure?!

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.730
Now, now. Try to stay calm, Magna.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.200
Like a loser should.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.300
You bastard! I'm gonna kill you!

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.700
I'm so gonna kill you!

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.540
Good! Let's do this now!

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.900
Wait, you guys—

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.800
As I thought, that guy is a very 
skilled flame magic caster.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.650
The lightning guy is also 
one to look out for.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.420
I know.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.220
Luck is trying to cheer him up...

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.540
La, la. Gimme more noms.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.160
My, aren't you a hungry little one?

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.120
Marie... Marie... Always Marie.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.090
What's going on over there?

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.030
The Black Bulls, huh?

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.420
I guess bulls will be bulls.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.370
Come on, you guys, stop! 
This is embarrassing!

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.560
Why are you so stiff?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.060
I'm sure this next match

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.360
will be complicated for you, 
given who you're up against.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.170
Uh... Y-Yeah, I guess.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.410
Not to mention, I've never beaten 
my little brother in anything.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.660
Don't worry.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.620
I've fought alongside you, so I know.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.410
You changed after meeting Asta.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.080
The same goes for me.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.670
I was able to face something hidden deep
 within my heart that I'd been ignoring.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.020
You're not going to lose so easily now.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.180
Now get out there and show everyone 
how cool you are. Just like your hair.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.680
Vanessa...

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.790
You've got this, Finral!

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.620
Don't lose like Magna, and come fight me.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.570
Yeah! Don't lose like— 
The hell did you say?!

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.720
I-I'm rooting for you, too!

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.990
You've got this. You've got this. You've got this. 
You've got this. You've got this. You've got this...

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.900
You'd better not embarrass 
the rest of the squad.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.990
Yeah.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.990
Charmy... Even Gauche.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.750
Thanks, you guys. I'm so happy 
I joined the Black Bu—

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.540
Please, more noms.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.590
I want to see Marie as soon as possible, 
so win this in one second.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.190
But I have seniority...

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.620
I'm sure Captain Yami's cheering 
you on from the base, too.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.330
Yeah. He seemed a bit antsy this morning.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.770
He said his stomach was acting up, but...

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.270
I'm sure he just wants to see you 
work hard even without his help.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.770
Those guys must be going beyond their 
limits and kicking ass right about now.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.580
I'm kicking ass, too.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.160
This one's gonna be a killer.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.660
And damn it, kid! I told you to 
restock the damn toilet paper!

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.420
Good grief. As if you could 
actually defeat me, Brother.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.650
Langris, I managed to change 
after meeting my friends.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.000
We'll be the ones who win this.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.010
Whatever. Don't blame me for 
whatever happens, all right?

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.640
Would you let me handle him?

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.540
I don't see why not.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.330
A battle between brothers, eh?

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.000
I also want to fight my 
brother for real one day.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.980
I accept your passionate request!

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.180
Bah-ha!

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.800
I'm going to burn the image 
of me gallantly riding

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.180
my Shooting Star into everyone's eyes!

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.990
You will not lay a single 
finger on our crystal!

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.770
It's finally starting!

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.790
Now I'm getting nervous.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.290
Finral, I know you can win this.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.430
And now,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.290
E Team: Leopold, Hamon, and Finral 
versus G Team: Langris, Fragil, and Sekke.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
Fragil

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
Langris

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
Sekke

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
G Team

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
Leopold

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
Finral

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
Hamon

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.050
E Team

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.470
Round two of stage two, begin!

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.770
You two concentrate on 
destroying the enemy crystal.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.840
Leave it to me.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.310
Let's find out where it is.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.450
Glass Magic: Verre Détection.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.320
I can see every inch of this battle stage 
as the light reflects off the glass.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.290
It will take a little while, but I will 
definitely be able to find the enemy's crystal.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.070
I expect you to take me all the way 
to the enemy base again, Mr. Bah-ha.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.810
Leave it to me! Also, I'm Sekke.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.900
Please call me Sekke.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.400
You can even call me Sek, bah-ha.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.220
Understood, Mr. Bah-ha.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.820
Bah-ha. No, really, it's Sekke!

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.560
Please call me Sekke!

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.810
You brought shame upon the House of Vaude.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.350
There's no way you can defeat me, Brother.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.700
You see, you aren't my child.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.180
So the only one that I love 
is my dear little Langris.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.330
Mother, it's a bit cruel to be so blunt.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.790
What is that pathetically weak spell?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.760
Learn from Langris's attack spells!

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.970
Goodness.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.420
I see my dear little Langris is better 
than you at both academics and sports.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.300
You're so amazing, my dear little Langris.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.730
As I should expect from my own child.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.570
What are you doing, Finral?

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.190
You disgrace the Vaude name!

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:32.070
How pathetic. He's older than me, but there's 
not one thing he can do better than me.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.340
What? A fiancée?

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.320
Yes.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:40.600
Finnes Calmreich

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.900
This is Lady Finnes, the fiancée of 
the next head of the House of Vaude.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.630
Good day to you.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.690
Her chronic illness keeps 
her from going out often,

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.940
but the king is her great uncle, 
so she comes from a prestigious family

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.420
and has splendid magic.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.610
So basically, in the future, 
this woman and I will...

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.930
Ugh. What a dull-looking woman.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.100
My dear little Langris, 
make sure you get along with her.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.190
She's going to be your bride someday.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.900
Of course!

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.210
Seriously... When I become 
the lord of this house,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.080
I'll be able to bring us fame 
like they've never seen.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.890
Ugh... I'm so bored.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:31.340
I'm very sorry that you got stuck with a 
fiancée who's sickly and older than you.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.700
N-Not at all! 
You're b-b-beautiful, Miss Finnes.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.180
It's just... I'm not the one who'll become 
the next head of the House of Vaude.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.550
Huh?

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.050
My little brother is better 
at everything than me,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.150
so he'll be able to make you happy.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.660
His magic is amazing, 
and he's a very decisive person.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.280
I'm just a failure.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.620
Exactly. There's not a single 
thing he can beat me i—

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.120
That's not true.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120
Huh?

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.130
I've only met you a few times, but I can tell.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.110
You're a very kind person.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.880
To me, you're a much more 
wonderful mage, Finral.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.800
O-Oh, stop! D-Don't tease me like that!

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.490
Oh, but I wasn't teasing you at all.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.110
Who do you think you are, you dull woman?

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.600
You have the nerve to call me 
inferior to my brother?

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.420
Don't be ridiculous.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.610
That loser left the family because 
he couldn't handle the pressure.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.980
He's not better than me at anything!
Not a single thing!

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.360
Bah-ha! Found it!

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.980
Here he comes. As we planned, 
we'll leave him to you, Finral.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.410
Just as a reminder...
Don't blame me if you lose any limbs.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.290
I'll end this in a single blow!

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.420
What?!

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:03.800
I tested this out earlier with another 
spatial magic user, Cob, and found out...

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.390
that when spatial magics collide,

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.880
the mana currents collide 
and cancel each other out!

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.020
Langris, we're the ones who are going to win!

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.910
Th-That's awesome!

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.370
You can cancel out spatial 
magic with spatial magic?

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.480
Way to go, Finral!

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.020
H-He's like a completely different person!

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.520
Keep it up, ya jerk!

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.060
Marie's waiting. Hurry up and win.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.780
I get to have more yummy noms, la!

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.260
Bah-ha, ha-bah?!

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.930
Excellent work, Finral! That was effective!

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.270
Hamon, where's the enemy team's crystal?

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.860
I've finally found it!

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.820
It's deep within that tower.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.320
All right, I'm counting on you two!

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.660
Th-This isn't good, bah-ha!

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.160
Who do you think you are, Brother? 
I'll remind you of your place!

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.750
Give it up!

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.880
You came in.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.260
This is...

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.760
Snow Magic: Phantom Snow Garden.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.370
This spell forces your senses to sleep.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.020
You cannot attack me effectively any longer.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.250
I'm not tired at all... This is nothing!

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.280
Especially compared to my older sister's 
training, which could leave you dead!

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.540
Honestly, you still have much to learn.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.790
Yeah! You're so valiant, Hamon!

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.720
I can still eat plenty...

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.420
You're talking about yourself?!

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.760
You should give up and fall asleep, too.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.760
This is...

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.140
I swore upon the symbol on my forehead...

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.600
that I would surpass my brother someday!

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.560
And that means I can't lose in a place like this!

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.270
Concentrate!

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.080
Mana Skin!

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.280
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.560
His senses are sharp!

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.040
He enveloped himself in mana 
and canceled my spell.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.540
More! I need to concentrate more!

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.050
I won't last much longer, Langris.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.220
Bah-ha!

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:59.040
A spatial magic battle! 
You don't see that every day!

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.860
Ah, so that is Finnes's fiancé, Langris.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.830
Not bad at all.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.530
He's still no match for me, though.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.180
Keep it up, Finral!

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.830
It's only a matter of time before 
their crystal is destroyed!

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:17.370
I never thought you'd become 
my natural enemy, Brother.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.460
Do you plan on defending 
until our crystal breaks?

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.380
I'm not sure that'll be so easy!

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.380
It might not be. That's why...

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.260
I'm going to use a new spell!

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.520
Bah-ha! What in the world is that slow spell?

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.370
Like you could hit my badass self right now!

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.110
What? Homing?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.750
That's no match for my invincible 
Sekke Magnum Cannonball!

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.830
H-He disappeared?!

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.420
This is pretty pathetic, even for me.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.340
I trained so hard, but I never 
could learn a single attack spell.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.340
It's not an attack spell?

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.940
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.980
It follows the enemy, 
and once it makes contact,

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.750
it transports them to another location.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.810
It's the applied version of 
the spell I usually use.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:25.930
This way, he can get rid of 
enemies without hurting them!

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.030
He must be a kind soul.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.010
You're so awesome, Finral!

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.620
B-But where did he go?

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.840
It just went back in. Can I kill you now?

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.840
Bah-ha... I'm dead.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.970
Langris, it's only a matter of time 
before your crystal is destroyed.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.140
I don't want to hurt you!

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.650
If you insist on continuing, I'll have 
to use this spell to make you leave.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.630
<i>Who</i> are you worried about?

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.380
You constantly get on my nerves, Brother.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.950
Who would've thought that our special 
reserve spells would be similar?

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.220
How dare you make me use my grimoire's magic?!

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:45.650
There isn't a single thing 
you can beat me at, Brother!

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.900
Th-This ominous feeling... 
I've felt this somewhere before!

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.990
Th-This mana...

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.240
This is...

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.750
This doesn't feel very pleasant.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.500
As I figured...

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.500
It's over, Brother!

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.250
Langris!

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:16.350
Th-This immense magical power... 
I already know I don't stand a chance.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.010
But this is...

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.020
This nauseating magic is like...

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.020
Who are you?

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.840
Finral!

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.730
If that attack hits him...

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.810
Run!

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.690
No. He's Langris.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.070
He's my little brother.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.200
You may not like it, but we're similar.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.450
Our mothers are different, but in the end...

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.950
I never did anything that made 
me seem like a big brother.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.710
I left our family and tried 
to forget everything.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.490
But I just couldn't. 
Langris, no matter what you think...

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.840
You're my little brother!

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:14.230
Langris, stop it! If you keep this up, 
I have a feeling you won't be you anymore!

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.090
What could you possibly 
know about me, Brother?

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.270
You left everything behind!

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.490
You're a coward who can't even hurt people!

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.250
Don't you dare try to act 
like my big brother now!

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.750
I'll stop you!

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.900
Finral!

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.400
G-G Team wins!

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.500
How do you like that? 
There's nothing you can beat me at!

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.940
Young Master Finral is so friendly and kind, 
isn't he? He has a lot of friends, too.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:23.560
Young Master Langris is... Well, it's obvious
 that he looks down on people, you know?

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.430
To me, you're a much more 
wonderful mage, Finral.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.690
Even I want someone that kind to...

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.190
Langris!

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.340
Working too hard all the time 
hurts after a while, doesn't it?

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.490
Come goof off with your 
big brother once in a while!

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.870
There's a festival going on nearby!

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.410
Why is he nice to me, too?

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.540
Stop it.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.440
Learn from Langris!

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.670
My dear little Langris is so amazing.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.530
I'm better than you are. That's why 
Mother and Father are kind to me.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:06.050
I have to beat him at everything! 
Otherwise, I'll... I'll...

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.410
Hey, the match is over.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.560
Wh-What's he doing?

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.360
Disappear.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.040
Finral!

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.420
These wounds are awful.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.710
At this rate...

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.130
Hey!

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.130
Just try and do something else.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.970
Forget the match. We'll kill you.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.100
You bastard...

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.050
How dare you do that to Finral?!

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.360
Th-This is too awful!

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.850
You actually pissed me off.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.350
I won't forgive you!

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.980
Oh?

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.350
There's something wrong with you!

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.010
The match was already over!

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.540
Petit Clover

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.320
Petit Clover!

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:42.040
Hairstyle

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.030
Hairstyle.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.380
That new spell is awesome! 
Fallen Angel's Weightlifting!

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.890
That's Fallen Angel's Wingbeat.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.840
I mean, I know when I need to get tough.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.690
It's the result of trying different things.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.600
So is your new hairstyle also 
from trying different things?

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.930
Oh, really?

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.150
Huh? Wait, no...

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.830
I'm sure you tried out a regent pompadour.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.640
As well as Captain Yami's hairstyle.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.900
And soft serve hair, la!

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.940
That's poo—

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.990
This looks pretty strong!

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.790
If you do Marie's hairstyle, I'll kill you.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.670
I-I like this hairstyle.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.710
I think this one is better.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.890
I-It's just a better option, that's all.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.660
How about something a bit more mature?

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.510
This is the hairstyle for when 
you go beyond your limits!

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.250
Uh, seriously...

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.640
I wanted to see this 
hairstyle on you, Finral!

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.170
When it comes to me in this series, 
my hair should be the least of your worries!

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.980
Praise me!

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.730
Your daring and resolute king presents...

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:51.650

 The Life of a Certain Man

Praise me!
