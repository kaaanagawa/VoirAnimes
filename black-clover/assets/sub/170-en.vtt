00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.190
The Faraway Future

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.200
Devils are born in the underworld.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.440
From the moment they're born, devils have 
an established spot in the pecking order

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.870
that cannot be overturned.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.340
Since I was born with no magic, 
I was definitely at the very bottom.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.340
How do you like that?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.840
I spent every day covered in my own blood.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.910
You're so weak, we can't 
even kill time with you.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.930
If only <i>that</i> didn't exist.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.930
All devils want to go to the human world.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.650
But because the gates of the 
underworld block their way,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.520
the powerful oppress the weak,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.630
and then the weak oppress those 
who are even weaker to pass the time.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.490
That's how shitty that world is.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.780
Go on. Cry and scream like you usually do.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.330
I didn't care about anything anymore.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.770
Not even about dying.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.580
Why, you little... Who do you think you are?!

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.010
I thought I'd crash into the gates, 
and my body would shatter into pieces.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.980
But because I had no magic, 
I slipped right through the gates

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.450
and actually ended up in the human world.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.820
Maybe it was because I had 
no magic and was helpless...

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.950
Or maybe it was because I was so beat-up...

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.050
But I had no feelings toward 
the humans whatsoever.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.080
However...

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.210
Look over there! Those horns... Could he be...

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.340
A devil! He's going to curse us!

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.480
We need to contact the Magic Knights!

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.780
Because I'm a devil, I was chased down 
by humans with powerful magic.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.600
My body stopped moving, 
and I was ready to accept my death.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.880
At last... this worthless life will be over.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.660
Hey, you're awake? Oh, thank goodness!

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.580
My name is Licita. Nice to meet you!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.040
This is my house.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.550
Don't worry. No one else knows you're here.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.650
This is my magic.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.090
As long as something lacks mana, I can 
put it into and take it out of containers.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.810
I found you while I was gathering 
firewood and carried you back in this.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.810
But talk about a surprise!

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.240
The other day, I found a 
five-leaf-clover grimoire,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.320
but I didn't think I'd 
actually run into a devil!

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.660
You're... not scared of me?

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.340
Why would I be scared of an injured child?

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.900
Besides, you don't have 
any magic, and you're so weak.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.670
Still, I'm a devil.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.480
Tsk, tsk, tsk...

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.200
I can give you a run for your money 
when it comes to being loathed.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.360
My body robs magic and life 
from whatever's near me.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.650
Just like that.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.110
So I live out here by myself, away from 
the village, so I won't bother anyone.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.980
But wait!

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.510
Maybe it's because you're 
a devil without any magic,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.880
but it looks like I'm not 
stealing away your mana or life.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.490
Don't you think...

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.740
this is destiny?!

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.250
You should totally be my kid!

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.750
Huh?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.920
A devil... adopted as a human's child?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.240
I couldn't wrap my head 
around what she was saying.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.130
But...

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.930
Come on! This way!

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.250
Woo-hoo! Dinner secured!

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.180
That human...

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.750
Isn't this beautiful?

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.940
Yeah...

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.150
For someone like me who was 
born in a dark, shitty hellhole,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.530
tormented for being a devil with no magic,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.440
and who cursed the fact that I was ever born...

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.730
She changed my world.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.200
Just because you're a devil doesn't 
automatically make you a bad guy!

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.000
Because...

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.380
You're not a bad guy!

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.290
You saved me from the 
suffering of being all alone.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.390
Thanks, Liebe!

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.640
I... did... that?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.660
Liebe! What's wrong, Liebe?!

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.290
I... am...

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.440
Lucifero!

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.760
To think there'd be a devil 
out in the human world

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.220
without making a contract with a human.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.160
I'm glad I decided to kill 
some time looking for you.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.260
One of the highest-ranked devils?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.170
My body won't do what I want it to...

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.660
What an excellent find!

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:52.200
I'll use him and try to find a way to 
manifest my own body in the human wor—

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.430
Who the heck are you?! Get out of Liebe's body!

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.490
Foolish human.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.660
Even though I cannot use most of my powers,
 you're still no match for...

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.860
She's... draining my mana?

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.120
Insolent human... You must have a death wish!

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.320
No...

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.820
I won't let go!

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.100
I'm never...

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.490
letting go again!

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.200
I won't...

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.130
I won't let you...

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.850
take my son!

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.420
Inconceivable... To think a human 
like her would get in my way...

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.570
But I can meddle with a lower devil anywhere.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.230
I shall return.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.380
L-Licita...

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.240
I'm sorry... I'm not very bright...

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.840
This was the only way I could think 
of to protect you from that guy.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.640
I'm going to use my magic to 
seal you into this grimoire.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:26.770
By the time you emerge, I'm sure 
you'll have grown big and strong.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.240
Live, Liebe...

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.760
My beloved son.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.290
Mom!

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.060
Hurry up...

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.650
and hand over that body!

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.350
This ki... is filled with an 
insane amount of rage and hatred.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.020
And...

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.150
Sadness.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.740
You must have your reasons, too.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.920
Then I'll accept your feelings and fight...

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.010
And I'll win!

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.760
You can't be serious!

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.100
You're missing an arm and don't 
have any magic! Like you could win!

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.490
I'm totally serious! 
I'm gonna win with these muscles!

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.900
The true nature of the 
anti-magic that the devil uses

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.100
is the power to nullify magic.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.540
Since Asta can't use magic anyway, 
this doesn't put him at a disadvantage.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.750
But...

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.900
That's great, but I'm not losing!

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.980
Captain Yami's katana!

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.330
Without my powers, these would 
just be rusted hunks of metal!

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.680
No matter how physically skilled you are,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.280
you don't have any magic, 
so you can't use spatial transfer!

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.290
And you can't shatter steel!

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.750
You'd stand no chance against a 
higher devil's magical powers!

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.930
You'd never be able to win!

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.600
I was sealed within the five-leaf 
grimoire and unable to escape.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.430
They won't get away with this...
I'll kill them.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.250
I'll kill all of them!

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.350
I hate them...

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.580
I'll kill them!

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.820
So I spent all of my time cursing 
Lucifero and the other devils, and then...

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.570
I gained the power of anti-magic, 
the power to nullify magic.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.440
I'm going to use my powers to get revenge!

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:38.960
And that was when the five-leaf 
grimoire chose a human.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.270
By some twist of fate, 
he was also born with no magic.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.810
It looks like I'll have to 
use this human as a host

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.680
to come back out into the human world again.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.100
Even if I have to steal 
his body, I'm going to...

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:00.450
Every single devil is a piece of shit!

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.140
And that's exactly why I'm going 
to kill every last one of them!

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:10.160
Even if I have to steal your body,
 my hatred is going to win!

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.560
I'm finally starting to understand you.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.880
That must be how you really feel!

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.130
What are you—

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:38.220
You can't use magic or anti-magic... 
So what the hell can you possibly do?!

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.740
As long as I concentrated and read your ki,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.630
your movements with those swords 
were super easy to read!

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.100
You're right. I don't have any magic.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.050
And without you, I can't even use anti-magic.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:09.850
But I have strong, unbeatable feelings,
along with all the people I've met!

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.980
I was taken in at the church at 
Hage Village the same day as Yuno,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.930
and I didn't have a lick of mana.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.380
On top of that, Yuno's hot and a genius!

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:25.940
But still, he's my rival, and we promised 
to see who would become the Wizard King!

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.880
And that's exactly why I was able to keep 
getting stronger so I wouldn't lose!

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.050
Because I met Captain Yami 
at the entrance exam...

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.130
Because I met the rest of the Black Bulls...

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.610
I am who I am today!

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.080
That's not all!

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.240
I've met so many people up until now!

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.590
I fought so many enemies.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.300
Some of them even became 
my friends after we fought,

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:55.590
and some didn't... but I won't forget them!
 I won't forget any of them!

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.350
All of these encounters 
helped make me who I am!

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.400
Merit that proves they are the best.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.860
Why are you taking forever 
over there, Asta?

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.200
I can't win this one without you...

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.700
Asta!

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.880
This little...

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.920
Even after the five-leaf grimoire appeared, 
and I was able to use anti-magic...

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.030
This whole time!

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.190
In order to be like

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:04.500
all of the magical swordsmen
I'd fought alongside and against...

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.010
I kept training!

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.780
Is that your limit?

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.040
I know you can do better than that, Asta!

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.200
Yeah!

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.400
No matter how hard you train, 
your body still has limits.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.650
You still don't stand a chance 
against powerful magic.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.630
But...

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.230
It looks like all that hard 
work wasn't for naught.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.940
You're not just fighting against 
some guy who can't use magic.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.560
You're fighting against a guy 
who can't use magic...

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.950
and has fought against countless 
powerful warriors!

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.450
There's no way I can lose... 
I spent so much time cursing them!

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.860
All alone...

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:22.290
All—

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.720
I... win!

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.440
Well done.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.580
Now the preparations for the 
devil-binding ritual are complete.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.710
You will make a contract with this devil that 
gives you complete dominance over him,

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.560
and you will make him your servant.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.710
Just think, "Obey me."

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.820
Then he will follow your every order.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.340
He'll be able to aid you as your familiar.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.220
That is the path you should take 
to become the ultimate warrior.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.660
I see. In that case...

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.110
Let's be friends!

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.990
Huh?

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.620
What? Devils don't even 
know what friends are?

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.620
Friends are like, uh...

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.790
Hold on a second. Are you trying to 
make an equal contract with that devil?

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.860
Yeah!

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:58.260
I said this before we fought, but he's 
the reason I was able to fight until now!

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.060
But I didn't know anything about him, 
even though we'd been together all that time.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.580
I want to know even more about him!

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.770
So first, we need to be friends!

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.990
What are you talking about?

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.060
There's no guarantee that 
this devil will listen to you.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.480
There's not a single merit 
in a contract like that.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.490
Nah, I mean...

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.910
He wasn't fighting seriously to begin with.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.710
He kept saying "kill" and stuff, 
but he was definitely holding back.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.570
You can't actually kill anyone, can you?

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.900
You're someone who can hate or be 
sad for someone else's sake, right?

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.270
That's why we can get along!

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.220
And that's why I want us to be equals!

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.840
This isn't a devil-binding ritual.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.230
It's, uh... Oh! A devil-befriending ritual!

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.960
He's a real idiot, Mister Nacht.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:54.770
He sure is.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.200
And it seems like we want to 
take down the same guys!

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.110
Let's beat down the bad guys together!

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.200
You and me!

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.400
Yeah, I can't believe how 
unbelievably stupid you are.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.820
I don't know if destiny 
actually exists... But he's...

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.180
Hey, by the way, what's your name?

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.900
Hey, by the way, what's your name?

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.010
Name?

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.930
What? You don't have one?

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.950
Then maybe I'll just give you one myself!

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.040
Liebe!

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.950
Starting today, you're Liebe!

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.950
He really is...

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.170
Licita's kid.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.960
I'm... Liebe.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.390
The heck is this thing?

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.430
My right arm is back!

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.660
Thanks so much!

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.300
The contract is complete.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.760
Unbelievable. That contract 
was unprecedented.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.790
I never imagined you'd be such a fool.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.110
However...

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.830
You chose what was right.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.210
But that doesn't mean people who 
are right will always be rewarded.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.250
So you need to get stronger,

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.900
to keep yourself from losing to unjust evil.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.260
Are you prepared to become the 
strongest in the next two days?

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.430
Yeah!

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.850
Loropechika... I'm going to 
save you, no matter what.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.900
Okay, everyone! Let's do this!

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.410
We're gonna do this.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.140
If the enemy is tremendously strong,

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.320
then we'll just surpass our limits!

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.420
Because we're the Black Bulls! Right, Yami?

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.640
I've been doing everything 
I can to defeat Zenon.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.620
But as for the actual results...

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.450
Why don't you stop hiding and just come out?

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.510
I thought maybe you could use someone 
with spatial magic to spar with.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.680
I suppose I should help you 
out with your training, huh?

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.650
As much as I'd like to handle this on my own,

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.150
this is something that affects 
all of the Golden Dawn.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.670
You've become stronger, too, haven't you?

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.790
So I will gladly accept your offer.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.590
You're still an insolent brat,

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.170
but it looks like you're able to 
be a bit more straightforward now.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.730
I'm going to save Captain Vangeance.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.930
All right! Just wait, Captain Yami!

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.420
No matter how powerful they are,
 I'm gonna defeat them...

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.830
and protect this world!

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:13.320
In this world where magic is everything, 
there was one boy who couldn't use magic.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.460
But he never let that hold him back.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.040
He trained through blood, sweat, and tears,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.280
and became stronger with his childhood rival...

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.590
to one day become the Wizard King.
