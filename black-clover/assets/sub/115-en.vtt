00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.810
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.770
Light Creation Magic: 
Light Swords of Conviction.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.810
Copy Light Magic: 
Light Swords of Conviction.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.060
Mana Zone: Spirit's Hushed Dance.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.520
Again!

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.530
I don't know if it's a magic stone 
or not, but that belongs to me.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.240
Give it back!

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.120
Nice job, Ronne!

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.910
Now... we'll finally make things right.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.230
Yeah.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.710
I can tell when someone's lying.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.220
Why was what you just said a lie, Ronne?

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.600
Raia?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.680
Who the hell are you?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.010
Don't tell me this reincarnation is...

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.690
Mastermind

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.420
Because he betrayed us, we elves 
were destroyed by the humans.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.350
But because I can see through lies, I knew...

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.780
that he didn't actually betray us.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.410
But I didn't tell everyone that.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.520
Because I didn't want them to lose any 
of their hatred for the humans.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.400
I wanted to see him one more time, 
no matter how many lies I had to tell.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.610
That was my disloyalty.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.660
And I guess I get a huge hole 
in my chest for that.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.000
But what the hell is this thing that 
just made this hole in my chest?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.230
They're the biggest liar of all.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.510
How long were they acting like Ronne? 
How long had they blended in with us?

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.510
Raia!

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.810
Raia! Raia!

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.060
What's the meaning of this, Ronne?!

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.320
The three leaves of the clover
 represent faith, hope, and love.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.710
Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.830
And...

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.270
Within a fifth leaf...

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.620
resides a demon.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.420
This reminds me...

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.630
of the day I took advantage 
of the bond between

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.960
the two mages chosen 
by the four-leaf grimoires,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.670
and created a grimoire of despair.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.060
I can finally obtain what 
should've been mine.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.100
This magic doesn't belong to an elf!

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.660
This Shadow Palace, which lies 
between this world and the next...

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.350
And the spell of the magic 
stones that can draw out

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.490
what I desire from the land of the dead...

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.310
Welcome home.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.800
I'm back.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.520
Ronne!

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.210
What is this cold, pitch-black magic?

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.060
Don't tell me he's...

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.100
A demon!

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.090
What in the world is that creature?

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.850
Thought it's still incomplete, I haven't
 been in my own body in centuries.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.690
What a wonderful feeling.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.860
Elf that was chosen by a 
four-leaf grimoire, I commend you.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.610
I praise you from the bottom of my heart

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.750
for everything you've done up to this point, 
as well as the results you have shown me.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.630
And now, I shall have you taste the 
depths of despair, like he did back then.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.670
What... are you talking about?

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.430
What's... going on?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.770
That day, the one who tricked the 
humans into destroying the elves

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.770
was me!

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.570
The humans were easy to manipulate,
 as they wanted power.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.780
We can come to understand each other.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.860
And then you lot managed to let me fool 
you in the most amusing way, too.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.530
The revenge went according to plan.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.080
All of you are fools!

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.210
How dare you?!

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.090
"Return."

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.770
Hey! That body belongs to Captain Vangeance.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.420
I won't let you die like that.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.690
I'd prefer to deal with you later, if possible.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.910
You can't be serious. 
You just showed up out of nowhere.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.410
Though I'm very aware that 
you're nothing more than trash.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.520
If all I have to do is destroy 
you to end all of this,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.910
so be it!

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.420
Mana Zone: Spirit Storm!

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.170
Vacuum Wall.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.840
What?!

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.340
Everything is meaningless 
before my word soul magic.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.090
Word soul magic?

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.600
His magic is insane!

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.530
Now that I'm stronger, I can tell.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.850
I can't beat this guy.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.350
Tch.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.610
At least, not alone!

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.610
Yuno!

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.610
Took you long enough, Asta.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.330
What in the world

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.870
is going on here?

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.990
And what is that strange creature?

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.580
What the heck is that creepy black thing?!

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.760
But... I get the feeling that I sorta know.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.620
I see that some uninvited guests have arrived.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.800
Well, I'll leave them alone 
for now. More importantly...

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.470
"Come here."

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.520
Word soul magic...

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.600
Whatever he says becomes a reality.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.990
Is that how he recreated 
Ronne's switching magic, too?

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.110
Don't toy with me!

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.160
Light Creation Magic: Light Whip of—

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.990
"Vanish."

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.490
"Iron Spears."

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.630
Patry...

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.500
Asta! That creepy black 
thing is behind all of this!

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.760
Yeah, I figured!

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.800
"Storm of Blades."

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.340
There are physical weapons mixed in?

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.020
I can't erase them with my anti-magic!

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.910
Damn it... It's taking all 
I have just to evade them!

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.910
"Vacuum Wall."

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.460
"Be crushed."

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.790
"Smashed."

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.170
"Broken to pieces."

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.920
"Riddled with holes."

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.890
Asta! Yuno!

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.570
I will not allow anyone to get in my way.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.670
Are you awake?

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:42.230
Thanks to you, the time that had stopped
 for me will finally begin moving again.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.410
I commend you, hero.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.510
Five centuries ago, they got in my way,

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.920
and though I was close, my incarnation failed.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.960
What... are you talking about?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.220
You were the next one I set my sights on.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:05.180
A new sacrifice that was loved by mana,
 still young, and swayed oh so easily.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.390
Tragedy and a sense of mission...

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.480
That was enough for you to 
dabble in forbidden magic,

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.900
which allowed the elves' souls to 
be reincarnated in human bodies.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.830
What are you talking about?

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:22.000
The one... The one who reincarnated us is Licht!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.620
Even if it meant dabbling in forbidden 
magic, he gave us our last hope!

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.120
Wrong.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.130
Because I was the one 
who reincarnated you elves.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.960
Wha...

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:52.560
Your leader doesn't want 
the humans exterminated.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.530
Restoring the elves and that revenge 
you longed for... All false goals.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.770
You merely walked down the 
path I prepared for you,

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:05.280
neatly leading the other fools after you.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.210
You truly did a splendid job.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.130
In the end, it led you to a 
future that Licht didn't want,

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:22.750
It's a lie... It's a lie... It's a lie...
 It's a lie... It's a lie...

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:19.960
and my incarnation, which finally 
allowed my soul to return to my body.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.540
I'm... like Licht.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.890
I was chosen by the four-leaf clover...

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.590
Indeed. You were chosen...

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:37.780
as my brilliant, foolish pawn.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.900
Excellent work.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.850
What the hell is that black thing?

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.890
Are you telling me Licht was 
being used by that black thing,

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.010
just like he used us?

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:14.480
Patry... Everything we'd done...

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.770
This is just too amusing!

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:30.990
Elves and humans... Your dreams and 
ambitions make the best playthings!

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.000
Don't give me that crap!

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.930
You just show up outta nowhere 
and make a mess of everything.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:58.190
You're super strong and scary, 
but who the hell do you think you are?!

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.710
Whatever you are, you piss me off!

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.190
You're just a piece of shit...

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.990
...and my dream won't lose 
to the likes of you!

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.330
Asta! Yuno!

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.930
The magic that's welling up from him

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.790
is changing the objects around him into wind.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.090
Is Licht's child... waking up inside him?

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:34.100
Oh? His overflowing anti-magic is 
erasing all of the magic around him.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.810
Is his magic resonating with my own?

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.820
"Storm of Blades!"

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.940
Asta!

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.110
Yeah!

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.470
Yuno's taking care of the physical blades,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.580
and Asta's taking care of the magical blades...

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.370
They're using both of their 
powers to block all of them!

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.580
You and I...

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.630
...can do this!

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:11.140
If you're going to get in our 
way, then you can break!

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.190
"Heal."

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.770
Damn it! What's going on?

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.320
He can do that?!

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.420
How impressive that you 
were able to wound me.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.830
Having the power of a spirit 
and being loved by mana...

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.050
And the power of a meddlesome 
comrade who dwells within

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.700
the five-leaf grimoire that 
I should have possessed.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:54.590
I don't know where you came from, 
but you may have that grimoire.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.650
When the owner of a four-leaf grimoire 
is engulfed in deep despair,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.060
a five-leaf grimoire is born.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.280
At last, I possess both my body 
and my pitch-black grimoire.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:19.160
I can rule over the current world as 
a demon with my true form and power!

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:27.280
Five hundred years ago, I succeeded 
in creating a grimoire of despair,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.320
but I was met with resistance in the very end.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.090
So this time, by using 
forbidden reincarnation magic,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.500
I mingled wicked thoughts with their souls,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.430
making it easier to steal their egos.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.480
I wanted my stepping stones to do their job 
and allow themselves to be stepped on.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.240
Empty hearts are so simple.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.580
For the sake of this moment, 
I have deceived, killed, and plundered.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.000
And oh, was it delightful!

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.250
You're unforgivable...

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.800
I'm not going to let you get away with that!

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.800
Unfortunately, I'm not the 
one you have to deal with.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.330
Rampage as you please.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.440
Let your hatred and despair guide you.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.530
Pat...ry...

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.690
The final state of an elf who's 
overflowing with malice...

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.790
A dark elf!

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.910
Demon Light Magic: 
Light Swords of Conviction.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.820
Black light!

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.990
And it's so fast. Even with my
Mana Zone, I couldn't evade all of it!

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.570
Asta! You alive?

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.080
Of course I am, Yuno, you jerk!

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.410
What insane numbers and force! The weight
 of that attack was off the charts!

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.460
If the anti-magic flooding out of me 
hadn't softened it, I'd be dead right now!

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.170
Damn it! He's gotten way stronger!

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.690
Both the destined one who carries 
the hybrid child of elves and humans

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.160
and the defective, magicless one 
who's somehow able to handle

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.690
the five-leaf grimoire will 
meet their ends here.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.940
I'm not sure who you are, demon,

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:59.950
but if you don't steal that body soon,
 you'll just die along with it.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.780
What the heck's going on?

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.120
I don't feel any ki from him at all!

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.670
This is just a heartless, burned-out shell now.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.970
It's merely casting scorched shadows 
of the spells in its grimoire.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.380
At least have some fun with it.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.850
So the exit is up above, is it?

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.770
Now, if you'll excuse me... Farewell!

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.480
Hold it, you bastard!

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.150
Tch.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.260
Yuno!

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.290
Mana Zone...

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.290
Spirit Storm!

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.190
Please move...

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.670
You probably can't forgive 
me because I'm human,

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.570
and I can't forgive you, either.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.070
But I know...

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.820
We should've been able to 
understand each other!

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.190
I'm begging you! Move!

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.250
Hate...

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.920
Crap...

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.950
This spell is...

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.730
No matter what happened in the past...

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.650
No matter what hardships 
and pain we go through...

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.110
I know we can come to 
understand each other!

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.950

 The Ultimate Natural Enemy

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.910
