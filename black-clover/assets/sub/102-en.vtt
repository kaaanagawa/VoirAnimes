WEBVTT

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.800
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.600
The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.510
And that sword...

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.730
Licht had just awakened from a 
slumber of several hundred years.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.920
Asta and Yuno were no match for his 
tremendous magical powers and strength.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.890
Yuno is my...

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.540
Asta is my...

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.810
...rival!

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.760
Even their perfectly matched combo 
attack had no effect on Licht.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.300
Well, let's go...

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.220
To get our other friends, 
and to destroy the humans.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.440
Somehow, Asta and Yuno were able 
to escape from the hideout

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.330
and rush back to the royal 
capital with their comrades,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.080
to save the Clover Kingdom

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.280
and the Magic Knights who 
had reincarnated as elves.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.650
But...

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.280
Poison Plant Magic: 
Zofnir's Garden of Lingering Burns.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.250
That's...

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.290
...Hage Village!

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.630
Asta and Yuno saw that 
Hage Village was under attack.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.090
Don't you dare touch her!

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.670
Nash! No!

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.890
Asta... Yuno?

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.780
Good job fighting...

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.970
...Nash!

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.830
Leave the rest to us!

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.790
Two Miracles

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.500
How impressive of you to block my attack.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.940
I believe the same goes for 
this body's human as well,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.250
but are you Magic Knights?

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.880
How about this, then?

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.380
Poison Plant Magic: Zofnir's Breath...

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.010
and Zofnir's Fingers.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.930
Like the other humans,
you can die from poison

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.780
or get skewered.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.770
Choose.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.350
We refuse!

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.950
They're both amazing.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.200
It's a miracle...

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.500
You were both abandoned in front 
of the church on the same day,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.460
and grew up in this village.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.430
Then you ventured off, dreaming of 
becoming the Wizard King someday.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.170
To think that Asta and Yuno...

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.470
have grown so much, and now... 
they've come to save this village.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.730
Asta said...

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.930
Your dreams can come true as 
long as you don't give up.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.230
That you can make everyone happy.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.240
Yes.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.730
Even though we haven't seen them for so long,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.260
we know...

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.460
how hard those two have worked for 
their dream to become the Wizard King.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.750
Oh?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.060
Well done, Yuno!

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.720
He made it into the Magic Knights!
 He's truly our pride!

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.770
Yuno's so cool!

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.810
So cool!

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.520
I have to let the whole village know!

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.210
So, Sister, what does the 
letter from Asta say?

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.650
Man, his handwriting sucks. 
When's he coming home?

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.800
We'll have to cheer him up 
when he comes back.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.900
I'm sure even Asta would 
be depressed about that.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.530
We'll have a super tato party.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.200
He says he passed.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.710
Huh?

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.130
Asta passed, too.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.170
What?!

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.880
Seriously?!

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.180
Wow... He really passed.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.390
Th-Then I guess he won't be coming home.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.560
I see... So they both passed.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.950
All right, I'm going to tell the whole village!

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.250
This is the first bit of good news we've
gotten since Hage Village was founded!

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.580
Yeah!

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.570
I see. So Asta passed, too... I see.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.210
Ever since then,

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.370
all the letters we'd 
receive from Asta and Yuno

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.410
became something we looked forward to.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.540
Dear Sister Lily...

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.490
Nash, Rekka, Arlu, Horo... 
How are you guys doing?

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.380
My first mission after joining 
the Black Bulls was boar hunting!

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.720
I even encountered a super strong enemy.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.350
You have no chance of winning. 
Why won't you give up?

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.150
If I give up, who's going to protect them?

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.980
I've realized something.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.270
It's not just because of our promise.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.020
I'm going to become the Wizard King

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.080
so I can protect everyone!

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.240
Here we go, Asta!

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.890
Take this! My last remaining bit of magic!

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.590
Soul Ball!

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.930
Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.930
So this is your final spell?

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.400
How wasteful.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.400
It's time.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.110
It's not a waste!

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.910
They drew us in with a decoy, 
then used our blind spot...

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.580
Magic reflection!

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.040
Not yet!

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.030
I can still move!

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.840
W-Wait...

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.840
Like hell I will!

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.270
We somehow won, 
but we weren't able to stop

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.270
the enemies from taking their own lives,

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.940
or save all of the villagers.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:29.950
At this rate,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.320
it'll be a long time before 
I become the Wizard King.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.820
But still, I'm still never going to give up!

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.300
If anything, he's better at not 
giving up than anyone else.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.910
You can do this, Asta!

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.580
Do this!

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.960
"P.S. Marry me, Sister Lily! From Asta."

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.310
Asta's the same as ever.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.220
At least give that part up already.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.070
Read Yuno's letter next!

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.470
Read it! Read it!

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.550
Yuno!

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.060
Wait, wait. I'll read that letter myself.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.310
Let's see...

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.870
"To everyone back at the church.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.870
When I went to the Magic Knight 
Headquarters the other day,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.070
I met the Wizard King. Yuno."

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.330
That's so cool!

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.280
What else does it say?

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.130
That's it, actually.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.500
Yuno's letters are always so short.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.910
Asta actually wrote a lot more about that.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.920
Let's see...

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.750
"Yuno and I went to the headquarters 
to give a report about a mission."

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.340
Y-Your Majesty!

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.310
I never expected you to welcome us yourself.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.270
Who's that flashy old guy?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:54.430
You fool! That's the current 
Wizard King, Julius Novachrono!

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.320
What?!

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.820
This guy is the current...

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.740
...Wizard King?!

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.690
Well, anyway, you all did 
splendidly. Good work.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.380
U-U-Um, d-d-do you have a moment?

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:16.880
What is it?

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.950
H-How...

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.260
...do you become the Wizard King?

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.410
I see. So you both want 
to become the Wizard King.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.980
Any Magic Knight should 
have that aspiration.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.400
You two! It's rude to ask
the Wizard King that directly.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.780
Listen. The Wizard King must be proud 
and have the trust of the people—

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.920
No.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.620
It's merit.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:54.540
You can't protect others with pride,
and the trust of others comes with merit.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.170
There is only one thing people 
want from the Wizard King...

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.430
Merit that proves they are the best.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.700
Gain merit.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.520
Continuously gaining merit is everything.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.970
Anyone who can't do that 
can never stand at the top.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.820
Bring it on!

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.360
To gain merit that proves we're the best...

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.530
Those were simple, but very deep words.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.620
I'm going to get more and more merit...
 The most that I can!

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.750
Asta and Yuno are doing their best in 
a world that we who live on the outskirts

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.250
of the Forsaken Realm could never imagine.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.490
Their hard work gave us courage and hope.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.690
But...

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.600
Dear everyone back at Hage Village.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.830
Our next mission is

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.310
exploring the Underwater Temple 
that's at the bottom of the ocean!

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.690
After we received this letter,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.860
we stopped receiving 
letters from Asta for a while.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.410
They sometimes say that no news is good news,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:20.900
but we were all very worried about Asta 
after we stopped hearing from him.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.750
After a while, we received a 
very, very, very long letter,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.970
as though he had been holding in 
all his thoughts for some time,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.980
and we were very surprised.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.840
Dear everyone back at Hage Village...

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.680
I'm sorry I haven't been 
able to write for a while.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.990
I really wanted to write 
you guys, but I couldn't.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.660
Asta's letter said that after 
fighting an organization called

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.020
the Eye of the Midnight Sun 
at the Underwater Temple,

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.200
curse magic was placed on his arms.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.740
And according to the doctor, 
he'd never be able to write letters,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.380
let alone hold a sword again.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.090
Hearing that, his friends 
from the Black Bulls

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.420
did everything they could to find a cure.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.220
Then he said that after he 
met the Queen of Witches

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.180
in the Witches' Forest, the curse was lifted.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.770
Never giving up...

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.570
is my magic!

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.870
That's quite the transformation.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.460
But what exactly are you going to do with it?!

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.900
You're not getting away!

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.440
Damn you!

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.230
What... the hell?

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.490
What the hell are you?

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.490
Get out of my sight!

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.140
Why?!

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.720
I got this far by kicking 
everyone else down!

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.970
Why are you...

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.020
You might've kicked people down,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.280
but everyone that helped boost me up

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.270
makes me strong!

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.690
Black Meteorite!

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.250
Soon after that, the letters we received 
from Asta and Yuno said that

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.670
they had participated in the Star Festival,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.510
and that many of their achievements had been

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.390
acknowledged by the people 
in the royal capital.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.670
Well, that was quite the entrance.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.390
This is the rookie who worked the hardest 
out of the Black Bulls this past year.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.730
Asta!

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.400
Oh, hey. Hey, there.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.300
Yuno and Asta placed first and second in 
obtaining stars among all the rookies.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.990
They're two new rising stars.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.690
In only six months since they 
joined the Magic Knights,

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.020
they've both built up magnificent records.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.370
On top of that, they're childhood friends,
 and they're both just sixteen.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.700
They're both very impressive youngsters.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.610
I wonder what noble families they're from.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.710
Nope! Apparently they're 
peasants from the boonies!

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.970
Bah-ha! Not to mention that Asta 
kid doesn't even have any magic!

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.330
They're peasants? No way.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.980
He doesn't have magic?

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.640
Did they really use their 
abilities to rise up the ranks?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.130
Ugh! What's with these people?

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.290
Bell.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.630
What?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.690
Full power.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.940
I wouldn't have it any other way.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.830
Uh, Yuno? What are you doing?

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.170
Asta...

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.070
Doesn't this remind you of the 
training we did when we were little?

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.370
The hell?! Why do you keep doing 
stuff like that outta nowhere?!

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.290
Besides, we're not kids anymore!

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.250
Are you trying to kill me in the middle 
of my big moment?! You ass!

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.930
If you had died there, 
then that's all you were worth.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.380
Glad you survived.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.670
What?!

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.570
S-Such powerful magic...

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.010
And the other guy stopped it?

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.300
They're on a completely different level!

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.910
Now that you've seen their powers,

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.810
if any of you still doubt their 
achievements, please come forward.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.910
It's true that they're both peasants.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:12.440
But they've worked harder 
than anyone to get here.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.490
Proud citizens of the Clover Kingdom!

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.200
A round of applause for 
these two new Magic Knights!

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.710
And... let us overcome 
our differences in status,

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.700
band together, and lead 
our country to victory!

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.320
Wizard King...

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.080
I guess peasants aren't too bad.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.510
Yeah! Now's not the time to 
be talking about status!

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.210
Let's all work together!

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.670
Yuno...

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:38.470
Yeah.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.350
We...

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.450
actually made it this far.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.730
Dear everyone back at Hage Village...

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.150
I...

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.730
I...

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.690
...will become the Wizard 
King, no matter what!

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.290
It just keeps growing back,
 no matter how many times I cut it.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.210
There's no end to this stuff!

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.740
Father!

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.630
Please wake up!

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.500
Don't die!

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.120
Poison?

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.250
I might be able to fix it like last 
time with my Demon-Slayer Sword!

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.130
Yuno!

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.010
Can you fight on your own for a while?

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.010
Of course I can! Actually, 
I'll defeat him myself anyway!

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.270
Good! I'll leave him to you for a bit!

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.090
Father!

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:35.660
Asta! Father was trying to protect us and...

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.780
Please...

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.340
Damn it! It didn't work!

00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.000
It's not a spell anymore. The spell's effects...

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.940
have already gone into effect,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.900
and the poison's circulating through his body.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.660
Father...

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.230
I might be done for...

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.640
Father! You've got this!

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.140
Is that you, Asta?

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.270
I got to see you and Yuno 
after you've grown so much.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.920
I couldn't ask for anything else.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.310
This must be my reward from God.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.910
What are you talking about?!

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.380
To think that little Asta

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.220
has grown so much...

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.580
Take care of... everyone for me...

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.860
Father!

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.730
Father...

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.250
Not yet...

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.750
Not yet, Father!

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.370
Don't die. You can't die!

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.150
You still... You still need 
to see how much more I...

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:30.270
how much more we can grow!

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.440
This sword...

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.240
Back at the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's hideout... He...

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.430
It somehow ended up back in my grimoire.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.830
Maybe with this sword, I can...

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.270
To think I used to change those boys' diapers.
 They've grown so much!

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.730
You are both my precious sons!

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.280
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 103:
 "Release from Misfortune."

 Release from Misfortune

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.950
Just so we're clear, they're my adopted sons.
