00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.230
It's so pretty.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580
Where am I?

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.330
It can't be... Is this heaven?!

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.640
I refuse to die, damn it!

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.150
I'm so sorry!

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.500
Asta...

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.610
What are you talking about?

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.780
There's not a chance you'd actually die.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.160
Yuno! Noelle and Mimosa...

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.030
And Mr. Glasses!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.770
I was worried about you.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.020
Thank goodness! I don't know what 
I'd do if you hadn't woken up!

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.590
How long are you going to 
hold on to each other?!

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.710
I'm injured here!

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.890
Hmph!

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.780
The Magic Knights Captain Conference

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.360
What?! I was asleep for a whole day?!

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.270
Yes. You were even snoring.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.580
Must've been a nice nap.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.530
That just means he was able to use 
all of his strength to fight.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.650
We wanted to fight with you,
but by the time we got there,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.690
the Eye of the Midnight Sun had escaped.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.120
You guys contacted us too late.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.290
That's why we were caring for you after 
you were brought to the church, Asta.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.420
Thanks for the recovery magic, Mimosa.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.850
Oh, it's nothing at all, really.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.970
The one who worked the hardest to 
make sure you were okay is Klaus.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.640
A-Ahem...

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.340
More importantly, 
thanks to you and the others,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.770
it appears that all of the 
kidnapped children are safe.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.000
Also, regarding the perpetrator Neige,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.780
they're interrogating him 
back at headquarters.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.480
I'm assuming he knows nothing 
about the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.340
They're taking into consideration

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.690
his deep regret and the fact 
that he meant no harm.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.690
I think he's going to be 
doing volunteer work

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.730
here at this church to pay for his crimes.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.490
I see. That's perfect for him!

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.730
Anyway, it sounds like you 
did a great job again—

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.960
If I were there, I wouldn't have let 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun escape.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.510
I'll get them for sure next time!

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.360
Yuno! I'm never going to lose to you!

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.640
I'm still going to keep getting 
stronger and stronger!

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.790
And I'll continue to get 
even stronger than you.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.010
Then I'm going to keep trying 
more, more, and even more!

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.230
And then one day...

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.980
...I'll become the Wizard King!

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.190
Oh, you two get along so well!

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.990
Huh?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.830
Not a chance.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.340
We should probably take our leave.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.220
Yes.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.430
Oh, yes!

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.440
Sister Theresa also just 
woke up not too long ago.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.240
Huh?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.250
Gauche should be with her right now.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.880
Hey, I came to see you, old hag
who doesn't know when to die.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.660
Is that how you talk to an injured person?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.210
Get the hell out, you sister complex punk.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.390
What? Should I just finish you off, 
since you don't know when to die?

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.150
Go ahead and try. Then you'll 
go right back to the slammer,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.820
you sister complex punk 
with a criminal record.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.650
Don't fight with her, Brother!

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.620
Well, if that's what you want, Marie.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.410
And... I guess I'm at least grateful that 
you took care of Marie, you stupid old hag.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.010
Hmph. I guess you've grown,
if you can actually thank people.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.500
Also...

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.510
I'm glad you're alive.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.970
I see.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.600
Now, my beloved angel Marie, 
praise your big brother for not arguing!

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.230
Pardon me!

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.610
It's Asta!

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.290
Yay!

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.000
I was worried about you!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.490
I won't die!

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.110
I'm going to kill you after all.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.790
He's still got a long way to go.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.670
How are you feeling, Granny?

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.670
Who do you think I am?

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.800
More importantly, 
when I tell your Sister Lily

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.450
about all of your heroic deeds 
this time, I'm sure she'll be pleased.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.180
True!

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.560
Sister Lily! Soon I'll become the 
Wizard King and come for you!

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.280
Asta, we have to head back soon.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.940
Wait, there's one place 
we have to visit first.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.480
It's so good!

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.850
This is so frickin' good!

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.600
R-Really? I was cooking so you'd have 
plenty to eat when you woke up,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.200
but I guess I made a little too much.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.330
What is this? This is really good.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.330
So good!

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.960
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.490
Oh, come on, Brother!

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.690
I'm not done eating yet!

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.960
I'll kill him... I'll kill him... I'll kill him...

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.530
I wonder if guys prefer girls 
who can cook, after all.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.800
Asta! Thanks for lending me your robe!

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.680
Sure. Looks like you kept it clean, 
just like you promised.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.890
Yup!

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.570
Your robe may be fine, but look
how beaten up you got!

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.470
It looks like you're hopeless without me.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.550
I'm pretty sure I get beat up 
even when you're around, Noelle.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.240
Someone he can fight alongside, huh?

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.550
Oh, shut up, Stupidsta!

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.840
I know I can't use recovery 
magic like Mimosa!

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.870
True.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.740
Asta...

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.370
Sorry, but I'm getting the first kiss.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.830
Thank you for saving Luca and Marco, Asta!

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.090
Huh? Huh?

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.560
Y-Yeah! You're welcome!

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.830
H-H-Hey... Wh-Wh-What?!

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.130
Shrimpsta! Did you burn off your lunch?!

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.010
Yes, sir!

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.480
All right! We're gonna have a traditional 
Black Bulls eating contest

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.370
to commemorate your full recovery!

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.200
This time, we're having tato pies!

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.140
Thanks!

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.010
I'm starving!

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.600
Have we done something like this before?

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.610
Nope!

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.520
More importantly, you should fight me!

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.920
I wish I could've fought the Third Eye!

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.570
Marie, we've already been apart half a day...

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.950
I want to give Asta a surprise party, too.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.350
Yeah, I'm going to pass.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.060
If I ate this much, I'd just get 
a stomachache and end up in bed.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.360
I'm also going to pass. What are you 
trying to make a royal like me do?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.320
Shut yer traps!

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.760
All of you are participating, 
whether you like it or not.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.820
All right, Mr. Yami! Please do 
us the honor of being the judge!

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.570
All right, if you're all 
done complaining now...

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.410
Ready... go!

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.120
So good!

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.370
It's instantly dehydrating me...

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.970
Hey, I haven't even eaten, 
but I'm already full!

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.700
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.700
Finral, you bastard.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.710
Stop using your spatial magic to 
dump all this into Luck's stomach.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.830
You caught me.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.920
Aw, but I can't eat these if I don't 
have some pretty lady feeding me.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.960
You're out.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:15.950
Flame Magic: Explosive Reheating!

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.370
I thought they'd taste better if I baked 
them a little more, but I overcooked them.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.170
You're out.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.520
I've still got plenty of room for seconds!

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.920
Hi.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.830
Gordon?! What are you doing there?!

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.930
You can keep eating. Here, say, "Ah."

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.930
You're being creepy, so you're out.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.340
I'd rather devour Marie than 
do something this stupid.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.880
You're both out since you 
haven't eaten a damn thing!

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.270
Hydration... Hydration...

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.210
They were both done a long time ago.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.530
The only ones left are...

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.060
Asta and Charmy are head-to-head!

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:14.690
All right! I'll show you I can 
win this without using magic!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.050
Results

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.050
As for the results,

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.030
Charmy won without using magic.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.570
Victor:
Charmy Pappitson

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.200
You've still got a lot to learn, kid.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.400
My identity!

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.270
No one's surprised.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.530
That crest...

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.700
That's a letter from the 
royal capital, isn't it?

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.880
Is there an incident? 
Do we need to take action?!

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.630
Shut up and rest.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.420
Or so I'd like to say... but it looks 
like the Wizard King wants to see you.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.120
The Wizard King?!

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.180
The other captains and I have a conference 
tomorrow, so he says to bring you along.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.750
I wonder what he wants!

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.550
Like I know.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.380
You'll find out when you get there.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.970
Wizard King,

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.720
I have sent a message to all of

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.300
the Magic Knights Captains 
regarding tomorrow's conference.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.730
Thanks, Marx.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.180
I don't want to believe it,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.970
but it's clear that there's 
a traitor among us

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.740
who's connected to the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.950
And I'll find out who it is tomorrow.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.830
But...

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.240
Are you sure this is going to work?

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.790
It'll all depend on Asta.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.170
We've been waiting for you,

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.170
Captain of the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro, and

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.870
Asta.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.640
Um... Who are you again?

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.400
I guess this is the first time we've 
really spoken to one another.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.270
I'm...

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.570
Mushroom Head.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.040
Yes, Mushroom Head.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.150
Hey! Please don't be so rude!

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.700

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.700
My name is Marx. I'm the Wizard King's advisor.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.240
The Wizard King's?!
You're awesome, Mushroom Head!

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.570
Well, it's definitely a lot of work.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.840
Also, my name's Marx, not Mushroom Head.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.920
So, where's the conference 
being held, Mushroom Head?

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.760
It's M-a-r-x!

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.800
It'll take a bit more time to finish 
preparing for the conference,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.140
so please wait with the other captains.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.460
Would you come with me, Asta?

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.980
I heard you fought splendidly 
the other day, Asta.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.520
I'm sure you'll receive at least another 
ten stars from the Wizard King.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.400
Seriously?! All right!

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.660
Wait... Where are we?

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.840
We're headed to an underground prison that 
very few in the royal capital know of.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.870
We keep important prisoners down here.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.580
Important prisoners?

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.640
You know that we've captured members of the

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.480
Eye of the Midnight Sun who were involved 
in the attack against the capital, right?

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.460
Then the ones in the underground prison...

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.290
Yes. They have a spell on them 
that protects their memories,

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.600
so we haven't been able to get any info
about the Eye of the Midnight Sun yet.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.620
But the Wizard King thought 
that your anti-magic sword

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.600
could possibly undo the protection.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:23.190
When they attacked the capital,
they were always one step ahead of us.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.820
That would've been impossible unless 
they had help from the inside.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.780
We're pretty certain there's 
a traitor among us,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.210
and it's someone rather high up.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.830
On the level of a Magic Knights Captain.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.380
N-No way!

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.110
We'd rather not believe that, either. 
That's why we want to clear things up.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.160
We're here.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.430
Right...

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.770
Hello?

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.440
Hey, Asta. Great work again.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.650
Th-The Wizard King! It's great to see you!

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.280
Sorry to bring you here 
when you're probably tired,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.050
but you're the only one who 
can use the anti-magic sword.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.050
By the way, I heard you fought with the 
higher-ups of the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.770
What kinds of magic did they use?

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.250
Wh-What kinds?

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.600
Say what?! Copy magic?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.280
They can copy other people's magic?

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.250
That's amazing!

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.010
Beast magic?! I've never 
heard of that before!

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.810
What?! Spirit magic?!

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.670
Fire? So, the Salamander?!

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.220
I would've loved to see all of that!

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.080
Um...

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.000
Wizard King!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.670
Oh, sorry about that.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.510
All right, Asta. Could you give it a try?

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.910
Do you think you can do it?

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.210
I believe so! As you wish, Wizard King!

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.940
What's the deal with that brat?

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.780
This isn't good.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.950
That's the brat who uses anti-magic.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.940
He's planning on breaking the protection 
spell that's on our memories.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.170
Don't... Don't touch me, you stupid brat!

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.880
Hi-yah!

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.500
Now, Marx.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.340
Yes, sir.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.130
Memory Exchange Magic: Mémoire Absolue!

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.930
Wh-What is this?

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.490
I've made a connection 
directly into their heads,

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.480
and this spell allows me to get answers 
from their true memories.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.420
Now they won't be able 
to hide anything anymore.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.850
That's so cool...

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.220
I know, right?! It's such an awesome spell!

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.100
Isn't it cool?!

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.110
Yeah!

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.500
Silence! I need quiet, please!

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.640
Yes, sir...

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.920
I will ask you both a number of questions.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.710
Answer me honestly.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.470
Understood?

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.330
Yes.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.820
Captain of the Purple Orcas
Gueldre Poizot

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.820
I heard about your work at Nean.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.540
To think that four Magic Knights Captains 
would actually let the terrorists escape.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.740
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises
Jack the Ripper

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.770
They're nothing like the weaklings 
you guys were dealing with

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.980
from the Diamond Kingdom 
and the Spade Kingdom!

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.830
Says the captain of a squad 
with fewer stars than mine.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.440
You sure you're not doing anything 
underhanded to get those stars?

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.520
Captain of the Black Bulls
Yami Sukehiro

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.630
Man, the gleam on a new 
katana is something else.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.090
Sucks that I'll be making payments 
on it for ten years, though.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.530
Anyway, calm down, Original 
Scrawny Line-Face Guy.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.250
What Garbledre is saying is the truth.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.410
It's Gueldre.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.260
You're the last person I want 
to hear that from, No-Stars Yami.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.280
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
Dorothy Unsworth

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.280
Whatever. I've got plenty of black stars.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.020
Those are negative stars! 
Why are you proud of that?

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.040
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.460
Silence, you foreigner and former peasant.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.590
You're annoying.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.580
What was that, Mister Royalty? 
Do you want to join in?

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.260
Captain of the Blue Rose Knights
Charlotte Roselei

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:56.310
How stupid. We're getting nowhere 
because of you noisy men.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.070
Why am I next to Yami?!

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.700
Calm down, Charlotte. Stay calm... Calm...

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.770
Captain of the Aqua Deer
Rill Boismortier

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:09.090
I guess they haven't decided on a temporary 
captain for the Crimson Lion Kings yet.

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.510
If Fuegoleon was here, he'd pull 
things together really well, but...

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.640
Did the air just get really heavy?!

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.720
I'm the youngest, so I 
need to lighten the mood!

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.520
Look!

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.790
This is my Fuegoleon impression!

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.280
What do you think you're doing?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.580
Don't let the fact that you're the 
youngest captain ever go to your head.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.490
Huh?!

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.930
You're a funny guy!

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.370
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.410
Captain of the Golden Dawn
<font size="30">William Vangeance</c>

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.410
I apologize for being late.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.830
What were you doing, Vangeance?

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.210
Oh, there was some business 
I couldn't get out of.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.600
I expect you're busy.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.430
You are the charismatic captain of the squad 
with the most stars this term, after all.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.970
I'd love to know your secret.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.930
How did you claw your way up to become 
the strongest squad so very fast?

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:10.530
I hear those who join your squad will 
develop powers beyond all expectations.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.550
Do you have magic that 
can see people's futures?

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.090
I have no power that impressive.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.070
My knights work hard, that's all.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.770
Really, I'd like to ask you, a wealthy merchant, 
the trick to making so much money.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.010
That's a company secret.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:34.930
I've been thinking this for a while, 
but the way you laugh is creepy.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.970
Why would you bring that up now?

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.190
Also, you resemble a boneless ham.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.060
Vangeance...

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.100
Where were you during the 
distinguished service ceremony?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.570
It's customary for a captain 
to accompany members

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.630
of his squad when they attend the ceremony.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.320
Business you couldn't get out of again?

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.560
I was out gambling. I lost all my money.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.680
Sorry.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.330
No one asked you.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.610
The air got heavy again!

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:10.870
This time, I'll do it right!

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:17.780
And you, if you're attempting to do an 
impression of me, you'd better be prepared.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.670
You're right!

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.410
It's not easy to do that braid over your face!

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.510
Man, you're hilarious.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.930
Come on, don't pick on Goldy.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.730
I mean, you don't use light magic, do you?

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:37.690
Indeed.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.370
And there it goes again!

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.330
Look, everyone!

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.990
This is my Yami impression!

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.320
Keep your mouth shut, Fluffy!

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.390
Huh?!

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.070
You must've been really 
spoiled growing up, rich kid.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.470
Well, don't expect the same 
treatment from me, loser.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.510
He was laughing before, but suddenly snapped?!

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.090
And you! Quit sleeping!

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.930
Oh, can you talk in snores?

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.390
I have no idea what you're saying, though!

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.150
Not to mention, Julius was the one who 
called us all here, so where is he?!

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:20.500
That old guy better not have forgotten 
us and wandered off somewhere!

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.440
That's very possible.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.160
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.440
Everything is ready,

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.410
so if you'd hold the
conference in another room—

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.250
Huh?!

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.410
You come here!

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.170
Huh?! He's snapped?!

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.750
Hey, kid. Working hard?

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.550
Y-Yes, sir. Great work, sir.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.120
Does he need to take a dump or something?

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.530
What did you need, Wizard King?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.650
Those two are from the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.180
Did you learn something from them?

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.490
Yes. Several things, thanks to Marx and Asta.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.200
I suppose this is the biggest one.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.700
I've learned that there 
is a traitor among you

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.790
who is working with the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.350
Petit Clover

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.410
Petit Clover!

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.850
Memory Exchange Magic!!

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.810
Memory Exchange Magic.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.890
Mémoire Absolue!

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.390
I will ask you a series of questions. 
Answer me honestly.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.440
Okay.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.170
If you were asked to choose 
between being the Wizard King

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.810
and your obsession with magic...

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:14.660
Obsession with magic.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.690
I knew it!

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.300
I-In that case...

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.460
What do you think about me?

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:25.830
You can be a bit naggy, but you're 
a hard worker. I'm always grateful.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.570
I see...

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.290
Because of that, I can concentrate 
more on my obsession with magic,

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.800
rather than being the Wizard King.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.230
What?!

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.730
There's a traitor in this dungeon?

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.020

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.230
supposed to be people everyone 
in the Clover Kingdom can look up to!

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.980
I'm gonna teach you a lesson!
