WEBVTT

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.100
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.530
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.950
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.610
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.930
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.810
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.660
He continues to diligently 
aim for the top!

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.800
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.380
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.800
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.850
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.560
The New Magic Knights Captain Conference

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.740
The Clover Kingdom.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.410
Much of the royal capital 
was destroyed in an attack

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.890
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.020
but the repairs are going smoothly.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.060
The citizens have gathered 
in the square to prove

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
that the threat of the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun has passed,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.800
and that the kingdom is doing

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.500
everything it can to restore peace 
and get life back to normal.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.260
It's Lord Vangeance!

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.750
He's wonderful!

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.740
Captain of the Golden Dawn
William Vangeance

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.010
He's the hero who saved the kingdom!

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.510
They're the pride of the Magic Knights!

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.420
Lord Fuegoleon!

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.040
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Fuegoleon Vermillion

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.270
Not only has he returned as captain, 
he now controls Salamander!

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.790
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.750
Lord Nozel's bangs are as charming as ever.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.280
I heard that he was on the 
front line of this battle!

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.350
Lady Charlotte!

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.800
Captain of the Blue Rose Knights
Charlotte Roselei

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.180
Every rose has its thorns... But I wouldn't
 mind getting pricked by Lady Charlotte.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.740
What in the world are Yami and the 
Captain of the Praying Mantises doing?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.290
I can't believe they're late on an 
important day like this. Unbelievable.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.810
Rill!

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.810
Captain of the Aqua Deer
Rill Boismortier

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.790
I wonder if something's wrong.
 He looks like he's spaced out.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.800
Yeah... He's definitely in love. I can tell.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.550
Where did that lovely lady go?

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.930
The young master's first love...

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.450
The Butler of the Boismortier Household
Walter

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.870
Ah, Madam... The young master 
is slowly becoming an adult.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.010
I'm sure you'll have a lovely 
grandchild any day now.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.010
Look! It's Lady Dorothy!

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.050
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
Dorothy Unsworth

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.180
And she's awake?!

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.250
I never knew she had such beautiful eyes.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.360
Heya! How's everyone doing?

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.330
Lord Kaiser looks so dapper for his age!

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.890
Captain of the Purple Orcas
Kaiser Granvorka

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.700
But he seems a bit down.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.490
Look! It's Lord Julius!

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.030
The Wizard King!

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.460
Lord Julius!

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.960
Wizard King's Advisor
Marx Francois

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.960
Did he get injured?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.710
I heard it was actually Lord Julius

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.420
who saved all of us from that attack 
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.830
He must have endured an intense 
battle to protect us all.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.420
That must be how he got hurt.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.310
He's forever our hero...

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.650
The Wizard King!

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.320
What? You want me to be the Wizard King?

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.980
He couldn't possibly—

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.690
Well, I mean, I can't go strolling 
out there looking like a kid.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.240
And we can't have the king finding out, either.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.940
But it'd also be strange if 
I didn't appear on that stage.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.080
But it'd be obvious that it was me up there.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.410
Oh, don't worry.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.590
You just have to stand up there.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.890
Here. Conceal your face with this.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.210
What?

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.590
You obviously look different now, 
but I see you haven't changed at all.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.700
Please don't let them notice... 
Please don't let them notice...

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700
Ahem...

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.860
The Wizard King has a sore throat, 
so he cannot speak to all of you today.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.330
Please forgive him.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.940
I wanted to hear the Wizard King speak...

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.260
He can't help it.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.110
Yeah...

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.260
Now, I'd like you all to 
give a big round of applause

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.080
to the valiant hero who 
bravely faced our enemies.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.000
Our great king,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.940
King of the Clover Kingdom
Augustus Kira Clover XIII

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.930
Augustus Kira Clover XIII!

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.920
Wow. It's the king.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.910
He's so cool.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.920
I love you, Your Majesty.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.930
Why are you dawdling?! Pick up the pace!

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.470
This is my time to shine!

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.430
Bah-yes!

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.110
Wh-Why? I know I just went with the flow,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.220
but how did I get stuck
as the king's attendant?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.980
Don't you dare stand next to me!

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.430
Yes, sir!

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.070
That goes for you, too!

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.680
Curse you, Julius.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.750
How dare you make me give 
a speech to the people

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.280
just because a cold made you lose your voice?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.510
But this is the perfect chance

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.450
to show the people my dignity and benevolence.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.050
You're a fool if you think your 
popularity will last forever, Julius.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.700
Good day, my fine citizens!

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.850
I am your king, Augustus Kira Clover XIII!

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.990
My majestic presence has 
left them at a loss for words.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.650
When will this be over?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.450
Shh!

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.580
Your Majesty, the public awaits your wisdom.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.290
Please do not make them wait too 
long and keep it brief, if possible.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.950
Oh, of course.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.500
Tch! Curse you, Vangeance. 
How dare you order me around?

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.810
Thanks to my valiant deeds and 
some help from the Magic Knights,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.820
the threat known as the Eye 
of the Midnight Sun has fled.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.260
The Clover Kingdom is safe, 
and peace has been restored.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.510
This must be a result of my daily good deeds!

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.030
But I'm sure that some of you remain wary.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.270
What will happen to your everyday lives?

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.050
What if other enemies attack?

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.020
There is nothing to fear!

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.900
Behold! My majestic light magic!

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.030
How brilliant! How valiant!

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.630
Light Magic: Absolute Monarch 
of Divine Brilliance!

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.040
Perfection.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:26.010
I give you my word, my adoring public! 
The Clover Kingdom is in safe hands!

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.050
Leave everything to me!

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.560
Tch! You damn beanpole! 
Let's settle things once and for all!

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.360
You damn foreigner! Let's see who's stronger!

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.380
The hell do you want?!

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.740
What're you guys doing?

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.670
Yami, Jack...

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.110
I'm certain I told you that today was

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.580
an important day when we 
were going to tell the people

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.620
that we'd taken care of the Eye of 
the Midnight Sun and restored peace.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.250
Was that today?

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.460
I totally forgot.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.340
Not only were you late, but you're 
fighting over something ridiculous.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.620
Well, he started it.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.010
What? You're the asshole who started it!

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.390
That's enough, you two.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.850
Remember where you are.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.010
Tch...

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.020
The Black Bulls and Praying 
Mantises are so violent.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.980
I saw in the paper that one of the 
Black Bulls is possessed by a devil.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.680
I knew there was no way

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.990
they should've placed second in 
stars at the last Star Festival.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.070
Yeah. They're the worst 
possible squad, after all.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.430
H-H-How dare you?!

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.020
That was my absolutely invincible light magic!

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.950
Huh?

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:44.830
What're you talkin' about?

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.230
You know what I'm talking about!

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.040
How dare you interfere with my spotlight?!

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.470
Your Majesty. Please show 
the people your leniency.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.430
I believe it best to show 
them how merciful you are.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.290
I-Is that so?

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.540
Tch. Who cares what you think?!

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.310
Just because people praised you as 
a hero! Get off your high horse!

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.190
Indeed. I-It's wonderful 
to see how lively you are.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.450
Continue with your ways.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.980
Do everything you can for the Clover Kingdom.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.070
Sure.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.720
The king is now taking his leave.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.180
I ask that you send him off 
with a round of applause.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.510
C-Captain Jack...

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.830
Um, could you call me back to the 
Praying Mantises sometime soon?

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.460
Huh? Who the hell are you?

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.060
Bah-ha?!

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.170
What are you doing?! Come here at once!

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.170
B-Bah-yes!

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.930
He's one of yours, isn't he?

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.970
Like I'd ever choose a guy like that.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.350
Let us take our leave, as well.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.690
Right...

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.850
Okay!

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.860
Lord Vangeance!

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.720
Good grief. It's finally over.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.280
So... why're you dressed 
like that, Old Man Owen?

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.380
What?!

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.510
A-All of the Magic Knights 
Squad captains are here?

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.930
I feel immense pressure...

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.930
Wh-Why were we called to a Magic Knights 
Squad captains' meeting, anyway?

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.690
My apologies, Yami.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.990
It should be your squad receiving 
praise from the public, not me.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.570
Well, we're used to getting booed.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.950
I apologize.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.910
It's no big. Don't worry about it.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.550
Calm down. Don't let your 
heart go aflutter, Charlotte.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.450
Stay calm... perfectly calm...

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:53.100
What's wrong, Prickly Queen? 
Your face is red. You okay?

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.460
I-I'm perfectly fine!

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.170
You know...

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.090
If you need to take a dump, 
go now! Don't hold it in!

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.350
Of course that's not it! 
How are you so devoid of tact?!

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.680
I was wrong?!

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.140
Of course you're wrong!

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.640
You just don't get it, Yami.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.650
This is why people say you're 
so oblivious. Am I right?

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.150
You have to take a piss, right?

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.360
No!

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.250
The captains...

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.490
Are they always like this?

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.620
This is a rare sight to see, in its own way.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:30.410
Damn that Julius. He's the one who 
called us all here, and he's late again.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:36.310
He didn't forget he called us all here and 
then just wander off somewhere, did he?

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.670
Damn that old man... I mean, old brat.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.390
You know... that might actually 
be possible this time.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.760
Yeah! Like, totally!

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.430
Yeah...

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.080
So what the hell's wrong with him?

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.110
No idea. He's apparently been like 
this ever since the spell broke.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.690
Sorry to keep you waiting, everyone.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.610
Hey, I see you're all here.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.080
Damnatio Kira

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.650
He's...

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.080
It's Damnatio.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.870
He was called here, too?

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.790
Pardon me.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.290
You jackass...

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.370
If you have a problem with 
one of my squad members again,

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.250
I'll gladly take you o—

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.640
Yami.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.210
I'm the one who called Damnatio here.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.430
You did?

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.660
It appears that what you'll be 
discussing today concerns me, as well.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.560
Therefore, I was told that
I was obligated to be here.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.650
Today, we'll be talking about the devil 
that resides in the Spade Kingdom.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.710
The other day, a few of our fellow 
citizens went to the Heart Kingdom

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.650
to find out more about the devils.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.670
I believe that you have all seen the reports,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:50.720
but I would like to hear from the 
ones who were actually there.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.910
If you would.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.010
Right!

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.410
All right.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.500
In the Heart Kingdom, 
they measure a mage's strength with

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.590
a system called magic stages.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:08.140
The stages go up in order from nine.
The smaller the number, the stronger the mage.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:16.390
Stage Zero
Stage One
Stage Two
Stage Three
Stage Four
Stage Five
Stage Six
Stage Seven
Stage Eight
Stage Nine

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.610
According to Queen Loropechika, 
it's not the total number of mages,

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.390
but the number of mages near 
stage zero that will determine

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.980
who is more powerful in a battle among mages.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.220
And this part's really important...

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.680
If we're up against a devil,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.200
apparently we won't stand a chance unless
 everyone fighting is stage one or stronger.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.940
Stage one, eh?

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.570
The powerful curse in the Heart Kingdom that

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.000
Asta and the others went to investigate

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.450
was the one cast upon Queen Loropechika.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.750
It seems the queen only has about 
another year to live due to the curse.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.130
And the one who put that curse on her...

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.050
...is the devil Megicula.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.180
And from a separate report from 
another group of Black Bulls,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.390
the Diamond Kingdom is currently 
under attack by the Spade Kingdom.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.940
In the past few years, the Spade Kingdom
 has become more and more powerful.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.440
It's very likely...

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.950
...that specific devil is helping them out.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.740
What we'll be discussing at this meeting 
is what we should do to go up against

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.830
the Spade Kingdom and this devil.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.100
Queen Loropechika plans to attack

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.960
the Spade Kingdom in six months, 
before she becomes weaker.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:23.390
We are thinking of assisting the 
Heart Kingdom and fighting alongside them.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.470
I would like all of you to train your 
squad members as much as you can.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.100
We only have six months,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.740
but do everything you can to 
raise everyone's magic stages

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:39.230
so that we can face the Spade Kingdom 
and protect this kingdom.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.460
I've heard from Queen Loropechika 
that the Spirit Guardians

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.980
will also help us out.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.110
Can I count on all of you?

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.460
Of course.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.320
Yes.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.450
Like you need to even ask us.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.300
We've already started.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.830
The Black Bulls will be doing as 
we please for the next six months.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.220
William?

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.800
I will participate in the fight...

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.770
But after everything I've done,

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.220
I cannot face my squad as the Captain 
of the Golden Dawn any longer.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.970
I ask that you relieve me 
of my duties as captain.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.270
Huh?

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.150
Hey!

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.300
Also, I'd like you to assign me a new mission.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.570
I'd like to put my life on 
the line to defeat the devil.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.570
C-Captain...

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.230
In that case, I am also guilty.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.990
Though my body was taken over by an elf,

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.580
the crimes I have committed against the 
Clover Kingdom are punishable by death.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.080
I agree. I am not worthy of being a captain.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.090
It's honestly not bugging me much.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.590
Be a <i>little</i> bit bugged, at least.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.260
Now, now, just wait a moment.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.090
I understand why you feel guilty,

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:59.220
but I cannot relieve you 
of your duties as captains.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.980
Besides, what you said 
just now would end up

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.020
involving all the other Magic Knights 
who were possessed by elves, too.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.280
And then who would be 
left to protect this kingdom?

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.100
If you want to atone for what you did,

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.940
you have no other option but 
to forget your positions

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.660
and do all you can to 
protect this kingdom.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.920
I trust in all of you.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.150
Yes, sir.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.290
Very well.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.750
Roger!

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.290
As you wish.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.670
So, Damnatio, does that work for you?

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.010
Whatever do you mean?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.580
In order to defeat the devil, the Magic Knights

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.690
will have to get stronger 
in the next six months.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.500
I'd like you to think about 
what to do with Asta

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.440
after we've taken care of this matter 
with the Spade Kingdom, if you would.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.320
I have no objections.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.000
But do not get the wrong idea.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.020
I'm only agreeing to this because

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.790
doing otherwise at the moment 
would not benefit the Clover Kingdom.

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.790
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.810
That heartless scales bastard.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.470
So, uh, I... Thank you!

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.050
No need to thank me.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.930
Right! Thank you very much!

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.310
Again, I'm counting on all of you.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.690
Leave it to me!

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.780
I wonder how I should sever 
my squad members...

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.740
I'm getting excited just thinking about it!

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.100
Yeah, maybe don't.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.850
I can't wait!

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.620
I should go lay out plans 
for training immediately.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.610
Why don't all the squads do this together?

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.450
That is definitely an option. 
Having mock battles would also help.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.790
I ain't gonna hold back!

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.120
That's my line, asshole.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.310
Sounds like we'll need to round 
up some healing mages, too.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.130
Don't get too carried away, okay?

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.770
Oh, right. Marx, you can have him come in.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:01.760
As you wish.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.270
Oho?

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.080
Hey, it's Hard Ham.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.590
Former Captain of the Purple Orcas
Gueldre Poizot

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.590
I'm sure you're all very familiar with 
the former Captain of the Purple Orcas,

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.570
Gueldre Poizot.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.070
The other day, while Gueldre 
was at the Shadow Palace...

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.740
He managed to carry away a load of 
ancient magic items and jewels

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.070
with his former senior 
and Magic Knight, Revchi.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.280
Oh?

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.290
You heathen. You never learn.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:37.340
I was planning to keep him whole, 
but I can't wait any longer!

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.840
I'm gonna turn him into sliced ham right now!

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.760
No, wait.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.350
I'm thinking about pardoning Gueldre.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.640
Pardoning him?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.940
Huh?

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.850
Gueldre has a knack for business.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.510
I'm sure he'll be able to 
turn an even bigger profit

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.030
from the treasures he tried to get away with.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.610
And I'd like him to use that money 
to help support the kingdom.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.580
You know, since repairs cost quite a bit.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:11.040
It's not like the kingdom has endless riches.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.290
You'll help us out, right?

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.040
U-Um...

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.090
Suddenly this all depends 
on me turning a profit!

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.760
Right?

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.500
O-Of course! I will do everything 
that I possibly can!

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.510
That'll help us out quite a bit. Thank you.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.890
Y-Yes, sir!

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.500
There was no way he could decline!

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.400
That was a different kind 
of pressure than Yami uses.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.700
Tch! Make sure you pull your own 
weight around here, Hard Ham.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.070
Mess this up and I'm gonna 
sell you as sliced ham.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.460
One last thing.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.950
Like I said, the kingdom 
doesn't have endless riches.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.600
So to help out with that, 
I'd like to make your salary as

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.790
Magic Knight Squad Captains 
half of what it usually is.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.750
What?!

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.240
Seems like a logical solution.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.420
I have no objections.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.840
Of course, I agree.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.330
Sure...

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.490
Okay!

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.010
I'm fine with that.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.260
It's the least I can do.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.300
Well, I guess that's that.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.720
Now, hang on a second!

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.270
You can't be serious!

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.230
What's the matter?

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.300
Half?! Come on, man! I'm in debt!

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.990
You want us to go broke?!

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.500
Well, you know, you need to set 
an example for your subordinates.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.030
I absolutely decline!

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.200
Well, majority rules, so...

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.450
There you have it.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.500
We now conclude the Magic Knights 
Squad captains' meeting.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.740
This is bullshit!

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.300
Closed for a Private Event

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.330
How long are you going to carry 
on with your drunken rambling?

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.930
I won't put up with this any longer.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.790
Yeah, go home, you square!

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.030
Must be nice...

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.540
You assholes always had money.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.440
I'm sure getting your salary 
cut in half doesn't even sting.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.980
Damn it!

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.780
This is nonsense.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.850
It's always best to drink in moderation.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.240
Ciao! See you later.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.500
Come on, you can hang out a little longer.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.120
Yeah, you have time.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.380
Come on, brave hero who saved 
the kingdom. Let's play a little game.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.710
Game?

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:25.240
We'll get back the salary we 
lost by taking it from you!

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.220
Very well.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.050
We'll take everything you've got!

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.480
Good grief...

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.980
I win...

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.410
Now I've got three times my salary...

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.880
I'm very grateful to both of you.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.110
Despite everything that happened, 
you continue to treat me the same.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:55.750
I promise you that I will do everything 
in my power to defeat this devil.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.750
Goodnight.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.750
Sorry to cause such a fuss, sir.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.330
Thank you very much.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.980
The Magic Knight Squads make 
their move to go up against

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.450
the Spade Kingdom and the devil.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.940
In the meantime, Asta and Yuno 
head back to Hage Village.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.030
