00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.060
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.610
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.950
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.610
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.870
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.700
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.690
He continues to diligently 
aim for the top!

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.790
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
or even if you're poor...

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.380
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.850
and to become the Wizard King!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.600
The Blue Rose's Confession

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.740
Doing this! Doing that!

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.720
There, there, good boys. Here's your food.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.410
What are you doing?

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.800
And after I played with you guys...

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.030
Do you have to be so loud 
this early in the morning, kid?

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.480
You're not even letting me 
push one out in peace.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.270
Hey, how long are you gonna 
keep messing around? Let's go!

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.490
Where are we going?

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.820
Huh? Where the hell do you think?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.500
To find out more about the devils.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.610
We're going to start with the curse, weg.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.300
We'll get some clues from that.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.880
Right!

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.380
You come, too.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.530
All right.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.380
Royal Capital: Magic Knights Squad Hospital

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.390
I'm very sorry, Sol.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.390
An elf stole my body... 
and I couldn't protect all of you.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.650
I'm a failure as a captain.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.850
That's not true!

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.660
It wasn't your fault, Sis!

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.650
I was completely useless, too.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.600
The Black Bulls' captain... As much 
as I hate to admit it, he saved us.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.790
Yami did?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.570
I see...

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.320
Also, don't call me "Sis." Call me "Captain."

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.670
Sure thing, Sis.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.840
More importantly, that guy... 
I guess he's not so bad for a guy.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.170
For a guy, at least.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.550
I mean, he's still no match 
for you, though, Sis.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.230
Don't tell me all that wasn't a dream...

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.480
They're things that happened 
when I was possessed?

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.730
Well done, human.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.340
Y-Yami in my memories is so... close! And...

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.580
But I had fun fighting 
by your side, Yami Sukehiro.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.040
Well, look at you. Being all nice 
and honest in the end, Charla.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.580
I'm pretty sure I'm not as awkward 
as the owner of this body.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.070
I can't remember exactly, but I think 
it was something like that.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.780
Wait... Does that mean Yami 
knows how I feel about him?

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.930
No, that can't be...

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.130
Sis...

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.030
Hey, Sis!

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.450
What is it, Sol?

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.430
Yo.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.950
The Captain of the Black Bulls is here.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.960
Yami?!

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.210
Yami!

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.830
Yami!

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.720
Yami!

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.860
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you...

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.310
What do you mean? I came 
to see how you were doing.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.140
Here you go, Prickly Queen.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.210
I-I-I do not currently have the 
mental or emotional capacity

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.330
to be in the same room as Yami right now...

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.560
Sol... Chase him away 
like you usually do, Sol!

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.410
Yeah... I mean, I guess he did save you,

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.710
so it wouldn't hurt to let 
him stay for a little while.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.540
Sol!

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.130
You all better?

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.550
Sis?

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.260
It's not like I can stay in bed forever.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.140
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What does my 
face look like right now?!

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.430
Calm down, Charlotte... 
You can do this, Charlotte.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.980
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.950
You've always been the 
stubborn, awkward type.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.860
Awkward

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.100
Awkward...

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.860
You always cause so much trouble.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.650
Trouble

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.650
Trouble...

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.160
Trouble

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.930
But I'm a bit relieved now.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.730
By the way, there's something 
I wanted to ask you, Prickly Queen.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.810
S-Something he wants to ask me?!

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.170
Wh-What... D-D-D-Don't tell me...

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.750
You said something earlier, remember?

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.840
You know...

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.470
Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha...

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.680
When you were under that spell...

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.200
S-Spell?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.980
I want you to give me the details. 
So that thing of yours...

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.090
I'm pretty sure it was...

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.510
A forbidden curse...

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.660
The heck?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.840
Th-The Captain of the Blue Rose Knights?!

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.840
Was he able to ask about the curse? About weg?

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.660
Come on. Why so scared?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.980
Let's just go. It'll be fine.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.180
P-Please stop.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.060
Oh, come on. The country's a 
mess right now, so we gotta—

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.570
Not happening!

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.320
Thank you very much!

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.430
That was a close one!

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.940
Thank you!

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.180
Oh?

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.810
Burglar!

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.740
Thank you, miss—W-Wait! 
There's a river over there!

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.030
I was just hoping you could tell 
me about the forbidden magic...

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.000
Sis! Come back!

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.750
Now I've done it.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.020
Why am I like this?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.710
I wasn't able to be honest 
with Yami yet again.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.780
I'm sure he just thinks I'm a freak now...

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.950
I became strong to persevere over 
the House of Roselei's curse.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.940
Apparently, she raised her rank again.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.810
That newbie from the 
Blue Rose Knights is so powerful!

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.790
Not to mention beautiful!

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.030
Lady Charlotte, please marry me.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.300
No, marry me!

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.560
But I couldn't trust men, who were all talk.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.690
If you cannot defeat me, 
you could never accept my curse.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.140
And then, my curse went out of control.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.000
The curse!

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.860
The curse upon the House 
of Roselei has activated!

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.810
It's no use. We can't stop it! Ru—

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.500
It won't... stop...

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.840
At this rate, the town...

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.350
Curses! How pathetic... I'm so pathetic!

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:32.360
I'm so sorry... Mother and Father...

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.340
What the hell's the big idea, you jerk?

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.840
You flung the pasta soup 
I was eating everywhere.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.660
Yami Sukehiro? To think I'd let him see 
me in such a disgraceful situation!

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.840
What a failure I am.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.350
On missions, you're as cool as a cucumber 
and always raring to go. So what gives?

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.360
I like tough girls.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.860
But it probably wouldn't hurt to ask
someone for help once in a while.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:28.120
Our Magic Knights Squads are full 
of strong people you can rely on.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.750
Yami saved me when all that was happening.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.470
But still, there was a part of me 
that didn't want to admit that,

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.230
and I continued fighting as the captain 
of an all-women Magic Knights Squad.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.860
I...

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.180
I'm...

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.860
Blue Rose Knights' Headquarters

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.170
What's up, Sis?

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.700
Captain...

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.180
What did you want to tell us?

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.920
As all of you know,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.570
we, the Blue Rose Knights, 
are female knights who pride ourselves

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.680
in achieving acts of valor on 
our own, without the help of men.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.730
Therefore...

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.180
I'm prepared to resign as 
your captain after I say this.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.480
I-I...

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:48.410
I like Yami!

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.630
No matter how hard I tried to 
rid myself of these feelings...

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.160
No matter how much I tried to 
forget him, it was no use!

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.740
I... I'm just...

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:03.130
I'm just hopelessly in love with that man!

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.760
Sis...

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.270
As I figured...

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.030
This is unforgivable.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.470
I'm... a failure as a captain.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.160
Oh my gosh!

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.210
We'll support you, Captain!

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.790
Huh?

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.920
They're totally Beauty and the Beast!

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.670
What a grand romance!

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.930
You're both captains, so you're 
perfect for each other!

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:52.250
I actually have a boyfriend, too! 
We've been secretly dating this whole time.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.060
What?!

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.660
Me, too! It's been so hard to keep it secret.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.690
What?!

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.100
Me, too!

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.590
Actually, me, too!

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.040
You should totally ask him out on a date!

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.530
A d-date?!

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.290
You've got this, Captain! I mean, 
you could win any guy over!

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.090
Wha—

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.240
But before that, you have to 
let him know you're interested!

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.000
I-Interested?!

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.620
You should tell him you love him!

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.780
I know! There's a perfect restaurant!

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.130
The night view there will 
definitely set the mood!

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.920
You'll be fine! No man could ever hate you.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.010
I'm sure he likes you, too!

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.890
Captain, you have a cool complexion... 
And you're a summer!

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.020
So pink and pastel colors 
would look best on you!

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:44.350
Wow, your skin is so beautiful!
Do you have a skin care routine? Oh, and...

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.290
You've got great romance luck!

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.780
I think a rose color would...

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.530
Tell him how you feel!

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.030
Tell him how I feel?!

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.530
Tell him how you feel!

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.780
H-Hey...

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.570
Tell him how you feel! Tell him how you feel!

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.450
Tell him how you feel!

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.350
I'm... going to tell Yami... how I feel...

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.300
Sis! W-Wait! Calm down!

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.810
I don't know what's going on, but it 
looks like you're having a blast.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.680
Sorry for butting in!

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.560
Wow, so this is the 
Blue Rose Knights' headquarters!

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.190
It's really pretty!

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.730
The hell are you doing?

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.700
Of all the times for him to show up!

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.350
Go on, Captain! This is 
your big, big, big chance!

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.420
Wh-What?

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.210
Go ask him out on a date!

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.010
What?!

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:41.950
You can do it!

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:42.870
H-Hey!

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.890
Y-Yami... Um, uh... you see...

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.840
Captain! I can't hear you at all!

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.210
How cute are you?!

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.630
Why'd you turn into a statue and 
start muttering? Are you Gordon now?

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.140
I know how you feel.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.440
Ba-dump!

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.370
I've known all along.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.190
Ba-dump, ba-dump...

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.300
Your ki is unique and indescribable...

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.200
You...

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.620
really don't like being around me, do you?

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.210
Like, you can't stand me.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.340
Huh?

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.210
But did you really have to scream your 
lungs out and run away like that?

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.150
You're going to scar my delicate little heart.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.010
We've known each other for years.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.970
It wouldn't hurt just to hear me out, would it?

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.640
He's such an insanely oblivious, uncouth man!

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.460
She's doomed.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.230
She won't even be able to 
tell him how she feels!

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.730
Th-That's not...

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.340
I-I-I-It's no use! I can't get 
the right words to come out!

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.240
A-At this rate, he's going 
to get the wrong idea...

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.370
That's not true, Captain Yami! 
I don't think she hates you.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.170
Ow!

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:07.750
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.990
Who the hell asked for your opinion,
 Mr. Suspended Sentence?

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.300
Th-The way the Blue Rose captain 
is acting... it reminds me of Noelle.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.110
What?

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.570
So she doesn't hate you. 
She just really trusts you, I think.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.910
The more she trusts you, the harder 
it is for her to tell you how she feels!

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.350
I just recently realized this myself.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:32.010
So you just said yourself 
that Noelle trusts you,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.700
and you're not embarrassed?

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.550
Not one bit!

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.160
We're comrades who've come through 
so many life-or-death situations together!

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.660
Seriously, Noelle just has a hard 
time expressing how she really feels.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.100
So, Captain Blue Rose, if you have 
a hard time saying something,

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.170
just keep carrying on like you usually do!

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.970
You're comrades who've been through 
life-or-death situations, after all!

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.690
Who the hell gave you permission to 
touch Sis like that, you shrimp?!

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.410
Looks like we've both been blessed 
with wonderful Magic Knights.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.270
No, he's caused me 
nothing but trouble, really.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.980
Asta, was it?

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.530
I was informed of what happened.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.780
I'm sorry for all of the trouble 
we caused while we were possessed.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.710
Nah, it wasn't your fault at all!

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.500
Y-Yami... Um... You wanted to talk 
to me about something, right?

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.970
H-How about we have dinner?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.830
Sure.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.960
I have no idea what's going on, but finally...

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.730
Sis... If she ends up with that guy,
 what am I supposed to do?

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.400
So... What did you want to talk about?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.490
Well, you see...

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.030
Ba-dump, ba-dump...

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.410
I wanted to know...

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.410
Ba-dump, ba-dump...

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.490
...more about your rose curse.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.420
What's wrong?

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.280
Thank goodness! Thank goodness 
they didn't get together!

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.930
But I also sorta feel bad for Sis, 
since her feelings didn't get across to him.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.610
O-Oh... So that's what you wanted to talk about.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.390
Was there something else?

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.690
Curse you for getting my hopes up!

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.780
You know. The Black Bulls have to

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.450
investigate the devils on 
the Wizard King's orders.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:49.770
That psycho scales judge guy is 
just itching to execute the kid.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.960
So I've gotta gather some clues, 
being the kid's captain and all.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.800
It all began

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.880
with a spell cast by a curse mage 
who had a grudge against my family.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.190
But that spell was unlike any other in 
this kingdom and impossible to break.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.490
Forbidden magic interferes with the 
shape of your life and of the world.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.730
The curse that activated when I was eighteen

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.910
changed the shape of my soul and 
the quality of my magic itself.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.460
It is extremely likely that this was

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.300
a forbidden curse that used 
power from another world.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.000
I knew it.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.000
But I don't know much else about it.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.820
I see.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.290
I guess I wasn't much help.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.260
But if you need to know 
about forbidden curses...

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.700
There's someone in your own squad

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.260
who has been affected far more than I have.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.980
In my squad?

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.570
So many close friends... I'm so happy.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.010
So happy...

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.550
Petit Clover

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.780
Petit Clover!

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:55.060
Practice

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.060
P-Practice?

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.980
P-Practicing telling him how I feel about him?

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.230
This is so embarrassing. But if it's 
to help let him know how I feel...

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.820
Ya...

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.890
Yami...

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.470
Your eyes are like jewels.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.980
They're so clear and pure...

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.070
I love you!

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.880
I love you too, Prickly Queen.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.700
I-Is that so? I see...

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.510
Whatcha doin', Sis?

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.100
S-Sis!

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.060
Curse you, Yami. I was hoping 
you'd at least take the hint...

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.570
But I guess that's one of his charms.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.300
