WEBVTT

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.090
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.670
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.970
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.630
His name is Asta.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.010
With guts and hard work, 
he made it into the Magic Knights,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.830
and he never gave up, 
despite how much he got hurt.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.680
He continues to diligently aim for the top!

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.810
Even if you are a peasant,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.650
or even if you're poor...

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.400
Anyone in this world can still shine!

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.820
He's working hard to prove that,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.910
and to become the Wizard King!

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.410
I've been informed that the recovery 
efforts in even the hardest-hit

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.540
parts of the Forsaken Realm are now underway.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.330
Things are finally looking brighter as a whole.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.720
Yes. And to make this peace an eternal 
one rather than a fleeting one,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.480
we must remain strong.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.970
It's nearly time.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.910
You have the captains' meeting as well 
as a special decoration ceremony.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.560
You're going to have a busy day.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.980
Indeed.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.230
The Chosen Ones

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.830
Our topic today is who will participate
 in the Heart Kingdom's training.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.330
Our promise with the Heart Kingdom's 
queen... In other words,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.830
the battle with the Spade Kingdom, 
is drawing nearer as we speak.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.840
I know that every squad is 
working hard to get stronger,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.910
but we just received word 
from the Heart Kingdom that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.660
preparations for training are done.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.680
Our training is finally in its final stage.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.630
There are five Spirit Guardians 
who will help us train,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.030
and there is a limited number 
that each of them can train.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.690
So I'd like all of you to nominate 
members of your squad.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.210
Now, who would like to get us started?

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.080
From my squad, I'm choosing Asta and Nero,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.230
though they were already 
chosen by the Heart Kingdom.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.750
Asta, who uses anti-magic,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.250
and Nero, who uses forbidden magic, 
are already at the arcane stage.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.080
We know from our previous 
battle that their powers will be

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.010
our trump card in defeating the devil.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.510
I hope they can make those powers 
their own even more through training.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.810
I'm also going to be sending Finral, 
Luck, and Noelle from my squad.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.410
What's this? Are you worried?

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.060
No matter how tough you act, you're such 
a softie when it comes to your sister.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.070
Apparently Luck and Noelle both 
pair well with their magic.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.630
Well, the Heart Kingdom does have a 
Spirit Guardian who controls lightning,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.760
and their queen controls 
the Water Spirit, Undine.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.880
Since Luck controls lightning magic 
and Noelle controls water magic,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.830
it should be perfect.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.000
And I'm not surprised that Luck is super 
excited, since he's always rarin' to go,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.670
but even Noelle's super motivated right now.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.300
Well, they are up against Megicula, 
who killed their mother.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.260
And as for Finral...

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.180
Well, he's handy to have around.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.540
If a reliable supporter 
like him is able to level up,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.680
our strength as a whole should rise.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.100
He may also provide hints 
to a new way of fighting.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.900
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.390
So from the Black Bulls, we have

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.050
Asta, Nero, Noelle Silva, 
Luck Voltia, and Finral Roulacase,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.020
making five members.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.280
That's quite a few.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.230
Nothing wrong with having 
so many guys with potential.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.790
They're who I'm gonna go with.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.790
I nominate Mimosa Vermillion 
from the Golden Dawn.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.740
We're up against the devil-possessed.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.360
I'm sure we will face some 
cruel, ruthless battles.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.050
The cornerstone of these battles 
will be recovery mages.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.310
She is a royal who also possesses 
substantial natural talent,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.560
and stretching her potential 
is sure to benefit our kingdom.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.270
I see. Is Mimosa your only nominee?

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.570
I hear that the Wind Spirit Guardian 
will also be training our nominees.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.860
Yuno declined.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.600
I assume he has his reasons.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.950
Please nominate Magic Knights 
from other squads, too.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.290
I nominate Leopold Vermillion 
from the Crimson Lion Kings.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.010
Leo's ambition is high, and he 
asked our older sister, Mereoleona,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.170
to train him at the volcano 
in the strong magic region.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.800
I can clearly imagine what kind 
of hell that must've been.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.460
No one can beat Leopold's hard 
work and ambition in my squad,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.060
but there is hesitation in him.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.830
I am hoping he can light a new flame 
by training in another kingdom

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.060
and burn away his hesitation.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.540
Once he is able to do that,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.040
he will be essential in the 
battle against the Spade Kingdom,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.570
but he will also become a true lion king 
capable of protecting this kingdom!

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.380
I see.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.230
I look forward to seeing how he grows.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.330
What about the other squads?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.340
Anyone from the Blue Rose Knights?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.440
I'd like to confirm something first.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.430
Is it possible for a captain to participate?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.970
I see no problem with it.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.560
I personally think someone who was possessed by an elf, such as yourself,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.430
could produce some interesting results.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.190
The feeling of the mana from when my body 
was possessed by an elf still remains.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.190
That red rose mana was far superior to mine.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.030
I cannot be picky in how I become stronger 
for the battle against the devil.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.900
I need to experience something 
similar again, no matter what!

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.960
Wait, no! That's not what 
I meant by "experience"!

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.500
Hmm?

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.080
So the only nominee from the 
Blue Rose Knights is the captain?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.340
Yes.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.060
Any others?

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.470
This is a rather hard decision, but I 
believe younger candidates are favorable.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.950
I agree. And I am very aware 
of how to train myself.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.660
I don't mind going if I can 
slice up the Heart Kingdom.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.730
Yeah, no. You're not going.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.580
This training will probably be grueling.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.810
But there will be knowledge and new 
discoveries they won't find here,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.450
and a new world may open up to those who go.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.660
I'd like you all to use that to your advantage.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.910
My... My own...

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.790
They're all my food!

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.950
I'd like you to train hard every 
day and grow ever vigilant.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.490
Training...

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.010
Training means protein...

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.760
This is for the protein!

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.490
You all have wonderful potential, 
so I'd like to see you grow.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.630
Growing bigger...

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.010
This is for the fat!

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.480
La!

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.570
This is for the vitamins!

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.820
This is for the fiber!

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.650
This is for the collagen!

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.530
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.340
Goodness, aren't you full of energy?

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.530
What got into you all of a sudden?

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.790
I nominate myself from the Aqua Deer!

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.300
I'm going to train, become stronger,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.300
and become a man that nice lady will notice!

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.800
I think we actually have enough now,
 but is there anyone else?

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.210
The Silver Eagles will do everything they can

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:44.180
to bolster their skills so that they
 can face the Spade Kingdom.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.690
As will my squad.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.810
We're also doing things our own way!

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.190
Then do we agree on the nominees mentioned?

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.860
Aye.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.690
Good. I look forward to seeing 
the fruits of your labor.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.620
Yes, sir.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.490
This concludes the Magic 
Knights Squad Captains' meeting.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.080
Whew, we're finally done.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.530
See ya.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.590
And where do you think you're going?

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.420
The special decoration ceremony 
is just about to start.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.340
Seriously? I have to go to that?

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.600
But I've got my wheels parked outside.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.270
It's not like anyone from 
my squad got picked.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.040
We were told that every captain should 
be in attendance for this ceremony.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.660
What? Why?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.500
Well, you see...

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.070
The king will be participating this time.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.070
Seriously?

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.680
Bah-ha... All the captains are here.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.760
They're so intense-ha.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:01.390
So they've made all the captains attend 
because I am present. Excellent.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.390
Seriously, this is too close. 
He's going to find out pretty soon.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.190
Captain Jack!

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.450
Please...

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.380
bring me back...

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.020
to the squad.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.110
The hell's his problem?

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.800
Talk about annoying.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.250
How about I slice you open?!

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.300
It looks like everyone's here.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.500
Let us begin.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.520
We will now begin our special decoration 
ceremony for the Magic Knights

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.870
who fought bravely against 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.580
Because the Wizard King's throat 
is not completely healed,

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.950
I will be conducting this ceremony.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.260
First...

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.790
With 21 stars acquired, we have 
Sol Marron from the Blue Rose Knights.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.020
You have been promoted to 
5th Class Senior Magic Knight.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.980
Thanks to your calm and brave decisions,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.730
you got the gravely injured 
Wizard King to a safe place.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.070
Please continue using that judgment 
and drive in the battlefield.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.360
Oho! Impressive. She moved 
up three ranks at once.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.000
She saved the Wizard King's life. 
This promotion seems quite fitting.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.590
I wasn't actually calm at all back then.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.260
Not to mention, the guy who saved Sis 
was the Captain of the Black Bulls.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.650
Next time, I'm gonna protect Sis 
without the help of any man!

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.090
Hey, uh... one of yours 
seems to be glaring at me.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.110
Is that my problem?

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.340
She's staring at Yami?

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.270
Wait, no, Sol! Don't tell 
me you like Yami, too!

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.530
Sis is staring at me passionately!

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.990
I'll do my best to live 
up to your expectations!

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.470
With 23 stars acquired,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.970
we have Mimosa Vermillion 
from the Golden Dawn.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.340
You have been promoted to 
2nd Class Intermediate Magic Knight.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.400
In the battle at the Shadow Palace,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.680
you showed humanity and effectively 
did your job as a recovery mage.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.090
We look forward to you saving 
many more lives in the future.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:17.150
I think people realize how important 
recovery magic is because of Mimosa.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.930
I will live up to this honor that 
I just received and do my best

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.650
in the battle against the Spade Kingdom.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.910
With 18 stars acquired,

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.130
we have Leopold Vermillion 
from the Crimson Lion Kings.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.660
You have been promoted to 
4th Class Senior Magic Knight.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.120
When the previous and 
new captains were absent,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.610
you inspired the other squad members and 
did everything in your power to stop

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.880
your vice captain, who had
 been possessed by an elf.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.910
Please continue to use your character to 
raise everyone's morale on the battlefield

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.630
and lead us to victory.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.350
So Leopold has also gone up three ranks.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.230
I would like to decline!

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.400
Back then, if my brother hadn't shown up,

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.340
my whole squad would have been annihilated.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.490
I did everything in my power, 
but I was completely powerless.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.830
Everyone tried to protect me, 
even if it cost them their lives.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.750
I'm just...

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.500
I'm just a weakling, and I do 
not deserve this recognition!

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.950
You fool!

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.800
Do you not understand why everyone 
tried so hard to protect you?

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.110
Is it not because they 
were moved by your bravery,

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.310
and because they saw hope 
in your very existence?

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.320
They entrusted you with the future 
of the Crimson Lion Kings.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.130
This award includes

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.820
the very determination, resolve, 
and hope of the Crimson Lion Kings!

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.150
Resolve and hope?

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.860
I, Leopold Vermillion, 
will live up to this recognition,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.940
do everything I can to protect 
my squad from any enemy,

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.920
and become a Lion King who 
can lead everyone to victory!

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.500
Yuno from the Golden Dawn.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.430
Yes, sir.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.150
You have earned 77 stars.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.280
Holy wow!

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.950
Wait, how many stars did the 
Aqua Deer have last time?

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.450
Yuno of the Golden Dawn,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.040
you have been promoted to 
1st Class Senior Magic Knight.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.910
What?!

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.970
Bah-ha?!

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.620
A 1st Class Senior Magic Knight?!
 This peasant?!

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.440
With your tremendous amount of mana,

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.590
you were able to deal a fatal blow to 
the devil, who was the root of all this evil.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.970
We look forward to great things from you.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.720
Yes, sir.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.750
He's now the same rank as 
our vice captain, Langris.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.780
He suddenly jumped to the rank right 
under the Magic Knights Squad Captains.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.710
I don't really get it, but you did good, right?

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.450
Way to go, Yuno!

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.320
To celebrate, let's go on a dat—

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.410
1st Class Senior Magic Knight...

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.160
I guess I got a little closer.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.140
These four members...

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.210
Hold it!

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.500
Well, this definitely sounds like 
it's gonna be a pain in the ass.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.640
Silence, Yami. Despite how 
he is, he's still our king.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.880
You just lowkey dragged said king.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.470
The one who shined the brightest in 
this battle hasn't been recognized!

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.570
The hero who protected the most 
important person in this kingdom!

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.220
Him! Sekke Bronzazza!

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.460
Bah-ha?!

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.680
Not only did all of you leave me,
 your king, unattended,

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.390
but some of you fools had 
the nerve to attack me!

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.350
Really?

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.330
Who knows?

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.830
Sekke is the true hero! 
The epitome of Magic Knights!

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:13.550
During that fierce battle, he dodged 
the enemy's attacks and came to me!

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.760
There's no doubt that he deserves the 
most recognition out of anyone here!

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.470
* Some facts may have been skewed.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.800
I-I just happened to show up-ha...

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.060
With my authority as king, I give Sekke...

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.160
the title of 1st Class Senior Magic Knight!

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.600
F-First Class Senior Magic Knight?!

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.620
What the bah-ha?!

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.700
If that peasant gets to be a 
1st Class Senior Magic Knight,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.590
I'm going to promote Sekke 
to that rank, too!

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.840
Bah-ha... Bah-ha... Bah-ha?!

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.640
Th-This is, uh...

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.100
Their disapproval is super obvious-ha!
 I'm gonna get killed, bah-ha!

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.310
I-I have just been promoted to 
1st Class Senior Magic Knight!

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:08.200
I, Sekke Bronzazza, 
will fight any enemy, win,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.380
and take pride in protecting 
the Clover Kingdom, bah-ha!

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.880
So please spare my life.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.880
W-Will that be all, Your Majesty?

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:26.710
Indeed! All of you should follow Sekke's 
example and remember to prioritize me!

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.400
Do you understand?!

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.210
I-I've been saved.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.570
As I was saying,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.820
other than the present five,

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:45.160
we will be promoting everyone who 
participated in this battle one rank.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.520
I see. So that's why they 
had all captains attend.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.280
They wouldn't usually have us all show 
up just because the king is here.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.020
Such care for the squad members 
coming from the Wizard King...

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.030
I thank you.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.040
All of the Magic Knights who risked their 
lives in this battle will be rewarded.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.790
If the current fuss over the Magic 
Parliament trial hadn't been going on,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.610
there were squads that would've 
seen many promotions.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.230
Though we will not be able 
to promote them at this time,

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.740
we have decided to give 
them special recognition.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.240
Captain of the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.720
What? I get something?

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.230
Please keep the problems to a minimum,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.730
and continue to show results 
with your teamwork.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.280
What? I don't get money?

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.530
Well, thanks anyway.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.530
This concludes the 
special decoration ceremony.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.730
Lastly, I would like to read a 
message from the Wizard King.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.720
"Our kingdom is slowly recovering from 
the attack by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.890
but the threat of the Spade Kingdom 
is just around the corner.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.800
I expect nothing but the best from 
those who have just been promoted.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.060
I hope that those who did not receive 
new titles will continue to train hard,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.870
come together as Magic Knights,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.900
and protect this kingdom and its people."

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.560
Yes, sir.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.090
We're back!

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.830
Come and get me!

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.820
Damn it! Quit running away!

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.920
Looks like you can't keep up with me at all!

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.230
Hey! Welcome back, Captain Yami and Finral!

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.220
Damn, you're noisy.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.270
Go train outside.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.300
Hey, Luck!

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:45.740
Huh?

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.850
You're mine!

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.350
You're going to the Heart Kingdom.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.760
Really?!

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.850
So it's finally been decided?!

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.290
From our squad, we've got you and Nero,

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.430
then Finral, Luck, and Noelle.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.070
Finral, too?!

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.880
Yeah...

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.200
I get to go all-out in the Heart Kingdom!

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.470
Sure. Go crazy, kid.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.200
Please...

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.040
Please let me go, too!

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.460
I can't just sit here if he's gonna go!

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.510
I'll get even stronger than him!

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.680
Look, this was already decided 
at the captains' meeting.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.970
Sorry.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.600
Please! Let me go!

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.720
He's always running ahead of me.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:39.190
But I'm a true man, 
and I can't be left behind again!

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.110
Even if you tell me not 
to go, I'm going to go!

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.770
With your mana, you're not gonna be able 
to keep up unless you're prepared to die.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:49.910
You up to that?

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.620
Yes, sir!

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.810
Who the hell cares about 
how much mana you have?!

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.130
I'll surpass the limits of a peasant!

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.140
Fine. I'll try asking Julius.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.630
Just remember this.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.000
What's important here isn't where you train.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.540
It's <i>how</i> you train.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.260
Got it?

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.060
Yes, sir!

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.020
You did it, Magna!

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.970
Yeah, it wouldn't be fun if 
I just kept getting stronger.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.120
Yeah! You bet your ass I'm gonna catch up!

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.210
In that case, Finral, Magna, and Luck!

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.700
Let's all do our best training 
in the Heart Kingdom!

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.670
Yeah!

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.380
Look at you, climbing up 
that ladder all at once.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.630
You're just so cool!

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.280
I guess you'll become the 
Wizard King in no time!

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.260
You can't be serious. It's not that easy.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.070
But someday...

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.110
Someday, for sure...

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.710
I'm going to follow my own path 
to become the Wizard King.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:49.530
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 154:
"Vice Captain Langris Vaude."

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:54.270
Page 154
 Vice Captain Langris Vaude

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.340
If you're going to come at me, 
you can't hold back, or you'll get hurt.
