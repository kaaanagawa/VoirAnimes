WEBVTT

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.800
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.740
Breaking the Seal

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.260
N-N-N-N-N-N-Ne...

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.260
Did you not hear me?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.860
S-S-S-S-S....

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.280
Sp?!

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.790
The bird just spoke?

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.610
It must be a spirit, and a noble spirit at that!

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.890
Nero?!

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.670
You spoke just now, 
didn't you? No, that can't be!

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.240
This is a dream, right? I'm still asleep, right?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.300
Wipe off that dumb look and get a move on.
 Hurry up with the spatial portal.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.610
What?!

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.250
This bird just started talking out 
of nowhere, and now it won't shut up!

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.690
At this rate,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.350
humans who have elves within them 
might not be able to return to normal.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.180
What?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.620
Even worse...

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.270
Anyway, hurry up and take 
me to the demon's bones.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.850
Nero, you're...

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.990
"Return."

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.580
That was a splendid cut.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.540
"Storm of Blades."

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.290
Anything goes with you, doesn't it?!

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.880
This black creepy guy's magic...

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.670
"Earth Shield."

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.750
Not only can he make the things 
he says manifest as magic,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.300
"Wave of Flame."

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.430
"Iron Spear."

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.850
he can summon, move, and order
 objects around, as well.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.150
This "Storm of Blades" is basically 
both of those things at once.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.150
This is completely nuts!

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.270
He was able to wither 
Charlotte's briars, heal himself,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.660
and keep doing whatever the hell 
he wants against the living,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.370
but considering he hasn't 
straight-up ordered us to "Die,"

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.660
I'm gonna guess he has some limits.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.500
Ugh, damn it. Just thinking about 
all this is a pain in the ass.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.200
Charlotte!

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.630
I'm Charla!

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.840
Back then...

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.720
"Wither."

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.350
Did some of my briars not wither 
because they were out of his range?

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.730
I'm assuming that was part of it, but it 
comes down to how much magic he has.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.700
Is the effect of the amount of magic 
he puts into his words so great

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.490
that it overwhelms our magic?

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.980
So just barely fending off his attacks while

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.200
we keep trying to figure 
him out is all we can do?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.000
Tch!

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.380
The one thing I've noticed is he can't 
stop my dark magic with his words.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.890
I knew it. He dodged it rather than stopping it.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.720
I mean, I need my spells to hit him, but...

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.900
Not bad!

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.990
I'm amazed you can move around so 
much when you're basically asleep.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.690
He's right. Licht isn't able to 
manifest his full powers right now.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.990
This fight seems evenly balanced 
at the moment, but at this rate...

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.700
"Storm of Blades."

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.380
Damn it! There's no end to this!

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.240
This ain't good. That guy's magic 
was too overpowered to begin with!

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.700
High

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.950
Devil

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.410
Elf Leader?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.160
Charla

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.490
Royals

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.490
Nozel

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.660
The breakdown probably looks something like this.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.490
Me

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.490
Magic

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.490
Nobles

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.640
Sol

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.360
Commoners

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.360
Magna

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.360
Kid

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.360
Bwah

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.360
Low

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.700
At this rate, my magic's not gonna hold out.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.890
And he doesn't seem fazed by any of this.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.650
I quite enjoy your company.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.190
You're so pleasantly annoying 
that I'm actually enjoying this.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.400
To think that having my own body 
and being able to play with magic

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.210
would make my heart dance with such delight!

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.780
I thank you.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.210
You've also helped me obtain 
the five-leaf grimoire.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.710
Now I shall use it.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.750
The magic of my words...

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.760
Word Soul Magic:

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.760
┘░╣╩┐┤.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.350
This nasty magic is... He's still...

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.190
I do apologize, but I'm a completely 
different being than the rest of you.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.190
From a different dimension, in fact.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.200
What the hell is this spell?

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.120
Is this from the other world?

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.050
Tch!

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.680
It's like sprinkling water on a hot stone.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.360
Yeah... That's not good.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.720
What is this...

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.110
...magic?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.870
Traveling this far all at once is exhausting.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.120
Hurry up.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.880
H-Hey! Wait up!

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.880
Take out all the magic stones that 
are embedded in this monument.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.380
Magic stones...

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.310
All the magic stones that were taken by the

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.890
Eye of the Midnight Sun are here.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.400
You're sure I can take them out?

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.560
Hurry it up.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.560
Now...

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.060
Put all those magic stones into this statue.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.810
The statue of the first Wizard King...

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.940
I guess they go here.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.530
All that's left are the eyes.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.490
This is the last one.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.840
Is this... magic?

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.720
Watch out!

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:17.850
This is...

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.770
Our magic is... melting!

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.600
Curses!

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.140
Dark Cloaked

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.560
Black Blade Blunt Slash!

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.020
You...

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.370
It leeched magic and life energy out of me?!

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.370
I guess you won't be able 
to hold your sword anymore.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.180
It's a spell that devours life.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.380
I merely opened the lid on it, 
but it can no longer be stopped.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.890
Not until it devours humans, elves...
 and everything else.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.410
Shit. This is seriously bad news.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.480
That evil magic is heading our way!

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.820
What in the world is that?!

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.480
That's the devil's magic!

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.570
Light Magic: Light Swords of Conviction!

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.320
Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.210
It swallowed up our spells?

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.830
Don't let it touch you! Run!

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.920
There!

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.850
Asta!

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.180
Asta!

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.690
I thought I was a goner!

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.860
Asta!

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.310
So anti-magic works against that, too?

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.570
And he's completely unharmed?

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.410
I guess it figured there's 
no point in swallowing up

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.900
something that has no magic.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.390
Unbelievable.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.080
Hey! Why do you guys sound creeped out?!

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.080
This is...

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.650
As we thought, there's even more of 
this eerie magic flowing above us.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.010
At this rate, the ones in the 
other rooms are in danger, too.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.300
The one with the most mobility, 
who can get those

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.890
who have turned into elves out of here...

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.450
Saving the kingdom, and all
 of us escaping here in one piece,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.140
will mean our victory.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.000
I'll go assist the ones below.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.850
Come with me, Vermillion.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.910
Yes, sir.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.370
You appear to understand 
the enemy and what's going on

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.990
up above better than I do.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.900
If you supplement Asta's anti-magic 
with Yuno's spirit magic

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.860
and that elf's light magic,

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.990
you should make it to the battlefield.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.500
Go.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.170
Got it!

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.300
Now that your seal has been broken, 
that means my seal will also...

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.500
Nero?

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:13.490
What a pathetic state you're in. 
If only my spell was more complete...

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.580
No, the only reason I was able 
to return is because of you.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.380
Huh?

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.460
Welcome back, my prince.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.540
First Wizard King
Lumiere Silvamillion Clover

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.040
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.720
The first Wizard King...

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.300
The legendary statue had life within it.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.750
And you're—Huh?!

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.900
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Nero, is that you?!

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:43.010
Secré Swallowtail

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.380
I had no idea you were such a cute girl!

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.150
If you'd told me earlier, I would've 
totally asked you out on a date!

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.090
Why don't we go on a date right n—

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.520
I'm really sorry.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.980
I sense an otherworldly magic 
from the Shadow Palace.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.380
I see. He must've obtained a body.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.750
Why are you two...

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.450
Just as I was about to die, she used her 
confinement magic to seal me away.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.620
I was asleep this whole time.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:20.340
And with the help of the magic stones, 
I managed to awaken, at least partially.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.840
Such calm yet powerful mana...

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.350
It's far more powerful than even the elves'...

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.700
She's...

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.600
For 500 years, I was just what 
you people called "Nero."

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.550
Huh? Why are you holding my ha—

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.910
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.160
Huh?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.140
Thank you, Magic Knight of the present.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.670
Wait there for your friends' return.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.660
I'm sorry you had to wait 500 years.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.700
It's fine.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:13.180
We can't let what happened 
before ever happen again.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.710
500 Years Ago

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.190
Clover Castle

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.810
Despite being a noble, 
my magic was only able to

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.300
open and close things, 
and was considered useless.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.200
So I ended up a servant...

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.910
to an eccentric prince

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.900
whose magic and talent were 
amazing even among royalty.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.950
I wonder what kind of awful snob he'll be.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.090
Hey there! You must be Secré.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:51.550
Sorry, I'm researching ancient 
magic right now, so I can't get up.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.850
By the way, what kind of magic do you have?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.850
But he was nothing like I had imagined.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.270
Sealing magic?!

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.930
What's that? I've never heard of it before!

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.030
That's so unusual! How amazing!

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.780
How should we have you use it? 
Just thinking about it is exciting, isn't it?

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.680
Magic that opens and closes locks is vulgar.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.630
That's not true! Don't seal off your potential!

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.340
Please don't make a face like you 
just said something clever.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.690
Aw...

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.390
Also, your clothes are weird.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.030
What?! But I made these 
clothes myself! Aren't they great?

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.350
More importantly...

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.050
What's more important than that?

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.770
What should I help you with?

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.620
Well... Right now, I'm creating magical tools.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.810
Magical tools?

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.650
Yup. So that people who aren't 
blessed with magic or by their

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.700
magical attribute can 
use all kinds of spells.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.070
That way, I think we can 
make our society more equal.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.070
But that just sounds like a silly dream.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.940
They're tools to help me with that.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.060
I think I'll call them magic items.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.400
I'm sure your magic will help me with this!

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.330
For example, can you seal magic into objects?

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.020
Um... Yes.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.340
You can?! That's amazing!

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.580
I helped the prince make magical tools.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.860
He really was nothing like I'd imagined.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.860
There were members of his family 
who didn't like his progressive ideas.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:32.150
But he didn't let that bother him, 
and he never compromised his ideals.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.010
He was a strong, honest person.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.260
Recently he and his sister, Lady Tetia,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.430
have been sneaking out quite frequently.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.130
What could they be doing here?

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.640
The other race... The ones blessed with mana!

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.760
Phenomenal magic and skill...

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.770
The same thoughts and ideals...

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.820
The same four-leaf grimoires...

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.350
The leader of the elves, Licht,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.150
was the first peer and friend 
that the prince had ever had.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.910
We can come to understand each other.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.910
You elves have truly amazing mana.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.770
By combining that with the magic-item 
technology that we humans created,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.500
we can make this land 
safer and more prosperous.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.670
Let us live together, hand in hand.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.750
Magic items that stored and distributed magic,

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.210
and the elves' magic stones, which linked
 to another world and amplified spells...

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.720
Through his work with the elves, 
spells and magic-item technology

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:49.070
that would help not only the humans, 
but both races to live in peace as equals

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.440
were slowly becoming a reality.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.630
The prince and Licht were best friends.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.860
And they were supposed to become family.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:04.180
I'm really sorry, but I'm probably 
going to be late to your wedding.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.960
Sadly, Father has summoned 
me to the palace that day.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.500
I know that he and the others 
are against this marriage now,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.780
but don't worry.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.870
I'm sure they'll understand someday 
and give you their blessings.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.890
I know.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.850
I'm sure Licht and the others 
will be eager to see you.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.250
But it's likely that even then,

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.780
he was already manipulating 
the whole situation.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.780
I wonder why Father summoned me today.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.200
We didn't mention the wedding 
to anyone, so is it a coincidence?

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.780
I need to hurry to the ceremony.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.820
No one's here?

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.790
Father, where are you?

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.030
"Bind."

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.460
What is this?

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.970
Good day, my prince.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.930
Minister?!

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.020
No... The evil mana that's coming 
from him doesn't belong to him.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.930
Who are you?!

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.940
Who am I?

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.790
Despair, hatred,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.170
disloyalty, or death...

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.440
You may call me whatever you wish.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.760
A soul with evil mana...

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.950
I've read about this being 
from another world! A devil?

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.640
Where are my father and the others?

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.150
Who knows?

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.160
Maybe they've gone to destroy the other race

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.710
that's trying to harm the princess and,
 indeed, the entire kingdom.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.260
I'm sure the elves will be quite surprised

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.900
when the humans' violence and greed

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.720
fall upon the wedding ceremony 
that only you should know about.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.310
What?!

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.220
Ah, this is what I'd expect from 
the strongest in the kingdom.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.110
That's some terrifying magic.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.020
Though I was prepared for that,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.110
so even you won't be able to escape 
from those bonds so easily.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:05.620
Once I obtain my body and grimoire, 
I'll come play with you again.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.380
Wait!

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.160
Someone! Isn't there anyone here?

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160
Anyone!

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:13.960
Prince!

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.800
Secré!

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.850
What's going on, Your Highness?

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.910
There's a devil plotting something!

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.140
So it wasn't you, was it, Your Highness?

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.130
That magic item we made is gone!

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.860
Secré! Break these restraints!

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.090
Your sealing magic can do it!

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.150
Right!

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.730
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.990
Faster... I need to go faster!

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.990
Tetia, Licht, everyone...

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.920
That's the magic item we made!

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.480
A five-leaf grimoire...

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.430
I knew it...

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.980
Licht...

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.770
I knew it wasn't you.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.620
He reclaimed his heart?

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.980
I'm sorry I doubted you for even a second.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.330
Please forgive me.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:40.180
Such a futile struggle! 
Now, relinquish your body to me.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.870
You are the future we believed in.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.640
You are hope.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.640
Licht...

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.010
Right now, I am filled with 
tremendous negative mana.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.140
I don't have full control anymore.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.820
At this rate, that devil will...

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.110
Don't...

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.270
To prevent my magic and body from falling 
into the hands of something wicked...

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.120
I've pulled even more negative 
magic into myself.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.620
Magic stones... He used the highest 
form of forbidden magic on his own body?

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.510
Don't... Don't do this, Licht!

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.620
I'm sorry. This is my last selfish request.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.510
You're the only one who can grant it.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.520
Don't do this, Licht!

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.210
Lumiere...

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:04.050
Please kill me!

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.890
This was all planned by that devil...

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.710
My prince, let us finish this.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.610
We're going to save this world!

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:49.780
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 118: 
"A Reunion Across Time and Space."

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 118
 A Reunion Across Time and Space

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.990
We didn't give up back then!
