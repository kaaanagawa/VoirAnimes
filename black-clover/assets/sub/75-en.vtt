00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.660
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.170
The Royal Knights is an 
elite group of Magic Knights.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.100
The selection exam to choose 
its members has finally begun.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.350
Asta, along with Mimosa Vermillion 
and the mysterious mage Xerx Lügner,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.320
head into their first 
battle of the tournament.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.290
Wh-What?!

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.180
For some reason, Xerx doesn't seem 
interested in fighting at all.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.180
Annoyed by this, Asta and Mimosa decide 
to attack the enemy camp on their own.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.160
Now!

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.620
It looked as though Asta's team 
was going to lose, but then...

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.210
The trap spells that Xerx set activated,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.050
and they managed to completely 
turn things around into a victory.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.970
And then, the one who appeared 
in the second match...

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.980
You're not beautiful!

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.250
Do your best not to taint my beauty, 
for I am Kirsch Vermillion!

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.040
Fierce Battle

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.560
Oh... life is so hard.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.910
C Team
The Coral Peacocks 1st Class Senior Magic Knight
Kirsch Vermillion

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.600
Why is this world filled 
with such unsightly things?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.810
And yet, why was I born so beautiful?

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.700
It's so hard.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.290
Where'd this weirdo come from?!

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.390
Shut up! I just... Shut up!

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.520
You're so insanely creepy, damn it!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.650
Don't be in such despair, you ugly creature.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.140
I understand that you must be 
quite jealous of my beauty,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.130
but there are things that 
just can't be helped.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.070
Who the hell are you calling ugly?! 
What even is this conversation?!

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.810
Did you get dropped on your 
head when you were born?!

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.470
The only one that's beautiful 
is Sis, and Sis alone!

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.190
You're so gross, you narcissist creep!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.140
A maiden shouldn't use such vulgar words.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.200
Your proportions are somewhat 
on the beautiful side.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.570
Why not learn from me to better yourself?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.040
I-Is that team going to be okay?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.670
Ah, if it isn't Mimosa.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.090
Did you come to admire my beauty, 
my beloved little sister?

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.640
Don't let my beauty cause your heart to stop.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.140
I wouldn't say you're beautiful. 
You're so narcissistic that it's creepy.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.570
What are you talking about, Mimosa?

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.860
You can't tell how beautiful I am?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.650
Are you sick? Let me cure you.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.170
I believe you're the one 
that's sick, Brother.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.700
I actually want you to 
lose this upcoming round.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.280
You were never good at telling jokes.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.740
I'm sorry, what?!

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.960
Jokes should be told with 
more elegance and beauty!

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.240
Yes! As beautiful as I am!

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.200
Mimosa's older bro is, like... sparkly. 
Or I guess I should say... unique.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.580
I have no idea what's going on,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.380
but I guess Mimosa's been 
through some hard times, too.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.110
Oh, heya. Nice to meet you.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.190
Mimosa's always been so kind to me.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.930
Are you the peasant known as Asta?

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.210
Yup.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.980
Don't talk to me as though 
we're friends, you swine.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.820
What the hell?! His eyes suddenly died!

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.680
I can't stand the sight of you.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.950
Neither your mannerisms nor 
behavior are beautiful.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.820
Your existence is unsightly.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.700
Your clothes are filthy.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.950
To top everything off, your muscles are ugly.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.120
Bodies should be beautiful just as they are.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.710
I don't see why you would train them.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.130
Only the weak would do such a thing.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.680
Yup! I was weak.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.930
I mean, I didn't have any magic!

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.130
That's why I trained!

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.430
They might be unsightly, 
but these are my weapons!

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.530
The size of the vessel into 
which an individual's mana

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.770
is poured is determined from birth.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.490
Unsightly struggling won't change its shape.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.820
Vessel... Wha?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:57.450
How could someone as unsightly 
as you become a Magic Knight?

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.390
Kirsch, please win this match,
 no matter what.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.630
Oh, Mimosa! To think you'd say such words!

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.090
Do you finally fully understand my charms?

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.340
Because Asta and I intend to 
slaughter you in the next round.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.010
S-S-Slaughter...

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.060
Such an unsightly word!

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.440
Who's that sparkly guy? I can see 
him from all the way up here.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.740
All that sparkling is sort of wasted on him.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.540
Kirsch Vermillion. 
He's Mimosa's older brother.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.150
To describe him in a single 
word... He's creepy.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.450
How could you say something like that?!

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.850
He's the Vice Captain of the Coral Peacocks!

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.220
Don't sell him short!

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.460
Despite how he looks,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.100
in place of their captain who's 
always asleep, Dorothy Unsworth,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.050
I hear he does almost all of
the squad's practical magic!

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.670
"Despite how he looks." So you 
think he's weird, too, four-eyes.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.310
Four-eyes sure does.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.850
Four-eyes definitely does.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.470
I do not!

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.600
Well, maybe a little bit.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.820
When's the next match going to begin?!

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.850
How long do they intend to make me wait?

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.920
All right, then.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.400
The next battle will be...

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:15.120
Sol   Kirsch   Magna

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:15.120
C Team

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:15.120
Cesc   Adrian   Willy

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:15.120
D Team

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:13.000
C Team: Kirsch, Sol, and Magna 
versus D Team: Cesc, Adrian, and Willy.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.120
Let the second match begin!

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.870
Now... let me show you 
how truly beautiful I am!

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.210
Shut the hell up!

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.730
We have to hurry up and get back so 
we can cheer Magna and the others on!

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.960
A-Asta's so close to me!

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.290
You seem unfazed, you shitty little shrimp.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.610
We're going to be facing 
them next if they win.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.560
Xerx...

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.500
Huh?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.640
You said earlier...

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.510
That you didn't come here to win. 
That you had a certain goal.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.650
I was lying.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.660
Don't hide anything from us. You piss 
me off, but you're our teammate.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.320
And you're strong.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.240
I'm going to make sure we 
win by working together!

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.620
Asta...

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.250
Then I'll need you to work hard 
as the decoy next round, too.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.310
That's not exactly working together!

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.380
Looks like it's started.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.180
Flame Creation Magic: Grand Slam!

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.680
Like I'm gonna waste any time!

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:29.320
If I just go right in there and bust 
the shit out of that crystal, we win!

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.450
What a fantastic spell!

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.880
A fifth-class junior peasant?

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.040
Just barging in there 
without a plan? He's no good.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.710
Shakudo Magic: Pursuing Jackals.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.210
You're so annoying!

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.010
Then how about this?

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.220
I see you, damn it!

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.680
I'm gonna beat the crap out of all 
these things, then beat the shit out of you!

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.060
What a crude way of fighting.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.030
So unsightly.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.610
Where the hell did you pop up from?!

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.080
You're straining too much.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.650
You're blessed with the ability to 
use both close and long-range magic.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.160
Your mana is crying.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.540
The hell did you say?!

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.670
Read the flow of the enemy's mana more.
Let your mana be your guide,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.290
and use close and long-range 
attacks at the appropriate times.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.650
Then you'll be able to burn 
more beautifully than before!

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.360
Uh... sure.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.300
Using close and long-range magic 
at the appropriate times...

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.150
Don't strain so much... And read 
the enemy's flow of mana...

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.860
I'll take care of the closer 
ones first. Take that!

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.000
And now for the one that's 
all the way back there!

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.680
All right!

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.880
Wait, where'd that sparkly bastard go?

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.260
Earth Creation Magic: Raging Mother Goddess!

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.010
Outta my way!

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.010
I'm gonna show you guys what I can do to 
raise our squad's rank and make Sis happy!

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.510
Mud Binding Magic: Flash Bog!

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.060
I'm not letting you go that easily.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.770
You and your golem can 
get sucked into my bog!

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.730
Damn it!

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.320
Why am I surrounded by such 
sloppy and simple-minded people?

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.280
Magic which creates golems that 
can be given certain orders?

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.260
Since this isn't a feint, 
its size is unsightly.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.790
What's your problem, ya jerk?!

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.030
Why not split it up into smaller ones 
and use them to cause confusion?

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.300
It would be beautiful to have them 
lie in ambush within the earth, too.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.860
You can do that with your 
unique mana, can't you?

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.550
Y-Yeah...

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.310
Earth Creation Magic: Divided Mother Goddess!

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.480
Mobility over power!

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.060
We're not gonna get caught in that bog again!

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.390
I shall guard the crystal! Therefore, 
it shall remain beautiful and unharmed.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.500
Bloom as gloriously as you wish!

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.330
What are you talking about? 
Your crystal's been left completely unguarded!

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.750
Water Creation Magic: Climbing Coelacanth!

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.170
You're mine!

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.210
I do apologize, but...

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.970
You're already captives 
of my beautiful magic.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.540
Cherry Blossom Magic:

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:54.980
Cherry Blossom Magic: Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals
 ~Plus My Beautiful Illusion~

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.980
Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals 
Plus My Beautiful Illusion!

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.650
That whole area's covered 
in a storm of petals!

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.450
C-Crap! I can't see where our enemies are!

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.740
This is...

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.200
...a road that leads straight to the crystal!

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.960
Go forth unto the beautiful 
primrose path to victory!

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.710
Full bloom!

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.130
Bloom! Bloom! Bloom! Bloom!

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.590
Fully bloom!

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.230
Full bloom!

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.860
C Team wins!

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.430
It's so pretty!

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.440
In this world, sin is...

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.910
being unsightly, and...

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.110
...failing to notice beauty!

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.920
We somehow got pulled into his bullshit!

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.990
It pisses me off, but it feels so good!

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.020
He's fast! And unbelievably strong!

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.450
And creepy.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:57.580
How are we going to beat 
them in the next battle?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:03.840
Ah... the greatest sin of all is my beauty.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.510
Well? How was our fighting?

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.430
Wasn't it beautiful?

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.990
Uh... Sure.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.230
Bah-ha...

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.690
Why the hell did I do that?!

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.320
Don't look at me!

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:28.880
That spell... First, he produced 
various clones to confuse the enemy.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.780
Then he covered the battlefield 
in a storm of magic petals,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.620
making it hard to see or detect magic.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.580
Meanwhile, it created a safe route to 
the enemy crystal for his teammates.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.960
The only way that's possible

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.420
is because being royalty gives 
you a monstrous amount of magic!

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.720
Ah... My beauty scares me.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.110
The man closest to becoming the next 
captain of the Coral Peacocks...

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.660
Kirsch Vermillion. Quite impressive.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.730
But he's still a weirdo.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.540
That magic was awesome!

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.180
Way to go, Mimosa's bro!

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.900
Please don't mention that, Asta.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.890
Quiet, swine.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.820
You're dirtying my space.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.870
You're next. A broken vessel 
like you who can't use magic...

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.870
I'll use my magic to shatter the rest of you.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.410
I don't know about that.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.610
I'm not sure how, but apparently when a 
vessel's cracked, you can use it longer.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.010
Cracked?

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.210
You were only using that 
vessel because you're poor.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.360
How unsightly.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.930
Say what?!

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.350
That cracked vessel was something 
Sister bought for us!

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.940
It's the symbol of love 
between Sister Lily and me!

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.070
I'm going to keep using it forever!

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.990
Asta, this was all just a "what if."

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.230
Your brain is unsightly, too.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.030
Next up is round three!

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:59.210
Finral  Leopold  Hamon

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:59.210
E Team

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:59.210
Kyle   Borja   Gaston

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:59.210
F Team

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:59.210
E Team: Finral, Leopold, and Hamon versus 
F Team: Kyle, Borja, and Gaston.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.340
The Crimson Lion Kings Intermediate Magic Knight Second Class
Leopold Vermillion

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.340
Let's hit 'em fast and 
loud with my flame magic!

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.590
The Golden Dawn Intermediate Magic Knight Second Class
Hamon Caseus

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:08.170
No, let us attack them with elegant 
flair using my glass magic.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.640
Seeing Kirsch fight has lit a fire within me.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.060
Let us also settle this beautifully.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.190
Who cares about beauty?

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.070
If you've been lit aflame, I'll use my 
flames to light an even greater flame!

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.900
Also, Kirsch is gross.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.940
Actually...

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:31.970
The Black Bulls Junior Magic Knight First Class
Finral Roulacase

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.260
Could you leave our attack strategy to me?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.730
Spatial magic gives you incredible mobility.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.320
There's no reason not to use that, right?

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.090
I haven't fought alongside 
the Black Bulls for nothing.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.180
I can't lose here!

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.690
This guy...

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.710
I like it! Let's see you bring 
out the best in us then!

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.670
Leopold and Hamon are both quite skilled.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.380
Go after the trash from the Black Bulls!

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.890
I'm not so sure about that!

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.070
His spatial magic is pretty useful.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.770
Borja!

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.360
Feather Magic: Feather Tornado!

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.990
Leopold, now!

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.910
Got it!

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.370
You're not getting away!

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.340
Curses... Friendly fire was 
their goal all along.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.760
And flame magic is an attribute
 I'm weak against on top of that!

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.390
That spatial magic user has a 
good eye on this battlefield.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:49.400
He knows where our magic works best and takes
 us to the perfect point on the battlefield!

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.700
Glass Creation Magic: Verre Épée!

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.700
To think that the Black Bulls
 had someone this good.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.250
Why did he stay hidden for so long?

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.250
At this rate, I can attack 
with all the power I've got.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.920
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.220
Crystal destroyed! E Team wins!

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.510
Yes!

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.890
I'm glad we won, but man, was I nervous!

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.390
Come now.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.900
We should have a meal after a battle.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.800
Indeed! Let's see who can eat the most!

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.500
Bring it on!

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.970
I'm definitely not in the 
mood for that right now.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.950
You're amazing, Finral!

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.730
Bah... ha...

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.860
The way he uses his spatial 
magic is troublesome.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.750
He's still a junior Magic Knight?

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.260
All of the Black Bulls in this exam so 
far have been junior Magic Knights.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.300
I hadn't taken them seriously,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.130
but the last two Black Bulls
 also exhibited powers

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.180
that seemed beyond juniors.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.100
Maybe the Black Bulls really 
are different this year.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.770
Not bad for the guy who brought 
shame upon the House of Vaude.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.210
I'll show you exactly how 
different we are next.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.980
Next up is round four!

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:18.110
Gareth   Simon   Medeo

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:18.110
H Team

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:18.110
Langris   Flagil   Sekke

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:18.110
G Team

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:18.110
G Team: Langris, Flagil, and Sekke versus 
H Team: Gareth, Simon, and Medeo.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.900
Crap! Bah-ha, crap!

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:24.890
The Green Praying Mantises Junior Magic Knight Fifth Class
Sekke Bronzazza

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.200
Everyone here is ridiculously strong!

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.240
It was too early for me 
to do this exam, bah-ha!

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.120
Besides, what the heck 
was up with Captain Jack being all,

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.980
"Let's give the newbies a chance, too"?!

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.510
This is definitely bad news!

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.370
Why the heck did I get picked, anyway?!

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.010
I mean, I said I could do it, but...

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.820
Are you all right?

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.060
The Black Bulls so far have been 
amazing despite being juniors.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:49.020
The Aqua Deer Intermediate Magic Knight Third Class
Flagil Tormenta

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.020
You're probably also strong, aren't you?

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.210
Bah-ha! I'm surprised you saw through me!

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.270
What to do...

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.900
I don't like standing out, 
but I guess I don't have a choice.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:05.740
First off, why don't I go rampaging 
in on my Sekke Shooting Star?

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.180
Um...

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.580
That sounds like a great plan.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.580
The Golden Dawn Vice Captain
Langris Vaude

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.840
All right. The crystal is completely 
covered with a barrier spell.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.090
No one can destroy it easily now.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.920
Keep going straight.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.230
You got it, bah-ha!

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.180
They're charging straight at us?

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.360
What the hell is that lame vehicle?

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.400
You fools!

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.370
Now you can fall for the trap 
spells we set in the earth!

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.600
He shaved the space away.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.600
Th-The crystal's been destroyed. G Team wins!

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.980
Did you all witness that elegant rampage?!

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.480
I'm one with the wind!

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.990
Bah-ha...

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.220
As expected from the House of Vaude.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.240
How beautiful.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.860
Wow... That's Finral's younger brother.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.500
Could I cut magic like that with my sword?

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.000
Bah-ha...

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.920
In the end, you'll never be more than 
a means of transportation, Brother.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.130
In our upcoming match, be careful not to 
get in the way of my spatial magic, okay?

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.370
I can't guarantee that you 
won't lose something.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.060
If that were to happen, 
Mother and Father aside,

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.310
I'm sure that she would be sad.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.150
You're right.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.320
So to ensure that doesn't happen,
 I'm going to win!

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.150
How insolent of you, Brother.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.420
Petit Clover

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.860
Petit Clover!

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.880
I Can See It!

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.910
I Can See It!

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.720
You're amazing, Finral! 
You can see the whole battle!

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.540
Your field of vision is huge!

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.560
Well, I'm lucky enough to have 
Captain Yami train me every day.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.890
Huh? What kind of training is that?!

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.640
For example, after a meal...

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.150
Heave ho, heave ho, heave ho...

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.240
The way he's patting his belly...

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.460
You must need to use the bathroom!
 Right this way!

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.530
Bathroom

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.530
That annoyed way he's knocking on the door...

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.580
Bathroom

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.990
You must be out of toilet paper! Here you go!

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.260
Other than that...

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.660
Here's your paper!

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.540
Here's your coffee milk!

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.760
I'll make sure your mustache 
looks wild enough!

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.380
Not too clean-shaven and not too rugged!

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.350
That's how it is.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.010
That's awesome!

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.130
He's just getting used.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.340
You can't be serious.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.670
Hello, I'm here to dazzle you
 with my beauty again.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.410
You were so beautifully happy 
when I beautifully spread beauty

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.270
across the battlefield 
because I'm so beautiful.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:51.110
The even more beautiful <i>Black Clover</i>, 
beautiful Page 76: "Mage X."

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 76
 Mage X

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.820
My beauty knows no bounds.
