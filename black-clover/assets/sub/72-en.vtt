00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.690
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.470
The Crimson Lion Kings placed fifth?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.680
The new Captain of the 
Crimson Lion Kings, Mereoleona Vermillion,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.480
is the older sister of Fuegoleon,
who was injured

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.690
fighting the Eye of the Midnight Sun 
and has yet to awaken.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.480
Thus,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.860
she decided to hold a training camp at 
a hot spring in a strong magic region,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.280
and she ended up dragging Asta 
and some of the others there.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.200
Asta and the others head toward the 
summit where the hot spring is, but...

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.580
I'm not going back!

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.920
I...

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.750
What we're striving for isn't something 
that can be obtained just by luck!

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.840
I'll get to the top!

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.630
Our dream is waiting for us 
at the top, beyond merit!

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.040
Saint Elmo's Fire

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.270
Strong
Magic
Region

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.270
Yultim
Volcano
Trail

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.290
I acted all tough and 
said I'd get to the top,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.410
but I can't even move an inch in this heat!

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.920
What should I do? If my muscles 
or guts can't get me through this,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.010
there's nothing I can do right now.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.990
I can't do this my normal way.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.380
Normal? Then what if I try 
something that's not normal?

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.060
That power!

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.000
But how do I use it?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.580
Last time, I sorta went unconscious and 
ended up like that when I came to.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.140
I don't know!

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.970
Your head looks like it's 
about to explode, too.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.600
That's what you get for thinking too hard.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.980
Right...

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.390
I can't think too hard about this.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.280
It's not like thinking helped 
at all last time, either.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.650
I need to concentrate. Empty my mind...

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.860
Transform!

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.000
Actually, you can go home after all.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.900
Please forget you saw that!

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.760
You got it all wrong! I can do this!

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.290
I can do it if I try!

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.970
Then I suggest that you keep struggling.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.270
Yes, ma'am!

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.500
That's the only thing I can do!

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.720
I'll struggle, struggle, 
and struggle some more!

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.250
Come to think of it, back then,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.880
it wasn't just the fact that 
I wasn't thinking about anything.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.260
I was about to die.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.830
Is that why I unconsciously...

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.970
Then, I guess...

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.240
I'll try jumping into the lava.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.510
I ran head-first into Salamander's explosions!

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.490
This isn't going to be scary at all!

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.480
No, wait! That's just being reckless!

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.890
Did you forget what he told you back then?

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.960
Stay calm at all times!

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960
I need to think...

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.140
I-It's no use! I can't think of a damn thing!

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.300
Because I'm stupid!

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.810
I'm so jealous of that 
Mana Skin barrier thingie.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.250
If only I had some magic... Damn it!

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.160
I haven't been this jealous 
of everyone in a long time.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.250
Hang on, Asta. You've gotta stop 
being so envious of others.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.360
You've done a lot yourself.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.790
There's no way a fool who doesn't 
know himself can manage it.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.450
I don't know myself? Could it be that...

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.330
I still don't fully comprehend 
the power that I have?

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.510
First, I have this anti-magic sword

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.710
that only I can hold, because I 
don't have any magical powers.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.610
It can cut through any magic.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.920
But I can't do anything 
about this environment.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.950
Second, I trained my body and increased my 
stamina so that I could use this sword.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.020
I could climb any other mountain,
 but not this one.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.660
Third, I can now use the ki detection 
that Captain Yami taught me about.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.780
It's now part of my routine.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.110
Using that, I'll know when the rocks or lava 
from the eruptions are heading my way, but...

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.170
Ki?

00:05:48.470 --> 00:06:01.500
Ki

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.890
People looking at you,
the sound of their breathing,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.750
their smell, the motions of their muscles,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.370
the vague sense that they're there...

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.070
Ki is the blanket term for all of the 
different types of life energy

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.510
the human body emits.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.900
When I do it, I combine it with 
magic and muscle, and fight that way.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.140
Could it be that if I use 
ki detection on myself,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.790
I'll find out more about that power?

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.010
I was right. I sense my own ki within my body,

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.480
as well as something black flowing 
into my body from the sword.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.610
If I could only strengthen this flow.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.870
Like, circulate it throughout my body more...

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.900
Circulate... like a river? No, like a ring?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.160
What stance would make 
that easier to visualize?

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.880
This is it!

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.700
All right, good! Flow even 
more throughout my body!

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.160
More... Even more!

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.580
More fiercely!

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.060
The sword's anti-magic flowed 
into Asta's body amplified itself,

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.640
and then brought about 
a change in Asta's body.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.610
There it is!

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.350
I can feel the power overflowing!

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.130
All right, I'm gonna make it to the top!

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.380
I can't stop!

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.280
Y-You can't be serious!

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.870
That attack didn't work?

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.040
Magical Lifeform
<font size="30">Borula</c>

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.270
Don't falter! If we can't 
defeat something like this,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.040
we're unworthy to be called Magic Knights!

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.600
Yeah, so take care of it already, Leopold.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.350
You got it! Wait... Noelle!

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.190
Your attribute is water, which gives 
you an edge over that thing!

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.620
What are you doing?!

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.640
Shut up! It's taking all my concentration 
to keep my Mana Skin up!

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.280
Asta?

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.350
But that form...

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.570
One Horn Bull Thrust!

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.310
That's my rival for you! So you've 
acquired a new special technique, eh?

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.450
That black aura... 
I shall dub you Black Asta!

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.180
Wait, where are you going?!

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.700
Hell if I know!

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.090
Oh, crap! Oh, crap! I don't know how to stop!

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.410
I seem to be heading 
toward the summit, but...

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.050
That's...

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.010
Yuno!

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.060
Asta...

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.330
I'm headed head-first into the lava!

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.540
You're not going to help him?

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.250
There's no need.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.540
The anti-magic overflowing from his 
body isn't heading toward the lava.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.660
It's headed toward her fierce magic.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.790
She's pulling me to her?

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.330
P-Please run!

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.070
Run?

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.110
You fool!

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.670
Among lions, the females 
are the ones who hunt!

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.710
Flame Magic:

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.010
Calidos Brachium!

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.290
Impressive.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.280
Looks like that violent lioness 
is as psychotic as ever.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.090
How'd she do that midair?

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.520
Yo, kid! You alive?

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.810
H-Holy crap!

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.530
She's definitely Captain 
Fuegoleon's big sister!

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.910
It looks like you've finally 
learned a little about yourself.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.450
But you still have a ways to go.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.160
Yes, ma'am!

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.780
I couldn't control it very well, 
but I was able to use that power!

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.840
I'm gonna get even stronger and 
pass that Royal Knights exam!

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.000
So you're finally all here, you fools!

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.030
The Yultim Volcano becomes 
completely dormant at night.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.310
You're supposed to get 
here before that, damn it!

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.130
At this rate, we're never 
going to win back first place!

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.410
Those who couldn't make 
it up here before nightfall

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.730
will try again another day!

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.070
Yes, ma'am!

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.220
I made it here before the sun set, 
but I shall climb it one more time...

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.870
no, a hundred more times, and become 
even stronger than you, Sister!

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.580
That's not enough! Climb it 10,000 times!

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.460
Yes, ma'am!

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.300
Good! Now I give you all permission 
to soak in the hot spring!

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.690
Hot springs, huh?

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.100
I remember soaking in one back 
at Hage Village after my training.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.890
B-But where is the hot spring?

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.890
Holy crap! Hot water came outta nowhere!

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.660
And now it's a huge bath!

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.660
So this is the Yultim Volcano hot spring!

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.710
You can't be serious.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.970
The analeptic effect of this hot 
spring is the best in our kingdom!

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.040
But no one ever bothers to use it, 
so we always get it to ourselves.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.970
It's the best hole in the 
wall you could ask for!

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.970
Well, I mean, any normal bastard would 
die before they ever got up here.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.140
All right, you fools! Take off your clothes!

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.850
What?!

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.190
B-But Sister, we couldn't possibly...

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.810
All the ladies are here, too!
What's gonna happen?!

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.360
Are we all getting in together?!

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.970
I don't know if her name 
is Meringue or Orange Juice,

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.530
but what the heck's her problem?!

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.200
I'm not going to allow Yuno to take 
off his clothes in front of any girls!

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.330
T-Together with Yami in a hot spring?

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.840
I like women who like hot springs.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.340
It doesn't hurt to have someone 
wash your back sometimes.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:44.030
Wh-Why am I having 
such ludicrous delusions?!

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.550
Okay, don't lose it.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.060
Stay calm. Stay calm.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.830
How am I supposed to stay calm?!

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.450
I will never allow any man to 
see Sis's pure, naked body!

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.990
Earth Magic: Mud Wall Partition!

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.200
Anyone who dares to climb 
this wall shall die!

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.370
Whoa! She created a women's bath 
and a men's bath in an instant!

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.370
All right, you fools! Hurry up and get in!

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.630
Yeah!

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.680
The view's as nice as ever.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.310
The temperature's just right.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.150
Sis... You're so b-beautiful.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.530
If this isn't heaven, 
then I don't know what is.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.780
Nothing beats having a drink 
while soaking in here.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.750
How about it, Charlotte? 
Have a drink with me.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.710
No, thank you. I'll pass.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.920
What? Is my liquor too good for you?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.660
No, it's nothing like that.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.130
I hold you in the highest regard,
 Lady Mereoleona.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.720
Then drink with me.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.770
I was already a drunken mess in 
front of Yami at the Star Festival.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.600
If that happens when I'm naked, I'll just die!

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.910
Then I'll have some.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.730
Despite how I look, 
I'm way older than all of you!

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.230
Oh? The Wind Spirit?

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.030
This wall won't suddenly break, will it?

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.370
Why are you zoning out?

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.520
H-Hey! I can wash my hair myself!

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.970
Oh, don't be shy! You said 
your name was Noelle?

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.330
You've got some guts! I like gutsy women!

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.500
Wanna join our squad?

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.750
Um... I'm already a Black Bull...

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.260
What's so great about that squad?
 It's overrun by men.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.890
What? Well, the girls are working hard, too.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.770
I mean, there are some loud 
and reckless guys, but...

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.020
But they're not all bad...

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.380
Most of the Blue Rose Knights are women! 
All the guys in our squad are errand boys.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.900
I was hoping we could get that Yuno guy to 
join so we could work him to the bone, too.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.170
I never thought he'd get that strong.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.330
All the guys are errand boys...

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.280
That doesn't sound so bad.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.290
The men's bath is right over there.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.430
R-Right about now, Yami's over there...

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.480
Nude...

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.790
Right over there!

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.800
Why are you floating like that? 
You didn't even drink anything.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.050
And that's how you are after one sip?

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.540
S-Sis, are you okay?!

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.500
You're so beautiful, 
even when you're passed out!

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.850
C-Call me "Captain."

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:40.900
You got it, Sis!

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.540
Fan me, too...

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.530
What happened to them?

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.030
This is a decent bath.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.170
The stars are so beautiful.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.290
Lady Acier also loved the 
view of the stars from here.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.630
My mother came here?

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.180
She's the one who showed me 
this spot in the first place.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.270
What was my mother like?

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:24.400
Um... No one will tell me about her.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.430
She was a strong woman.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.030
She would give me lessons quite often.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:34.240
I was undefeated on the battlefield, 
yet I was never able to defeat her once.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.080
It didn't even matter that my magical 
attribute had the advantage.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.380
The Steel Warrior Princess who would 
dance around the battlefield, Acier Silva...

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.210
Her strength and beauty 
captivated everyone.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:51.300
And you look a lot like her. 
You're her spitting image.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.640
But your magical abilities 
aren't like hers at all.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.060
Your sloppy magic control makes it hard 
to believe that you're her daughter.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:07.940
Her daughter

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.130
Her magic was refined beyond belief,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:07.940
Refined

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.670
and it had dignity.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.450
Your magic is so crude and unsightly, 
it's hard to believe you're royalty.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:07.940
Crude

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.860
And that's why you must surpass her.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.820
You may look like your mother,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.450
but surpass her with a 
strength that's all your own.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.950
Yes, ma'am!

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.460
Of course. Even that idiot who doesn't 
have any magical powers is doing his best.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.550
Even if I lack talent, I'm not 
going to run or make excuses.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.570
I'm getting fired up, 
and my body's feeling warm, too.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.300
Wait, it's actually getting hotter?!

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.290
How dare you try to show off?! 
I'm sure you can't handle this heat!

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.180
I'll melt the cool right off of you!

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.520
I'm totally fine.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.730
What did you say?!

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.660
Leo, he's not trying to act cool or anything!

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.450
He just hates losing!

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.610
I also hate losing!

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.330
Let's see who can stay in here the longest!

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.870
Hey! Why are you cooling down 
the water with your wind?!

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:05.750
That's not fair!

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.250
It's not cheating. Magic is 
part of my strength, too.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.060
Besides, you're heating it 
with magic in the first place.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.810
What the hell are you dumbasses doing?

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.100
There are better ways to enjoy a hot spring.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.640
Captain Yami!

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.470
What are the other ways to enjoy a hot spring?

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.180
Do you mean working out? 
Or maybe working out?

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.690
It's working out, isn't it?!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.990
Shut the hell up.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.790
Is your head full of muscles, too?

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.210
You're the only moron who'd enjoy that.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.150
No!

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.150
It's not working out?

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.530
And here's another one with 
a head full of muscles.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:44.810
Captain... Then what's this 
other way to enjoy it?

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.250
What else?

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.000
We're gonna go peep at the women's bath!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.410
D-Did he say peep?

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.470
Are we allowed to do that?

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.340
Won't they kill us if they find out?

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.510
I can't believe what a bunch of whiners you are.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.070
If you're a true man, 
this is a risk you've gotta take.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.770
Even if it costs your life.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.020
I-Is that what it means...

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.020
...to be a man?

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.540
Yes. All guys are like that.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.030
I'm sure you want to take 
a look, too, Mister Cool.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.400
No, I don't.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.550
You stupid little punk. 
Don't you try and act cool with me,

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.540
you breezy little pretty boy.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.250
Uh... again, this isn't just part of
 my character, so please stop...

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.510
Well, someone doesn't give a shit about 
your character, you dumbass.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.000
And that's me.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.330
Please stop, Captain Yami!

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.660
Yuno really isn't interested!

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.980
He's only ever bathed with 
guys since he was a kid!

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.910
Come to think of it, 
my brother loved baths, too.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:56.970
Leopold, I still have many 
things I must teach you.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.570
Of course, Big Brother!

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.740
W-Wait! Was the thing he said he 
had to teach me back then...

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:09.140
Leopold, what I'm going to 
teach you right now is...

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.220
To peep into women's baths!

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.630
Of course, Big Brother!

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.170
There's no way that happened!

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.050
No... My brother would never look.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.110
Actually, he'd probably be 
furious and try to stop us.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.680
What are you mumbling about, bomb head?

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.850
Why are you trying to be like that 
Hot-Blooded King of Hardnoses?

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.020
You're going to surpass him, aren't you?

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.290
That's right!

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.190
I'm going to surpass my brother!

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.070
What the hell are you 
guys standing around for?

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.360
This is a battle, in a sense.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.630
Why are you so scared of being killed?

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.240
We came here to whip you 
wimps back into shape!

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.460
He's right!

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.300
You must never run from a battle!

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.750
We are the best! The Crimson Lion Kings!

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.090
All right! We're gonna peep!

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.620
Let's show them how manly we are!

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.490
Yeah!

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.220
Wh-What is that?

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.310
Don't tell me those guys...

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.650
Oh? Listen to those fearless voices.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.730
Now they sound more like 
the Crimson Lion Kings.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.150
But they're going to try to peep!

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.210
You're never going to see 
Sis's pure, naked body!

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.830
Earth Magic: Mud Wall Cliff!

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.260
Don't back down!

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.740
We are the Crimson Lion Kings! We can 
climb over any wall, no matter how high!

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.890
Yeah!

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.930
You can't be serious.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.780
Okay, get going, kid!

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.110
You've learned a new technique. 
Now go become a real man!

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:12.200
No! My heart belongs to Sister, 
so I absolutely refuse to look!

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.540
Uh... Sure.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.460
Exhaustion Recovery.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.780
Sister Lily always heals the people 
of Hage Village with her sweet smile.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.950
And it's said that it's the Hage 
Hot Spring that heals her soul.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.540
But there are times when she's so 
busy with her duties at the church

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.950
that even a hot spring is not 
enough to help her recover.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.540
When that happens, she eats 
tatoes pickled in black vinegar.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.790
Father introduced me to these, and they 
worked instantly the day after I ate them!

Sister is as beautiful as ever!

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.870
Hello, everyone. It's been a while.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.980
Asta and Yuno are working so hard!

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.610
Everyone at the church is proud of you two.
