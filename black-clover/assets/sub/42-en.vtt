00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.010
To retrieve the magic stone that 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun is after,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100
Asta and the others headed 
for the Underwater Temple.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.850
But a strong flow of mana 
caused powerful currents,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.190
making it impossible for anyone to go in.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.840
The only time the mana would weaken was 
in a week, on the night of the full moon.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.690
Yami ordered Noelle to master a 
water spell that would allow them

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.550
to move through the water by then.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.820
Asta and a mysterious girl 
named Kahono encouraged Noelle

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.240
when she was unable 
to control her powers.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.330
The rest of the Black Bulls also joined in.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.330
And then...

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.430
They all acknowledged me 
and gave me a mission.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.590
I want to help them!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.590
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.520
I... I did it!

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.720
All right!

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.200
The Sea Dragon's Cradle...

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.430
Kahono! I did it—

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.570
Huh? Kahono?

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.960
You've got some great friends!

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.670
They're the ones who should be 
cheering for you in the end!

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.950
Good for you!

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.380
Well, I'll be waiting for you, Noelle!

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.830
Inside the temple! Okay?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.660
The Underwater Temple

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.170
Tonight's finally the night of the full moon.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.180
The mana deep within 
these waters will weaken,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.160
so it's the only day we'll be able 
to reach the Underwater Temple.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.350
You guys better be ready.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.610
Just you wait, Underwater Temple!

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.320
Just you wait, magic stone!

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.280
Just you wait, unidentified seafood!

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.510
I wonder if they'll have something 
rare that I haven't tried yet.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.700
I wonder who I'll be able 
to fight. I can't wait!

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.450
Let's hurry up and go!

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.330
The sooner we go, the sooner we can 
go home, and the sooner I can see Marie.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.380
And I can get back to flirting!

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.970
Looks like you're all set.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.740
We're counting on you, Noelle.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.110
R-Right...

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.120
Are you nervous?

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.870
H-Huh? I-I-I'm not nervous at all!

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.810
Everything went great yesterday.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.870
Aw, you're so stiff.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.300
Wanna drink this so you can relax?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.200
Why would you offer her 
a drink, you lush?!

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.030
Our lives are at stake here!

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.500
Well, if she's feeling pressured,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.660
it might not work out,
no matter how good she is.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.210
Noelle, just take it easy.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.090
But if you mess it up, I'll kill you.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.470
The pressure's so intense!

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.550
Honestly, what's with you people?

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.010
I feel stupid for even being 
nervous in the first place.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.300
I mean, none of these guys

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.020
believe for a second that my magic will fail.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.650
Okay, here we go.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.950
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.080
I did it! It worked!

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.670
This is amazing, Noelle, but...

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.020
G-Grey...

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.920
Get off me, you big tub of lard!

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.430
I think I want to kill you.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.550
Turn into someone smaller!

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.020
How's this, my inferiors?

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.810
Now your ego's inflated!

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.320
Well done, Noelle. I'm counting on you 
to get us to the Underwater Temple.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.740
O-Of course. Here we go.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.120
H-He praised me!

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.340
This is awesome!

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.050
We're actually moving through the ocean!

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.100
So many yummy-looking fish!

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.200
Look, Marie! This is what it 
looks like inside the ocean.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.440
Hey, get closer to the fish!
Marie wants to see!

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.440
I don't have time for that!

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.290
Marie! Marie!

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.100
Let me see your precious face!

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.820
The mana in the water's getting stronger.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.450
Come back! Marie!

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.920
What's that?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.780
What the hell is that?!

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.450
Looks like the entrance 
to the strong magic region.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.620
I-Is the mana here really weaker?

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.040
The strong magic region's insane!

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.290
Lady Noe, you'd better be able to handle this!

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.750
You're probably super scared,
Magna, since you use fire.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.180
Wh-Wh-Who are you calling scared, you jerk?!

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.320
You've got this, Noelle!

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.320
La!

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.930
You can do this, Noelle!

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.930
La!

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.160
Go, go, to the strong magic region!

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.160
La! La! La!

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.440
Hey, shut up! I can't concentrate!

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.980
We're just barely avoiding the currents...

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.820
It's as though the mana 
is cooperating with us.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.320
We can do this.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.360
Crap. I feel sick.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.160
I'm gonna throw up.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.070
If you throw up in here,
I'll kill you, pervy woman!

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.080
The intensity is decreasing.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.410
Whoa!

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.740
This is awesome!

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.590
It's so pretty!

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.330
There are so many creatures 
I've never seen before!

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.870
That fish is super shiny!

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.490
Isn't that glow... magic? So badass.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.540
Looks like some of the creatures evolved 
a bit further because of the mana.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.650
I wonder if it's yummy.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.530
I wonder if its taste 
evolved a bit further, too.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.280
We're gonna go catch it real quick!

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.420
You idiots!

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.420
Do you two want to drown?!

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.510
And Grey, you don't need to 
mimic her glutton side, too!

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.230
That's...

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.160
Those whirlpools... They're magic barriers!

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.230
And they're extremely powerful.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.230
We won't be able to get through like this.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.370
All right, you're up, kid.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.740
Go slice through it with 
your anti-magic sword.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.840
Captain Yami...

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.980
Huh?

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:43.350
You see... coming to the ocean for my first 
time made me realize something crazy.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.750
I can't swim!

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.250
Man, doesn't that suck?

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.560
Who said you need to swim?

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.760
Huh?

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.010
P-P-Please wait! At least give 
me time to get myself ready!

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:02.090
Your time is my time... 
and my time is my time.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.270
What?!

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.270
Ready, and go!

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.310
I can't breathe! I'm gonna drown!

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.040
Huh? There's air.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.580
Good work.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.000
Woohoo! We're saved!

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.490
See? You were scared.
You even peed your pants.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.260
I did not, you bastard!
They're just wet from the water!

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.020
The mana's too strong!
I can't connect with Marie!

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.510
Gauche! Gauche!

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.550
You're on top of me!

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.890
Marie's more important!

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.560
But what a surprise.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.890
Who knew there was a space 
like this on the ocean floor?

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:54.990
Oh?

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.100
Oh, my.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.790
So this is the Underwater Temple!

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.790
Charmy.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.540
Make us some cotton.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.790
Roger!

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.680
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.310
Have a bite.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.180
Thanks!

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.190
How boring. No one's attacking us.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.640
True. There don't even seem 
to be any trap spells.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.870
That's a bit disappointing.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.730
Aw, how boring.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.870
Don't you dare let your 
guard down, you bastards!

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.450
This is the strong magic region! 
Be ready for anything!

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:46.810
Yeah!

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.140
There.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.220
This is awesome!

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.060
Are these houses?

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.490
Does that mean there are underwater people?

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.600
Are they strong? Are they violent?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.290
Aren't you guys excited to fight them?!

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.980
That'd be just you, kid.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.120
Hey! There are people over there!

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.890
Seriously? Underwater people?

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.410
They won't suddenly attack, will they?!

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.950
Shh! They'll hear us.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.020
Hey, are they...

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.580
Yeah, I think they definitely heard us.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.520
How rare!

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.720
Guys! We have visitors for once!

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.740
Wait, that robe... Are you a Magic Knight?

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.430
So cool!

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.290
Tell us about the outside world.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.030
What kinds of missions have you done?

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.030
Okay, okay!

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.810
Leave everything to the great Charmy!

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.810
It's been about ten years 
since we had visitors.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.710
Wait! I was picturing a dangerous dungeon!

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.310
Thankfully, most of the time,
what you expect isn't what you get.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.700
I guess we should find 
someone who looks like

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.030
they know something about the magic stone.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.820
Indeed.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.140
Well, hurry up and bring out the 
boss of this temple. Capisce?

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.200
Captain Yami! You sound 
like some gangster!

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.520
Got it! That'd probably be 
the high priest! Capisce?

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.280
You can find the high priest 
right up those stairs. Capisce?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.400
I can take you there. Capisce?

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.420
It caught on!

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.470
Hey, you guys are cute. Why don't we 
have an underwater barbecue together?

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.720
Right, Gauche?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.220
Marie is a billion times cuter.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.940
H-Hey, Grey!

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.740
Why don't you turn into me?
We can have that witty twin banter again.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.230
No one's as pretty as you 
in the outside world.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.860
You turned into Gordon and you're 
flirting?! Seriously? Why Gordon?!

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.530
Crab pot, crab egg foo young,
crab dumplings...

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.940
Things seem to be going really smoothly.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.280
Isn't that a good thing?

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.000
Though you're probably not satisfied 
if you're not almost dying all the time.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.170
Uh, it's not like I actually 
enjoy almost dying all the time!

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.840
This must be it.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.200
Tell the high priest hi for us!

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.690
Let's chat some more when you come back.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.360
Sure, thanks!

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.730
If you do...

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.100
...actually return, that is.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.040
There's someone there.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.710
Is that the high priest guy?!

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.750
Hey!

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.470
There's something really crazy here!

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.910
Hurry up and do something, Asta!

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.180
Wait! It might actually be the 
kind-hearted protector of the temple,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:03.980
despite how it looks!

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.530
I won't do anything unless it attacks—

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.160
What?!

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.240
What's that big creepy thing?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.580
They didn't even hesitate!

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.060
Well, well! Looks like we've 
got some interesting guests!

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.490
Welcome to the Underwater Temple!

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.700
I'm the high priest here!

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.650
What's with the hyper geezer?

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.690
Hey. That was some welcome, you old fart.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.330
I just love surprising people!

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.320
Those young 'uns over there had 
some delightful reactions.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.650
You need a better hobby.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.010
I wonder if he's yummy.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.530
Uh, Charmy, I wouldn't...

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.970
It just fell apart?!

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.700
It made itself easier to eat?!

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.370
That's my magic.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.850
Huh?!

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.000
I couldn't eat it.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.570
I don't know what kind 
of magic that was, but...

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.210
He made something that big with magic?

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.680
Who is this old guy?

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.640
You guys are after the 
magic stone, aren't you?

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.060
If you want it, why don't 
we play a little game?

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.190
Play a game with you?

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.020
And there it is. It's probably 
something really dangerous.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.570
He's calling it a game, but it's probably 
something that could potentially kill us!

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.080
I call this game...

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.910
The boob-squeezing game!

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.060
Nobody's going to be playing that.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.650
Hey! Don't beat on the high priest!

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.040
I think he's really important!

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.800
And I'm royalty!

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.840
Oh, I'm just kidding!

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.970
I think you need to know there are people 
in this world that you shouldn't joke with.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.100
Stop! Let's all respect our elders!

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.710
Hey, old man. We don't have 
time to play with you.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.320
How do you know about 
the magic stone, anyway?

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.680
I have pretty good eyes, you see.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.820
What'll it be? You want the magic stone
for your kingdom, don't you?

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.270
What do you wanna do?
Send him flying and steal it?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.780
Yeah, that sounds fast. I'm in.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.240
That old guy seems like he has lots of magic,
so it might be fun to fight him!

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.730
Hey! I'm hearing a lot of 
dangerous talk over there!

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.940
Magic Knights aren't allowed to do that!

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.680
There's no way that old man is normal.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.650
I need to make sure I don't get 
pulled into anything troublesome.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.310
I'm getting sleepy.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.520
Pardon me, but where's the food?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.760
And you people don't intend to work at all!

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.110
Haven't you made up your minds yet?

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.550
If you win the game, 
in addition to the magic stone,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.330
I'll gather the temple's 
most beautiful girls

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:58.870
and hold an exquisite banquet 
with the very best food and drink.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.700
Let's do this!

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.250
Seriously?

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.670
Is that more important than the mission?!

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.710
I'll do anything from games to working out!

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:10.670
Okay, dial it back a bit.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.630
All right, old man. We'll do it.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.270
This gaming expert will take you on.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.330
You go, Mister Yami! You're the 
biggest player of them all!

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.730
So what are we playing?

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.480
Dice? Roulette?

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:29.980
A white-hot...

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.980
Temple battle royale!

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.240
Yeah!

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.500
Temple mages, come on out!

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.500
Game Magic: Temple Shuffle!

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.510
What're those?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.260
New passages?

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.060
You called, High Priest?

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.390
Finally! Mages from the outside who 
made it to the Underwater Temple!

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.610
I'm so excited!

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.260
Still... They don't look that tough.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.890
The fish are talking!

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.780
Huh? What was that, punk? 
Look at your lame-ass masks!

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.260
The magic's just rolling off these guys!

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.250
Are they the warriors from 
the Underwater Temple?

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.540
Well, then. Why don't we get started?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.690
Wait, already?

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.250
And start what?

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.550
All right, then.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.550
Let the games... begin!

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.390
I'm not ready yet!

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.470
What the heck, man?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.130
Where am I? Where is everyone?

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.040
Test, test, test. Can you all hear me?

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:14.000
You've been scattered to different 
areas inside the temple.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.860
So we're still inside the temple. Awesome!

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.880
Starting now,

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:24.390
you'll face off against the 
temple mages, nine-on-nine.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.850
Where's the food?

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:30.330
Come to think of it, I don't 
know any attack spells yet!

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.250
Wait. Nine?

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.650
There should be ten of us...
We're missing one.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.480
The rules are simple.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.550
If you knock out your opponent, you win.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.820
If your opponent gives up, you win.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.890
I think I sobered up a little.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.620
Victory goes to the first team 
to wipe out the other team,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.490
or whichever team has the 
most members left in the end.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.780
I wonder who I should turn into next.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.780
You can fight however you'd like!

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.570
You can fight one-on-one or even run away.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.380
You can find your friends 
and fight together, as well!

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.260
This sounds way too violent.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.580
Fine! I'm gonna run like 
a bunny. Go for it, guys!

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:12.480
However, my nuisance spells 
are out there, so be careful!

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.380
Nuisance spells?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.230
Just you wait, stupid geezer.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.510
Yay! This is awesome!

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.070
A blood-soaked battle! I'm super pumped!

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.010
That's so easy to understand!

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.570
All right! Bring it on!

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.530
Oh?

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.940
That's funny...

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.420
I can't seem to sense any magic from you.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.050
Can you actually fight?

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:45.840
Good grief. Guess I picked a loser.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.170
Wanna find out if I'm 
actually a loser or not?

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:26.280
Petit Clover

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.430
Petit Clover!

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.780
There Are Ten of Us

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.790
There Are Ten of Us.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.370
You called, High Priest?

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.370
Sorry to call the nine of 
you here without warning.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.490
Sadly, I have some bad news.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.690
Huh?

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:47.800
Something felt off, so I counted again,
and there's one extra.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.800
One extra?

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.390
What do you mean?

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.700
Your numbers.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.080
What?!

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.290
That's impossible!

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.900
Unbelievable! That means there's 
elephantly an impostor among us!

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.990
What's the elematter?

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.160
Wh-What's the matter?

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.260
You're not a sea creature, are you?

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.640
Oh, come on! You're elenuts!

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.620
What's your favorite food?

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.420
Bananas!

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.130
And your best feature?

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.250
My long nose!

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.000
Which makes you...

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.420
Elephantly an elephant!

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.310
So you are the impostor...

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.310
Elephantly an elephant...

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.190
Weirdo...

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.170
What's all that racket?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.230
Welcome to the Underwater Temple!

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.640
What's with that look? You want 
the magic stone, don't you?

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.130
Go on and fight, then! Go!

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.070

 Temple Battle Royale

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:53.720
Despite how I look, I'm actually the 
high priest! I'm super important!
