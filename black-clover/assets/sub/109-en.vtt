00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.810
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.260
The members of the Golden Dawn

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.180
who had reincarnated as 
elves attacked the castle.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.620
On top of that, the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun's floating hideout arrived

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.600
at the royal capital,
carrying Licht and Raia.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.230
Who the hell invited that giant rock?

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.990
But look. A pretty little 
bird just showed up, too.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.450
Nozel and Noelle regrouped 
with Yami and the others,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.540
then split off in order to protect 
the people of the Clover Kingdom.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.420
But when Noelle and Nozel returned to the 
Silva residence, where they had grown up,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.170
they were faced with the 
enemy's compass magic.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.130
Noelle used the experience she 
had gained in previous battles,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.890
as well as all the hours 
she'd spent training,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.700
along with her desire to save her 
siblings to gain new powers.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.480
Now be destroyed! 
Both you and this mad world!

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.690
Spatial Mage Brothers

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.870
Vermillion Residence

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.290
No matter how many times we blow 
this away, it comes right back.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.040
How dare those humans use 
such impertinent spells?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.620
There are several enemies on the 
third floor and in the inner courtyard.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.450
Which would mean the safest and most 
beautiful escape route would be...

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.750
Right there.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.850
Everyone, please hurry.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.230
Thank you, Mimosa and Kirsch.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.660
You've saved us.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.140
This is the Vermillion residence.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.750
The terrain is completely in our favor, and...

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.050
My beautiful cherry blossom magic is helping

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.910
to confuse the enemy while 
protecting and hiding our allies.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.890
These shriveled little mushrooms 
and their fungus magic weaken

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.920
the enemy's magic and 
their ability to find us.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.690
And finally, my dear sister 
Mimosa is using her plant magic

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.670
to search our residence 
and guide us through it.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.070
If our goal is evacuation, 
our spells are tailormade for it.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.190
We don't even have to worry about bloodshed.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.590
It's so beautiful!

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.520
Please do shut up, Kirsch.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.220
They'll find us.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.810
They're only our enemies because 
their bodies were taken over by elves.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.210
Members of the Golden Dawn,

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.220
I promise you that we'll return you to normal.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.990
Heya. Working hard?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.770
David!

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.250
Member of the Golden Dawn
David Swallow

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.250
Nope! I'm Baval.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.320
I didn't sense his presence at all.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.130
How did he find us? 
Our spells aren't working?

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.460
Oh, come on. Don't look so scary.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.190
I'm sorry to interrupt when 
you were trying so hard,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.840
but all I did was find you and say hi.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.510
If I wanted to kill you, 
you'd all be dead by now,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.730
so there's no point in getting all up in arms.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.420
What's with this elf?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.400
What are you after?

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.130
Nothing, really.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.860
Let's relax and have a little chat.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.040
I think you know this, but we've reincarnated 
with much more powerful magic than you

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.070
and gathered here at the royals' residence.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.170
You can sense it, too, right?

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.390
That there's powerful magic 
other than ours heading here.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.210
Oh, it's pointless to escape outside.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.670
I mean, we're just going 
to kill you all anyway.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.870
So just relax and give up.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.180
I'm pretty amazing, but so are the others.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.600
Man... This really takes me back. 
I can't wait to see everyone.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.600
I won't let that happen!

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.900
We won't give up!

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.190
Well, that's fine and all, but I mean...

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.810
This match seems like it'll be over 
as soon as the enemy's king is taken.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.850
Kira Residence • Central Tower

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.490
There's a really powerful guy 
visiting your king right now.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.100
He's twisted, persistent, and stubborn, 
so your king won't be able to escape.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.330
Oh, and...

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.590
If our guy uses <i>that</i> magic to kill,
 there's no way your king will survive.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.510
My magic isn't enough to offset </i>that<i> magic...

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.380
He's that powerful?

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.930
How dare you?! What do you think 
you're doing in this sacred hall?!

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.500
Wh-What's the matter, Langris?!

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.860
That's the current king? 
How seedy can a guy look?

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.000
Seedy...

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.390
How dare you call me seedy?!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.550
So your son is a traitorous rebel!

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.630
Your Majesty, this is some kind of mistake!

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.120
Y-Yes! My little Langris would 
never do something so fooli—

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.190
Silence!

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.380
Honestly... How could they 
let this scoundrel through?

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.930
Julius and the other Magic Knights 
are all absolutely useless!

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.680
Very well, scoundrel! 
I shall show you my magic!

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.960
Behold my vast magical powers!

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.280
You must be too busy shaking to even escape!

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.140
Light Magic:

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.090
Absolute Monarch of Divine Brilliance!

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.610
How do you like that?! Behold my godlike spell!

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.390
Now grovel before my authority!

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.460
My...

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.420
My spell!

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.680
What a ridiculously slow light spell.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.600
I'm not going to kill you right away.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.470
I'll start with your legs!

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.520
Stop!

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.500
Langris!

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.900
Please don't do this, Langris!

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.440
If you don't stop now,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.370
both you and the people who care 
for you are only going to be sad.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.120
Shut up.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.970
You killed all of us elves, and you have 
the nerve to talk about being sad?

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.380
Langris!

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.340
Are you all right, Miss Finnes?

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.110
Finral...

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.780
Finral!

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.030
Who the hell are you?

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.160
I'm your older brother!

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.790
Stop trying to act cool, Finral!

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.290
I'm not, though!

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.460
What are the others doing?

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.350
We took care of all the other shiny guys.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.970
It would've gone more smoothly if 
Mr. String Bean here had done his job.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.470
What? You were the one slacking off,

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.470
you stupid meathead.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.540
Looks like you made a mistake

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.470
in overestimating your strength 
and splitting up your forces, elf.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.050
You expect me to believe you?

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.610
Care to explain how you 
two were able to beat them?

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.990
Just like this!

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.620
We won't give you a chance...

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.160
...to attack!

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.960
I'm sorry. My magic seems to automatically

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.420
attack anyone who tries to attack me right now.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.090
At least entertain me a little, humans.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.310
Bring it on.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.730
That level of spatial magic is astounding!

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:57.030
There's no spatial mage in this kingdom 
who can cancel a spell like that.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.880
And he has it protecting him 
automatically, at all times?

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.300
No one could ask for a better shield!

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.460
Father, Miss Finnes...

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.010
Leave this to us and run!

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.830
Enough!

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.590
You're just the Black Bulls' transport! 
You don't stand a chance against Langris!

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.110
It doesn't matter if I'm just 
the Black Bulls' transport,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.970
or if he's the Vice Captain 
of the Golden Dawn.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.850
Right now, the only reason I'm fighting...

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.640
is because I'm his older brother!

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.630
Finral...

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.630
Could you not underestimate 
my squad's wheels?

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.390
What? Er...

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.200
Yeah, you're in the way, so...

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.630
Get moving, will ya, old man?

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.740
Langris! My dear little Langris!

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.940
Yeah, you too, old lady.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.860
Langris!

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.150
Finral, please come back alive.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.260
I will. Along with Langris.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.100
Hey!

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.060
Why didn't you let me escape first?!

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.220
Oh.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.740
Honestly, you're all worthless.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:18.280
Hang on, now. I still have 
to tear you to pieces.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.740
Langris...

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.310
Seems like this kid's definitely 
gonna be worth slashing apart.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.790
Severing Magic: Death Scythe...

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.500
Lunatic Slash.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.640
You stupid mantis!

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.640
Whoa! Talk about an insane way 
to help someone escape!

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.770
Just remember, he's the king!

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.590
You gouged my slashes. Nice, very nice!

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.270
He only sees the enemy now!

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.870
You still think you have 
a chance against me?

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.940
Know your place, humans!

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.290
He can actually use attack spells 
while also using his automatic defense?

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.870
Come on, man.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.160
If any of these hit you, 
you'll be dead instantly.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.370
Spatial Magic...

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.910
Spatial Magic...

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.920
Archangel's Crash!

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.040
Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.420
The difference in our 
magic power is too great!

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.720
I can't even block half of these with my magic!

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.640
Avoid the rest any way you can!

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.970
Damn it!

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.560
Who do you think you're 
ordering around, Finral?

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.850
Dark Magic: Black Hole!

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.980
Reinforcement Magic: Leg Strength Boost!

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.450
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked 
Lightless Slash!

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.530
Yami!

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.660
Thanks!

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.060
We'll have to do something 
about that defense

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.700
if we're gonna get anywhere near him.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.150
But if he keeps attacking 
us this relentlessly,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.640
Finral's magic won't be able
to keep canceling him out.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.580
A long battle puts us at a disadvantage. 
If we start a fight, it needs to be quick.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.190
We'll have to force our way through!

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.020
And for that to happen...

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.320
We need more than one attack 
to break through that defense.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.660
I can take care of one side...

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.240
I haven't had a prey like 
this in a long time.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.010
I want to slash him... 
I want to slash him so much!

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.500
Let me slash ya!

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.060
Jack's blades can cut 
through all sorts of spells

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.510
by using his innate instincts to 
transform the very nature of his magic.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.810
And all because he wants to slash things.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.140
Like this?

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.130
And even though spatial 
magic has unique properties,

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.020
he's still able to slash through it.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.940
Wh-What?

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.610
And there he is! The tall, scrawny, 
perverted weirdo genius!

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.070
Severing Magic...

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.740
Dark Magic...

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.540
Dark Cloaked...

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.910
Cut through...

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.830
...space!

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.830
Death Scythe!

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.330
Dimension Slash!

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Yes!

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:39.940
Tch!

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.570
I was surprised that they were 
able to get rid of my defenses,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.320
but it seems they were one move short!

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.990
You can't defend or even 
attack with your spatial magic!

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.370
My magic can't defeat my enemies.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.250
But...

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.670
Return... to nothingness!

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.130
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:08.910
Wha—

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.090
He dropped his defenses so
he could transport the others?!

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:21.570
My Fallen Angel's Wingbeat forcibly 
moves someone from one point to another.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.360
I'll save you along with my friends!

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.450
Too bad, human!

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.360
I'm just a little bit faster!

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.290
You're all just going to die at once!

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.530
These guys are Magic Knights Squad Captains!

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.540
They'll do something about this!

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.300
The more I slash, the faster my blades become!

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.100
It's time for your nap, little boy!

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.430
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked 
Lightless Blunt Strike!

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.190
This time, it should—

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.530
You're just humans...

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.530
How dare you do this to me?!

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.790
You petty... dirty, ugly humans!

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.000
Disappear!

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.260
Now he's really lost his mind.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.130
What's the deal with this 
intensely wicked magic?

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.010
Tch!

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.250
What the hell are we supposed 
to do with this? Damn it!

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.890
No... It's all over.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:52.190
When he's that far gone, there's no
 way he'd notice my puny magic.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.490
Langris...

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:03.250
Thinking back, we've never actually 
fought ever since we were kids.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.420
I always ran away, using my 
lack of talent as an excuse.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.190
Even though I'm your older brother, 
and even though I realized you felt lonely...

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.660
This is... my last chance!

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.310
Your big brother's pretty confident 
when it comes to agility and accuracy.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.270
I'm going to stop you, no matter what!

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.530
Come here...

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.980
Langris!

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.910
Langris... Langris... Langris!

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.830
Langris!

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.920
For the talented little brother, 
you sure are a handful. Honestly...

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.930
I'm pretty weak, so... 
I'm sorry I took so long.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.930
Langris...

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.320
Seriously...

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.410
You've got some nerve, taking all the 
glory when you're nothing but a wimp.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.420
Well done, Finral.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:37.580
Now, what I really want to 
know is... what's their endgame?

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.460
Are they gonna call it a day after 
they slaughter all us humans?

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
I have a feeling they're 
still hiding something.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.870
Finally... Soon, I'll be able 
to see you awake, Licht.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.990
Did you also just get here?

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.010
Brother, that's not Licht.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.700
You're Patry.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.240
I knew you always looked up to Licht,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.470
but you finally decided 
to look like him, too?

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.330
What do you mean, "finally"?

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.460
When I reincarnated, I just 
happened to end up in this body.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.150
This was my fate.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.210
Man, you're creepy.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.390
Hup!

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.720
Hey! It's been a while, Droit.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.230
I just reincarnated, so it doesn't 
feel like it's been that long.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.780
I see. Hey there, little Eclat.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.180
Good evening.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.550
Raia, where's Licht?

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.740
Hey, good to see you, Patry.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.060
Maybe because his body's artificial,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.750
or maybe because he's the one who activated 
the forbidden reincarnation spell...

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.750
His memories aren't completely 
back yet, and he's asleep right now.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.250
I see.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.250
Well, anyway, the gang's all here now.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.100
Everyone else is waiting in the back.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.010
We may all be here now,

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:12.020
but I'm pretty sure the Golden Dawn's
already taken care of all the humans.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.920
There was a huge chunk 
gouged out of the castle.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.070
Looks like Latry went a bit crazy.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.170
I'm sure that seedy-looking king
 is no longer alive, either.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.320
Now all we have to do is fit the final

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.790
magic stone into the pedestal in the castle,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.370
and activate the spell that 
uses the entire kingdom.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.570
That magic stone is 
already within our hands.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.790
We'll wash away the malice 
that afflicts us as a side effect

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.210
of the forbidden spell,

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.800
and complete our reincarnation.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.630
We'll wipe out all of the humans,

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.780
and we'll take back this world, 
making it a peaceful world for elves alone.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.780
I'm gonna bet that there are a 
bunch of tough guys in there.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.620
I wonder what the rest of my dumbasses 
and the other Magic Knights are doing.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.160
I'm gonna flatten all the elves 
myself if they don't get here soon.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.100
Nah, I'm gonna slash 'em all first.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.420
No, it'll be me.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:50.590
Petit Clover

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.150
Petit Clover!

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:54.100
Me

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.500
Me.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.640
I'm gonna flatten all the elves 
myself if they don't get here soon.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.870
Nah, I'm gonna slash 'em all first.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.230
No, it'll be me.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.490
No, me!

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.660
I told you, I'm gonna kick all their asses!

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.400
And I'm telling you that <i>I'm</i> 
gonna kick all their asses!

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.720
No, me!

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.660
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me...

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.130
Me!

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.870
Tch! You piss me off.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.250
Hey, stop copying me.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.180
Wha—

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.710
I said stop copying me!

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.510
Wha—

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.970
What the hell's going on?

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.210
We keep doing the same things!

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.950
After all's said and done,
Yami and Jack are totally in sync.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.300
Shut the hell up!

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.550
My beautiful voice, my beautiful flowers...

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.190
Everything about me, 
Kirsch "Beautiful" Vermillion, is beautiful.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.150
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 110: 
"The Raging Bull Joins the Showdown!!"

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 110
 The Raging Bull Joins the Showdown!!

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.070
I am not a raging bull. 
I'm just ragingly beautiful!
