00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.990
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.200
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.510
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.790
Asta and the other Black Bulls headed 
to the beach town of Raquey

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.340
in order to go to the Underwater Temple 
that lay deep beneath the water there.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.810
Asta and the other Black 
Bulls received an order

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.760
to retrieve the magic stone in the temple

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.210
so they can stop the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.000
who want to separate from the 
Clover Kingdom and create their own country.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.950
But...

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.950
Why are you all playing around?!

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.250
And you're not?

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.830
C-Captain Yami...

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.380
All right, gather round, you idiots.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.130
Apparently the Underwater Temple
really is at the bottom of the ocean.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.260
But the mana kicks up the 
ocean currents so much that,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.600
ordinarily, even a first-class 
mage can't get near it.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.390
But on the night of the full moon,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.110
the mana becomes weaker.
We might be able to get in then.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.520
Like the name suggests, the Underwater 
Temple is on the ocean floor.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.370
We can't just walk to it.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.590
So Noelle...

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.870
Take us there with your water magic.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.830
Give us a ride there.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.330
B-But I'd need incredible magic 
control in order to do that.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.960
I can't!

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.520
You do it.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.170
The next full moon is a week away.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.970
Learn to control it by then.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.930
Surpass your limits.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.710
The Water Girl Grows Up

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.860
Where are you going?

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.890
Oh, I just thought I'd let in some fresh air.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.950
I see. So...

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.320
What's your foot doing there?

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.950
Hey, now, how did that get there?

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.040
This foot is so rude.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.060
You were planning to forget your work 
and go out to play, weren't you?

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.470
What? Now, why would I go out to play?

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.360
I just wanted to go observe some magic—

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.890
You don't have time for that!

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.080
Please do your work for once!

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.740
Hurry up and shut that window!

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.620
Right...

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.980
Honestly... We haven't even resolved the 
incident with the Eye of the Midnight Sun yet.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.180
Don't be so angry, Marx.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.590
You're gonna die young.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.070
And whose fault is that?!

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.170
The Eye of the Midnight Sun, eh?

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.940
I hope Yami and the others are doing well.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.240
I just hope they aren't fooling around.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.790
I wish I could've gone to 
the Underwater Temple.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.460
I feel sick from drinking too much...

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.650
I'll be the sun that'll make you shine.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.150
You bastard! How dare you eat my pudding?!

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.550
It was yummy!

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.900
I wrote my name on it!

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.600
Other people's food always tastes better!

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.100
You bastard!

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.600
Goodnight, my angel.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.570
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.280
Seconds, please!

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.780
Knock it off, you assholes!

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.770
We're not here to play!
I can't concentrate like this!

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.820
I'll kill you all!

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.290
Sorry!

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.960
What a beautiful voice.
I wonder if she's from Raquey.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.790
It's so beautiful and ethereal...

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.120
Are these bubbles magic?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.040
Whoa, is she a water spirit?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.970
Eek! You heard that?

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.180
How embarrassing!

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.050
Eek!

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.610
Oh. She's not like what I'd imagined.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.060
Well, now that you've heard me, 
there's no way around it. Let's be friends!

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.560
La-dee-dah!

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.060
Friends?

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.060
I'm Kahono. What are your names?

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.880
I'm Noelle. The meathead is Stupidsta.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.140
Who are you calling 
"Stupidsta the meathead"?!

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.070
Ah, so Noelle and Stupidsta the meathead.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.610
What a strange name.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.580
Wait, don't believe her! 
How naïve are you?!

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.470
Huh?

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.690
That's totally a nickname, 
and she's making fun of me!

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.310
It's Asta! My name's Asta!

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.580
I see. Nice to meet you, Asta!

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.460
So what were you doing out here, Kahono?

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.810
I was singing.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.170
Well, yeah, I could see that.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.760
I was doing vocal training.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.740
I love singing at this spot.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.090
Training?

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.100
Yup! I have a dream!

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.730
I want to be a singing,
dancing, magic-using...

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.400
idol!

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.950
What's an idol?

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.400
What?!

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.010
You don't know?!

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.190
Nope.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.100
They're all the rage in the Common Realm
and Noble Realm right now!

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.400
Oh...

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.490
Well, you see... So, you see... Well...

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.890
Idols are popular people who 
can sing, dance, and use magic!

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.010
Huh...

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.590
I'm going to become a famous 
idol and get super rich!

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.680
So you're after money?

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.760
What's so great about money, anyway?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.630
If you do have it, it's just in the way.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.080
It's not in the way! Money's important!

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.180
You've never had to worry about not 
having money, so you wouldn't understand.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.430
But money's really important!

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.590
You can't eat tatoes without any money!

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.690
If you don't have any tatoes, 
why don't you just eat steak?

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.440
Damned royalty!

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.280
Yeah! Money's really important.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.530
I totally understand what Stupidsta's saying!

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.600
Seriously, who are you calling "Stupidsta"?!

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.680
Was it Kasta?

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.370
I told you, it's Asta!

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.370
Oh, right. As—Oh?

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.040
What?

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.790
Stupidsta, your body's weakened.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.170
It's Asta, damn it!

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.060
Huh?

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.860
What?

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.170
Your muscles are pretty fatigued.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.320
Are they?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.300
Do you ache when you move?

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.430
Wait, how can you tell?

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.890
That's my power.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.250
Power?

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.100
Don't worry. You'll feel better in a sec.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.110
Song Recovery Magic: Healing Lullaby.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.610
This is...

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:22.120
She pinpointed each individual spot.
What precise magic use.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.510
H-How do you feel?

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.120
Well, I feel...

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.880
This is awesome! I don't 
hurt anywhere anymore!

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.840
My body feels so light!

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.950
My muscles aren't fatigued anymore!

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.720
Thank you, Kahono! You're amazing!

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.240
I've never seen song recovery magic before.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.730
Great!

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.870
Okay, that'll be 100 yuls per session.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.450
You're charging me?!

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.650
Just kidding!

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.020
Good...

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.630
Or not!

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.700
You're really charging me?!

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.070
Money's important, right?

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.450
Here...

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.330
One hundred.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.520
Thank you kindly.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.090
Just let me know when you 
want me to sing for you again.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.930
My hundred yuls...

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.210
That's just spare change.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.650
How is that spare change?!

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.400
I can buy at least ten tatoes with that!

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.840
See? It is change.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.090
Damned royalty!

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.670
You're both really funny.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.090
How old are you?

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.160
Fifteen...

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.100
Same here.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.260
Really? I'm fifteen, too!

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.100
We're the same!

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.680
Really?

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.940
Hey, let's be friends!

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.020
Sure, count me in. You're pretty funny.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.720
A girl my age... who's a friend?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.930
This is my first one.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.930
W-Well, if you insist, 
I guess I don't mind.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.090
I'm willing to be your friend.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.830
Yay!

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.830
Oh, sorry. I'm so happy, I couldn't help myself.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.200
Really?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.130
I see. So you're both Magic Knights.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.330
That's amazing!

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.220
I-It's no big deal.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.620
It's to be expected for me. I'm royalty.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.480
I'm a peasant, though.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.690
So, what brings you to Raquey?
Taking a vacation?

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.130
We're on an important mission.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.280
We're actually trying to get 
to the Underwater Tem—

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.280
Stupidsta!

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.380
The Underwater Temple?

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.450
Sorry, but this mission's a secret.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.320
Well, whatever.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.660
So, what were you two up to at this hour?

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.670
Could it be... Eek!

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.420
Wh-What are you talking about? Of course not!

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.380
The moonlight is so romantic, isn't it?

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.830
The sound of the splashing waves 
also heightens the mood and... Eek!

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.090
I told you, that's not it!

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.010
I was training, too! Magic training!

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.480
Magic training?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.790
Y-Yeah. I can't give you the details,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:58.020
but I need to learn how to control my magic 
within the week before the next full moon.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.900
Otherwise, this important mission—

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.210
I see.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.110
So you want to control your magic...

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.010
Hey, Noelle. Show me your magic real quick.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.050
Huh?

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.910
You can do it, Noelle!

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.110
Wow! That's amazing!

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.350
I see. Good work, Noelle.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.580
Now that we're friends,
I have some advice for you.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.380
Huh?

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.930
I think you're trying to hold in

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.860
your mana too much when 
you try to control your magic.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.110
Huh?

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.210
Listen closely.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.590
Can you hear it?

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.650
I listen to the sound of 
the waves to calm myself

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.630
so I can use my magic exactly how I want to.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.630
Exactly how you want to?

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:08.600
It might just be me, but I think that true 
concentration comes from a calm heart.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.630
From a calm heart?

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.890
I get it!

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:17.240
I also feel like my best swings happen when 
I'm not thinking about anything at all!

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.730
Would you shut up?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.980
You don't even use magic, and you're 
never thinking about anything, anyway.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.240
What's the kindest memory you have 
that brings you the most peace?

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.210
My kindest... memory?

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.740
Yeah. Maybe your family?

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.860
My family...

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.510
To think that the last thing the 
one they called the Steel Princess

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.950
gave this world would be
someone as useless as you.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.520
I'll never accept a failure 
like you as family.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.530
Solid...

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.300
Are you seriously Mother's child?

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.780
The House of Silva doesn't 
need someone like you.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.030
Nebra...

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.780
Um, Nozel...

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:18.250
Why did Mother have to die to 
give birth to someone like you?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.520
You killed our mother.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.430
Thanks for the advice, Kahono. 
I'll try practicing a bit more.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.470
Let me know if you get tired.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.250
It'll only be a hundred... No, it'll only 
be a thousand yuls, since you're a royal.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.850
A kind memory...

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.490
Sister, how are you doing?

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.660
You're shining under my sun!

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.730
Are you stupid?

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.880
Not yet!

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.500
Keep it up!

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.700
You're truly a goddess. 
My little sister, Marie...

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.720
What the heck is that?

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.140
Are they having some kind of contest?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.740
Not yet!

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.170
Thanks, Kahono.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.990
You can just pay me later.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.200
Of course.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.060
Not yet...

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.500
I can't drink any more...

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.020
Not yet!

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.010
Noelle!

00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:01.520
Everyone left me... 
Won't someone come get me?

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.490
The full moon is tomorrow... 
Tonight's my last chance.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.910
Don't worry! You've almost got it, Noelle!

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.330
There's no time... I still 
can't control it at all.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.670
At this rate, the mission will be...

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.170
I just got a great idea!

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.550
Asta?!

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:33.300
Noelle! Stop thinking,
and set all of your magic free!

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.360
Huh?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.890
I just remembered!

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.440
That thing from the first time you lost control 
would probably go underwater the best.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.520
Remember what Kahono said earlier? 
That you were holding your magic back?

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.920
If that's the case, maybe it'll work 
if you just let everything loose.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.550
A-Are you crazy?

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.530
If it doesn't work—

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.700
I told you! If that happens, 
I'll use my sword to save you!

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.450
So don't worry and just go!

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.960
Fine! Don't blame me if something happens!

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.710
I'm releasing...

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.210
all my magic!

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.720
Amazing!

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.730
I knew it! This isn't going to work at all!

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.330
How am I supposed to relax in this situation?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.690
Noelle!

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:41.700
Noelle!

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.720
I guess I really can't do it.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.800
I mean...

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.640
I don't have any... kind memories at all...

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.900
Noelle!

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.890
You can do it!

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.680
You're always talking big, 
so what the hell is that?

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.560
And you call yourself a Black Bull?!

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.260
All that awesome magic is going to waste.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.590
Hurry and learn how to control it
so you can fight me!

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.470
It'll be fine! Even if you mess up,
you won't die or anything!

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.820
Just take it easy!

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.970
You must be hungry!

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.570
Hurry up and finish so you can eat this!

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.200
Even if you fall, I'll catch you gently!

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.330
If you fall, I'm kicking you back 
up there, so make this work.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.330
Grey Disguised as Magna

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.330
Just get it done, damn it!

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.450
Noelle! You can do this!

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.130
I had some...

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.030
Some kind memories within me.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.360
So you're Nozel's little sister.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.850
Your big bro mentioned that you're some 
loser who can't even control her magic.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.130
And that you wouldn't be able to pass 
the Entrance Exam even if you tried.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.120
I've never seen a royal fail before.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:07.870
If you'll excuse me...

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.130
Well, if you feel like fighting, 
why don't you come join my team?

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.220
Huh?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.430
The absolute worst Magic 
Knights squad, the Black Bulls.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.630
We're all nothing but losers.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.050
Meaning we're perfect for you.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:29.110
I was with my family for years, but I didn't 
have a single pleasant memory of them.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.400
It's only been a few months since 
I joined the Black Bulls, but...

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.400
I have so many memories!

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.280
So many kind memories.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.120
And...

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.340
They all acknowledged me 
and gave me a mission.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.590
I want to help them!

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.300
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.060
I... I did it!

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.060
All right!

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.070
The Sea Dragon's Cradle...

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.040
I did it! I really did it!

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.770
Don't get distracted!

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.660
I'll protect the food!

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.330
This feels great after 
being in the sun all day!

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.510
Hey, it's my turn!

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.550
I'll be right there!

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.550
Hup!

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.800
Asta! That was my job!

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.540
S-Stupidsta...

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.410
You did it, Noelle!

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.060
Huh?

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.690
Could you not touch me so casually?!

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.310
What?!

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.320
Who the hell are you?

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.040
Thank goodness everything ended well.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.570
Now, let's drink up.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.890
Kahono! I did it—

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.250
Huh? Kahono?

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.880
All right! Time to celebrate!

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.330
Yeah! Let's celebrate!

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.570
Here we go!

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.910
You did it, Noelle.
You surpassed your limits.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.740
Well, guess we should get going

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.570
to the Underwater Temple.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.300
You've got some great friends!

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.990
They're the ones who should be 
cheering for you in the end!

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.770
Good for you!

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.340
Well, I'll be waiting for you, Noelle!

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.730
Inside the temple! Okay?

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:17.370
Petit Clover

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.410
Petit Clover!

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.870
Song Recovery Magic!

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.670
Song Recovery Magic!

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.680
Song recovery magic?! That's amazing!

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.590
Sing for me!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.600
Sure! It'll just be ten billion yuls!

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.400
Here you go!

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.510
Okay, I'll sing!

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.970
L-o-v-e! Kahono!

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:38.330
Kahono Idol Show

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.290
What in the world are you doing?

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.310
Yay! I made some new friends!

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.800
I'm sure you'll be invincible once 
you can control your magic, Noelle.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.230
Let's meet again soon!
