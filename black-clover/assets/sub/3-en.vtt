WEBVTT

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.630
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.230
But a single mage saved them all.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.530
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.820
Clover Kingdom Royal Capital

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.340
Time has passed, and the title

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.250
of the Wizard King has been 
passed down through generations.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.090
The Wizard King commands the Magic Knights,
and they protect the kingdom together.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.380
The Magic Knights are comprised
of nine squads of mages

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.940
that specialize in combat, all under 
the command of the Wizard King.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.730
This band of heroes protects 
the kingdom with their lives.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.290
To become the Wizard King or a Magic Knight 
is the aspiration of all in the Clover Kingdom.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.430
To the Royal Capital of the Clover Kingdom!

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.730
Grey words can't make anything happen

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.480
I know, yeah I know

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.650
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.740
I dreamed it all my life

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.490
Step by step I go, though 
it's a doubtful world 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.540
Don't care how much I fall

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.010
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.380
To faraway future, I burst out running

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.550
Go beyond even the unseen fears

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.920
The vision I had, so I can be myself

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.180
Someday I will write the next page

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.700
You are my hope

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.440
Like that page from someday

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.780
I was able to meet you

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.740
I call this a miracle

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.980
Nine hundred and ninety-five...

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.630
Nine hundred and ninety-six...

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.050
Nine hundred and ninety-seven...

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.150
Nine hundred and ninety-eight...

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.050
Nine hundred and ninety-nine...

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.440
One thousand!

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.180
Now to down some moguro leaf juice!

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.740
Gross!

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.700
One more gulp!

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.200
Gross!

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.700
You want some, too?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.330
What the heck?

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.820
I got my grimoire.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.220
I'm gonna keep climbing up,
even if I don't have any magical powers!

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.270
All right! I'm not done yet!

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.220
Not even close!

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.540
One thousand and one!

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.230
I'm sure Yuno's been training, too! I can't lose!

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.740
One thousand and two!

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.210
Asta was training for the 
Magic Knights Entrance Exam,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.730
which was to be held in the royal capital 
of the Clover Kingdom in six months.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.500
So was Yuno.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.550
I should wrap up for today.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.550
No, just a little bit more.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.510
I'm sure he's also...

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.770
One thousand and one!

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.150
One thousand and two!

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.200
Each one's goal was to one day 
become the Wizard King.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.430
One thousand, five hundred and... three!

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.460
Well, I can understand Yuno...

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.460
But are you really considering allowing 
Asta to take the exam, too?

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.510
Well, he's saying he wants to do it.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.640
And the ones I was counting on...

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.640
W-We can't do it...

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.090
We can't become Magic Knights!

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.730
If someone who was kicked out of 
the Magic Knights was that strong...

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.510
There's no way!

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.430
We're sorry!

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.870
...decided against taking the exam.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.070
Again, I believe Yuno will be fine, 
but I don't think Asta's up for it.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.140
Well, he's saying he wants to do it.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.380
<i>Again</i>, I believe Yuno will be fine,
but it'll be pointless for Asta to take them.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.630
Well, he's saying he wants to do it.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.710
Actually, the idea of Asta going to the royal
capital just makes you feel lonely, doesn't it?

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.600
Aw, Father!

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.650
Th-That's not...

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.900
I just believe that if he's 
going to fail anyway,

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.160
he's better off not taking 
it in the first place.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.380
A-And you know... The little 
ones will miss him, too.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.620
Not me! But they'll have one 
less person to play with!

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.290
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.910
Not you, too, Tower Master!

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.500
Well, I'll feel a little lonely with 
both Yuno and Asta gone, Father.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.790
Well, of course, I raised them, and I've lived 
with them ever since they were babies.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.260
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't 
a bit sad to see them go.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.290
If possible, I'd like for them 
to stay at the church.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.270
But I also want to let them 
do what they want to do.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.140
Indeed.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.030
Besides, you know... Yuno will be fine,

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.770
and Asta might fail the exam 
and come right back anyway.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.410
Y-You're right. Right!

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.280
Yuno will be fine, but the 
other one will come right back.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.220
Um... The book that Asta obtained...

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.550
Is it truly a grimoire?

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.920
Asta can't use magic. How was 
he able to obtain a grimoire?

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.230
I'm not sure.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.270
But that's...

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.340
Yes?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.730
No...

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.050
Look! Look!

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.060
My very own grimoire!

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.770
I don't even know how,
 but I was able to get one!

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.400
The five-leaf clover... It couldn't be.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.150
Training's not over until 
I'm back at the church!

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.160
Eat my dust!

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.610
Goal!

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.540
Yuno! Asta!

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.760
Welcome back.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.130
Wh-Who got here faster?

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.650
Hmm... Yuno was just a tiny bit faster.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.020
Seriously?! Were you even looking?!

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.400
Then I'll race you into the church!

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.650
I win.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.650
Yuno can be pretty childish sometimes.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.960
Yeah, I mean, getting so worked 
up over Asta, of all people?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.910
Not to mention, Yuno...

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.170
How many years will this last us?

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.330
I'm gonna become the Wizard King.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.530
Yuno?

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.630
Did you come to watch me train?

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.190
Nash?

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.300
What's up?

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.090
Nothing. I was just bored.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.510
I just came by to make fun of the 
idiot doing something idiotic.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.140
Whaddya mean, idiotic?!

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.220
Well, it is!

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.210
You can't even use magic, and you're going 
to take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam?

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.440
Of course you're going to fail!

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.820
That's not decided yet!

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.030
Just look!

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.660
I even got a grimoire!

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.120
I'm gonna get into the Magic Knights!

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.730
And then, one day, I'll become the Wizard Ki—

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.980
That's never gonna happen!

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:37.460
Orphans like us, who are poor... 
aren't allowed to dream like that.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.570
Nash...

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.530
You can't give up right from the get-go!

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.850
Possibilities exist in everyone!

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.790
Shut up! They do not!

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.690
No, they do! I'm going to 
keep chasing my dream!

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.610
It doesn't matter if you're 
poor or an orphan.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.010
Anyone in this world can become amazing.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.850
They can do anything.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.580
They can make their dreams come true.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.110
They can make everyone happy!

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.000
And I'll prove that to you!

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.720
Prove?

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.620
I'm going to join the Magic Knights

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.630
and become the Wizard King!

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:44.020
Tomorrow's the day Asta and Yuno 
set out for the royal capital.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.990
We have to send them off with a bang!

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:51.330
Father went to all the surrounding 
villages asking for tatoes.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.660
Father!

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.670
What's that look for?
This isn't just for you!

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.540
Actually, it's mostly for Yuno.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.840
Father!

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:05.090
Well, you know... Yuno might make it 
into the Magic Knights, but you're...

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.330
Father!

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.570
Asta, there's no need to be embarrassed, 
even if you fail the exam.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.410
Huh?

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.620
No one believes you're going to pass, anyway.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.860
Are you trying to encourage 
me or make fun of me?!

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.610
You can come back at any time.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.030
Your home is this church.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.530
No matter how crappy or poor 
it may be, it's your home.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.650
That's right, Asta.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.510
I'll be lonely without Asta here.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.820
Yuno, too.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.540
We're all family.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.450
Y-You should say that to Yuno, too.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.770
Tell him he can come back
whenever he wants.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.660
Yuno will be fine.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.550
What do you mean?! Besides, I'll be fine, too!

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.430
I'm gonna become the Wizard King!

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.890
And then... I'm gonna come back for Sister!

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.230
So when that happens, marry m—

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.830
All right, let's eat.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.410
We have stewed tatoes,
tato tempura, grilled tatoes,

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.730
fried tatoes, stir-fried 
tatoes, steamed tatoes,

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.790
Hage-style boiled tatoes, tato juice, 
and even special tato pudding!

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.370
Yay! Let's eat!

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.550
So flaky and delicious!

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.620
Yummy!

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.090
Hey, that's mine!

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.960
Don't eat it all yourself, Asta!

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.690
So good!

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.610
Take care.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.140
You better write us, Yuno.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.180
Sure.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.020
Good luck!

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.930
Come back soon!

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.360
He'll be back soon... Asta, that is.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.920
Nash!

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.850
But you know...

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.930
If, just if, and it's a very huge if...

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.510
If you get into the Magic Knights...

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.400
Yeah?

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.360
I'll believe in possibilities. 
I'll believe I can become anything.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.420
And then one day, I'll get into 
the Magic Knights, too.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.930
No, never mind.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.300
I'll be waiting for you.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.460
Well, I'll be off.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.970
Hey, wait, Yuno!

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.820
Answer me, you handsome jerk!

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.220
Just because we're rivals doesn't 
mean we can't get along!

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.730
Hey!

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.730
Well, bye, guys!

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.850
Have a safe trip!

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:26.980
See ya.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:35.150
Yuno and Asta... You've both grown so much.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.580
Asta's always been full of energy.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.630
This is Sister Lily. She'll be 
working here starting today.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.090
All of you, be kind to her.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:49.970
Wow... Sister Lily.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.260
Yes?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
Please marry me!

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.220
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.310
Lily...

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.750
He seems happy.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.070
It might be because of Asta...

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.740
But Yuno's become so strong.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.990
Asta...

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.540
He's so beaten up.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.120
It's all my fault.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.790
He was protecting me.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320
What?

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.250
Yuno, you sound so...

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.190
Asta, stay with us!

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.180
Sister Lily...

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.810
Asta...

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.680
Please marry me.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.180
Thank goodness.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.970
Do your best, you two.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:57.710
It is summer. Asta and Yuno start their 
journey to the royal capital in order to take

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.200
the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.710
The royal capital is a long, 
long way from Hage Village.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.210
The royal capital, huh... I wonder what it's like.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.790
I wonder if we'll get 
to meet the Wizard King!

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.930
First, we need to pass the 
Magic Knights entrance exam.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.340
Then we'll talk.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.720
I'm so excited!

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.980
Excited? Aren't you scared?

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.060
Huh? Why would I be?

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.570
You never change.

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.620
Come on, let's hurry!
The royal capital's super far away!

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.440
Hey.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.990
I've gotta hurry up and 
become the Wizard King!

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.370
Just because you get there quickly

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.240
doesn't mean you'll become the 
Wizard King any quicker.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.740
I'm gonna become the Wizard King, and...

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.850
My, Asta, you look so impressive.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.780
Sister... no, my Lily.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.070
I came for you, just as I promised.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.930
I've become the Wizard King. Now, get on.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.430
Okay!

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.640
Hold on tight!

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.790
It could happen!

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.620
Can you even ride a broom when 
you don't have any magic?

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.540
I-I'll make it work!

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.370
Will you?

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.770
I will! I got my grimoire!

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.490
I can do anything as long as I don't give up!

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.740
Come on, hurry up!

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.930
I'm gonna leave you behind, Yuno!

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.670
Let's train all the way to the royal capital!

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.030
You can't be serious.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.000
Can't keep up, can you, Yuno?

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.010
Not done yet... Not yet!

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.340
Stop. We've got a long way to go.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.740
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.450
Hot! Hot, hot, hot!

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.330
I wish everyone back at the 
church could eat this, too.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.470
Yeah.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.970
This way!

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.980
No, it's this way.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.470
H-Hey, wait!

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.700
Stay out of my way!

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.830
I just gave you a hand.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.570
No one asked you to!

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.330
All right!

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.820
My precious moguro leaf juice!

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.870
What's the matter, Yuno?

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.740
Whoa, it's huge!

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.680
So that's the royal capital.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.810
That's where the Wizard King is.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.550
All right! I'm gonna do this!

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.420
I'll be right there! Just you wait!

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.200
I'm gonna become the Wizard King!

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.530
After a long and perilous journey,

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.950
Asta and Yuno arrive at the royal 
capital of the Clover Kingdom.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.810
The Magic Knights Entrance Exam awaits.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:24.430
They will now have to compete with many 
powerful opponents and pass the exam!

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:35.840
No one can escape from here

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:42.590
Once again in the small closed off classroom

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:50.830
The star of the class was shining yet again

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:57.280
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.710
I've thought many times

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.420
That the revolution was within my hands

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:12.020
Isn't it strange? If you want 
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:18.850
The rest of us who were left 
behind wanted to become something

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:26.110
We repeat the same morning over and over

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:32.990
You're the only one who 
can choose your tomorrow

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.720
Let's go beyond our current selves

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:04.360
Petit Clover

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.420
Petit Clover!

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.860
The Mystery of the Grimoire

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.990
The Mystery of the Grimoire!

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.570
Wait, what? We're small now?

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:17.750
But man... Our grimoires 
are totally different.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.290
He ignored me?

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:25.230
A grimoire's size and thickness are 
determined by its owner's style.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.630
All right! Let's compare grimoires!

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.600
No.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.510
That thing's
filthy

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.710
No fair!

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.270
You scared you're gonna lose?

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.770
Not a chance.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.860
You're getting a big head just because 
you're a little handsome, aren't you?

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.910
Not a chance.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.520
This is it, Yuno! The Magic Knights 
we admire so much are here!

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.110
Our path to making our dream of becoming 
the Wizard King come true starts here!
