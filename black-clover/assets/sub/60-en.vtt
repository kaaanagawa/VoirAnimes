00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.160
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.890
Thanks to the Queen of Witches, 
both of Asta's arms were healed.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880
In return, he fought hard to 
protect the Witches' Forest

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.930
when Fana of the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.650
another owner of a third eye, 
suddenly appeared.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.240
She's got a third eye, too!

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.690
I'll bet everything

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.910
on this one attack!

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.670
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.840
Asta and the others were 
helpless against the attacks

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.570
of Fana's Salamander, the fire spirit, 
as it tried to burn down the forest.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.000
But Noelle used a powerful 
attack with her water magic

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.960
and managed to subdue Salamander.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.520
All right! Now it's finally time 
for my special move!

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.450
In order to finish it off,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.520
Asta used Bull Thrust, a special 
move he had just thought up.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.900
Here we go!

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.450
Bull Thrust!

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.710
Defectors' Atonement

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.090
To think that imperfect little 
brat had this much power...

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.000
It seems he wasn't all talk.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.890
As for the other army...

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.610
Who the heck is that guy?

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.440
He's not a witch, is he?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.250
He had the balls to show up 
alone in front of this huge army?

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.040
Is he stupid?

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.790
Mars! Do you know who I am?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.800
Wait, is that guy... our old teacher?

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.840
Ladros...

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.260
So I get to torment our old 
teacher with my own hands.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.350
Heck yeah!

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.100
Woo! Guess that's our teacher for you.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.360
It looks like neither of you 
are who you used to be.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.400
Then I shall use my own magic...

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.530
to atone for my past!

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.510
Woo! What a nice breeze.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.200
It feels so nice!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.210
For the record, I have to ask...

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.040
Do you have any intention of turning back?

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.050
Oh, come on. That's our line, Teach!

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.810
So, like... Apparently our 
king is really sick, y'know?

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.180
And from what we've heard, the queen 
here has lived, like, hundreds of years.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.520
So the king wants to know how she does it,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.310
even if it means killing 
everyone in this forest.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.030
We just happened to hear that 
the Eye of the Midnight Sun was

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.520
also visiting this forest,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.940
so we decided to take 
advantage of the chaos!

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.710
Taking what you want by force... 
That's how the Diamond Kingdom works.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.690
And that's exactly why I left.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.090
Here I come!

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.590
Yahoo! I get to embrace our 
teacher with my own two—

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.860
Tsk.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.310
He's charging at us despite 
how many of us are here?

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.100
Is this guy stupid?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.530
Wind Creation Magic: Emperor of 
Slashing Winds—Winter Wind!

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.530
What?

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.490
He's fast!

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.550
That's... the traitor, Fanzell Kruger!

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.680
He was a military commander 
and an instructor for our army.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.380
And he had the nerve to defect!

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.940
If we kill him, we'll get a huge reward!

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.550
Don't hold back! Kill him!

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.040
As I thought, they're not moving.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.230
It must be hard to attack in a place 
where your allies are concentrated.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.280
Particularly for warriors with 
powerful magic like you two.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.770
But there are limits to how 
much I can do by myself.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.990
I'm counting on you two, my little 
honey and my cute little student.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.140
I wonder if Master actually 
put some clothes on.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.650
Yup. I think I might actually be a genius.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.560
Keep calm! Get into Formation Six!

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.930
Former commander or not,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.650
if we keep formation and continue 
attacking from a distance,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.050
we'll eventually beat him.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.320
He's only one guy!

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.780
What?!

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.570
Of course he's not alone.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.690
"To make a surprise attack, you must 
have three times the enemy's strength."

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.040
That's what my master taught me.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.420
Reinforcements!

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.620
Don't underestimate our strength!

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.880
Team Two!

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.180
They're... trying to drive us into the forest!

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.340
This isn't good!

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.200
The dense fog and trees 
will ruin our formation.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.450
Change over to Formation Thirteen!

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.400
Team Four!

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.150
Team Five!

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.450
How are they able to predict 
our moves so easily?!

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.450
It's because I was in the 
Diamond Kingdom's assassination squad.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.460
You guys are too easy.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:21.750
Previously, I killed people who were 
doing everything they could to survive.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.850
There might not be anything I can 
do to atone for what I've done.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.370
This might just be self-satisfaction, but...

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.590
I'll put an end to your tyranny.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.340
You traitor!

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.890
Sure. You can say whatever you want.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.970
I won't lose heart again.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.110
If I did, the person who saved me 
might get angry with me again.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.190
That girl's amazing!

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.110
She's able to command us witches so well.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.930
I know, right? Our little 
Mariella is amazing.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.620
And as for our next move...

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.890
What are those things?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.880
They fell for it!

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:40.040
I used my magic items and skills to 
modify the golems just a tiny bit.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.050
Amazing! But the modifications 
must've cost a fortune.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.690
Believe it or not, it only cost me 
3,000 yuls in materials for each!

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.270
That much destructive power 
for a mere 3,000 yuls?!

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.740
Okay, everyone! This is it!

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.030
Time to teach those thugs who 
thrashed our houses a lesson!

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.770
Don't you dare underestimate us witches!

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.650
Oh, dear... Looks like they set traps 
down there and tried to lure us in.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.320
It wouldn't be safe to just charge in there.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.700
But on the other hand, 
it looks fun, so here I go! Woo!

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.410
Let me play, too!

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.490
Now, then... where are they?

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.880
I figured this is what you'd do.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.050
Wind Binding Magic: Emperor of 
Slashing Winds—Whirlwind!

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.580
Whoopsies! Looks like I've been caught.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.900
I'll ask you one more time. 
Any chance of you turning back?

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.730
Like hell I'm gonna turn back!

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.450
I wanna kill lots and lots of people!

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.580
What the hell's wrong with you, Teach?

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.270
You're the one who raised murderers like us.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:55.700
And now you think you can live 
your life as a good person?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.220
Sorry, but I promised my final student...

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.260
and your junior apprentice.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.180
I'm going to live!

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.770
I'm done running!

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.460
Good. Make sure to sense 
your opponent's mana.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.730
Calm your emotions.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.550
Good. Now concentrate.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.410
Listen up. Your powers 
exist to protect others.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.010
Don't ever forget that.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.110
Yes, sir!

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.860
Ladros was an expert in 
physical reinforcement spells.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.530
This probably won't be enough to beat him.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.080
That's enough!

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:13.790
Mars...

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.040
He had the best skills of all my students.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.490
At this point, I don't think 
I can beat him at close range.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.050
Let's have you step back a bit.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.060
Wind Creation Magic: Emperor of 
Slashing Winds—Mountain Wind!

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.770
Ladros...

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.360
This is my full magic power!

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.590
Wind Creation Magic:
Emperor of Slashing Winds—

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.370
Gale!

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.160
Ladros was an odd kid who 
didn't have a magic attribute.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.010
Teacher...

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.650
You can become strong even 
without an attribute, right?

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.970
He had a complex about that.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.340
But his magic was stronger 
than anyone else's.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.480
If he's picked up a powerful long-distance
 spell, things are gonna get ugly.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.490
I'll put him out of commission first!

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.950
Forgive me!

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.700
I can't! I can't, I can't!

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.610
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't!

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.080
Your magic...

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.360
Teacher, I just...

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.470
can't eat all of your magic!

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.800
He doesn't have a single scratch on him!

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.440
After you left, I had the 
army surgically modify me,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.530
and I gained a certain magic ability...

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.270
Absorption and emission.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.680
I can absorb all of the magic 
attacks I take into my body

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.270
and fire them back whenever I want.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.670
In other words...

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.160
I can use your magic to kill your friends!

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.570
What the heck is that magic?

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.660
It's not just Ladros. 
Several magic powers are building...

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:21.590
Hey, Teach... Did you happen to bring 
anyone important to you into this forest?

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.460
If you did, you should probably 
go save them right about now.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.800
Sweet! You can race with my magic!

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.470
Here I go!

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.480
Ready... and boom!

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.480
Million Lasers!

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.960
Whoops... I got so psyched up, I ended 
up killing some of the people on our side.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.970
I wonder if Teach is still alive.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.070
Ooh, there he is!

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.020
Zell...

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.150
Domina...

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.860
Oh, dear... It looks like you really did 
have someone important to you here.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.740
But you seem to be taking a nap. 
Probably not the best time for that!

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.990
So you're Teach's special someone.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.830
Man, I'm jealous.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.880
Hey, I've seen you before.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.960
Oh! You're the girlfriend 
who ran off with him!

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.390
How've you been?

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.970
Don't... You should be using your 
powers to do the right thing...

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.650
But I have been this whole time.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:06.020
I didn't go through special training to 
protect people. Not even a tiny bit.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.610
Getting to use your power to the max in 
combat... What could be better than that?

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.450
You see, I want to be acknowledged. 
By this country! By this world!

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.330
That's why I trained hard and climbed to 
the rank of the Eight Shining Generals.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.850
What is this idealistic crap 
that's coming out of your mouth?

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.220
That's exactly why you 
lost a power struggle

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.640
and had to run away with your 
tail between your legs,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.130
you stupid coward!

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.640
My husband... is not a coward!

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.140
Guess I'll just have to kill this chick first!

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.170
Don't!

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.690
My powers... exist to protect others.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.340
Your lessons got through to me.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.640
Mars, what just...

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.890
Mars, buddy... Whatcha doin'?

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.220
There's no reason to kill 
people unnecessarily.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.770
Our target is the Queen of Witches.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.390
How half-assed can you get?

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.650
Those two are traitors that defected 
from the Diamond Kingdom.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.160
Letting them go would mean 
betraying our kingdom.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.160
You're right.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
So... you're gonna betray the kingdom?

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.540
I guess that's what this means.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:57.380
Woohoo!

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.800
I can finally kill you legally!

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.980
Seeing you always drove me nuts!

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.380
All cool and composed, even when we 
were kids! You could do anything!

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.210
I knew you were going to get in my 
way as I was aiming for the top!

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.550
Who knew I'd get to off you here?

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.160
And along with your beloved teacher!

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.700
This is the best! I couldn't ask for more!

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.170
Mariella?

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.400
That's my master you're talking about.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.710
Don't kill him like he's 
just some sort of bonus!

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.440
Could you and your weak 
magic stay out of this?

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.720
You wouldn't even count as a snack.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.690
That's my widdle Mars!

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.740
I'll take your ridiculously huge magic, add in
some flair, and send it right back atcha!

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.950
Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe!

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.950
Mars, why are you protecting us?

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.620
As Ladros said, we're traitors.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.960
And you lost your memory...

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.800
Don't worry. I'm on your side, Master.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.470
I wasn't expecting to see you here, but...

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.860
Woohoo!

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.370
The details can wait.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.390
We need to do something about him first.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.600
Right. But how are we supposed to 
handle such an unnatural power?

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.560
He's almost invincible, but there are 
still a number of ways to defeat him.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:39.190
One is to feed him magic until it overwhelms 
his capacity and he self-destructs.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:43.230
This might be possible with spirit magic 
or even the Queen of Witches's magic.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.450
The other method...

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.120
is anti-magic.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.960
Anti-magic?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.760
How do you know about that?

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.610
There's actually someone who 
can test out that method

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.290
on the other side of the forest right now.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.940
Let's lure Ladros over there!

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.840
Understood.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.720
What are you gossiping about over there?

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.720
No matter what plan you come up with,
it'll be useless against my power!

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.570
What?

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.870
Huh?

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.900
Your power has made you careless!

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.150
I'm not half bad at 
reinforcement magic myself.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.660
Have a nice trip!

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.180
We have you completely surrounded!

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.050
So just give up already!

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.300
Shoo, shoo! Shoo, shoo!

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.630
Resistance is futile!

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.000
We don't want to hurt you!

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.640
You're still young! You shouldn't 
just throw your life away!

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.210
If you do something stupid, your parents 
and friends back home will be sad!

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:01.610
You filthy humans... Don't you
 dare speak of my friends!

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:44.340
Petit Clover

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.490
Petit Clover!

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.840
You Got Through to Me

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.980
You Got Through to Me.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.270
Mars!

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.850
Do you... know how old I am?

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.100
Twenty-eight.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.020
Woo! There's no way Teach is in his twenties!

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.410
I say thirty-eight!

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.860
No one can teach swordsmanship like that

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.920
unless they've been teaching a long time.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.600
He's forty-two!

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.040
I have absolutely no interest in this, 
but he's probably forty-six.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:14.100
He has such a beautiful and intelligent 
wife despite how he looks.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.120
The only way he could've 
pulled that off is with

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.890
flirting techniques acquired
as a middle-aged man.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.630
Hm... Fifty!

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.380
He always looks so tired, too...
I say fifty-four.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.050
You are at least younger 
than me... aren't you?

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.180
I'm only twenty-eight...

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.330
Your lessons got through to me!

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.200
It appears that Salamander 
is still alive and well.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.940
What will you do now, brat?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.900
Let's see what you're made of.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.820

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 61
 The Promised World

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.740
Being ageless is my magic.
