00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.770
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.430
Langris and the other 
members of the Golden Dawn

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.180
who had been reincarnated as 
elves infiltrated the castle.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.020
Yami and Finral rushed to the castle 
and were forced into a rough battle.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.800
It doesn't matter how many of you 
humans try and attack us! You cannot wi—

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.950
Of course the ones who 
are most worth slicing up

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.450
would show up at the castle, huh?

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.870
Jack joined the battle, and they 
were able to turn the tables.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.170
They regrouped with Nozel and the 
others and rushed into the castle.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.840
Kivn had already infiltrated the Silvas' home,
 where she attacked Nebra and Solid.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.770
Damn it!

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.600
Nozel!

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.350
Noelle!

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.680
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.520
Compass Magic: Another Atlas!

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.900
Noelle and Nozel joined the fight,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.850
but they were also attacked 
by Kivn's compass magic.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.430
Nozel!

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.490
Calm down.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.320
You can no longer fight.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.170
Worry about your own—

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.700
Battlefield Dancer

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.260
Mother! Mother!

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.910
At least realize you're being 
attacked and evade, you slowpoke!

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.880
You piece of trash! 
How dare you eat before me?!

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.100
If you're mad, just try to get me back.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.310
I'm sure it's hard to look in the 
mirror with a face like yours.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.480
You should be grateful for my kindness.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.770
What's with that flimsy little grimoire?

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.360
Are you really royalty?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.060
It's just pathetic that you can't 
even control your powers.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.370
It disgusts me that you're my little sister.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.450
I will not have someone as shameful 
as you in the Silver Eagles.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.280
Pathetic, isn't it?

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.640
What, really?

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.270
Noelle is practicing her water magic 
against a dead tree by herself at night.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.650
Not only that, she keeps missing.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.900
A few even come back to hit her,
 so she just gets soaked.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.900
I couldn't even do that as 
a joke. She's so talented.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.760
Maybe she's even some kind of genius.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.680
I hate to think of her as my sister, though.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.730
Noelle, I've decided which Magic Knights
 squad you'll be joining.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.660
You'll be joining the Black Bulls. 
The matter has already been settled.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.670
What?

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.830
The Black Bulls? You mean 
the worst of the worst?

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.300
That's perfect!

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.820
Don't they just do lame missions out 
in the boonies? Like hunting boars?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.470
That's perfect for you, Noelle.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.370
It's okay... It's okay...

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.830
It's okay.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.100
I did all that training.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.910
I can do this... I can do this!

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.130
I can still fight!

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.550
Let's show her the true power

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.050
of the royal House of Silva!

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.350
Right!

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.400
Unfortunately,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.070
your attacks will never reach 
me in this sealed space.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.490
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.060
You're just wasting your magic.
You're only going to exhaust yourself.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.920
And after all I went through to 
try to let you die peacefully.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.550
What... What should I do?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.180
Even using Mana Skin, I can't use 
Sea Dragon's Lair in this magical space.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.680
Even when I direct my magic with 
all my strength, this is all I can do.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.990
All I can manage are simple 
movements at close range.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.780
The only possible strategy is...

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.270
You're trying very hard, but I 
wonder how long you'll last.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.290
Nozel...

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.450
Think. If Asta or the other 
Black Bulls were here,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.420
they would think of something crazy...

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.610
Damn it! If we don't break her spell,
 we can't get out of here!

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.220
There's no way out!

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.220
No way out?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.060
I can't currently use creation 
magic within this space,

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.790
but I can intentionally cast 
that rampaging spell!

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.400
Nozel, please help me out!

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.330
This is...

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.170
What in the world is going on?

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.170
Curse you...

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.420
You flooded this enclosed 
magical space with water.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.020
Another Atlas traps everything inside.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.030
I'm going to drown. I have no 
choice but to undo the spell.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.410
How dare you, human...

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.120
In a mere instant?! 
Such speed and precision...

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.890
That was amazing... I expected 
that from Nozel, but Noelle...

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.150
W-We did it, Nozel.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:14.150
Th-Thank you very much for going 
along with my reckless plan.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.660
It was quite a crazy method of fighting,
 unbefitting of royalty.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.650
But we were able to win because of it.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.170
So this is the method of fighting 
that you've learned...

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:35.920
Because you look just like our mother,
 I feared I'd lose her again.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.190
Huh?

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.650
I didn't think you would become strong.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.930
I couldn't lose you. I had to protect you.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.940
That's why I tried to keep 
you off the battlefield.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.730
But you became strong.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.890
And that means I was mistaken.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.200
So, er...

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.710
I-I apologize, Noelle.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.020
Nozel...

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.210
...apologized?

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.220
N-Nozel...

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.390
The fight is not yet over.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.720
We must treat Nebra at once.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.980
No...

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.730
Nozel...

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.620
Nozel! Nozel!

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.160
Too bad for you.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.670
This mad world will not end.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:58.070
It's now even bigger and more powerful.
It cannot be stopped.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.640
Damn it! What are we supposed to do?!

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.630
There's nothing you can do.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.020
Give up, grieve, and regret 
your actions, royals.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.820
I won't give up.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.100
There has to be... 
There has to be some way!

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.570
Think, Noelle!

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.030
You can do this!

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.530
After all, you were finally able 
to get Nozel to acknowledge you!

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.280
At this rate, Nozel and Nebra will...

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.710
I can wait until you slowly weaken,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.150
but I think you'd prefer to die quickly,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.670
you foolish and sinful humans!

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.550
I don't have a single good memory of them...

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.060
But they're still my siblings!

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.810
Long distance attacks won't hit.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.320
I can't do any complicated 
magic manipulation.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.520
But if it's nearer and denser...

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.860
This is a spell that I can cast only

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.280
because of this situation 
and who I am right now!

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.530
The biggest factor in getting spells

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.790
to manifest is natural talent.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.670
But dedicated training and unwavering 
effort can also pay off.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.980
In some rare cases, 
intense wishes or determination

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.510
can grant power in a crisis, as well.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.020
Many royal mages acquire spells 
intuitively using their innate,

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.020
powerful magic and natural resourcefulness.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.680
And because of this ability, 
they rarely ever research, train,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.570
or have their lives put in 
danger on the battlefield.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.650
But while Noelle had an enormous 
amount of magic as well as talent,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.280
as a member of the Black Bulls, 
she trained, worked hard,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.580
and fought for her life.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.830
Everything she had gone through,

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.170
and her strong desire to protect her siblings,

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.670
gave her the power to get through this crisis!

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.020
Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Armor!

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.620
Noelle!

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.720
What is this magic?

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.890
A tremendous amount of magic 
is being concentrated.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.680
Royal girl...

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.290
It's like she's swimming 
through this space.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.700
Is she riding mana from the magical attacks, 
and the disturbance in this magical space,

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.490
as if they were some sort of high waves?

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.760
Is her armor a spell that lets her 
control all the mana around her?

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.470
But... will you be able to evade all of these?

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.220
I still have the absolute advantage.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.590
If I find even the slightest 
tear in your defense,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.760
this world will rip off your armor!

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.930
It's hard to believe I was 
struggling just a moment ago.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.970
I feel like I've been freed from my cage.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.110
I never knew magic was so freeing.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.610
I wonder if this is how Mother felt, too.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.880
Mother... The Dancing 
Princess of the Battlefield...

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.520
You managed to cut through 
all of that attack?

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.980
You're mine!

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.770
Willful Compass!

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.570
The mana currents you dance 
through so elegantly...

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.450
I'm going to change their destination, 
as well as your own...

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.230
To hell!

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.930
Fall, royal!

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.430
She overruled my mana compulsion?!

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.370
Sorry, but I'm not dancing elegantly.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.690
This armor... Everything that
 touches this mana...

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.940
is under my control!

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.210
I'm desperately struggling and fighting,
forcing my way forward!

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.450
Now be destroyed! 
Both you and this mad world!

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.550
Did I win?

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.480
Hurry, take Nozel and Nebra...

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.910
This isn't good. I don't have 
enough magic to fight this many.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.750
How dare you do that to Kivn?

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.250
It appears that we have 
underestimated you humans.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.920
That will not happen again.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.840
Begone!

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.340
Solid!

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.230
Now that's what I call a 
perfect surprise attack.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.170
Not bad. It's even more 
insane when it's doubled.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.760
What was that spell?

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.850
I've never seen anything like it.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.500
Don't let your guard down! Curse you, human!

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.050
Considering the huge amounts of magic 
you were throwing at each other,

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.840
I figured a crowd would show up eventually.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.960
Zora!

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.470
Go on, get to work, 
you royal attendant jerk.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.970
House of Silva Attendant
Paplo Espuma

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.970
What are you thinking, bringing me
 somewhere so dangerous?!

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.430
I saved your ass, so now 
you're gonna listen to me.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.610
No...

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.250
More importantly, if you don't hurry up,
 you won't have any masters anymore.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.490
Huh? Lady Nebra and Lord Nozel!

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.060
O-Oh, no!

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.740
Bubble Recovery Magic: Bubble Refresher!

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.490
Lord Solid, please bring me Lord Nozel!

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.000
Lord Solid?!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.730
What? You lost your will to fight?

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.430
Give me a break, you royal Magic Knight.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.260
The other two got their asses kicked, too.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.260
All you do is flaunt your arrogance, 
and this is all you've got? Pathetic.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.970
You can't even protect your own family, 
you royal Magic Knights Squad captain?

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:51.770
Nozel...

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.650
You're finally receiving 
your grimoire next year.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.950
I can't wait to see what kind 
of magic you're going to learn.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.670
I'll learn spells of unparalleled power

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.580
and become a powerful Magic Knights 
Squad captain, just like you, Mother.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.320
Well... Nebra and Solid both have 
water magic, just like your father.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.590
It's just a hunch, but I think 
this little one will be the same.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.460
You're the only one who 
inherited my steel attribute.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.850
Make sure you protect your 
siblings with that magic, okay?

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.100
That's right... I...

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.650
You guys are supposed to be stronger 
than the rest of us commoners, aren't you?

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.610
Let's see just how brave you can be!

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.610
Hey, that's enough out of y—

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.710
It's all right.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.370
Nozel?

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.220
He's exactly right.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.620
Groveling at something like this

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.780
brings shame upon the royal House of Silva,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.630
as well as the title of 
Captain of the Silver Eagles.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.880
I'll reinforce my physical 
functions with magic.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.040
Nozel... I never knew mercury 
magic could do that.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.890
It's such sophisticated magic!

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.090
Let us go, Noelle.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.890
Yes, sir!

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.230
All of you bastards have so 
much magic, it makes me sick.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.900
I'm gonna need you to dial it 
down to commoner level.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.900
Ash Magic: Revelation of the Cowardly.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:23.660
Here they come!

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.740
Take my magic with you, Noelle!

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.090
You won't escape!

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.090
You're too slow!

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.400
Hold still, damn it!

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.930
You won't get away!

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.260
Trap magic?

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.620
I've rigged plenty for ya.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.400
The Revelation of the Cowardly reveals 
where I've placed my trap spells.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.500
If they show even a moment of vulnerability,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.330
I'm sure those royals can take care of them!

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.070
You can't move so easily with your 
body in that condition, can you?!

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.750
Nozel!

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.460
He's ignoring the force of those spells?

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.050
What was that spell?

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.970
Considering your reactions,

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.770
I guess you guys don't know about 
complicated magic like counter-traps.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.770
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.480
Your control is faltering!

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.400
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver!

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.120
This is nothing!

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.350
These spells were derived and 
developed over countless years.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.670
Complicated human spells...

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.210
Looks like you elves don't know about them.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.060
Langris! No matter what you think of me,
 I'll always be your older brother,

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.460
and you're my younger brother!

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.940
Come back, Langris!

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.320

 Spatial Mage Brothers

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.410
I can actually do it if I try!
