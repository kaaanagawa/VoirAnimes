WEBVTT

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.860
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.820
We Won't Lose to You

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.730
What? Captain Vangeance from the Golden Dawn?

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.310
Yeah. He's also the leader of the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.480
What the heck does that mean?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.820
"William is asleep inside 
me," is what he said.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.660
So his body was taken over?

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.830
Don't ask me!

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.290
On top of that, he's not the 
only one who went all weird.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.490
It affected other Magic Knights, too.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.670
Marx, Old Man Owen,
and the Spiny Prickly Queen.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.710
Even Captain Charlotte?!

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.050
A lot of crap happened while you 
were enjoying your beauty sleep.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.220
You do realize I was dying, right?!

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.810
Yeah, I guess.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.530
There's nothing to guess!

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.720
Man, I was so worried.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.140
At least sound like you mean it!

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.350
No, really. I was.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.460
I couldn't even sleep at night.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.320
I'm glad you weren't taken over.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.160
Wait... Does that mean Langris's 
body was also taken over?

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.660
Probably.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.930
That ominous mana... Is that 
why he tried to kill me?

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.830
Hey, Finral.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.050
Let's go.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.890
Right!

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.930
Langris, this time...

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.930
I'll stop you for sure.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.230
Flame Magic: Explosive Scattershot!

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.970
Not bad, you virgin delinquent.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.210
What the hell are you doing here?

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.070
I was heading back from visiting Finral.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.740
I thought you might be all 
alone and crying somewhere,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.470
so I came to see you.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.760
Who the hell is crying?! And get 
the hell off my Crazy Cyclone!

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.270
Damn it... Just don't get 
in the way of my training.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.290
Right about now, Asta, 
Noelle, and Luck are fighting

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.380
the guys from the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.910
Probably.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.060
I want to make sure I don't embarrass
 them as their senior knight.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.330
So...

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.630
I'm going to get even stronger!

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.060
I promise I'll make it back alive!

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.430
So head on back first!

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.820
Hey, Yuno! Yuno!

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.240
It's no use. None of us know you.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.740
Yuno!

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.580
I just told you it was futile.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.380
I think it's time we made you quiet down.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.550
Klaus, please don't...

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.260
Asta!

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.910
Stop this, Klaus! We're both Magic Knights!

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.580
This body is... reacting?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.540
Hmph! Our hatred for you

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.290
is far stronger than your 
pathetic little bond!

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.020
Come on, now. If you push yourself 
too hard, you're gonna die.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.110
What a pain...

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.490
Of course, we won't need you anymore 
once we get your grimoire and swords.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.960
It doesn't look like you're going to give up.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.460
In that case...

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.370
If you want to protect your precious 
little royal friend and die,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.300
go right ahead.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.010
No...

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.100
Not yet...

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.600
Huh?

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.790
I'm not going to die yet!

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.360
I promised my friends I'd come back alive!

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.610
I won't let my friends kill my other friends!

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.120
I'll survive this. I'll survive all of this...

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.870
And then...

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.370
I'll become the Wizard King!

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.330
But you're the one who gave me hope.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.130
Even if you're poor, an orphan...

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.850
or even us...

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.620
We can become greater than anyone 
else in this world. And to prove that...

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.460
To make Sister and everyone else happy...

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.730
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.290
What in the world are you babbling about 
now, when you can hardly even move?

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.910
This is where...

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.660
...you're going to...

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.170
...die!

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.260
What are you talking about, Asta?

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.770
I'm the one who's going 
to become the Wizard King!

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.530
Yuno?

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.490
Y-Yuno?! Y-You... Hey!

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.870
Wait, are you... Are you actually Yuno?!

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.920
Yeah. Why?

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.670
What?! But your ears are hella pointy!

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.950
Yeah, apparently they are. So?

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.430
But, I mean... you're normal?!

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.580
You're right!

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.260
Look, Yuno! Our ears match!

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.750
Bell, could you quiet down a bit?

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.930
Now's not the time for that, Miss Spirit Lady!

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.730
Wha...

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.830
What the heck?!

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:13.160
Stop staring at the little shrimp 
and look at how much I've grown!

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.930
Who the heck are you calling a shrimp?!
You're <i>way</i> smaller than me!

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.640
What did you say?!

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.990
You're both way too loud.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.510
What in the world is going on?

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.660
Would one of you kindly 
get me down from here?

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.330
I'm me. You got a problem with that?

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.920
Nope! Not at all!

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.760
Why the heck are you two having a moment?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.500
More importantly, look at m—

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.500
So you've awakened.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.640
You're one of us. Now, come here.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.440
Hey...

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.110
Could you not butt in?

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.000
This mana... The reincarnation 
definitely worked.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.190
But it looks like he's still...

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:06.010
Licht's grimoire and swords are right 
in front of him, and he hasn't responded.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.340
I guess it could be because he used the

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.240
ultimate forbidden spell to 
bring back his elf friends.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.340
Looks like they might need more time.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.060
Both Licht... and you.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.230
I can tell.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.760
What's moving their bodies right now 
are souls that belong to others.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.940
Klaus and Hamon's souls have been put to sleep.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.950
Really?! Then we can save them?

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.570
Th-Thank you very much, Asta.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.490
And also inside me...

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.990
Yuno?

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.060
But...

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.510
I am a Magic Knight of 
the Clover Kingdom, Yuno.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.000
No one else.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.020
Clearly, that vessel is a human 
with a very strong will.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.940
It appears he hasn't fully awakened yet.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.010
Humans are such a nuisance...

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:09.020
We're going to kill those two behind you,
 and then have you leave that body!

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.980
Oh?

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.520
Those bodies belong to my senior knights.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.740
You're going to have to leave.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.460
Looks like we have no choice.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.330
We'll have to give it everything we've got.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.650
The ground's shaking just from 
you guys glaring at each other!

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.800
Oh, crap!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.410
I don't know how we're going 
to get them out of there.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.390
We may have to incapacitate and bind them.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.950
I'll stop them.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.430
You take Mimosa and get back.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.360
Asta?

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.060
Like hell I'm gonna let you do this alone!

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.870
Yuno, you jerk!

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.620
Yuno's not alone! He has me!

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.250
Mimosa, this might be rough, 
but step back a bit.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.380
O-Okay.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.280
With the grimoires and 
knowledge from this age,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.150
we will be able to use even more 
refined spells than existed in our age.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.950
It appears so.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.490
Combination Spell: Le Chateau de Verre!

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.100
It's over.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.230
Well, that thing sure looks crazy.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.280
You got this, Yuno?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.530
That's some intense magic.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.030
I won't have time to cover you, Asta.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.370
Bring it on!

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.030
Go, Le Chateau du Verre!

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.550
We won't lose...

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.550
...to you!

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.340
You two are amazing!

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.300
The anti-magic kid is one thing,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.810
but that other guy who hasn't 
fully awakened even though

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.890
his magic grew exponentially after 
being reincarnated is a pain, too.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.420
Licht?

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.950
He's not even using magic, and he's 
able to make himself and others float?

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.960
You can't be serious.
His mana is so incredibly dense.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.360
The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.190
And that sword...

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.660
Nero?!

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.850
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.040
What?! What?! What?! What?! What?!

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.860
Hey, wait! Stop that, ow, ow, ow!

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.370
This ki...

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.870
There's incredible magic 
coming from that sword.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.280
Oh, crap... My black form
 is reaching its limit.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.380
Please... Just last a little longer.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.970
Asta, be careful.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.410
Yeah, I know!

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.290
This goes way beyond fast...

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.020
It's like he melted into the air. 
I can't even read his ki!

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.380
It's as though he became one with 
the mana of nature itself.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.010
I can't sense his mana!

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.740
Asta!

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:25.080
Wind Spirit Binding Magic: Liable Tempest!

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.300
Don't miss!

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.800
That doesn't sound like you, Yuno!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.930
How was that?

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.680
Asta, behind you!

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.210
Damn... it?!

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.960
What are we going to do about 
that guy's teleporting, Asta?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.000
I'm gonna surpass my limits right now!

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.210
You can't be serious!

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.860
Wind Spirit Magic...

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.110
Spirit Storm!

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.940
He sucked up my magic?

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:10.400
This is just one of the 
Demon-Dweller Sword's true powers.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.190
H-He's so strong...

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.100
And what the heck's going on with my sword?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.930
What the heck is going on in general?

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:45.540
Damn it... Don't stop moving 
at a time like this, body!

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.760
That brat's probably reached 
his limits... though, so have I.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.310
I'll give him credit for 
getting this far, though.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.780
Asta... Yuno...

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.530
Even if I wanted to try 
healing them, my magic is...

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.120
I can't find an opening with him.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.350
In that case, I'll...

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.810
Not yet...

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.570
Not yet...

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.180
Not yet...

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.320
He's starting to keep up with 
how fast those attacks are.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.070
Not bad.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.450
Not yet!

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.830
How about this?

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.830
Mana Zone...

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.890
Wait, that's that one lady's...

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.130
Licht!

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.720
Spirit Storm!

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.260
It's amazing enough that he 
managed to find an opening

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.380
with Licht, even though he hasn't 
completely awakened yet.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.230
I'd expect nothing less from Licht's...

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:26.690
Wha—

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.740
I thought he couldn't move anymore!

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.500
This is when Asta will surpass his limits!

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.750
Not yet!

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.760
Their timing is perfect!

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.510
What the hell is with those two?!

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.770
Yuno is my...

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.770
Asta is my...

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.290
...rival!

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.280
He blocked our attack with that sword?

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.730
He's condensing a phenomenal 
amount of magic...

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.050
Yuno's wind?

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.600
The leader of the Eye of the 
Midnight Sun, Licht, is so strong!

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.260
But I promised Zora I would come back alive!

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.110
Not to mention, I've got Yuno, too!

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:52.320
