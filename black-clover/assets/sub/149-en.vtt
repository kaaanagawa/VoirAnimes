00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.910
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.700
In this kingdom where magic is everything,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.010
there is one boy who can't use magic.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.050
His name is Asta.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.640
He puts in blood, sweat, and tears 
in hopes of becoming the Wizard King.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.640
But there are also those in the kingdom 
who possess at least a little bit of mana,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.750
yet can barely use any magic at all.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.400
The very few out of the population, 
those who live in the shadows...

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.800
They are also trying to survive.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.220
My prince, I've brought your tea.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.110
It's completely cold by now.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.210
Secré? How long have you been there?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.640
How long do you think?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.760
Sorry, I didn't see you.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.650
It doesn't bother me.
This happens all the time.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.180
Take a look at this.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.090
"First, a magic item that 
stores and splits mana."

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.900
So what's this one do?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.360
It's a magic item that increases mana!

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.610
Like the elves' magic stones, basically.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.680
Ah...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.250
There aren't many of them,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.680
but this kingdom does have people 
who weren't blessed with mana.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.130
But once this is complete, we should 
be able to resolve their concerns.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.190
Huh?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.780
Yes, and this should end the 
discrimination that currently exists.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.140
But there are a few problems 
I need to take care of first.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.210
Ah, it makes my head hurt...

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.400
My prince thought about the future 
of this kingdom more than anyone else.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.790
But...

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.850
The burn scar that he gave 
me should fade over time.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.520
But the scars on my heart from 
enduring their ridicule for so long

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.150
will never go away.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.940
Above all, even after they died, 
the vengeful flames that burn in my heart

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.520
can never be extinguished.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.910
I...

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.060
will make it to the Spade 
Kingdom, no matter what.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.090
So that we can obtain the powers of the devil.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.160
The reason she wanted the devil's powers

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.250
and caused this whole incident

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.110
was because she was born with very 
little mana and suffered discrimination.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.780
Maybe this kingdom hasn't changed 
that much in the past 500 years.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.220
Two Things We Need to Find

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.340
I'm sure you can guess why 
I summoned you all here today.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.900
I wanted to ask you some questions regarding 
the incident with the Devil Believers.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.160
Ask us anything.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.780
Right, kid?

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.860
Sure?!

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.850
All right, then, let's get started. First...

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.160
Could you tell me what 
you talked about that day

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.970
with one of the leaders of the 
Devil Believers, Dazu Tayak?

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.050
The difference in mana... Those blessed 
with abundant mana and those who aren't.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.300
There's no doubt that the gap between 
those two is what caused this incident.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.830
Discrimination is something 
we must get rid of at any cost.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.520
Is there something up with Nero?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.980
Oh, it's nothing.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.280
Pardon me.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.250
Lord Julius, we just received

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.340
a message from Queen Loropechika 
of the Heart Kingdom.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.540
Loropechika

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.870
Huh?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.910
So she's the Queen of the Heart Kingdom.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.050
You three...

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.040
We just happened to be 
summoned by the Wizard King.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.380
I see.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.230
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.970
You must be the Captain of 
the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.260
Hey, nice to meet you.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.730
I guess she really does know about me.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.020
You may have gathered why 
I'm contacting you today.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.530
As I mentioned to you previously,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.270
we were preparing for you to train with 
our elite guard, the Spirit Guardians,

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.240
and those preparations are now complete.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.290
Are you okay, Loropechika?

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.150
What just happened?!

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.580
Did something happen to the queen?

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.840
What, though?!

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.060
Maybe Megicula's curse suddenly advanced?

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.970
No!

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.660
Finral!

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.010
Huh? But...

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.220
We'll take care of all the paperwork.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.510
We're counting on you.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.560
Right!

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.570
Asta, sorry, but do you 
mind if she stays behind?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.600
Huh?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.410
I'm fine with that.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.070
Asta!

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.100
I can't keep this open for 
long over such a distance...

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.070
Hurry!

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.910
Okay, I'm off!

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.330
It'll probably be easier to speak 
with you if you're not in that form.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.090
Could you come with me 
to the basement library?

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.850
There's something I'd like you to see.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.700
Marx, I expect you to fill out 
all the paperwork required

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.550
for them to enter the Heart Kingdom.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.150
Huh? Er, yes, of course.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.620
All right, let's go.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.620
Wait, why are we outside the palace?

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.560
I think... the queen is generating 
a force field made of mana,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.910
so we can't enter the palace.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.210
Spirit Guardian
Gaja

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.360
You lot...

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.310
I don't know what you're doing here,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.730
but this is clearly unlawful 
entry to our kingdom,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.300
unless you can prove otherwise.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.470
W-W-W-Wait!

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.180
Our Wizard King will eventually contact you.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.660
Yes... What?

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.750
Forms have been submitted from

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.000
the Clover Kingdom to allow 
entry into our kingdom?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.320
Very well.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.950
Pardon my rudeness.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.820
Allow me to lead you to the queen.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.870
Welcome, everyone.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.550
She seems to be dressed pretty rough 
compared to last time...

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.050
Even if her clothes are different, 
they can't hide her beauty!

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.090
She is truly a goddess who has 
descended upon this land!

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.320
Finral! You're supposed to change, remember?!

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.120
By the way, what brings you here today?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.690
Oh, right!

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.690
It doesn't <i>look</i> like her curse is acting up...

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.730
Is there something about my curse?

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.020
Oh, for goodness' sake, Loropechika.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.220
So that's the Water Spirit.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.090
You had a stomachache because 
the things you ate for lunch

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.860
didn't agree with each other?

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:17.570
I told her not to eat hard bacon
 and red spinach together.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.800
But that part of her is adorable, too.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.590
If you will excuse me...

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.890
Thanks.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.780
Guess I'll head back, too. 
I've got something to do.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.520
Head back? But how?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.650
How do you think?

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.180
I'm gonna die...

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.570
But thank goodness it wasn't your curse.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.580
As I was trying to tell you earlier,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.690
the preparations for your 
training are complete.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.080
And so...

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.000
Huh?

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.630
What's wrong?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.640
My glasses are missing!

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.520
Your glasses?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.640
Wait, you just noticed?!

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.180
Wow, her eyesight is...

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.810
...shockingly bad?!

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.380
Come on, now, Loropechika.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.550
That was your last pair.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.410
I end up stepping on them, 
kicking them, dropping them,

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.810
H-Huh?

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.540
sitting on them... I basically 
break my glasses all the time.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.250
And they're custom-made.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.870
In that case, I'll help you find them!

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.250
Oh, don't worry. I have an 
idea as to where they are.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.300
Huh?

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:46.840
This is...

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.520
She's gathering information from all around?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.020
This is only one part of it, 
but it should be enough for now.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.650
She's usually watching 
over the whole kingdom.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.150
The whole kingdom...

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.350
Oh, there they are!

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.830
I knew it was Mugi!

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.140
Mugi?

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.330
Wait, then is that creature—

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.020
It's alive?!

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.460
Oh, I forgot to introduce you.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.550
This is the thick-pelted beaver, 
Big Mugi. She's Mugi's mother.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.390
Mugi comes here often with Big Mugi.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.330
Or you might say they just waltz right in.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.630
Why in the world does she look so smug?

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.940
Sh-She's so cute!

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.020
The only problem is they're 
quite the troublemakers,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.950
and they take my things 
without permission sometimes.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.020
All right!

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.130
I'll head on over and get your 
glasses back from this Mugi!

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.120
Huh? But it's okay...

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.320
You're gonna be training us soon!

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.820
This is nothing!

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.330
Oh, fine...

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.260
I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna pass.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.720
But wait... If I make a good 
impression on the queen...

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.980
Wait, no... That's not it, Finral. 
This is just another trial to break my curse!

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.690
Leave getting your glasses back to us!

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.990
Let's go, Asta!

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.440
All right, we're off!

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.240
So that's the thick-pelted beavers' lodge...

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.790
There they are!

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:36.890
Leave it to me!

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.800
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.340
As well as... Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.740
Way to go, Finral!

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.820
Easy-peasy!

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.560
Oh, no! You can't hold them like that!

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.850
Are you okay?!

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.470
What are you doing?!

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.240
You're not getting away!

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.370
Perhaps Mugi is finally 
getting its just deserts.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.880
Really?

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.510
No, I can't!

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.680
That thing is seriously pissing me off.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.220
That's just another reason they're so cute.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.920
Looks like it's my turn.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.510
What the heck is he doing?

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.290
Huh? He's fishing, isn't he?

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.290
Well, that much is obvious!

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.140
You'll be giving those back.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.190
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.130
So that must be

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.190
the ki that's commonly used 
in the Land of the Sun.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.170
So that's how...

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:54.640
That must be how he found you, even though 
I was concealing you and your mana.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.150
Yes.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.500
It doesn't matter if he has anti-magic 
or if he's at the arcane stage.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.900
He's going to become stronger.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.680
Let's trade.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.030
Way to go, Asta!

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.250
Thank you so much.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:29.270
Now I can see all of your 
faces... clearly... a-again?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.440
Oh, Loropechika...

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.040
What?!

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.340
Loropechika, is your hand okay? Are you hurt?

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.190
I-I'm fine...

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.550
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! What have I done?

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.970
Are your eyes actually bad?

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.140
Huh?

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.380
You could see us just fine 
the last time we met.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.340
You see, when Loropechika 
is in her royal gown,

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.070
she's using Mana Zone, so she 
can detect what's around her.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.490
It has nothing to do with 
if she can see or not.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.660
You wouldn't need glasses if you 
just did that regularly, would you?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.300
My mana isn't infinite.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.670
I want to avoid using up too much of it, 
just in case something happens.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.350
Especially considering Loropechika has

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.170
a Mana Zone barrier up all around 
the Heart Kingdom at all times.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.070
I have returned, Your Majesty.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.180
Oh, perfect timing.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.710
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.680
It's fine.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.740
Is that...

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.590
I went to retrieve the new ones.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.550
Then are all those...

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.320
There can never be enough.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.950
Then everything we just went through was...

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.580
I'm very sorry. I tried to stop you, but...

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.400
This is all your fault.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.030
My fault?!

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.670
Oh, yeah. I guess I'm the one 
who said we'd get them back.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.670
But I thank you from the bottom of my 
heart for doing all of that for me.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.180
Please rely on us whenever you're in need!

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.010
Damn it, Finral, no!

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.770
Now, let us get back on the topic at hand.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.810
The reason the preparations for 
your training took so long...

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.110
Um...

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.320
Yes?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.610
We're over here.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.200
Oh, I'm terribly sorry about that.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.620
The reason the preparations for 
your training took so long...

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.980
is so that the Spirit Guardians 
could meet you in top form.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:13.130
But there is also a limit to how 
many the Spirit Guardians can train.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.500
All right! I'm getting fired up!

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.250
No one said you were going to train yet.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.050
What?!

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.810
No, since they're both at the arcane stage,
we need Asta and Nero to participate.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.200
Nero, too?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.550
Wait, the arcane stage? Does that mean 
the Wizard King and Captain Yami, too?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.820
I'm certain those two don't need our training.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.250
And it appears that your captain

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.570
has already figured out how to 
get to an even higher plane.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.200
Yami has?

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.450
When?

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.020
As embarrassing as this is, I've lost the key.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.430
From what I've heard, your magic 
allows you to open and close things?

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.270
Would you mind opening that for me?

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.320
I wonder what he wants to show me.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.350
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.610
That's...

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.920
Your real name is Secré, right?

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.400
"Secré is going to love this!" 
was scribbled onto this page.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.840
My prince!

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.890
There aren't many of them,

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.420
but this kingdom does have people 
who weren't blessed with mana.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.700
But once this is complete, we should 
be able to resolve their concerns.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.530
Yes, and this should end the 
discrimination that currently exists.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.030
But back then, they probably lacked

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.910
the technique to create this magic item,
 so it was never completed.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:23.930
I know.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.460
But I've sent a request to the

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.070
Magic Item Research Lab at the 
Magic Knights' headquarters

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.310
to have it made according to this blueprint.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.160
If this had already been completed...

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.860
People like the Devil Believers' 
leader, Dazu Tayak,

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.560
and those who follow her 
may have never come to exist.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.030
Those blessed by magic 
and those who aren't...

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.760
In order to end the 
discrimination between them,

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.000
this is one of the things most 
necessary to the Clover Kingdom.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.410
Is something wrong?

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.980
N-No...

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.110
We're back!

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.020
Today was so exhausting...

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.650
Welcome back.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.780
Thanks.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.320
What did you and the Wizard King talk about?

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:18.700
Nothing really.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.770
Did something good happen, Nero?

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:21.800
Huh?

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.550
You look happy.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.700
She's right.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.550
You've been looking pretty down lately,
 but today is different.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.230
She has?!

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.250
You all look pretty happy yourselves.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.870
Well, of course we do!

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.750
We're finally going to be training 
with the Spirit Guardians!

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.980
Of course, you're coming with us, Nero.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.990
I see.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.170
Let's do our best!

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.140
All right.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.270
My prince, your will has 
definitely been carried on.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.560
Julius Novachrono...

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.850
He thinks about the future of the 
Clover Kingdom just as much as you did.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.140
My prince, I will become stronger 
so that I can protect this kingdom.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.320
Stronger... I have to get stronger.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.750
Or I can't protect this kingdom!

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.830
I can't fight!

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.170
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 150:
 "The Maidens' Challenge."

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:54.270
Page 150
The Maidens' Challenge

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:52.840
Grey and Captain Charlotte of the 
Blue Rose Knights are working hard, too!
