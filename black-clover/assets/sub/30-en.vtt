00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.650
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.170
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.610
He's so strong...

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.160
What the hell was that magic?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.480
So, how would you like to die?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.880
P-Please spare us! We'll never 
attack the village again!

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.010
I won't kill you this time.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.040
Huh?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.670
Because today is...

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.590
Marie's birthday.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.680
Huh?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.730
Come on. Celebrate Marie's birthday with me.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.060
Who the heck is that?!

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.970
Rejoice greatly, rejoice 
with all your might,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.170
and then die.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.620
I'm going to die anyway?!

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.800
The Mirror Mage

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.080
Village in the Boonies: Hage

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.750
Father!

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.000
They sent money again this month.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.500
Great!

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.310
Are they doing well?

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.690
We'll be able to eat lots of tatoes again.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.010
Yay!

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.020
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
1st Class Junior Magic Knight
2nd Class Junior Magic Knight
3rd Class Junior Magic Knight
4th Class Junior Magic Knight
5th Class Junior Magic Knight

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.220
Apparently Yuno became a
first-class junior Magic Knight.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.020
That's awesome! It's only been 
two months since he joined!

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.070
Yuno is the hope of Hage!

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.130
What about Asta?

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.100
I'm sure he's trying too hard 
and being a burden to everyone.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.280
Asta, you can come home at any time!

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.990
Let's see... "Hello, Sister Lily, 
brats at the church, and Mayor."

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.540
What about me?!

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.290
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
1st Class Junior Magic Knight
2nd Class Junior Magic Knight
3rd Class Junior Magic Knight
4th Class Junior Magic Knight
5th Class Junior Magic Knight

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.290
Asta's also become a 
third-class junior Magic Knight?!

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.170
What?!

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.420
I see... I guess Asta's working hard, too.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.180
To think our Asta is finally...

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.510
Both of you stay healthy, and do your best!

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.520
The Golden Dawn's Headquarters

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.650
Yuno.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.410
I heard you moved up to
first-class junior Magic Knight.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.780
Congratulations.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.900
It's no big deal.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.030
Exactly.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.470
We wouldn't want you to get too cocky.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.030
I still far surpass you in 
both rank and experience.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.430
Klaus?

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.500
Take this.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.510
A little gift from your senior
in honor of your promotion.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.050
You sent all of your pay 
back home, didn't you?

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.020
Klaus is so shy.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.700
He was so happy when he heard 
you had been promoted

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.770
that his glasses were sparkling with joy.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.020
It's a bit smothering.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.700
Black Bulls' Base

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.080
All right, all eyes up here.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.080
We just got paid, so no work today.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.710
Yeah!

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.710
All right! I'm gonna train real hard!

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.510
Thanks, Mr. Yami!

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.130
Awesome decision, sir!

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.910
Let's drink! The night's still young.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.250
Time for second breakfast!

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.850
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.840
I'm gonna hit on all the girls!

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.450
Ocean girls? Mountain girls?

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.860
All the girls meet... me!

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.740
By the way, Gauche, good job 
handling that many guys yesterday.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.040
Today's my sister's birthday, so could I have 
the next year off, until her next birthday?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.980
No.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.490
I'm so bored! I wonder if anyone 
will attack the royal capital again.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.680
Hey! Maybe I'll attack it!

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.130
That's a bigger no.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.380
Your luck with money goes 
up if you polish gold.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.860
None of these guys intend to work at all...

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.230
Cotton Creation Magic: Sheep Cooks!

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.900
Time to eat!

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.980
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.980
You've got tatoes!

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.140
I procured the local specialty from my 
meal-saving prince's hometown, Hage Village!

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.500
Dig in, everyone!

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.750
Thanks! So good!

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.780
It's so dry. Must be full of fiber.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.010
It's so flaky.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.470
It completely dried out my mouth.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.610
So dry...

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.490
Munchy, munchy...

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.570
My love for my meal-saving prince 
provides the best seasoning!

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.570
I wonder what I should get my 
goddess Marie for her birthday.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.760
All right! I'm gonna get all the cuties—

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.580
Hold it.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.390
Oh, right...

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.970
You want to do some gambling, so you 
want me to take you into town again?

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.420
No, before that...

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.170
Not sure if it's the fiber working, 
but I'm about to hit my limit right now.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.680
That is the one limit you may not hit!

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.340
Evil, begone!

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.770
Honestly...

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.370
How am I supposed to find anything to do 
when we get a day off on such short notice?

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.850
Magna!

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.370
If you have some time,

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.610
I was wondering if you could drop me off 
somewhere on your super-awesome broom!

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.360
I can't say no to my cute little underling.
Where do you wanna go?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.040
To Nean!

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.870
I-Isn't that...

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.710
The place where those guys had the mixer?

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.420
And what are you gonna do there?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.820
Well...

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.000
Well?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.800
I'll tell you on the way!

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.660
What the heck?!

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.730
I-It's not like I care what he does.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.760
A-And I have absolutely no interest 
in who he's going to see!

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.930
Get on. Let's get going.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.290
Huh? Right now?

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.010
Otherwise, we're not going.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.050
Let's go!

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.330
Hold on tight!

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.220
O-Okay, so I <i>do</i> want to know!

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.750
City in the Common Realm: Nean

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.750
To my dear, beloved little sister Marie...

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.260
I just arrived in the city you live in.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.410
My job as a Magic Knight is rough, but if
it's for you, it's not really rough at all.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.520
I can even buy you presents with my pay.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.610
A former convict like myself is
only able to live a proper life

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.590
for the sake of your angelic cuteness, 
Marie. It's all thanks to you.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.890
Ah, already, my nose won't stop bleeding.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.790
Lord Gauche!

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.790
We've been waiting for you!

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.300
Come in! We've got plenty of birthday 
presents for you to choose from!

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.200
Hurry up and show me around.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.820
Right away!

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.610
First up, we have these!

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.150
All little girls love plushies, 
and plushies love little girls!

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.810
I'm sure her delight will
show in her angelic smile.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.320
Thank you, Brother!

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.060
I-I'll take them all...

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.070
Thank you, sir!

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.470
Next, we have this.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.790
I'm sure the little darling will enjoy 
her days playing house as she fantasizes

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.530
about living in a mansion like 
this with her beloved brother.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.590
Brother!

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.090
Welcome home!

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.850
I'll take that, too.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:19.930
Thank you, sir!

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.810
Lastly, we have this! With this outfit, 
your little sister can be a real angel!

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.860
Brother...

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.940
I love you!

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.570
Give me everything in the shop.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.980
Thank you, sir!

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.830
What?! You're going to see a 
chick you met at the mixer?!

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.290
Yup! I promised Rebecca that I would 
play with her little siblings.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.460
M-Man, you're already meeting 
her family? Way to go!

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.800
Don't mess this up.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.520
Got it!

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.060
There it is!

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.370
All right! I'm going to play 
with all the strength I've got!

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.770
Don't get too crazy!

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.530
To my dear, beloved little sister Marie...

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.570
Please forgive your brother for 
being late due to his anemia.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:31.210
I bought you lots of birthday 
presents. Please be happy!

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.300
I used up all of my pay, but no
 price is too high for Marie.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.590
I will be able to see my 
little angel Marie soon...

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.340
I'll be able to see her smile... 
Oh, my beloved Marie.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.100
Marie... Marie... Ma—

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.600
How do you like that, Marie?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.170
This is fun! You're so strong, Asta!

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.730
Me, too!

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.820
And me!

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.220
All right! Are you read—

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.000
Huh? What?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.570
Get away from her this instant, you trash!

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.870
Hey, you're my senior with the sister complex
who's always getting nosebleeds!

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.370
Don't call me a guy with a sister complex 
and nosebleeds, meathead runt!

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.710
I'll stomp you to death!

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.630
I train hard, so you'll have 
to try harder than that!

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.180
He's so annoying.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:32.140
I'm only able to see my sister,
who lives at the church, once a month!

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.250
Today is the one day that I get 
to release my pent-up feelings,

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.570
worship the heck out of my sister, 
and do all kinds of things with her,

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.570
so why are you worshiping her first, huh?!

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.400
See? You do have a sister 
complex and a nosebleed!

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.910
So wait, she's your sister?

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.930
Don't you dare point at my angel.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.110
I showed you her picture before!

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.460
Did you?

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.610
I was just visiting Rebecca, 
and she just happened to be here.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.710
Hi...

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.850
That guy is scary.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.130
What does he mean by "all kinds of things"?

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.140
Shh!

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.470
Man, Marie sure is cute.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:13.230
Of course she is! More importantly, why 
do you have your eye on my little sister?

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.440
Stop!

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.030
Please don't be so mean, Brother!

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.730
I'm going to marry him!

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.980
I'm going to marry him... I'm going to 
marry him... I'm going to marry him....

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.380
Marry him?!

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.000
I ended up following him because I was 
curious, but what the heck's going on?!

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.000
Um... May I ask for the fare now?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.570
Will this do?

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.460
That's too much!

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.760
I'll kill you... I'll kill you... I'll kill you...

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.760
Huh? What was that?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.340
I'll kill you... I'll kill you... I'll kill you...

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.850
I'll kill you!

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.210
Mirror Magic:

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.710

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.820
Wh-What the heck's up with that spell?!

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.740
I'll kill you!

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.030
Brother, stop!

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.740
It sure is noisy out here.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.210
Marie, it's time. We must 
go back to the church.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.480
Sister!

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.330
Tch.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.410
Oh, so you came, Gauche.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.500
You old hag!

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.470
It's not "old hag," it's "Sister."

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.660
Marie's about to go on a date with me.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.680
Go back to the church by 
yourself, Sister Old Hag.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.040
Not happening. It's time.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.480
You go home, you sister complex punk.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.980
In any case, it's not good for Marie 
to spend time with a guy like you.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.990
Your attitude's always terrible. You have
mean eyes and a filthy mouth.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.810
What did you say, you shitty old hag?

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.770
See? Filthy.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:51.990
Shut up. Die.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.060
You've got some nerve, 
saying that to an old lady

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.180
who's not long for this world, you fool.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.580
Yeah, right, dumbass. 
Says the old she-demon who'll

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.040
probably live another hundred years.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.170
Don't talk to people like 
they're monsters, you thug!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.960
Shut up, gangster hag!

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.110
Gauche!

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.530
How can you talk to your elders like that?!

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.650
You shouldn't!

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.350
You stay out of this!

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.120
Anyway, go on home.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.450
Let's go, Marie.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.580
Brother, Asta! See you later!

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.280
M-Marie!

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.110
See ya!

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.740
See you later!

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.950
You okay, sister complex guy?

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.500
M-Ma... Ma... Ma...

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.500
What a weirdo.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.370
Why don't you come in and have dinner at
our place while you wait for him to wake up?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.820
You're welcome to spend 
the night... if you want.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.060
Really?!

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:45.860
Yeah!

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.880
Yeah, come over!

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.470
S-S-Spend the night?!

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.310
He's going to spend the night at the home 
of a girl he just met?! Is he stupid?!

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.970
How stupid can he be?!

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.580
And Asta is so funny!

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.400
That really loud boy?

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.550
Yeah!

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.280
S...

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.780
So good!

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.350
Isn't it?

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.300
This is so good!

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.050
Would you like some moguro fruit?

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.620
So fast!

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.130
All these dishes are so good 
that I can't put my spoon down!

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.410
Really? I'm glad to hear it!

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.710
You'll be a great wife one day, Rebecca!

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.310
It's no big deal...

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.640
What are you talking about?! There's more to
being a good wife than just being a good cook!

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.690
Sissy, are you going to marry Asta?

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.450
N-No, Marco!

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.010
Of course she's not!

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.960
You should totally jump him tonight, Sis!

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.120
You idiot! What are you saying, Luca?!

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.920
Goo goo.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.140
Y-You too, Pem?! Do you even 
know what you're saying?!

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.650
J-Jump him? No, you dummy, dummy, dummy!

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.160
What's going on? What is this?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.660
It's not even winter! Why is it so cold?

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.160
Huh?

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.700
You should totally jump him tonight!

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.720
Goo goo.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.960
Y-You too, Pem?!

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.390
You dummy! Dummy, dummy, dummy!

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.210
I-I would never do anything like that!

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:40.430
I-I'm just going to check and see if 
Luca and Marco are actually asleep...

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.540
Asta...

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.570
Die, Asta.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.590

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.740
G-Gauche?!

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.970
Die, Asta.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.140
Why? Wait, what? What's going on?

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.190
Huh? What?!

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.980
I won't allow you to marry Marie. I'll make 
sure it doesn't happen by killing you.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.480
What?!

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.320
Kids say stuff like that all the time!

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.990
Only cowards attack people in their sleep!

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.030
I don't care if it's cowardly or not,
as long as I can kill you.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.250
Mirror Magic:

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:52.950
Real Double.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.270
Now there are two Gauches?!

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.590
First he shoots beams out of a mirror,
and now this? What's up with his magic?

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.590
Your crime...

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.430
is the fact that you met my little sister.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.680
Wouldn't that make most people criminals?!

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.180
Shut up. Die.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.270
That's not even your house!

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.520
S-Snow? When did it pile up so much?

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.080
It's not even the season for that yet.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.390
I don't care about that. Just die.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.210
Hey! What do you two think you're doing?!

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.090
Rebecca! I'm so sorry!

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.200
Now's not the time for that!

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.300
The kids are gone!

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.670
Huh?

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.550
Urian, where are you?

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.060
Chris!

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:50.890
Hey!

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.060
Von is gone!

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.330
Starting today,

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.570
you're all my friends.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:57.350
Petit Clover

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.660
Petit Clover!

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.850
Double Gauche

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.330
Double Gauche.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.980
Brother!

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.550
Spin me around like Asta did!

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.740
I'll... kill him!!

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.740
Spin... Marie around?!

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.740
Brother?!

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.700
I can't disappoint Marie... 
I'll have to rely on my clone...

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.500
Mirror Magic: Real Double!

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.690
Spin her around...

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.210
I can't put Marie in danger.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.760
That's true!

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.880
Then I'll just have to do it for her.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.910
See? We're spinning!

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.050
You're not doing it right.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.970
What? The ABCs of cooking?

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.770
<b>A</b>ll will <b>B</b>ow down before my <b>C</b>ooking!

Pursuit Over the Snow

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.740
But now's not the time for that!
The kids are in trouble!
