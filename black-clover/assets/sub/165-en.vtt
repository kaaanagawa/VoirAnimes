WEBVTT

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.790
And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.410
a devil.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.340
What Asta, who was born without magic,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.720
gained from the five-leaf grimoire was

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.730
the power of anti-magic, 
which nullifies any magic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.920
Meanwhile, the Dark Triad 
of the Spade Kingdom

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.800
also possessed the powers of 
the devils from the underworld,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.680
and began invading the other kingdoms.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.770
Asta continued to fight 
while believing in himself,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.300
along with his friends... 
to protect this world!

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.660
The thing that connects this 
world with the underworld is...

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.510
a magic channel called the Tree of Qliphoth.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.500
Dante said that creating the Tree of Qliphoth

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.180
required world tree magic and dark magic.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.850
Guess I'm gonna have to 
take you out here and now!

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.500
Meanwhile, in the Heart Kingdom,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.380
the battle against Vanica's 
Dark Disciples continued.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.550
True Lightning Magic: Ceranos!

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.080
First, Luck defeated Svenkin,
 who uses skin magic.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.810
And next...

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.210
Food Magic: Glutton's Banquet.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.570
I'll just... help myself!

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.640
Charmy powered up her food magic
 with the Mana Method

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.370
and brought down Halbet, who used hair magic.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.290
True beauty and strength come 
from a well-balanced diet!

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.000
What is this giant array?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.960
I endured and took my time making it.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.520
True Flame Magic:

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.160
Crimson Eruption!

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.950
Leopold, who had obtained true flame 
magic through the Mana Method,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.640
defeated Sivoir, who used eye magic.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.810
If you aren't prepared to get hurt,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.820
stay off the battlefield!

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.740
The Spirit Guardian Gaja took care 
of Hischer, who used nail magic.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.620
You won't have your way, Dark Disciple!

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.220
Plant Magic: Magic Cannon Flower!

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.460
You're disgusting!

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.650
Robero, who used tongue magic, 
appeared before Queen Loropechika,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.870
and fell at the hands of Mimosa, but...

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.180
Yoo-hoo!

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.190
My widdle Loropechika!

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.390
Man, I'm bored.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.780
The three members of the Dark Triad 
are also out right now, aren't they?

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.730
Yeah. By the way, did you hear?

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.290
There might be a spy from 
the Clover Kingdom here.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.800
Oh, please! No one would be that stupid.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.830
Guess you're right.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.960
You there.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.520
What are you doing in Lord Dante's room?

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.320
Ah, you must be the spy.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.910
Let's have a nice, long chat.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.720
They disappeared?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.480
Where did...

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.190
Water Crusade

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.610
My widdle Loropechika!

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.960
You grunts next to her don't 
need to be so guarded, either.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.360
I only cursed you last time 
because Megicula asked me to,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.150
but we're going to have so much fun today!

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.500
She's the devil-possessed 
who hosts Megicula...

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.930
Vanica of the Dark Triad.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.300
The one who killed my mother!

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.940
Why did you attack the Heart Kingdom 
if I'm the one you're after?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.670
Why did you target the places
 where my people were?

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.660
Well, I thought if I did that,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.830
you'd be even more willing to fight me!

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.660
How dare she?!

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.780
We've defeated all of your minions!

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.500
You're the only one left! I hope 
you're prepared to deal with us!

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.670
What?

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.740
You've defeated them all, you say?

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.680
Man, that felt great.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.940
No... He should've been 
rendered unconscious.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.090
Ah, Lady Vanica, I am so grateful.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.070
Thanks to you, I was able 
to feel good so many ti—

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.220
Could you shut up?

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.760
Hurry up and take care of all the pests 
who aren't my widdle Loropechika.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.140
Lady Vanica, please, stomp on me some more.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.630
You see? Thanks to the curse I put on them,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.520
they just won't die, no matter
 how many times you kill them!

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.450
Where do you think you're going?

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.360
What?

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:01.500
We've only just begun trampling 
this kingdom. Long live Lady Vanica!

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.500
Dark Disciple
Hischer Ongg

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.750
All the other enemies...

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.730
Behold the power of love!

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.260
All hail Lady Vanica!

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.430
How dare you... How dare you 
inflict pain and injury on me?!

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.080
I was chosen by Lady Vanica!

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:30.190
How dare you put someone as beautiful 
as me through something so disgraceful?!

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:36.700
I'll wreck everything with the eternal 
beauty that Lady Vanica gave me!

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.540
Looks like they're all still yapping.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.830
Bring it on!

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.900
I told you, you will not have your way.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.840
But if you don't defeat me, they're just
 going to keep coming back to life...

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.510
Until they exterminate every 
last person in this kingdom.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.520
Do you feel like playing with 
me now, my widdle Loropechika?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.070
Let's go, Loropechika.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.030
Yes.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.370
Noelle! Let us fight, too!

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.530
Right!

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.920
Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Armor!

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.410
We will defeat you!

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.550
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.920
Blood Magic: Red Beast.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.170
What was that snake 
supposed to be? An attack?

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.140
Don't worry. I'll play with you girlies.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.660
I snuck some magic-controlling 
weed seeds into that last attack.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.350
I can't move...

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.910
But neither can you!

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.190
Mimosa!

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.260
Leave this frog to me. You two 
take care of that devil-possessed!

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.850
Both of your magic powers 
are the best, Lady Vanica!

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.740
Blood magic and curse-warding magic...

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.440
Just like Loropechika said, she's...

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.940
Uh, Loropechika?

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.220
Loropechika!

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.340
Ah! Yesh?!

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.730
S-Sorry, I was checking something.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.410
Checking something? It looked 
like you were just spacing out.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.380
More importantly, the Spade Kingdom...

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.290
Oh, right.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.850
Each member of the Dark Triad uses
two different magical attributes.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.300
Their own, and the one their devil has.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.110
Vanica and Megicula...

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:08.070
I've fought them once before, so I will 
come up with a strategy against them.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.030
Let us train toward that.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.520
Excellent, my widdle Loropechika!

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.320
I wonder if Dante and Zenon 
are also having fun right now.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.810
But I definitely get to have the most fun!

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.330
It's widdle Loropechika, 
and I get to kill her if I want!

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.890
Loropechika has me. That won't be happening.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.920
World tree magic and dark 
magic sound fun and all...

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.390
But having to drag them back 
sounds like such a pain!

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.760
Dark magic?

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.520
What do you mean, drag them back?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.140
What are the other two members 
of the Dark Triad doing?

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.400
What? Why should I have to tell you?

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.410
World tree magic... Dark magic...

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.660
The Queen of the Heart Kingdom 
inherits the previous queens' powers,

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.290
which includes their knowledge and experiences.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.060
This is where that colossal 
amount of information

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.210
gets realized in Loropechika's mind.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.200
This place is why she is called 
the "All-Knowing Priestess."

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.690
That's... awful.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.320
Loropechika!

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.250
They're...

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.840
If we let the Dark Triad have their way,

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.480
the door connecting the underworld where 
the devils live to this world will open,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.680
killing more than 90% of 
the people on this continent,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.710
and the world will cease to be!

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.320
What?!

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.700
That's... awful.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.320
Loropechika!

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.290
They're...

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.800
If we let the Dark Triad have their way,

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:38.390
the door connecting the underworld where 
the devils live to this world will open,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.590
killing more than 90% of 
the people on this continent,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.710
and the world will cease to be!

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.340
What?!

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.740
How could you do something so awful?

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.220
People are going to die, too!

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:59.050
I want my blood to seethe with all of the 
blood of the strong people left behind!

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.230
I have no interest in the 
weak who're going to die.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.860
But who cares about the future? 
Let's enjoy the pres—

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.300
Indeed, we cannot let 
these people roam free!

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.370
That's why we will defeat 
you right here and now!

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.380
The fate of the world is in our hands.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.380
Mana Zone plus Mana Method...

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.130
Water Spirit Magic...

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.410
Ludic Sanctuary!

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.400
This water cuts the power 
of your blood magic in half

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.150
and powers up Noelle's magic!

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.450
Harder! Even harder!

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.160
What...

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.170
The lighter your armor, the more 
you can become one with the water!

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:12.690
That will also assist you in becoming 
one with the water and moving faster!

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.120
Valkyrie Armor ~ Mermaid Form!

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.190
I won't let you have your way any longer!

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.950
Nice!

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.960
Aw, there was someone who could 
team up with widdle Loropechika.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.250
This is going to be even more fun, then!

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.960
Don't croak too fast, okay?

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.970
Devil Power: 50%!

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.580
She has this much power even 
when it's difficult for blood

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.140
to harden within my magic.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.070
As I expected... a normal attack 
won't be enough to defeat her!

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:03.980
Noelle!

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.450
Nice! I'm getting even more fired up!

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.210
51%!

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.710
She only went up one percent, 
and her power is insanely stronger!

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.720
I guess you only think about 
satisfying your desires.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.290
52%!

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.560
Is that how you killed my mother...

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.730
Acier Silva of the Clover Kingdom?!

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.480
53%!

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:50.980
Who's that? I have no interest in the past,
 so let's just enjoy this moment!

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.330
Just give up and let me lick you.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.000
We're never going to die because 
of Lady Vanica's magic.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:11.020
We trained really hard so we 
wouldn't lose to the likes of you!

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.620
Not just for the world...

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.520
Or to avenge my mother...

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.170
You're truly magnificent, Loropechika.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.090
We've gotten so much stronger.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.410
Y-Yes. I guess maybe you had 
something to do with that.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:41.370
But of course! Loropechika is amazing!

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.410
Oh, no. I'm not that... I'm just...

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.420
Just so you know, humility is
 going to sound fake right now.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:54.420
My mana and magic are both passed 
down from all the other queens.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.620
Well, your mana is amazing to begin with.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.140
It can't be inherited just by anyone.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.700
Since I'm so clumsy and silly,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.850
I wonder if I'm worthy of being 
the Queen of the Heart Kingdom.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.940
When I previously fought against Vanica,
 who is possessed by Megicula,

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.110
I was frightened.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.570
And because of that, I was cursed.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.070
I am unfit to be the queen.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:30.280
When I'm before you, I forget about 
my status as queen, and I can be honest.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.080
I wonder why.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:37.590
Saying this probably makes me even 
more unfit to be queen, but...

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.090
I'm...

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.670
so afraid of dying.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.100
I don't want to die!

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.890
I have so much to think about 
as the queen of this kingdom!

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.860
But I... I...

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:58.870
Oh, I'm sorry. A queen shouldn't 
cry so much in front of others.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.110
Seriously, what are you even talking about?

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.860
It's totally fine if you cry.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.580
Especially in front of friends.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.500
Exactly.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.630
Noelle... Mimosa...

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.710
How in the world did you just trip?!

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.230
We...

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.310
are going to win, no matter what!

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.270
For our truly kind...

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.610
...friend!

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.860
65%!

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.570
66%! 67%!

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.610
Nice! Okay, here I go! I'm gonna do it!

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.260
I'm going to give it my all!

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.630
70%!

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.170
Noelle!

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.010
That's what we were waiting for!

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.760
We'll have Vanica use all of the 
devil's power she can right now.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.530
We'll have her increase how much 
blood she sheds from her blood magic

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.110
and make her use up her mana.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.600
That way, she will use the devil's power.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.290
We should be able to go 
head-to-head with her.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.300
And when she uses up all of 
the devil's power that she can,

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.530
we'll use our trump card.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.900
That will be you, 
our mage of the arcane stage...

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.290
Nero!

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.300
Nero's arcane stage...

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.870
Noelle's combative spirit 
and fighting style...

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.090
If you two grow along with Undine and me,

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:52.680
we should be able to defeat Vanica, 
as well as Megicula, who possesses her.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.530
Nero, you're doing this, too.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.190
I'm going to seal that devil's 
power you're so proud of!

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.460
Mana Method: Sealing Magic ~ Eternal Prison!

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.810
I won't let scum like you take 
the world or Loropechika!

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:54.510
Petit Clover

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.460
Petit Clover!

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:58.020
What the Queen of the 
Heart Kingdom Inherited

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.020
What the Queen of the 
Heart Kingdom Inherited.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.930
The Queen of the Heart Kingdom 
inherits the previous queens' powers,

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:06.560
which includes their knowledge and experiences.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.300
This is where that colossal 
amount of information

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.520
gets realized in Loropechika's mind.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.540
This isn't it.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.040
This isn't it, either.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.790
It's not this, either.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.970
Or this. Or this.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.800
Ugh, dang it!

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.670
Why were all the previous 
Queens of the Heart Kingdom

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:33.120
unable to sort anything in order?!

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.230
That goes for you, too.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.650
Sniffle, sniffle...

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.900
No matter how powerful the enemy is... 
No matter how cornered we are,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.690
we'll never give up. 
We'll continue to surpass our limits.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.280
That's what the Black Bulls do.
