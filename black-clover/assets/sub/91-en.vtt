WEBVTT

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.700
It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
But a single mage saved them all.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.590
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.770
Gauche, Gordon, and Grey 
did everything they could

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.550
to protect their hideout from the attack 
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.390
And then...

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.520
I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.980
my precious friends.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.280
Mana Corkscrew!

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.260
Along with the other Black Bull, Henry,
they succeeded in driving back

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.820
Rades and the others by 
working together, but...

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.130
What the hell was all that?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.460
What did they take from our hideout?!

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.580
Master Licht...

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.170
Excellent work.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.250
The magic stone in their hideout 
was stolen from them.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.810
Meanwhile,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.300
at the Eye of the Midnight Sun's 
hideout where the Royal Knights,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.640
led by Mereoleona, had infiltrated,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.490
the final member of the Third Eye,
 Raia the Disloyal,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.620
was about to make his move.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.170
Looks like someone dangerous showed up.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.650
Licht is gone right now, too.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.540
Guess I shouldn't be so lazy 
about this and just go.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.070
Mereoleona vs. Raia the Disloyal

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.640
That guy's magic is insane!

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.650
Mercury Magic: Silver Bullets.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.100
Silver Blades.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.300
How about this, then?!

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.450
Silver Shining Regal Spear!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.920
The Eye of the Midnight Sun's 
attacks have no effect.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.030
I've never seen Lord Nozel
 so determined to fight.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.550
It's pretty amazing.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.360
According to our research, 
there's a time at which

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.710
that spatial mage exits this hideout.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.350
And that's right now.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.900
Outside, our spatial mage is casting 
a spatial jamming spell.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.900
Now, no mage from the outside can enter.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.740
Leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht...

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.580
I won't let you leave this 
place until I defeat you!

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.210
Cherry Blossom Magic:

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.670
Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals 
~Plus My Beautiful Illusion~.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.680
What the heck is this spell?!

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.180
My former self... Yes, my arrogant self,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.180
has been cast aside, along with my hair.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.270
And because of that, my magic 
has become even more beautiful,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.000
and I can use it to make 
you all bloom beautifully!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.190
You're so creepy! 
Just shut up for a second!

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.830
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Waterball!

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.790
Copper Magic: Red Shining Mace!

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.460
Not bad. But I'm surprised you made it 
into the Royal Knights, Ben Benfunk.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.810
Our team annihilated you in an instant.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.380
Hey, what kind of thing is that to say after 
I just pulled off such an awesome move?

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.820
Besides, we were defeated by that Yuno kid.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.730
Same thing.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.050
I'm pouring everything 
I have into this fight.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.780
If I mess up, Lady Mereoleona 
is going to send me flying.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.140
Lightning Magic: Thunder Fiend!

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.800
Aw... He had the chance to come 
to a place this fun, but he failed.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.160
Oh, well.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.050
Guess I'll have to go crazy for Magna, 
too, and then rub it in his face!

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.020
Oh...

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.400
How beautiful.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.080
Way to go, Yuno! Small fry will never 
be anything more than small fry.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.370
Talk about easy.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.740
Let's hurry ahead.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.070
I-It's no use...

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.250
No matter what you do...

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.960
What? The small fry has some last words?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.960
We will soon be reborn... 
in our true forms!

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.760
True forms? What are you talking about?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.550
What are these patterns on the walls?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.020
The deeper we go, 
the more patterns there are.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.270
It's unsettling.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.410
What's the matter, Yuno?

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.610
Quiet.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.370
I... hear something.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.080
I can see through all 
those simple-minded traps!

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.880
I'll cut through any spell 
with my anti-magic sword!

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.860
We seriously have nothing to do!

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.100
Why not take a break?! 
We can fight, too, you know!

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.940
Wait, another me?! Is that you, Grey?

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.410
What the hell, you little shit?
 You can use magic?

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.570
You can clone yourself?

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.310
Heck no! Don't underestimate 
my lack of magic!

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.820
Who gave you permission to 
make another one of you?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.040
Uh, it's not like I wanted another me!

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.990
So which one's the fake? 
They've even copied his lack of magic.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.170
Can you tell which one's the real one?

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.340
Uh, not at all.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.340
How useless are you?

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.080
I'm the real one!

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.930
No, I'm the real one!

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.600
You're the fake!

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.550
No, that's you!

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.350
Knock it off.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.900
She just set them both on fire.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.660
What are you doing?! 
Are you trying to kill me?!

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.610
I guess you're the real one.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.410
Huh?

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.640
I don't remember bringing along someone

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.150
weak enough to be killed by that.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.410
You're insane, lady!

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.210
Seriously, though...

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.510
You really messed me up.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.670
Copy Magic: Aqua Curtain.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.100
Copy Magic: Healing Light Particles.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.610
Damn, you're one scary lady.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.860
He's...

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.760
Heya, I'm Raia.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.120
Lady, you're wasting that beauty of yours.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.520
She's no lady. She's a warrior.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.800
A soldier.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.610
Who are you? You look like you 
might be somewhat entertaining.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.740
H-He's the last one from the 
Eye of the Midnight Sun's Third Eye.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.880
Oh?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.510
He's named Raia the Disloyal, and he's insane! 
He can copy other people's magic!

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.560
Come to think of it, 
that information does sound familiar.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.010
You forgot?!

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.520
Come on, now... What's with that magic?

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.770
We have to deal with a monster like him?

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:54.030
If you weren't royalty, I would've 
asked you out for a drink.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.550
Don't hold back.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.460
I'll let you drink as much as you like...

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.530
of the flames of hell, that is!

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.790
Jeez... Well, aren't you scary?

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.790
But I've already had my share 
of the flames of hell.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.450
Copy Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.250
Th-That's Captain Yami's!

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.550
Hey, you! Don't copy him!

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.800
Well, I mean... My magic basically 
exists to copy others, so...

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.910
I guess that fool still has a ways to go,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.890
if you're able to copy him so easily.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.770
Okay, here we go. This spell 
won't be that easy to dodge!

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.450
That stance...

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.190
That's also Captain Yami's!

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.700
Copy Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.880
She punched the spell 
and then set it on fire?!

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.960
What the hell?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.710
Unfortunately for you, the original idiot 
who uses that spell packs more of a punch.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.470
Oh? But—

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.300
The all-incinerating spell 
of total destruction...

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.050
Flame Magic:

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.410
Calidos Brachium!

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.100
You can burn for my 
foolish little brother's sake!

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.970
The all-incinerating spell 
of total destruction...

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.730
Flame Magic:

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.970
Calidos Brachium!

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.830
How can she move that fast?

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:00.730
Plus, she had immense concentrated magical 
power in that arm she slammed him with.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.200
It's simple magic, but insanely powerful.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.410
She's more combat-oriented than 
any mage I've encountered before.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:13.420
Holy crap! She's not fighting long-range,
 but getting right up in his face!

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.000
If she's fighting up close, I might 
be able to use her techniques later!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.420
Heck yeah!

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.250
Copy Magic: Healing Light Particles.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.430
He healed right back up again!

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.190
Okay, I'm gonna fight, too... huh?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.690
If you don't want to be killed, 
just shut up and watch.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.490
What?!

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.490
She's definitely gonna be more 
trouble than anyone else here.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.870
But, I mean...

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:57.380
There's no point in getting a big head 
over magic you stole from us, royal.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.630
Copy Magic: Light Swords of Conviction.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.220
I doubt she can keep up with this speed.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.650
Next.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.610
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.490
Man, Lady Sisgoleon's super fast!

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.990
What's with these... superhuman movements?

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.420
Copy Magic: Invisible Seeker.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.800
He's copying people left and right. 
Dunno whose spell that is, but...

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.010
I'm pretty sure

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.800
that one's a spell the former 
captain of the Purple Orcas used!

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.680
Copy Magic: Aqua Javelin!

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.310
She changed directions in midair?

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.070
Next!

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.570
And her reaction times are as fast as Vetto's.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.570
You're not getting away!

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.400
Copy Magic: Tainted Culvert Wyrm!

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.010
How do you like the most powerful 
water spell I can use right now?

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.340
Copy Magic: Salamander's Breath!

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.490
Next!

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.150
She just burns right through water magic,

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.880
the attribute she's weakest against,
and flame magic, too?

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.670
Ugh, you're a pain in the ass!

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.830
What's wrong? Is that all you've got?!

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.980
Invisible—

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.860
Next!

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.820
Copy Magic: Sticky Salamander!

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.240
Next!

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.240
Copy Magic: Jötunn's Ice Floe!

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.340
Calidos Brachium!

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.890
Next!

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.020
She's a beast.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:08.180
Mereoleona Vermillion... She's 
definitely as crazy as the rumors say.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.280
I did a little research.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.370
The royal capital was too stuffy for her,

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.410
and she wanted to eat the meat of wild beasts,

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.240
so for more than 300 days out of the year,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.290
she's like a beast herself,
living out in the wilderness.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.290
Delicious!

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.660
She steeped herself in 
the natural world's mana,

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:30.800
and her Mana Skin reached a higher level 
while she lived out there, or so they say.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.830
That's apparently true, 
judging by her monster moves.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.020
I've never even heard of 
this Raia guy's copy magic,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.560
but I'm starting to understand.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.570
His copy magic can mimic spell attributes.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.570
That means he's a crazy bastard who 
can use every possible attribute.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.820
And the strength of his spells reflects his 
tremendous amount of magical power.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.320
So even if he copies some 
random, average mage,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.490
his version of the spell 
will be even more powerful.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.830
But... when he's activating one spell,

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.330
he can't use another spell with a 
different attribute at the same time.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:12.590
That he lifted his invisibility
to fire a spell proves that.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:17.090
Even so, most people wouldn't stand a 
chance against a guy this overpowered.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.850
But this time...

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.730
Lady Sisgoleon is awesome!

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.480
Can I steal any of this? Even a little bit?

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.820
This is such a pain in the ass...

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.150
Then how about this?

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.240
My sword?!

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.380
How the hell did he manage that?

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.250
I thought there was some kind of 
condition he had to follow to copy...

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.180
I need to touch another's grimoire 
to be able to copy their magic.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.750
Earlier, when I was transformed,

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.250
I casually snuck in and touched it.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.260
Licht...

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.560
Copy magic, eh?

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:10.060
Well, I'm empty inside, so I 
guess it's sorta perfect for me.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.290
You're kinder than anyone, Raia.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.940
Huh? What are you talking about, Licht?

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.410
You look at people carefully, 
and you like everyone.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.370
That's probably why your 
magic is like that.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.120
I like everyone?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.320
It's a kind magic that can't be used 
without watching others closely.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.750
Kind? You're wrong, Licht.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.220
I'm a liar, a slacker, and disloyal.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:44.110
Licht, a man who was genuinely 
kind, said that I was kind...

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.850
and you people tricked and killed him.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:51.480
Look at how many of you crawled out. 
There are hordes of you now!

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.990
Humans... I'll kill every last one of you!

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.500
Looks like that was just a copy of its form. 
You couldn't copy its anti-magic.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.060
So you just hit it without any hesitation?

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.050
If I could've copied his anti-magic,
 your fist would've been shattered!

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.570
Not to mention, the feel of this mana...
This woman's strength...

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.460
It's not just the royalty's magic power!

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.140
It's a human strength that 
we're not familiar with.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.840
Are you done with your spells?

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440
In that case...

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:37.610
She's surpassed Mana Skin and begun 
controlling mana across the area.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.610
Let's end this!

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.580
Mana Zone Calidos Brachium Barrage!

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.360
What's the matter, 
last member of the Third Eye?

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.960
Is that all you've got?!

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.310
He didn't even stand a chance.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:13.140
I don't even have time to use 
any rapid recovery spells.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.060
To think she'd be able to 
use a Mana Zone attack...

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.820
Mana Zone: the ability to harness 
the mana that's floating in

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.530
the surrounding area and control 
that territory at will.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.520
Basically, within that territory, 
you can discharge more mana than you

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.240
personally have in any direction.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.460
Where's your next attack?
Don't you have anything else?!

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.880
Also, your detection abilities 
grow astoundingly sharp,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.710
and your reaction speed increases.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.960
By borrowing the power of mana,
you can move freely, even through space!

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.970
That woman is insane.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.220
We had such a hard time with the Third Eye,
and she's mopping the floor with one of them...

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.470
Captain Mereoleona is so awesome!

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.480
If that's all you've got,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.230
I'm just going to keep punching 
you until you disappear!

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.230
Burn to ash!

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.330
Well, shit.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.000
Wind Magic: Tornado Fang Triple Strike!

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:22.150
Sorry, but people at your 
level can't stop me anymore.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.460
Nice, Yuno!

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.570
He unleashed a spell 
from behind the enemy.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.220
Was that the ability 
people call Mana Zone?

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:37.050
Come to think of it, when he generated 
a spell inside that other spell...

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.690
And that Spirit Dive power...

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.610
Mana Zone made all that possible!

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.610
Yuno... You have such 
overwhelming ability!

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.160
That sound...

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.160
We heard it earlier, too.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.800
A heartbeat?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.420
The feel of this mana... I've felt it before.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.560
The Royal Knights, eh?

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.560
I guess I'll play with you a little longer.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.090
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 92:

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:54.250
Page 92
 The Wizard King vs. The Leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.450
"The Wizard King vs. The Leader 
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun."

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.910
Go on, Licht. Defeat the Wizard King.
