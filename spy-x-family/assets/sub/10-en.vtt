00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.900
Good morning, Master Henderson.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.080
Good morning, sir.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.780
Would you like some tea, as well?

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.820
Yes, I'd love some.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.080
It's been a while since you were in
charge of the grade school kids.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.920
How are the kids this year?

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.840
I must say, they show promise.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.500
I heard you had to give one of them
a Tonitrus Bolt on their first day.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.380
True, it was a rather rare occurrence
for our prestigious Eden College.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.770
It's the first time I've heard
of it happening, too.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.610
I only did what was necessary.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.610
Good deeds shall be praised,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.940
and misconduct will be met with punishment.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.910
That is essential to education.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.780
I have much to learn from you, sir.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.210
As the elementary students pass
through the gates of Eden College

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.800
to learn true elegance every day,
our school's traditions shall live on.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.010
Our house of learning exists to ensure
the future of our country is elegant.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.030
Lord Damian!

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.120
Isn't this your older brother, Lord Damian?

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.740
Yes...

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.880
This must be his entrance ceremony!

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.460
He's probably elsewhere in this book, too!

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.630
Oh, there he is!

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.620
Ooh!

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.840
There he is again!

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.430
And here! He's truly an MVP!

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.140
Your brother is just raking in
the Stellas! How magnificent!

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.980
But I'm sure you'll become an Imperial
Scholar even faster, Lord Damian!

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.230
We all know you'll be the first
to get a Stella in our grade!

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.870
W-Well, yes.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.110
But we still have a while until our exams.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.450
Your first opportunity will be...

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.320
Our P.E. class next week.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.290
We'll be having a dodgeball tournament
with the other classes!

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.500
My friend told me something he
heard from his friend in Class 7.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.130
He said if you become MVP,
you can get a Stella!

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.250
Really?

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.590
This is your chance, Lord Damian!

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.430
MVP, eh?

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.660
It is a clear, sunny day.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.450
Young ladies and gentlemen of Eden,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.280
you will be adding another page
to Eden's history today...

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.300
Elegantly and brilliantly.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.220
Shut up! You picked a fight with me first!

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.550
Anya didn't do anything wrong!

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.180
Exactly! First off, you—

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.470
Shut up, uggo!

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.270
Excuse me?!

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.930
Shithead.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.680
Shut it, Stubby Legs!

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.480
You're not supposed to talk to girls like that!

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.610
Ele...gant.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.450
I have returned!

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.450
Welcome home, Miss Anya.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.120
Papa, I have acquired important news!

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.000
What?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.630
You may be able to get a Stella
at your next P.E. class?

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.000
That's what Becky said.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.260
My friend told me something she
heard from her friend in Class 7.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.100
The MVP from the winning
class in next week's tournament

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.560
will receive a Stella!

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.770
So it's a rumor? That seems dubious.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.400
Then we need to train, Miss Anya!

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.360
Training!

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.360
So what sport will you be playing?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.570
Dodgeball.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.610
Dodgeball...

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.830
That's the game where you hit your opponent
with a ball to do them in, right?

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.200
"Do them in"?

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.450
Mama! Teach me a killer move!

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.130
Very well! I shall teach you the
ultimate killer move with a ball.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.840
Are you also athletic, Yor?

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.170
Oh, not exactly.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.260
I just used to play catch
with my brother sometimes.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.550
I can't tell them I rip people apart
and toss them around on a daily basis!

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.180
Just leave this to me, Miss Anya!

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.810
I'll show you a killer move that
will help you catch that star!

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.980
I will reach for the stars in dodgeball!

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.360
Anya will catch the star!

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.940
That's the spirit!

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.190
I'm glad she's so motivated... but...

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.070
Super Anya will catch the star!

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.740
Yes!

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.330
We'll start with strength training.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.040
One...

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.410
Two...

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.130
Three...

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.340
Four...

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.510
Death-Defying Sit-ups

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.470
Five.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.270
Six.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.770
Stamina is crucial, too.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.610
Miss Anya!

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.410
Now, listen carefully.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.660
You're not just using your
arms when you throw the ball.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.410
You need to make sure you
step out with your foot,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.790
twist your hips as you shift your weight,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.800
channel all of your strength
into your shoulder, and... throw!

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.100
Okay! Now you give it a try!

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.810
Oh, Loid.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:33.990
Visualizing the Game

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.070
This is training?

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:34.010
I don't really understand how,
but I did decide to let Yor handle this.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.080
Miss Anya, please wake up.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.940
Hey!

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.910
Hey!

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.830
Hah!

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.540
Hah!

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.750
Hup!

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.880
Hup!

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.710
Slap!

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.590
Slap!

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.500
Fwap!

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.420
Fwap!

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.510
Chwass!

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.050
Chwass!

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.400
I'm gonna catch that star tomorrow!

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.830
I did my best. I survived
Mama's ruthless training.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.000
I even thought up a name for my killer shot.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.290
I'm gonna seize that star!

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.390
I'm gonna get lots of stars...

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.850
so I can help Papa with his mission!

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.860
At least it's clear that you're motivated.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.480
Just make sure you don't hold
Lord Damian back, Stubby Legs.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.610
Second son... and his lackeys.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.940
Why are we playing together with the boys?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.900
Being on the same team
with him is the worst.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.660
Second son... The son of Papa's
target for this mission.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.120
Good things happen if
I become friends with him.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.910
Wh-What are you staring at?!

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.290
But he gets really mean,
so I don't like him.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.880
Well, I don't have any time to
waste on a runt like you, either.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.040
A runt?

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.390
I'm going to get MVP in this tournament
and be rewarded a Stella.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.850
I need to become an Imperial
Scholar just like my brother.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.560
Otherwise...

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.610
Father will never notice me.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.360
Hey, wait, Lord Damian!

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.110
Gather round!

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.900
Your usual P.E. teacher, Bobby,
is out sick, so I will be his substitute.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.550
Do not forget to be proper
young men and ladies,

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.580
and execute the most elegant of plays.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.160
Yes, sir.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.920
We will now begin the dodgeball tournament
between Class 3, Cecile Hall,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.970
and Class 4, Wald Hall.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.720
You may now begin!

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:09.980
THE GREAT DODGEBALL PLAN

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.990
Let's show them who's boss, Lord Damian.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.110
You've got this, Damian!

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.990
Lord Damian!

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.870
We gathered some intel on Class 4!

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.000
Good.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.630
In order to be awarded a Stella,
you have to become the MVP.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.760
My enemy...

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.340
is him!

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.850
In order to defeat Class 4
and win this match, first...

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.850
we need to defeat him!

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.690
The son of a command major, Bill Watkins.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.400
Bill Watkins (6)

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.490
Nice catch, Bill!

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.280
What the heck is that monster?!

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.490
There's no way he's our age!

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280
It's him...

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.000
Bazooka Bill!

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.960
Because of his obviously
blessed physique and brains,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.630
he won awards in all kinds of
sports tournaments in kindergarten.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.330
The Monster of Bodam!

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.760
Are there even that many
tournaments in kindergarten?!

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.250
Wearing glasses right now
is dangerous, old man.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.260
I humbly thank you for your concern,
Damian, son of Chairman Desmond.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.020
But I'll be fine, because that
ball won't be hitting me.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.260
Also...

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.270
Any hits above the shoulders don't count.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.860
Enemy positions confirmed.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.530
Airflow, humidity... both good.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:47.950
Gerf.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:48.700
Gah.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.330
Four hits.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.790
Wow! Way to go, Bill!

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.410
What?!

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.790
Is that even possible?!

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.910
Don't panic! That was just a fluke!

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.050
Oh, that wasn't a fluke.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.720
When I throw the ball...

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.680
Every imaginable detail has been calculated.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.890
We're not just talking simulations.
I've trained my body to its limit.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.960
Daddy!

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.340
Ah, my son, Bill.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.380
Yes, Daddy?

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:47.180
You will eventually be the hero
of Eden, as well as our army.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.670
Make sure you seize those
Stellas with your own hands.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.310
For the future of Ostania!

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.600
Sir, yes, sir!

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.180
Yes... my victory is predetermined.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.320
Um, hello?! We'll die if
that actually hits us!

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.690
Don't worry. I'll hold back on you women.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.990
Actually, that also pisses me off.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.170
Gurk!

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.540
Hit.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.120
That's some mouth you've got on you.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.930
Do you really think we went into
this without a plan, you giant oaf?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.800
You can't win...

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.340
at dodgeball all by yourself!

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.200
Ow!

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.370
You're gonna be the MVP! I just know it!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.010
I'm gonna be the MVP!

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.170
Let's do this! Formation G!

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.180
Right!

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:26.770
Four hits.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.280
I'm not done yet!

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.870
Ultimate...

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.450
...Shadow...

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.290
...Clone...

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.300
...Attack!

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.630
Shadow clone, eh?

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.090
Now, this is what you call...

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.050
a real shadow clone attack!

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.510
Lord Damian...

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.720
It was an honor to fight by your side.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.730
Emile!

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.610
I know all kinds of great
things about you, Lord Damian.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.230
Though I can't remember a single one
right now, I'm sure there was something.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.730
Please win, Lord Damian!

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.980
Because you'll always be...

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.580
a true MVP in our hearts!

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.510
The forbidden... face block!

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.520
Emile!

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.680
Emile! Hey! Speak to me!

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.660
Ewen... you dummy. Don't cry.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.360
I'm not crying!

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.400
It's not the end yet...

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.530
So don't give up hope.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.160
Yeah. I know. I know!

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.750
Once we give up, it's game over—

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.870
Damn it! At this rate, we're gonna lose.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.460
I need to find his weakness!

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.170
I don't care if the others go down.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.840
I need to somehow survive and stand out!

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.050
Second son is a real shithead.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.400
Next up...

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.850
we have that little runt over there.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.020
I'm going to aim for... her feet!

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.730
Wha—

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.440
Hey! He missed! Nice!

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.530
Let's get the ball going!

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.030
She just...

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.860
jumped before I threw the ball!

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.400
Take this!

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.740
In that case...

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.030
I'll aim for her right arm!

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.700
Okay, her left!

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.790
I guess I'll just have to use my secret weapon!

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.960
This throw will suddenly change its course
and nail any opponent scampering about!

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.670
Take this!

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.730
Homing Slider Shot!

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.640
What was that about holding back on women?!

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:02.890
Blorf!

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.010
Blorf!

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.890
Hit.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:14.110
That's impossible! She's
reading my every attack!

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.990
Who in the world is that girl?!

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.860
Hey, not bad...

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.410
Heh.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.230
"Dodgeball," of course, stems from "dodge,"

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.410
meaning to swiftly move out of the way.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.410
Such elegant evasion!

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.630
Anya! Look out for the guys out of bounds!

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.920
You dummy! Get up, quick!

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:41.290
You were impressive, but even you
can't dodge from that position!

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.020
Die!

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.510
The bastard just threw that
ball with everything he has!

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.020
It's unfortunate... But in the end,
this is her own fault.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.610
Don't worry. I shall survive
and lead Class 3 to victory.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.710
Hit.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.180
Wh-What are you doing, Lord Damian?!

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.970
Oh, no! My chance at MVP!

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.140
You protected me?

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.550
Huh?

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.350
Are you a good guy?

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.890
N-N-No!

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.480
I was just frustrated that he was
taking out our team left and right,

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.650
so I tried to catch it...

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.190
Damn it all!

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.150
You're the only one left.
It's in your hands now.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.910
The future is in Anya's hands.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.460
Now is the time to unleash my killer shot!

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.790
Miss Anya, this is my final lesson for you.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.170
The key to throwing a ball well is to
put your whole body into the throw.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.010
Think of this ball as an arrow of light!

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.150
I won't let your death
go to waste, second son.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.220
I'm not dead!

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.990
I will avenge you!

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.790
That power she had when she knocked me out...

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.380
She might just be able to...

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.420
I have no idea what's going on,
but this is intense.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.840
Could it be...

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.110
The most important thing
is shifting my weight.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.150
The power in my step
and the twisting of my hips

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.780
need to go to my widdle hands...

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.410
And then my widdle hands... um... um...

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.610
Anyway!

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.320
Killer Shot!

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.370
Star Catch Arrow!

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.290
Huh? What?

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.380
Huh?!

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.150
That's game.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.260
Huh?

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.760
Yay! We won!

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.810
Huh?

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.850
Now you're definitely
getting that Stella, Bill!

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.520
Hm? Stella?

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.070
There are no Stella awarded for winning
a mere mini-game in a single class.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.780
Who in the world suggested otherwise?

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.950
On the other hand, you had the nerve to yell
something as vile as "die" during the match,

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.990
so I have no issue with giving
you a Tonitrus Bolt instead.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.940
Don't worry, Bill! We'll just
try harder next time!

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.850
We'll have another chance.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.000
But to think...

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.130
Two students who were at odds with each other
worked together to take on this challenge.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.130
Too bad, Anya. But you did great!

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.120
This shows that you are worthy of
a Stella, young ladies and gentlemen.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.800
Cheer up!

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.400
You can't be serious, you moron!
What was that crappy throw?!

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.920
I shouldn't have defended you!

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.590
Shock!

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.710
What's your problem?
It's not like you hit anyone!

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.320
Anya doesn't like you after all.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.620
What did you say, Stubby Legs?!

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.840
You're not supposed to say
stuff like that to girls!

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.200
Or perhaps not.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.940
You really are a shithead.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.550
Huh?! Say that again!

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.510
Everything Mama teaches me is useless.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.210
Yeah!

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.910
"STELLA"
