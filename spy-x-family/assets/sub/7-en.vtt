00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.980
The man who threatens the peace
between the East and the West...

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.990
Donovan Desmond.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.730
In order to get closer to him,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.610
I successfully had Anya enroll in
Eden College, the school his son attends.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.620
Next, in order to attend the social
gathering that Desmond goes to,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.630
I need Anya to obtain eight
merits, called "Stella,"

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.920
so that she can become an Imperial Scholar.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.760
To make this all happen at a prestigious
school, however, would not be easy.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.350
That is why I formulated a plan B,
"The Friendship Scheme."

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.770
I was hoping to have Anya get
closer to Desmond's son, Damian,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.860
Come over!

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.030
which in turn would hopefully
connect us as their parents.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.690
Welcome

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.690
Thank
you

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.650
But on the first day,
she ended up punching Damian,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.860
earned a Tonitrus Bolt, and left
their friendship in shambles.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.820
Alas, it is too early to give up.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.960
This plan has only just begun.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.760
THE TARGET'S SECOND SON

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.930
Good mworning...

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.510
Good morning, Yor. Breakfast is ready.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.270
Looks like the three of us are
getting used to life as a family.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.190
Is Anya still asleep?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.320
She's still worried about
what happened yesterday?

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.860
Come on out. I won't get mad.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.780
Eat quickly, or you'll be late.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.660
I'm sorry I'm bad at school.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.790
No, that was my fault.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.000
There's no point to worrying about the past.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.710
Just make sure you don't
get into any more fights.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.760
Okay, come on. Cheer up.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.430
Your classes start today.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.680
You're so kind, Loid.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.690
Figuring out what we can do next is far more
constructive than dwelling on the past.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.940
Besides, it would be
much worse if she somehow

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.440
got sick of school and
didn't want to go anymore.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.700
I need her school life to go as smoothly
as possible for the sake of this mission.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.870
Oh, and make sure you apologize
to Damian at school today.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.790
Got it?

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.870
Yep. Gonna go now.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.460
Do your best and be a good girl!

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.610
It's time for us to head to work, too.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.470
Yes.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.380
I'm counting on you, Anya.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.270
The peace of the world rests
on you two making amends.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.690
Anya will do her best.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.280
Have a wonderful day, Miss Becky.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.900
Miss Rich Girl!

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.370
Oh, Anya. Good day to you.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.980
Do you live in a castle, Miss Rich Girl?

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.330
Of course not.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.870
You came here on the school bus?

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.630
I could have my driver give you a ride
to and from school from now on.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.880
Does that mean I get to
be a Miss Rich Girl, too?

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.880
I never said anything about adopting you.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.850
Aw, I'm jealous of the dorm kids who
don't have to go to and from school.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.100
Bleh...

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.100
What do you mean, "Bleh"?
You rude little girl!

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.520
Ugh, it's only morning and
you're already obnoxious.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.020
What's her problem?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.900
Know your place!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.400
Nyah!

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.320
Make sure you apologize.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.410
Um...

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.660
Um, yesterday, I...

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.080
Let's go, Anya. Our class is about to start.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.920
Hey, wait!

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.290
You'll just catch their stupid
if you keep talking to them.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.420
But world peace!

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.920
He was worried, so he came to check on her

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.590
Stop getting in the way, Blackbell girl!

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.590
No, wait.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.340
As I recall, Blackbell and the Desmond
Group are actually business partners.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.480
Could this girl be under orders from an enemy
organization to put a stop to our mission?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.190
No, calm down. That's not possible.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.240
First impressions are the most important thing
when forming a group of friends at school.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.950
They must make amends today, no matter what.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.210
You know...

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.750
Hm.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.000
That's the girl who got violent, right?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.750
How scary! So barbaric.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.340
Is the girl next to her another delinquent?

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.800
She just hit him out of nowhere
without a reason, right? That's nuts.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.350
I don't want to be in the same class as her.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.680
What if she hits me, too?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.310
I can't believe she came to
school. Talk about a pain.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.100
School is scary...

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.980
People are so shallow.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.570
They can only judge what's on the surface.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.490
Are you a smart person, Rich Girl?

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.820
Aw, I wouldn't say that.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.530
And call me Becky, not "Rich Girl."

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.080
All right, be seated.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.160
I hope we become the best of friends.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.830
I'm the only one who knows
how good you are, Anya.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.880
Honestly, people like that are just...

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.880
We'd better stay away from them.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.420
School is scary,
but I think it might be okay.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.550
Hey, look! Isn't this cute?

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.970
Tch!

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.560
Why don't you give them a piece
of your mind, Lord Damian?

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.930
That's right. My name is Damian Desmond.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.060
All right, I'm calling the roll. Abel.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.060
As one of the sons of a prestigious family,
I was born into a life of privilege.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.770
Here.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.520
Alice.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.140
Here.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.440
Edward.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.060
Here.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.150
No one had ever defied me before.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.690
Damian.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.190
Yikes, the Desmond Group's chairman's son.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.650
I've never even been hit
by my older brother.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.320
Mr. Desmond.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.240
And yet...

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.490
Mr. Desmond.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.280
Here.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.450
Conner.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.530
This is the first time I've
had to deal with such...

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.370
Here.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.200
George.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.580
With such...

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.830
Here.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.160
With such...

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.160
Herman.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.000
Here.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
With such...

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Sara.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.910
Here.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.920
Johnny.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.580
Here.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.670
Jesse.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.380
Here.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.590
Carl.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.420
Here.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.050
Well, today will be our first lesson,

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.340
so before we begin...

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.470
This is the starting line for all of you who
worked so hard to get into this school...

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.340
Math Class

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.600
As you can see in this example,
when this and this are like this...

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.730
And that's why this turns out
like this, and this is... this.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.520
So you get this answer by doing this...

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.360
And if you get this answer, you can use the
same method to get the answer over here.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.900
She had the nerve to fall asleep
in first period on her first day.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.860
Is she actually a delinquent?

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.870
How scary.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.160
Anya!

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.080
We have science class next. Wake up!

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.660
Second son!

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.870
I have to apologize to the second son.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.500
Second son? You mean Damian?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.210
He already left.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.130
And just leave that loser alone.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.470
But peace will be in trouble if
I don't apologize to the second son.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.890
You mean it'll put a damper
on your peaceful school life?

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.220
I mean, yeah... Who knows
what that boy will try to do?

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.060
But don't worry.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.730
I'm on your side, Anya!

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.320
I'll protect you, no matter what.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.650
Oh, it's okay, then.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.940
Yes.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.410
No, it's not!

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.490
Papa?!

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.040
I need a way to tell her how
important that apology is!

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.040
As you can see, you can reflect
the sun's rays using a mirror.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.750
Science Class

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.500
The spot where the light hits will feel warm.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.630
Next, let's try an experiment
using two mirrors.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.050
It is good to apologize today.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.340
Is that you, God?!

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.050
We will use the other mirror to
reflect the light from earlier.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.770
Apologize, Anya. Reconcile with him.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.230
I suddenly feel this intense pressure.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.110
"And that's when John made up his mind.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.940
Language Class

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:12.400
Even if he were to be left out,
he was going to see his beliefs through.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.370
And then John never apologized
to anyone ever again."

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.990
"But then John reflected upon his actions"

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.160
"and thought, 'Sometimes, it's just
better to admit you're wrong and get along with others.'"

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.370
My textbook seems different
from everyone else's...

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.170
Lunchtime

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.170
It's finally time for lunch.
Let's go to the cafeteria.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.630
I guess this really is a prestigious school.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.170
We're getting pretty brutal
lessons from day one.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.800
I'm exhausted.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:49.400
New students, you can order
whatever you'd like for lunch.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.730
Cafeteria

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.070
Huh... Well, they're nowhere
near as talented as my chef.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.070
Anya wants omelet rice.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.570
What a bizarre dish.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.460
Second son!

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.790
Ew, go eat in your dorm.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.890
I have to apologize.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.090
No, you don't.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.760
They're the ones at fault.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.300
That stupid little brat!

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.220
That's it. I need to get her away from Anya.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.640
Hey, newbie! Where are you going?!

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.130
Becky Blackbell from Class 1-3.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.110
Come to the student hall
in Tower A immediately.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.190
Huh? But I'm still eating.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.040
Now!

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.030
Ugh!

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.740
Now's my chance to apologize.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.490
Wh-What do you want?! You wanna fight again?

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.580
Umâ€”

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.470
If you hadn't sucker punched him,
Lord Damian never would've lost to you!

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.500
Um...

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.150
Shut up, you two.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.260
Huh? I see. You're going to
personally give her what for!

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.660
Why do I find it so hard to
speak when she's in front of me?

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.870
Lord Damian?

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.960
What is this awkward sensation
I'm feeling in my chest?

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.030
I feel a weird chill. I better
apologize quick, then run away.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.950
Knowing Lord Damian,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:29.030
I'm sure he's finding the absolute perfect
insults to rip this little girl to shreds!

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.290
I wonder what he'll go for? "Shrimp"?

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.050
No, that is far too meek.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.170
Super uggo? Raccoon face?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.420
Um...

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.920
Violent gorilla girl?

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.550
I...

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.050
She's even got those lame hair
things that look like horns.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.890
Y-Yesterday...

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.080
Your momma's so fat...

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.180
You've got stubby little legs.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.390
Stubby little legs!

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.810
She's even got those lame hair
things that look like horns.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.650
Raccoon-faced commoner!

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.730
You'll get your filthy commoner germs on us.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.980
Go away, you stubby little raccoon.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.190
With stubby little legs...

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.110
Stubby little legs!

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.110
I'm... um...

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.950
I'm r-really sorry...

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.740
that I suddenly hit you yesterday!

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.870
I just wanted...

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.470
to be friends with you.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.090
I'm sorry...

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.180
for having stubby little legs.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.610
Sh-She felt so bad that
she's actually bawling?!

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.930
She's so demure.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.680
I guess I didn't really need to interfere.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.940
Well done, Anya. Good job apologizing.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.980
Lord Damian, your face is bright red.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.440
That's just because... I'm enraged!

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.780
I would never...

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.360
That's right. She defied me! Right to my face!

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:46.820
Yes...

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.750
She came right up to me...

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.120
Stared deep into my eyes...

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.210
N-No! That's not what's going on!

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.080
Stop pounding, my stupid heart!

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.750
She's a commoner! I would never...

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.340
No, never!

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.200
That's just too embarrassing.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.810
Damn it all! I'd rather
die than ever admit it!

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.150
I will never forgive you!
My pride will not allow it!

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.280
Well said, Lord Damian!
A woman's tears cannot sway him!

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.900
We'll let you off the hook for today.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.490
Lord Damian!

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.360
Her apology... was completely rejected?!

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.130
Plan B is done for.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.550
By the way, why are we running?

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.890
Shut up!

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:53.930
Relationship with Damian:

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.260
School is... scary.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.930
Becky!

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:59.840
Who was it?! Who the heck called me out here?!

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.690
Tower A Student Hall

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.800
That makes the denominator three,
and you get one-third.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.190
Which means you have three thirds,
which is equal to one.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.670
Simple, right?

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.920
L-Loid, why don't you both take a break?

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.000
Absolutely not. She has to learn
at least this much by today.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.350
The incident with Damian the other day...

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.930
The "Friendship Scheme" that was meant
to bring us closer to the Desmonds...

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.010
I will never forgive you!

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.930
completely fell apart.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.750
Which means we need to go with
the orthodox method of Plan A,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.880
and boost its chances of
success as much as possible.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.530
If you don't finish this, you don't get
to watch your spy cartoon tonight.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.070
Well? What's the answer here?

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.890
I'll finish this quick by reading Papa's mind.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.260
Come on. You use this formula here...

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.240
In order to get the Stella needed
to become an Imperial Scholar,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.570
there are other methods
such as excelling in sports

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:58.040
If her grades deviate too much from the norm, it might make people suspicious, which would make the school wary of her, and the Desmonds...
There are other methods such as excelling in sports or doing community service, But in order to halt getting Tonitrus Bolts from bad
grades or being expelled from them, we need to get her academic skills up so she can get stable grades. If Anya puts in the effort...
Carelessly becoming someone else in order to infiltrate and get close to someone is risky. If the worst happens, WISE won't keep
quiet, since they're already on high alert against Western spies. Which means we basically need to proceed with caution...
I could enter the faculty room and alter documents, though honestly, the most absolute way to
get to the social gathering is to infiltrate it, but over the past few years, fellow agents have...
But as far as the process goes, the best way to maximize academic efficiency within the family...

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.910
or doing community service.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.320
But in order to halt getting
Tonitrus Bolts from bad grades

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.780
Though honestly, the most absolute
way to get to the social gathering

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.460
or being expelled from them,
we need to get her academic skills up.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.100
is to infiltrate it, but over the
past few years, fellow agents have...

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.120
I could enter the faculty room
and alter documents...

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.120
Are you all right, Miss Anya?!

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.340
I will read Mama's mind.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.800
Mama, this question...

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.290
Let's think it over together.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.530
Let's see... The denominator is five,
so that's one split into five.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.840
Um... To make this easier to understand,

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.440
let's rip all four limbs off of a torso...

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.430
Oh, but then the head gets in the way.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.160
Huh? Um...

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.880
Five... Five?

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.910
Doesn't a five look like an S?

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.320
Are you all right, Miss Anya?!

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.310
What's wrong? Well? Why can't you solve this?

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.110
I honestly can't figure out
what it is she can't understand.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.250
I don't wanna study!

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.830
Hey, wait a minute!

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.390
L-Loid...

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.500
I don't think it's a good idea to
be too forceful at times like this.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.140
Yes, but she needs to study more
to become an Imperial Scholar.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.590
But is that something she wants for herself?

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.390
Well...

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.350
That's actually for my mission.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.990
I would really like Miss Anya
to enjoy going to school.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.500
Of course, she may need to study
so that she doesn't get expelled.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.110
Yes... You're right.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.020
She's still very young,

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.990
so getting good grades is
probably the least of her worries.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.930
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.880
I shouldn't butt into
another family's affairs.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.380
No, it's quite all right. Thank you, Yor.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.650
I do lose my composure with her at times.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.280
I'm sure other parents go
through the same thing.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.860
Let's take a break.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.110
I'll make us some tea.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.320
Anya, we made you some hot cocoa.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.890
And now she's holed up in her room.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.340
I guess she's sulking now.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.980
I'm gonna do my best in school!

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.300
She reminds me of my little
brother when he was small.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.050
She'll come out eventually.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.610
By the way, your brother works for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, right?

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.300
He must have a brilliant academic record.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.360
Did you help him with his homework?

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.390
If you have any tips for me...

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.660
Oh, no. Yuri was a much more
capable child than I was.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.950
I'm embarrassed to admit it, but he
probably taught me more than I taught him.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.270
Whenever we'd study together...

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.620
No, Sis. Spiders actually aren't insects.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.200
Insects have six legs,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.990
and their bodies are split up between
their head, thorax, and abdomen.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.490
Wow... You're so knowledgeable, Yuri.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.990
Whenever I complimented him,
his smile would light up the room.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.680
Sis! Next, I'll teach you history!

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.220
S-Sure...

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.380
He must've enjoyed teaching me things,

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.950
because he'd always study on his
own even when I left him alone.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.710
Sis, wake up! I learned
my times tables! Listen!

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.850
Mrfh...

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.830
I see. So part of his motivation
was earning your praise.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.020
I'm not so sure about that,

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:22.040
but if that is the case, perhaps you can
be someone like that for Miss Anya.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.540
It might be worth it to praise
her for the smallest things.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.000
I think that'll make Miss Anya happy.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.370
Well... I'm not so sure about that.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.770
I'm not her real father, after all.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.690
Wait, no.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.230
That's right. I need to be the ideal father.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.270
I need to play that part.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.030
That was the foundation of this mission.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.540
But up until now, nothing has been ideal,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.470
and as a father, I've been...

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.790
It's all right.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.730
Please be more confident in yourself.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.980
Don't you remember what Miss Anya said?

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.790
That we're a perfect 100 points.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.930
To Miss Anya, you're a wonderful father.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.550
I'm grateful to hear you say that.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.540
Oh, no. I butted in as a stranger again.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.090
No, Yor.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.320
You're not a stranger, nor part
of someone else's family.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.060
Right now, you're the
mother of the Forgers.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.330
I'm counting on you to provide
whatever I'm lacking.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.350
Th-That's right. I'm actually someone's wife.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.830
Don't say things like that
when we're out of the house.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.860
It would be great if you could
look over Anya's homework, too.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.380
Of course, if you think I can be of help.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.960
Let's take our time and do our best together.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.060
That's right. Don't panic, Twilight.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.110
If this could be ended by
assassinating Desmond alone,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.760
there would be countless methods,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.770
but that won't get us to a true solution.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.740
Nothing goes well in a short amount of time.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.170
You need to know what your target
is thinking, what they desire,

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.440
then gain their trust and get close to
them so you can keep an eye on them.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.490
Completing such mundane missions that
require patience makes a true spy.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.280
First, I need to truly understand Anya.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.690
Oh, look at the time.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.830
I'll go have a chat with Anya.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.630
Then I'll go ahead and do the dishes.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.840
Hey, Anya. Your spy show's about to start.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.060
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.590
Let's watch your show first,

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.040
and then we can figure out
what to do about your studies.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.990
Anya?

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.480
She fell asleep.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.160
You're going to catch a cold.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.230
She was studying on her own?

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.920
I have to get the best grades
on my tests for Papa...

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.250
I guess I'll just record that show for her.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.680
No, Mama. You can't kill Papa...

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.770
What exactly is she dreaming about?

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.970
Zzz...

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.920
A wonderful father, huh?

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.820
I wonder what it'd feel
like to have a real family.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.830
Heya, Yuri! Working hard, I see!

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.780
Oh, it's been a while, Dominic.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.420
I've been so busy with work that
I haven't been home at all.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.360
Elites at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
sure are cut from a different cloth.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.830
Oh, yeah. Dominic, how was
the party the other day?

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.370
What was the guy my sister went with like?

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.540
Oh, Yor's...

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.540
Ah... Actually, congrats, by the way.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.940
Wait, you haven't met him yet?

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.050
Huh?

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.500
My sister got married?

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.710
