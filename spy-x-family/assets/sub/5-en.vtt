00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.720
Today is the day.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.500
Hm? For what?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.990
You have to ask?

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.470
It's the day Eden College announces
the admissions results.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.950
The results should be posted
at 1200 hours today.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.260
This is more nerve-racking
than I thought it'd be.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.360
My bracelet just broke.
Why did it have to happen today?

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.420
Oh, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.910
L-Loid, look.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.070
Oh, come on, Yor. Black cats being
unlucky is just a superstition.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.910
Y-You're right.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.140
Papa...

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.900
What's the matter?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.810
I just stepped in poop.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.420
Admissions results for Eden College?

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.700
Ah, the thing we've got Agent Twilight doing.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.540
Chief, peace between the East
and West hangs on Operation Strix.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.430
Please take this more seriously.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.830
You don't know Twilight very well, do you?

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.250
C-Correct, sir.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.460
Underwear:

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.440
He might just be the best spy in all
of Westalis, so don't worry so much.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.800
He'll be telling us that "the sakura
blossoms bloom" soon enough.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.410
What does that mean, sir?

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.680
It's a code phrase from the Far East.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.810
It means they passed.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.600
It's not there.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.730
WILL THEY PASS OR FAIL?

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.550
We failed...

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.360
We failed...

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.230
We failed.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.500
L-Let's head home.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.360
I-I'll make us some tea.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.620
I'm sorry... It's all because I stepped in poop.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.870
A moment, Forgers.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.490
Master Henderson...

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.000
What is this?

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.340
Look at the very top.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.640
Anya Forger...

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.130
That is the waiting list of successful
applicants, though rather confidential.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.460
A waiting list?

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.680
Correct. Once her overall scores were tallied,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.090
Anya Forger placed first on that waiting list.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.270
If any of the current successful
applicants were to withdraw,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.650
she'll immediately get into the school.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.900
B-But after what we did...

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.570
Do you know what the number one killer
of our species on this planet is?

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.190
Huh?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.960
It is the mosquito!

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.910
Yes. You saved Master Swan from
that brutal killer back there.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.140
That brought your score up tremendously.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.850
That's insane.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.380
Stand proud, Forger.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.880
Your family is worthy of our school.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.280
So if even one person withdraws,
Miss Anya will get in?

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.370
Correct.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.340
But if no one withdraws...

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.700
Now, about that...

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.130
Th-The Thorn Princess?

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.850
What are you doing here?

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.110
Secretary Zachry Feiss, I presume?

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.740
If it's not too much trouble,
I will be taking your life.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.870
Please, no! Spare me!

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.250
I have a son who's just about to turn six!

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.770
He'll be starting at Eden College next month!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.670
If I die, he won't be able to go to school!

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.170
I'm terribly sorry, but that's
exactly why I'm doing this.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.700
Huh?!

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.840
For the sake of Miss Anya
getting into the school...

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.020
I need you to die!

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.740
You mustn't, Yor!

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.660
You mustn't take the life
of an innocent person, Yor!

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.680
Yor?

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.030
Oh, it's nothing.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.330
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Zachry Feiss.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.750
Well, no matter.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.020
There are a few that withdraw every year.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.440
Make sure you are properly
prepared for the eventuality.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.070
Thank you very much, Master Henderson.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.700
I must warn you that I may not be
teaching here by the time you arrive.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.370
What?

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.750
I was forced to give that
swine a good thrashing.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.430
I was able to protect Eden's honor,
but who know what ramifications await me?

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.280
That foolish man and this instructor...

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.430
I'm not sure which one will be
more useful to me in my mission,

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.250
but if that fool stands in my way,
I have plenty of ways to destroy him.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.020
Please let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.090
I appreciate the attempt at
consolation, my elegant boy.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.060
Just await that call at home.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.520
3
Days
Later

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.670
Anya will be accepted...
Anya will be accepted...

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.630
Anya will be accepted...
Anya will be accepted...

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.830
What in the world is she doing?

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.990
Apparently, she's performing a prayer
dance to help her get accepted.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.230
Anya will be accepted...

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.990
Oh... I see.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.990
Kieeeeeeeh!

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.930
Hello, Forger residence.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.570
Yes.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.240
Yes.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.670
Goodbye.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.530
Anya got in!

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.110
Papa! I passed!

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.930
You did a great job, Anya!

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.950
I did it!

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.380
Oh, thank goodness! What wonderful news!

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.680
I'm so happy!

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.710
Thank you for all you did as well, Yor.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.980
Heya. I heard she got in.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.400
Time to celebrate!

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.980
You sure found out fast.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.290
Never underestimate an informant.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.540
Oh, you must be the missus.
Pleasure to meet you!

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.000
I'm Loid's friend, Franky!

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.050
Hello.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.200
Scruffy-scruff!

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.040
Let's get this party started! I got
some booze, and I ordered delivery!

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.000
Who do you think you are?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.270
This is all thanks to me
stealing the answer sheet.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.220
You idiot! They'll hear you!

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.540
Huh? Wha wuz zat?

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.000
Are you even drinking, you party pooper?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.730
Leave me be.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.360
Isn't it great, Anya?

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.720
Daddy said he'll buy you anything
as a reward just for today!

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.890
Hey! Don't go promising her things like that!

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.870
I don't want you to buy me anything,
but I wanna do something!

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.410
Hm? What's that?

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.240
I don't mind as long as it's doable.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.420
Save me, Bondman!

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.730
Good morning, Bondman.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.040
Your mission today is to save
the kidnapped Princess Honey,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.690
and take her back the castle.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.090
Wait for me, Princess Honey!

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.520
The kingdom's best spy infiltrates the castle...

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.890
Bondman!

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.900
Taking down any enemy that stands in his way,

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.770
he finally makes it to the princess.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.490
I'm here to save you, Princess Honey!

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.830
Bondman!

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.180
Peace was restored to the castle,
and their love continued to grow.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.500
This is what I wanna do.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.640
What you wanna do? Wait, you mean...

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.980
I wanna play "save Anya from the castle"!

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.950
Nope. Not happening.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.990
How cruel... You meanie!

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.040
I'm not going to school if you don't do this!

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.920
No one asked you to speak for her.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.050
Oh, hey. I'm pretty sure that's Newston Castle.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.970
I heard it was recently remodeled
into some cartoon's theme park,

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.110
but that's definitely it.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.600
It's got the same kinds of
tricks and traps seen in the show,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.970
and you can even rent it out.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.290
The government doesn't have any
eyes over there, Loidy Boy,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.780
so it wouldn't hurt to have a little bit of fun.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.920
But...

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.400
After everything she went through to pass, too.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.620
Doesn't seem fair if you can't get
some kind of reward, huh, kiddo?

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.440
Sniffle, sniffle...

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.620
Sniffle, sniffle.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.550
Sniffle...

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.360
All right, fine.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.180
Right, then! Let's strike while the iron's hot!

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.560
Leave the castle reservation to me.
You're in charge of our ride!

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.260
Wha?! You expect us to go today?

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.830
And you want <i>me</i> to arrange this?

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.990
Well, of course! It's for your daughter!

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.350
We have a message from Twilight.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.770
Code GO005.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.650
He did it.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.020
"The sakura blossoms bloom."

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.440
Another message from Twilight.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.210
What is it?

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.010
How shall I reply?

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.090
He might just be the best
spy in all of Westalis...

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.650
Get him what he needs at once!

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.510
Yes, ma'am!

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.760
To Falcon in the Rhynnick region.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.170
Emergency operation from Twilight.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.650
Falcon here. Roger the emergency
operation from Twilight, over.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.400
"1830 hours... Meet downstream on the
Nein River in the Rhynnick region."

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.680
They sure didn't waste any time.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.990
Believe it or not, this castle can do this, too!

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.910
I'm gonna make a quiz!

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.440
Hey, great idea!

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.860
You seriously came through!

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.400
Anya's never been on a
plane before! It's so exciting!

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.710
Nice, nice, nice!

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.910
There we go.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.880
Does Anya look cool?

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.630
Yes, you do.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:11.300
Loid! Where did you get this li'l plane?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.130
It's amazing!

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.800
Oh, some wonderful coworkers of
mine are letting me borrow it.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.480
Fank you for always looking
after my husband.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.590
You all have your seatbelts on? Here we go.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.890
Let's go!

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.700
I'm so excited!

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.270
Yahoo!

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.830
Oh, it's so pretty.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.670
It looks like a tweasure chest.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.800
Papa, you're amazing!

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.960
Look! There it is!

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.960
Holy crap!

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.840
The castle's so cool!

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.540
Hey, settle down!

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.130
We're about to land.
Make sure you're properly seated.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:19.740
We're in a castle!

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.020
You don't need to go running around with her!

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.480
This is wonderful.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.750
What's the matter?

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.530
Something's not right.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.250
What do you mean by that?

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.610
Can you truly call a castle
with no enemies or servants

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.760
a castle?

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.950
I'm sad.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.250
I don't think I can go to school now.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.250
I know, right? I can't blame ya, little missy.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.560
Daddy better step up his game.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.050
We have a report from Twilight.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.770
He's requesting agents.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.210
As many as possible.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.700
This will be a true test for WISE.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.470
To all agents in Ostania.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.740
Report to Newston Castle
for an emergency operation.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.410
This is an extremely important
assignment regarding Operation Strix.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.620
Mission rank is over SS.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.730
I repeat: this is an extremely important
assignment regarding Operation Strix.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.950
Mission rank is over SS!

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.420
That's the real Twilight...

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.630
I gotta get his autograph later.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.360
Look at your agency coming through for you.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.190
Well, give them the rundown.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.080
I'll explain the rest.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.180
All right, fine.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.810
Thank you very much for gathering
here today on behalf of my daughter.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.010
Morse code.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.790
"Just listen quietly."

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.660
Orders from Twilight!

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.890
I would like for all of you to
play the part of the enemies

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:51.250
This assignment is an imperative part of Operation Strix, and you do not to need to inquire further about it

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.700
of a spy who is coming to save a princess.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.400
I have absolutely no idea what's going on...

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.010
But this is Twilight we're talking about.
I'm sure this is all according to plan.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.090
This man will explain the details. Follow his orders from now on

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.240
Thank you again for doing
this for my daughter.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.280
All right! Let's announce the cast!

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.580
Here's our star for today!

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.110
Princess Anya!

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.960
This is the spy person who's gonna save me!

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.480
Loidman!

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.230
And the big bad boss!

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.540
Scruffy!

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.730
Count Scruffy Head!

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.490
And Mama... um...

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.910
can be whatever.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.890
Shock!

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.380
And now...

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.190
to the very capable subordinates
of Count Scruffy Head!

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.150
I need you all to put on
your best performances

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.960
and get in Loidman's
way as much as possible!

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.260
Uh... wait...

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.530
This mission ranking is over SS.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.380
I'll make any sacrifice necessary
to see this mission through!

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.460
I couldn't ask for a better
opponent than Twilight!

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.710
This day has finally come...

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:50.030
You can all decide for yourselves how
you're going to get in Loidman's way.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:54.890
I am not exaggerating when I say the
success of this plan is in your hands!

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.150
Uh... Where is this going?

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.730
My loyal minions!

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.990
Make Loidman suffer as much as
possible for Princess Anya's sake!

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.640
Once you're all prepared,
get to your positions!

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.520
Roger!

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.570
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!
Princess Anya is mine!

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.960
If you want her back, come after me!

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.690
Save me, Loidman.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.540
Wait, it's already started?!

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.400
Hey!

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:38.020
Loidman! You are about to face many
obstacles in order to get the princess back!

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.000
First up,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.020
we have a quiz that the princess made
up in this courtyard, so listen up!

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.770
If you can't answer correctly,
you'll be putting that on!

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.490
This is...

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.240
You betcha! A Bondman costume set!

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.240
So exciting!

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:53.980
Okay, question time!

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.610
What does Princess Anya like about Bondman?!

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.780
Huh? His face?

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.830
Bzzz! The fact that he has
a pistol with a silencer!

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.040
What? Really?!

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.630
Oh, come on! You're her dad
and you don't even know that?

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.170
Next question!

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.860
What's Anya's favorite food?

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:13.430
Peanuts!

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.750
Ooh! Correct!

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.860
Tch. Guess that was too easy.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.950
Here's the final question!

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.020
If you get it wrong, you'll be
changing into that outfit, Loidman!

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.950
That's <i>if</i> I don't get it.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.020
Here's your question, then.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.640
What does Anya want right now?

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.460
What does she want right now?

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.630
Five! Four!

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.530
You didn't say anything about a time limit!

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.000
I never said there wouldn't be one, either.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.370
Calm down. What does Anya want right now?

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.680
What does she want...

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.210
Bondman's spy gear!

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.920
What's the correct answer, Princess Anya?!

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.510
Right now...

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.530
I'm thirsty, so I'd like some water, please!

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.320
Looks like you're wrong, Loidman!

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.440
How the hell would I know that?!

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.990
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.180
Too bad for you, Loidman!

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.940
Now, let's have you keep your word!

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.860
I'm <i>so</i> excited...

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.190
to see the <i>real</i> Loidman!

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.710
Loidman!

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.860
All right, then! On to the next stage!

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.290
Hey, wait!

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.110
Loidman!

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.820
If you want to save Princess Anya,
you'll have to make your way up here!

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.620
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.760
He's so cool!

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.520
He's just so amazing...

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.120
You're so cool, Loidman!

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.810
We're just getting started, scruff!

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.810
Oh, no. Save me.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.900
God, this is pain.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.990
Loidman! Up here, up here!

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.660
I'm right here!

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.100
There's no end to this.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.930
This is so cool!

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.360
You've got this, my minions!
Don't let him win!

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.300
Loid! Let them hit you, damn it!

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.020
Now you've done it, you bastard!

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.420
Don't think you're gonna catch us that easily!

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.800
Buh-bye!

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.280
Save me, Loidman.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.790
You're so amazing, Loidman!

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.010
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!
I'm impressed you got this far, Loidman!

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.760
But I won't let you have the princess!

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.330
Save me, Loidman!

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.640
Are you seriously telling me
I have to act out this embarrassing

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.230
little play in front of all of these agents?

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.570
But in the end... this is for the mission!

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.290
H... Hand over the princess.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.200
Ooh!

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.190
I can't believe we get to see
Twilight's acting skills in person!

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.120
You fool! You think I'd
hand her over that easily?!

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.110
Now, go! The most powerful
witch in the world, Yorticia!

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.200
Finish off that fool, scruff!

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.000
Now there's a witch?!

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.760
What the hell is going on in this story?

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.520
Huh?

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.700
Wai—no way. What?!

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.980
Anyone who tries to kidnap Miss Anya...

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.110
will not get away alive!

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.330
Y-Yor, please calm down.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.070
Why is she using physical
attacks when she's a witch?

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:26.920
She's strong!

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.070
She's gonna kill me!

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.200
Yor... Are you all right?

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.690
Scruffy, scruffy, scruffy, scruff!

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.470
Excellent work getting this far, Loidman!

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.440
But you won't defeat me that easil—

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.810
So exciting!

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.850
I... I've come to save you, Princess Anya.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.460
Papa!

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.600
Wait... I'm supposed to be your dad in this?

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.490
So sparkly!

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.800
Congratulations, Anya!

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.010
Anya...

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.960
Congratulations...

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.090
What is this?

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.990
I've had so much excitement
ever since I left the orphanage!

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.400
It's all thanks to you, Papa!

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.820
Hm? Oh... I'm happy for you.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.200
I'm gonna do my best in school!

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.070
That's good.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.970
Well, anyway... congratulations
on getting into the school.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.350
Sir, the expense report from Agent Twilight.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.480
Are these numbers real?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.960
Yes, they are.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.690
But...

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.430
They are correct.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.700
Mission Report

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.700
Operation Strix

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.700
Phase 1: School Admission achieved

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.620
THE FRIENDSHIP SCHEME
