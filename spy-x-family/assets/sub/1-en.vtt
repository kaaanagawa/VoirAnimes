WEBVTT

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:05.173
How much longer to the embassy?

00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:08.801
About 20 minutes.

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.679
Huh? The brakes…

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:15.099
Hey! You! Watch the road!

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:21.105
One of our country's diplomats

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.108
was killed in an accident in Ostania.

00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:25.526
The authorities believe

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.113
it was an assassination
by a far-right party in the East.

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:34.076
They are planning a war against Westalis.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.830
We must find out what they are planning.

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:39.081
Let's leave it to him.

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.084
One of our most skilled agents.

00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:43.628
Twilight.

00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:47.089
Here are the photos as promised.

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:49.759
Proof that the Minister
of Foreign Affairs wears a wig.

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:50.843
Here are the negatives.

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:56.182
Good work. This will force him to resign.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:58.100
I'll be counting on you again.

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:01.813
Hey.

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:05.691
I'll have you hand over the items
as promised.

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:08.110
But… Just now…!

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.532
I've been fooled!

00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:14.367
The codename is Twilight.

00:01:15.493 --> 00:01:17.078
He was a spy.

00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:25.086
When countries worldwide were battling
a discrete yet fierce information war,

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:27.547
this man survived on the battlefield

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.216
by using 100 different faces.

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:36.722
And Dad's taking it out on me that the
pictures of him in his wig were stolen.

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.766
I just don't get it! He pisses me off.

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.810
Are you even listening, Robert?

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.271
Oh, how unfortunate.

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:49.151
Hey, Robert. What do you say we…

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:51.612
-Karen, let's break up.
-What?!

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:54.824
-There's no intelligence in your stories.
-Huh?

00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:56.826
Well then. I hope you find happiness.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.289
Wait, Robert! That came out of nowhere!
Robert!

00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:05.293
Sorry, Karen, but I no longer have
business with you or your father.

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:08.296
Tonight will be the end
of my alias as Robert.

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:11.674
Marriage? As happy as humanly possible?

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:13.426
I disposed of my attachment to such things

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.470
along with my identity card
the day I became a spy.

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:30.401
An arbitrary encryption.

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:34.196
The train on track five will
soon depart for Berlint.

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:40.578
Hello, or good evening, Twilight.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.955
Good work earlier.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.291
That saved the minister's life

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.710
and helped our country.

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:50.254
Now, onto the next assignment.

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:54.925
The target is Donovan Desmond.
A member of the National Equality Party.

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.720
He is a threat to
the peace of the metropolitan capital.

00:02:57.803 --> 00:02:59.847
Your mission is to get close to him

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.266
and find out his unsettling movements.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.519
To do this, you must first get married
and have a child.

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:07.605
Huh?

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:11.484
Desmond is cautious
and doesn't often show his face in public.

00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:14.528
The only time he appears is at

00:03:14.612 --> 00:03:17.782
the regular social gatherings
held at his son's prestigious school.

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:21.327
It has become a social gathering place
for political and business tycoons.

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:24.955
You must enroll your child in this school

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.083
and infiltrate the social gatherings.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.585
Since the deadline for enrollment
is approaching,

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.462
you'll be given one week.

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.256
He wants me to have a child in seven days?

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:38.344
Pardon me.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:40.972
Operation Strix.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.598
This operation will protect

00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:45.434
the peace between East and West,
and ultimately, the world.

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:47.770
Heroes of the dark.

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.773
The work you agents do,
will never see the light of day.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:55.277
No medals will be awarded, nor will you be
featured in the newspaper.

00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:59.532
But don't forget that people's
daily lives depend on your work.

00:04:01.242 --> 00:04:02.410
Fine.

00:04:02.994 --> 00:04:05.538
I, Twilight,
got rid of both my name and face.

00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.957
I'll portray a father figure with a child.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:11.210
All for a better world.

00:04:12.253 --> 00:04:15.548
&lt;=eptitle&gt;MISSION:1
OPERATION STRIX

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:18.592
This is the family room.

00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:22.555
Fully furnished, air-conditioned,
and… Um, sir?

00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:24.223
No wiretaps

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:26.350
and escape routes can be secured.

00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:27.518
I'll take it.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.187
Then Mr. Forger, may I have your signature
on this document?

00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:34.191
Loid Forger. Occupation, psychiatrist.

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:36.277
That'll be my new life.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.613
A family that I love. A happy home life.

00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:42.116
How wonderful. A new home for your family.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.452
Is your child a boy or a girl?

00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:47.204
Oh, that's yet to be decided.

00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:48.289
Huh?

00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:51.292
What a huge load for a spy.

00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.797
Huh? You want to be a foster parent?

00:04:56.881 --> 00:05:01.260
Yes. I heard that children can be
adopted from this orphanage.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:02.803
-My wife and I are having…
-Sure.

00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:07.058
-Take whichever one you like. Come on in.
-Uh…

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.101
What an awful environment.

00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:11.812
But the more underground
an institution is,

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:14.065
the more children
with unknown backgrounds,

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:16.567
and that's more convenient for
falsifying their backgrounds.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.819
This assignment will be work
if I have a kid.

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:22.198
If it were up to me, I'd do it all myself,

00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:25.034
but even though
I'm the best spy in Westalis,

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:27.078
I can't turn myself into a child.

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:31.207
Um, if possible, I'm looking for a child
who can read and write.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.583
In that case…

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.376
Hey, Anya!

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.088
She's the smartest one here. She
doesn't talk much but she's a good kid.

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.591
She's a creepy kid.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.052
I hope he takes her.

00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:45.137
Come on, say hello.

00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:46.972
Um, excuse me.

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.976
The age of entry for
Eden Academy is six years old.

00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:53.813
She can't be more than four or five.

00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:55.231
-Six!
-Hm?

00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:56.357
Six.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.484
You are six years old?

00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:01.278
But her height…

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.492
A newspaper?

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.410
A crossword puzzle?

00:06:08.494 --> 00:06:10.913
Isn't that a little difficult for a child?

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.625
Although for me,
this is nothing but child's play.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.502
One down is "homeostasis."

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.420
One across is "casual closure."

00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:21.173
Under that is
"symplectic homomorphic mapping."

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:27.221
She finished it? Seriously?!

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.431
How intelligent!

00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:32.309
She'll easily be able to
pass the entrance exam.

00:06:32.393 --> 00:06:33.227
I'll take her.

00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:36.063
-What forms do I need to fill out?
-No worries.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.065
Just take her already.

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:41.902
Child-bearing mission complete.
It's going so well that I'm worried.

00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:43.320
Are you okay with that?

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:47.366
Spy? Mission? How exciting!

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.827
The girl was a telepath.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.162
Test subject 007.

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:54.915
The girl had the power to read
people's minds.

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:58.252
She was born unintentionally
through an experiment done by

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.337
an unknown organization, but she ran away.

00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:03.340
She moved from place to place
seeking protection.

00:07:03.424 --> 00:07:04.425
Listen, little girl.

00:07:04.508 --> 00:07:06.844
-Anya.
-Listen, Anya.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.888
You'll be my daughter starting today,

00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:12.766
but we'll tell people that
you're my biological daughter. Okay?

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.684
Yeah.

00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:16.854
Make sure to call me Father.

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:18.856
-Father.
-Good.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.568
What a cute little girl! Hello.

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.278
We're the Forgers. We moved in today.

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.864
I'm Anya, my father's daughter
from long ago.

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:28.115
Oh?

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:29.491
Don't say unnecessary things.

00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:31.368
Come on. Let's go inside.

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.537
Is this Anya's home?

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:35.623
-Yeah.
-A television!

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.083
You can turn it on.

00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:40.628
Adventure anime Spy Wars!

00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.546
Anya likes this!

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.424
Of course you do.

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.843
A pistol with a silencer…

00:07:47.927 --> 00:07:48.761
How exciting!

00:07:48.844 --> 00:07:51.972
-I'll make sure to get it back!
-I have to go get some essentials.

00:07:52.056 --> 00:07:54.350
-I won't go easy on you!
-And her fake identification papers.

00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:55.392
I'm going to go out.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.394
Stay here and watch that.

00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:00.481
Adventure!

00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:02.524
It's not an adventure!
I'm just going shopping.

00:08:06.904 --> 00:08:09.573
Anya wants a pistol
that doesn't make a sound!

00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:11.033
Fine, if they have one.

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:15.537
Blending in and acting normal
is the essence of being a spy.

00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.290
We have to look like
an ordinary parent and child.

00:08:18.374 --> 00:08:20.793
-Ding ding!
-Why are you standing out?

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:25.297
No, no. You have to hold her hand
since she's just a child. Here.

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:34.181
With one hand in use, I can't prepare
for an enemy attack, but, oh well.

00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:35.474
Enemy?!

00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:43.691
-What are you doing?
-Being vigilant.

00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:47.611
Did I do something for her to be vigilant?
Maybe it was too early to hold hands.

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:49.655
Does she not like me? This isn't good.

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:53.075
I have to maintain a good relationship
with her until the mission is over.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:56.078
I have to understand her.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:59.081
Understanding the other side
is the first step towards peace.

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:02.459
If he understands Anya,
the world will find peace?!

00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:07.673
-Anya likes peanuts but not carrots.
-Hm?

00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:10.009
-I like crunchy bacon!
-Oh.

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:14.263
A bakery doesn't mean crunchy bacon.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:17.016
I'd like to have this.

00:09:17.683 --> 00:09:20.394
You can't buy something
that's worth one dalc with ten pents.

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:27.067
Maybe she's not smart after all.

00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:28.819
Was the crossword just a coincidence?

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.571
Maybe I should find another child…

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:35.326
-Anya knew that!
-What's wrong?!

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:39.371
Anya will be useful…

00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:41.123
What should I do…

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.916
I'll buy you peanuts, so stop crying!

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:44.793
Peanuts!

00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:52.509
Father, Anya's tired.
I can't walk anymore…

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:56.972
It's no use. I don't understand

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.600
this irrational behavior.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:03.687
I need a manual to decipher it.

00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:07.691
Trust is the foundation to parenting.

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:11.195
Accept rather than scold.
See the child's perspective.

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:14.698
Children cannot express
their feelings well.

00:10:14.782 --> 00:10:16.825
Try to understand them.

00:10:16.909 --> 00:10:18.702
I guess I can't interrogate them.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:20.621
Parents around the world are

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:23.207
taking on such a difficult mission.

00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:27.002
"Develop self-esteem for their future."

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:31.006
"By giving them the ability to think
for themselves, they will be able to…"

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.512
I'll be returning her to the orphanage
once the assignment is over.

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.390
That's all there is to our relationship.

00:10:43.602 --> 00:10:47.981
No! Anya doesn't want to study!

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:51.318
I need to know your academic ability
for the exam.

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:54.446
Anya can take the test without studying.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.906
As long as I can read other people's…

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:56.824
people's minds…

00:10:57.408 --> 00:11:00.035
Are you planning on cheating? Listen.

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:01.453
If you don't pass, I'll…

00:11:01.537 --> 00:11:02.538
fail my assignment.

00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:08.001
Forget it.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.003
I'm going out.

00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:13.507
I'm not taking you with me today!

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.135
Absolutely not. Stay home.

00:11:21.974 --> 00:11:24.351
-Hey!
-I said no!

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.355
There! You think I won't see you?

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:30.983
There! There!

00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:34.444
Father finds me every time. How fun!

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.447
Now you won't be able to leave!

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.449
And that's why you're late?

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:43.453
I ultimately had to barricade the entrance
and lock her in.

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:46.415
I hope you don't get reported
for child abuse.

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.792
It's so difficult to know
what children are thinking.

00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:52.254
It's also frustrating how they think
that crying will solve everything.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.507
It's their job to cry, Twilight.

00:11:55.591 --> 00:11:57.968
Anyway, here's what you asked for.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.554
Application, exam voucher,
and the entrance exam questions.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:04.391
-It was hard to get those.
-Thanks, Franky.

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.060
I'm sure we'll get by if I have her
memorize the answers.

00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:09.021
Oh, and your daughter.

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:11.315
I dug up information
that wasn't at the orphanage.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.567
Nothing regarding her birth.

00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:16.111
Age and parents are unknown.

00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:18.530
There was only information
on this past year,

00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:20.949
but she was
returned from four foster homes.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.368
She even changed orphanages twice.

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:27.122
Anya Williams. Anya Levski. Anya Roche.

00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:31.168
So many name changes.
You two were meant for each other.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.087
I was only kidding.
This was for a mission right?

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.674
Even if she's a child, getting attached
won't do you any good.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:42.095
-Thanks for the warning.
-Hey! My payment!

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:43.931
Ugh.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.683
It's difficult to know
what spies are thinking too.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.693
How boring. This isn't what I imagined
a spy would be like.

00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:59.529
Anya wanted to take back a bomb.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:03.158
I can't have her messing with
my spy equipment, so I need to lock it.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:05.744
The number is six, one…

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:08.914
One, zero, a bomb!

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:17.172
A bomb!

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.676
Secret communication tool!

00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:23.679
Secret!

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:28.183
Boss! New communication
has been intercepted!

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:29.810
Is it a code from the West?

00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:32.145
No, just plain text.

00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.898
Um… Twilight is coming…

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:39.611
Twilight? These are the frequencies
used by the West organization.

00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:41.029
Oh, again!

00:13:41.113 --> 00:13:43.073
This way, ogre…

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.284
Hurry up and find the source!

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.543
Now that you know I'm a spy,
I'll have you disappear!

00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:58.630
I'll have to leave once he finds out

00:13:59.548 --> 00:14:00.757
Anya's a telepath…

00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:02.175
Anya,

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:05.637
don't tell anyone about your abilities.

00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:08.223
It's time to study, Anya.

00:14:08.307 --> 00:14:09.975
Anya wants to draw…

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.728
You don't have to do such childish things.

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.981
We need to use your power for world peace.

00:14:16.565 --> 00:14:18.150
There's no time for crying.

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:19.985
Stop playing and study.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:28.076
I hope she hasn't made a mess.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.579
That's right. I have to move this.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:54.895
Who are they?!

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.396
Anya?!

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:58.690
Anya?!

00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:01.860
Was she kidnapped?

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.696
By one of their members…? But why?

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:09.034
I need to find her right away. Keep calm.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:12.537
Looking at this situation,
the enemy found out that I'm a spy.

00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.247
I need to go into hiding right away.

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:16.041
And Anya…

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:20.671
There are plenty of other kids.
I'll just have to start over.

00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:25.801
Who is this kid?

00:15:26.802 --> 00:15:28.470
Is she Twilight's?

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:32.641
I don't know. We brought her since she
was in the room where the call originated.

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:33.975
This is because of that tool?

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:37.104
She built a barricade outside of the room
and was hiding.

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:38.063
Why outside?

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.147
Who knows?

00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:43.527
Fine. If we can use her as a hostage,
we'll use her as a shield

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.572
to make Twilight steal the wig directly
from the Foreign Minister.

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:48.657
Boss.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.867
Maybe we should just give up on the wig…

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:55.372
Transparency is important in politics.
Wigs aren't good.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.457
A pistol that doesn't make a sound!

00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:00.419
And the minister is
a sneaky traitor who is

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:01.586
biased to the West.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.381
Those who defend traitors
are also traitors.

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.884
A real bad person…

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:13.140
The men watching the house came back!

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:15.142
We got the man.

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:17.644
Good work.

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:22.149
His skills were not amateur.
He's a real one.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:23.734
Go rest over there.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:27.028
Now, now, Twilight.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.157
I'll have you return the photos you stole.

00:16:31.283 --> 00:16:32.159
Huh?

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.453
-What? He was just…
-The girl is gone!

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.413
He got us again!

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:40.584
I'm a fool. I'll be disqualified as a spy,
taking a risk like this and sneaking into

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:41.710
enemy territory!

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:44.337
Father… It's not him!

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.923
-Don't worry! I won't do anything.
-Father!

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.594
This is why kids are…

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.013
I see…

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:56.683
I'm starting to understand
why I get frustrated when kids cry.

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.811
It's because it reminds me of
when I was young.

00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:03.732
No one lent a helping hand.

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:07.319
All I could do was cry out of loneliness,
despair, and helplessness.

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:12.365
I thought I had abandoned my past, but I
was overlapping it with my childhood.

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.826
Not only that but…

00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:20.707
-Hey, little girl.
-Anya.

00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:22.209
Well, Anya,

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:25.879
we're professional "tag" players.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:30.342
When we see someone who seems to
have talent, we challenge them to a game.

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.385
Oh, Father's a liar.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.138
Listen. If you go straight here

00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:37.724
and turn right along the road,
you'll see a police station.

00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:42.312
If you give this to the police station,
you win. Understand?

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:45.774
If she shows this to them, she'll be
accepted into a better orphanage.

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.859
A plan cannot depend on children.

00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:49.611
-I'll have to rethink.
-Father…

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.738
Go on now! Hurry!

00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:55.575
Am I unqualified to be a spy?
That's not it.

00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:58.453
My mistake was
ever putting her in harm's way.

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.957
That's right. A world where
children don't have to cry.

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.209
I became a spy to create

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:05.919
a world like that.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.592
Don't let him get away!

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.469
Drag him out and expose that bastard!

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.056
A trap? When did he…?

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.684
What is this? Flour?

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:25.313
-Twilight?!
-Don't use your gun! It'll blow up!

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:33.655
Wha--

00:18:34.573 --> 00:18:35.574
No way…

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.537
Turn around and I'll kill you.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.080
Twilight…

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:47.043
Hello, or good evening Edgar. How's Karen?

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:49.087
How do you know my daughter's name?

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.382
Of course I know. I'm a spy.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.426
I know her height, weight, shoe size,

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.095
favorite food,
and every freckle on her body.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:01.850
I know her criminal activities too,
although they're cute compared to yours.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.935
-Shut up. My daughter wouldn't…
-Edgar.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.939
I also know that you care a lot
about your daughter. Listen.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:11.276
If you want her to continue
living in peace,

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.236
don't ever come near me again.

00:19:15.906 --> 00:19:18.199
If you understand, go home.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.300
-Anya!
-Father!

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:38.136
Father!

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:42.432
Why are you…? I mean,
what are you doing out of the house?

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.435
I just happened to come here to shop,

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:46.895
but it seems to be closed.

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:49.147
Father's such a liar.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.691
Anya was playing tag with some men.

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:54.069
Really? Did you have fun?

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.905
It was a little scary.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.241
Anya wants to go home.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.118
Father and Anya's home.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.913
Are you sure?

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.792
If you leave me behind,
Anya's going to cry…

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.920
She was returned from four foster homes.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:13.964
Anya Williams.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:16.925
Anya Levski. Anya Roche.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:18.760
I see.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.012
Then let's go home.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:29.396
That house is dangerous, so let's move.
There was a poisonous snake yesterday.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:30.438
I don't like snakes.

00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:33.358
Father is such a liar.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.819
But he's a cool liar!

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.487
Anya wants to live in a castle!

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.697
If they have one for sale.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.282
Once we move, you have to study.

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:42.200
Ugh!

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:45.578
You just have to memorize
the answers this time. It's easy.

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.633
Please begin the exam!

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:02.387
I'm counting on you Anya.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.764
Do your best.

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:08.852
-This is so hard!
-I don't know any of it!

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.146
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe…

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:27.954
K-212, K-212…

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.210
It's there! You passed! Good job!

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:35.462
Did Anya do good?

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:36.713
Yes! You did good!

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.215
-You did…
-Oh, Father!

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.009
Now that I'm relieved, the fatigue

00:21:41.092 --> 00:21:43.219
-Don't leave me!
-that had built up has come crashing down.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:47.182
-Relieved? Me?
-Father, you're making me cry!

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:50.727
-I'll be good, so please come back!
-Something's wrong with me…

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:54.189
&lt;=title&gt;

00:22:49.744 --> 00:22:52.455
Father died.

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:53.957
Mail!

00:22:56.084 --> 00:22:57.669
Miss Forger?

00:22:57.752 --> 00:22:58.962
I'm Anya Forger.

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:01.923
Could you give this
to your father or mother?

00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:03.341
My mother doesn't exist.

00:23:03.424 --> 00:23:05.426
Oh, really… I'm sorry…

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.555
Father! The mailman came!

00:23:27.782 --> 00:23:30.577
What's with you?
Are you trying to kill me?!

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:33.621
Sleeping in front of somebody
is unacceptable…

00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:36.124
I've got to pull it together.

00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:37.542
-Mail!
-Hm?

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:42.755
A letter of invitation from Eden Academy.

00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:44.173
What's wrong, Father?

00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:47.135
"The second step is
a three-person interview.

00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:50.305
Must attend with both parents.

00:23:50.388 --> 00:23:52.640
No exceptions."

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.102
Mother doesn't exist.

00:24:06.571 --> 00:24:08.740
&lt;=eptitle&gt;MISSION:2
SECURE A WIFE
