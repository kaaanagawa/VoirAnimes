00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.240
If you're really married,
then prove it to me.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.230
Kiss right here and now.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.280
If that's all it takes...

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.220
What?!

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.000
A kiss? A kiss?!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.290
Doesn't that mean... um...

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.840
Oh, yes. I've read somewhere that
your first kiss tastes like lemons.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.240
That'll go perfectly with
this marinated fish.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.240
Calm down, Yor! Get a hold of yourself!

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.330
Here I go.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.000
O-O-O-One second, please.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.470
There is no way I can do this sober.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.260
Fank you for waiting...

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.620
Uh... right.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.820
We don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.050
This ish for my sake, as well.
I will do my besht.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.030
What are you two whispering about?!

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.800
Can you do it or not?!

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.570
Prove to me that you're
really a married couple!

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.080
Keep your mouf shut, Yuri.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.720
We will now show you just how in wuv we are.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.610
Here I come, darling.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.340
Now, cwose your eyes.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.960
S-Sis!

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.890
Um... Yor?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.980
SHOW OFF HOW IN LOVE YOU ARE

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.530
Sis...

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.790
How lewd!

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.570
Sis!

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.550
Look! I scored the highest
in my whole class!

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.300
Oh, how wonderful!

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.660
I'll reward you with a kiss.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.540
Smooch!

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.800
Sis...

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.280
When I grow up...

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.540
I'm gonna marry you.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.480
Oh, my.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.210
Then I guess I'll just have
to wait patiently for you.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.070
...wait patiently for you.
...wait patiently for you.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.810
...wait patiently for you.
...wait patiently for you.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.310
You...

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.650
You can't, Sis!

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.340
Seeing you kiss another man
in front of me is just...

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.520
I won't allow—

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.540
Oh, I knew it...

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.790
I just can't!

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.790
—itpppppbt!

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.550
No!

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.640
Izzit the end of the world?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.360
Huh?! Um, Yuri?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.300
I see how it is, Sis.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.350
You're going to treat me like that just
because I tried to stop you from kissing him.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.960
I guess you just couldn't wait to
do naughty things with him!

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.830
I was a fool to test you.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.590
Perhaps my feelings were what
was truly being tested here!

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.370
Um... more importantly, you're bleeding.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.830
Loid Forger... You may lay claim
on my sister's lips for now.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.390
Wha—

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.950
What are you talking about?!

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.500
Right... Well, I'll let you
off the hook for today.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.390
But just remember—

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.180
No, really. You're bleeding.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.280
Is this just normal for the Briars?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.060
Are you all right, Yuri?
You're about to fall over.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.800
I'm fine.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.800
Did you really just say that?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.360
Well, so are you, Sis.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.720
Shall I call you a taxi?

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.240
I'm fine. You're such a worrywart, Sis.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.570
Whoa, there!

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.790
Wipe that smirk off your face!

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.280
Are my failures that amusing to you?!

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.160
Er, no. I was just admiring
what lovely siblings you are.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.440
You must have always been
there for each other.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.350
Yuri, thank you for protecting
Yor up until now.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.690
I'm sure you've been through many hardships.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.220
I'll also do everything I can to
be there for her from now on,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.810
so let's do everything we can
to make sure Yor is happy.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.320
Like I'd ever ask for your help!

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.450
Forget it! I'm going home!

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.370
Feel free to come over anytime!

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.550
I'm sure that'll make Yor happy.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.280
You should come when my
daughter's awake next time.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.220
Miss Anya was doing everything she
could to stay up to meet you.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.420
She's absolutely precious,
so I hope you'll play with her.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.180
I don't need him to invite me! I'll be back!

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.710
Next time, I'll prove that
you're tricking my sister!

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.640
I am not being tricked!

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.730
Now, hear me, Loid Forger.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.230
If you make my sister cry even a little bit,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.270
I will have you ex—

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.280
Um... well, you know.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.200
Just know that you'll rue the day!

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.040
Be careful getting home, dear!

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.360
Sis!

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.740
Be mindful of your yelling!
It'll disturb the neighbors!

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.890
Was he about to say he'd have me executed?

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.910
I should be careful.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.160
Any wiretaps?

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.360
Looks like we're clear.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.930
Since he's with the secret police...

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.430
Well, because he's her brother,
he may just try that.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.860
I need to be on my guard.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.830
Loid, thank you very much.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.180
I'm a bit embarrassed to say so,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.660
but thank you for welcoming him into
your family, despite his rudeness.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.510
Yuri clearly loves you very much, Yor.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.570
I don't have any family or friends
I can rely on, other than my daughter,

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.940
so I admit that I was a
little envious of you two.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.210
Loid...

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.520
Though my daughter is also
just part of a pretend family.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.710
Well, anyway. I'm glad he didn't find
out about our pretend marriage.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.810
Yes.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.100
I'm suddenly very tired,
now that I'm relieved.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.420
Why don't we head to bed after we clean up?

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.320
Er, in separate beds, of course!
I'll change things back!

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.590
R-Right.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.790
Papa... Pwease save Earth...

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:57.180
Now, Yuri... You'll make
me mad if you hit Loid...

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.230
I can't remember the last time
I felt envious of another.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.130
I should sleep. I'm sure I'm just exhausted.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.340
Yet my mission still continues on tomorrow.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.260
I beg your pardon.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.080
Which way is the station?

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.120
Get to the hospital first, pal!

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.400
Morning, pwease.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.530
You seem very green today, Papa.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.740
Quit talking in your sleep
and go wash your face.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.700
Good morning!

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.860
It's too bad you didn't get
to meet Yuri yesterday.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.230
Who's that?

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.390
Huh?! But she was so looking
forward to meeting him!

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.470
Things sure did get lively yesterday.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.220
I'm very sorry.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.740
Who'd have thought Yor's
brother would be like that?

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.990
Oh! Unkie!

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.990
And he's part of the secret police,
my greatest foe as a spy.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.270
S-Secret police?!

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.100
What's that?

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.490
"Secret" plus "police"...

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.500
That sounds so exciting!

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.280
Why didn't you introduce me to him?!

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.790
Gimme back the excitement I wasted!

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.840
You wanted to meet him that badly?

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.990
Well, at least the storm has passed for now.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.020
I need to concentrate on Anya's education.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.790
Come on, hurry up and eat. You'll be late.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.900
Om... nom...

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.900
Don't worry, you'll see
be able to see him soon.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.860
Has the threat truly passed?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.470
Yor Briar, whose younger brother
is a member of the secret police...

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.400
Previously, there was nothing
suspicious surrounding her.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.960
She didn't seem to know what her
brother's true occupation is,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.730
so my intuition says she's still clear.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.600
Besides, if she knew her brother
worked at the State Security Service,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.410
there'd be no concern over suspicions
arising about her being single.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.670
No, it's dangerous to be too certain.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.650
What if she was just acting and this
was all a lie to get closer to me?

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.840
Suspect everything, Twilight.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.480
Papa, Mama is...

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.720
What is it?

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.240
Mama is...

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.250
bad at cooking.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.230
So it was obvious that I made
breakfast this morning!

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.880
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.610
I did do my best.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.300
Ah, by the way, Yor...

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.090
Yes?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.550
Er, I just...

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.300
I guess putting a listening device
on her is going too far.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.660
No, I need to silence any doubts now.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.500
Even a moment's carelessness
could mean death.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.100
It could also mean the lives
of tens of thousands of people.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.600
I need to do this to prove Yor's innocence.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.800
You've got something on your neck.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.180
Huh? Thank you very much.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.680
That startled me. I thought he was
going to give me a kiss goodbye.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.400
Wha?!

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.490
I s-still haven't forgotten
about last night...

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.670
I can't kiss or even cook.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.500
Loid managed to smooth
things over last night,

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.510
but I'm probably not acting like a proper wife.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.120
I may be imagining it, but Loid
seems a bit more distant today.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.140
Maybe he's gotten sick of
me being so disappointing.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.740
I need to be on my guard.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.050
What's the matter, Anya?

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.190
Mama and Papa need to get along.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.930
W-Well, we aren't fighting or anything.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.210
Th-That's right.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.840
And you make sure you get
along with your classmates.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.040
Yep.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.660
We should get going, too.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.910
Oh, right.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.510
Children are so curiously observant at times.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.010
Hey, Yuri.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.800
Why are you covered in bandages?

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.270
Didn't you go celebrate your
sister's wedding yesterday?

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.090
I don't really remember what happened.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.940
You probably got drunk and picked
a fight with her husband.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.620
You really need to quit drinking.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.660
Well, I can't let a guy like
that be with my sister.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.490
Was he that disagreeable?

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.810
I think...

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.200
he was...

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.650
a good guy.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.720
But con men and spies always
try to act like good people.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.480
That's it! Hopefully he's a spy!
Then I can throw him in a cell!

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.550
Calm down. Do you have any proof of this?

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.170
Shit!

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:10.070
I totally forgot to bug their
living room and bedrooms!

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.770
Wait, no!

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.710
If I happened to hear Sis's
voice in those situations,

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.530
my heart wouldn't be able to bear it!

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.260
Did you give yourself those injuries?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.790
You need to detach from your sister so
you can concentrate on your work more.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.220
Our job is to capture

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.450
spies from the West, namely, Twilight.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:38.050
Because that will lead
to your sister's safety.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.970
I know that. For now...

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:46.430
Loid Forger, the day you make my sister cry...

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.380
What's with her?

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.800
She said something like,
"I'm a failure of a wife."

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.750
Heya.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.000
Oh, Sharon.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.070
Huh? How do you become a good wife?

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.250
Are you two not getting along?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.560
Well, it's not exactly that...

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:08.920
It's just... This is my first time
being with a man in general,

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.320
It's just... This is my first time
being with a man in general,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.970
so I'm unsure of how to act.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.670
I was curious when I looked
into her past connections,

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.290
but I guess Yor has really
never dated a man before.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.300
I'm worried that things
can't go on like this.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.090
It doesn't help that I can't cook.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.490
Anya's words really got to her.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:37.560
It appears that Yor is trying to seem more
wifely for the sake of our pretend family.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.180
No, wait.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.570
She could also be trying to act like the
perfect wife to put one over on me.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.250
It must be rough when your husband
is clearly so much better than you.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.370
Why don't you two just call it quits?

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.670
Er, I'd like to avoid that.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.550
Yor's relationship with her
coworkers seems a bit, er, uh...

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:56.580
Hey, you four!

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.450
Hey, you four!

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.270
Quit yapping and get to work.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.760
Gah! It's the section chief.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.840
Say, Yor...

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.580
Could you go drop this off
at the post office for me?

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.890
Yes, sir.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.330
I guess I'll have to make a move if
I want to clear the air for good.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:24.340
Come to think of it, Loid and
I have separate bank accounts.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.090
If I contributed a bit of my
earnings from my actual job,

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.210
would I be able to help Loid out?

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.830
But I can't make him suspicious of me, either.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.930
Not to mention, I don't think this
was really a financial issue...

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.200
You there. I'd like to
ask you a few questions.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.580
May we have a bit of your time?

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.090
Th-The secret police!

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.490
D-Did I do something wrong, sir?

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:56.140
Was I being far too suspicious by
looking at ads meant for families,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.890
when I'm clearly lacking as a wife?

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.310
I-I-I'm married!

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.820
We're not hitting on you.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.560
What the hell is this?!

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.070
You call me outta nowhere and
tell me to dress like this

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.480
so we can question your wife?!

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.050
Just shut up and follow the plan.
This is all for my mission.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.850
I've got nothing to do with that!

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.200
We are inspecting the mail.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.310
You just tried to mail this...

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.240
But it clearly contains a code
meant for the West.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.400
Is the sender, Burns, your superior?

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.830
Y-Yes.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.010
What is your name?

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.260
Yor Bri—

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.420
I-It's Yor Forger.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.260
Well, well, well... Yor Forger, eh?

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.260
It clearly states your name
right here as a collaborator!

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.740
He's really into this.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.320
So you're in cahoots.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.330
I-I have no idea about this.
This must be some kind of mistake.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.270
You'd be better off if you told the truth.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.700
Speaking of city hall, someone from the
finance department was caught the other day.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.560
Clearly, the corruption within
has spread far and wide.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.290
I heard he met a pitiful end.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.760
The intense torture got to
him physically and mentally,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.040
and he apparently offed himself in his cell.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.230
And I heard last month, they caught
another woman around this chick's age.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.230
You know, that official's secretary.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.490
What kind of characterization is he going for?

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.020
Ah, her.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.340
She was freed once we found out she
had family in State Security Service.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.490
Man, talk about an awesome benefit.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:27.990
Our family members can be let off
the hook of most allegations.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.030
Enough talking. You'll be
coming with us to the station.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.580
If she's aware that Yuri works
for the State Security Service,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.790
this will all be solved as soon
as she mentions Yuri's name.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.450
There's no reason for her to be
secretive to one of his coworkers,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.580
and if she resists, she'll further
make us suspicious.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.100
Come on, Yor. If you're in on this,
ask your brother for help.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.050
And if you're not...

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.780
I...

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.120
work hard every day for the
citizens of this country.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.440
I would never participate in espionage!

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.090
No use playing dumb with us!

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.250
Just shut up and come with—

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.120
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.070
I'm quite certain I mentioned
that I was married.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.120
Please do not touch me so casually.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.420
You do realize you're putting your family
in danger by doing this, don't you?

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.120
My younger brother and husband are both kind

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.620
and upstanding members of society.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.660
If you ever unjustly harm either of them,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.910
I frankly do not care if
I'm dealing with you two.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.620
I will show no mercy!

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.580
Hey, Second Lieutenant Mop...

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.780
Are you certain about this cipher?

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.410
What? Of course I'm—

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.830
What the?!

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.120
Looking closer, this is clearly
not the raccoon cipher.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.080
It's the caterpillar cipher!

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.970
If we decode this message...

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.440
This is a letter Burns sent to a
renowned hemorrhoids doctor.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.320
Huh?

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.850
I see. He used a cipher because
he was embarrassed.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.780
How confusing.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.540
So, yes, it would appear
we had the wrong idea.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.340
Your name isn't on here at all.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.780
You may leave, but make sure you keep
quiet about this for Mr. Burns's sake, too.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.540
Well, that was quite the farce.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.660
Considering how she acted, it's pretty clear
she has no connections with the secret police.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.450
Hey, come on. Don't tell me you
feel guilty for doubting her.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.430
I don't.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:31.240
I've warned you about this before, but don't
develop unnecessary feelings for her.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.170
If you value your life, don't trust anyone.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.620
We have no other way to survive.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.650
Somehow, it's extremely infuriating
to hear those words from that face.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.490
But you made that face!

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.940
Damn it! I thought I could land
a few chicks with that face on.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.390
My precious hot-guy face!

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.580
It's a terrible idea to date
a woman while deceiving her.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.910
Did you really just say that?

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.700
Today was terribly nerve-wracking.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.840
I was almost arrested, meaning not
only would I be ruined as a wife,

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.810
but I would've destroyed the Forgers.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.250
Oh, hello, Yor.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.350
Loid...

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.150
What a coincidence. Why don't
we go home together?

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.890
Oh? There's something on
your collar again, Yor.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.210
I'm so sorry.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:29.520
Apparently, I'm such a failure as wife that
I can't even keep up proper appearances.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.120
Well, if you ask me, Yor...

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.530
Perhaps many families throughout this
world are somehow putting on an act,

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.640
thinking, "A wife should be like this,"
or, "You're supposed to be the parent."

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.880
Of course, I believe that working hard
to be your best self is admirable.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.880
But if you dwell on that so
much that you lose yourself,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.390
things that should go well might fall apart.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:58.410
Many people suffering like that
come to my hospital all the time.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.480
Putting on an act all the
time can become tiring.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.160
Loid...

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.750
And that's why I want you
to be as you are, Yor.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.840
The more confident you seem,
the less people will suspect anything.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.450
And I'm sure Anya will be
happier seeing you smile.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.360
Thank you very much. I...

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.670
I'm truly grateful that I married you, Loid!

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.120
Don't tell me you feel
guilty for doubting her.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.970
What did you just throw away?

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.770
Oh, just the lint I found
on your collar earlier.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.690
More importantly,

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.890
we didn't even do anything to celebrate
our one-year wedding anniversary.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.870
Why don't we buy some cake on our way home?

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.300
That's a lovely idea!

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.140
Papa, Mama! I have returned!

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.760
Welcome home, Miss Anya.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.710
What's the matter?

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.990
Papa and Mama are getting along!

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.470
I told you that we were never
fighting to begin with.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.850
We have cake, Miss Anya!

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.030
I want some cake!

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.350
Hey, now. You're going to
bother the people downstairs.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.910
THE GREAT DODGEBALL PLAN
