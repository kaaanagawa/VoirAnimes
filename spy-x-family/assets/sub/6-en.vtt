00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.240
Exclusive Seller of Eden Academy Uniforms

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.950
And... 99.5.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.750
I'm two millimeters bigger than last time!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.210
I'm sure it's just an error.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.210
You never know. Kids grow up so quickly.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.250
Indeed.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.960
Well, with that in mind, we should probably
have your uniform made a little bigger.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.510
But it was quite a shock to hear that
you were suddenly married, Yor.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.970
You should have told me the
last time you were here!

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.730
I'm, er, sorry about the other day.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.270
And to think that your lovely daughter is
going to the prestigious Eden College.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.730
Congratulations.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.230
Fank you very much.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.860
Are you an Eden College alum?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.910
Oh, no. I went to an insignificant
little school out in the country.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.530
Oh, then do be careful.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.830
There's something of a wall between parents
who are Eden alumni and those who aren't.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.750
Apparently this causes discrimination and
bullying among the children, too.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.720
Oh, and hazing from the honor students,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.590
and conflict between the
dorm kids and commuters.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.590
Speaking of, I hear that kidnappings
of commuter kids are on the rise.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.520
It's not surprising, considering most of the
kids who can attend Eden are rich.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.350
I don't wanna go to school anymore.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.980
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.530
Don't worry. There are plenty
of fun things about it, too.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.150
Okay, all done with your measurements.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.080
Let's see, you'll be getting one uniform,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.750
plus a winter coat, a vest, and a sweater,
for three additional items.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.000
You're a regular here, so I'll
get those done immediately.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.420
Oh, you'll be able to get everything else
you need from the shop on the corner.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.750
This is going to cost more than I thought.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.340
What's the matter?

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.390
I am in fear that I will be kidnapped.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.520
Oh, I see. You sure didn't waste any time.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.440
Yor, is it all right if we eat out today?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.270
Yes, of course.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.020
Are there any kidnappers at the restaurant?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.610
Here's our special for the day.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.530
Pork sauté in pawpaw sauce with
porcini mushrooms and potato potage.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.160
Po?

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.240
Looks delicious.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.370
Must be cipher P.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.040
Ah, a notice about my briefing.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.380
It'll be in five days at
1300 hours at safe house D.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.460
Understood.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.090
But I really need to ask them to stop
using this notification method.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.800
There's something unpleasant about it.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.260
5 Days Later

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.300
Hello?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.890
Oh, yes, hi.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.720
What? It's done already?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.310
All right. We'll come
pick up the order today.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.100
Thank you.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.770
Is the uniform done?

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.280
Sounds like it.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.530
But I have my briefing today.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.530
I'm sorry to trouble you, Yor,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.530
but could you go pick
it up with Anya for me?

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.870
I got called into work.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.660
Of course. You can count on me.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.550
I might not get home until late, so you
can go ahead and get delivery for dinner.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.300
All right.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.630
Have a knees day.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.040
WISE Handler
Sylvia Sherwood
Alias: Handler

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.590
Good day... or perhaps
good evening, Agent Twilight.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.090
Hello, Handler. What's this about?

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.420
Before we get into that...

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.340
What in the world were all
those expenses the other day?!

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.100
A castle rental fee, and rental fees
for furniture to go in said castle?!

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.980
You think we're made of money?!

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.020
Oh, here's a couple more bills, actually.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.020
Going to school is apparently very expensive.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.690
I have to admire the balls it takes to
just casually hand me more bills.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.900
Well, they're all necessary expenses.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.980
Very well. Anyway...

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.660
I'm here today to brief you
on phase 2 of Operation Strix.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.490
Though you're usually on the ball,
so that may not be necessary.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.700
Well... I may actually
be off my game lately.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.460
Phase 2 requires a social gathering.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.210
Before we get into the details,
let's review how Eden works.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.300
Eden College.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.760
There are around 2,500 students

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.260
ranging from the ages of six to nineteen,
and the curriculum covers all thirteen years.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.220
Academics, sports, the arts...

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.220
They offer a top-class
education in every field.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.190
The students who manage to shine
brighter than their fellow elites

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.730
are the honor students known
as the Imperial Scholars.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.740
The social gathering that Desmond attends

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.110
is only open to those Imperial
Scholars and their parents.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.240
In order to become an Imperial Scholar,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.080
a student must earn eight
merits known as "Stella."

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.120
Stella Stars are awarded for exceptional
grades and contributions to society.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.670
Which means, first, you need to raise
your daughter into an honor student.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.120
You may use underhanded
means if necessary.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.050
On the other hand,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.100
poor grades and bad behavior will result
in demerits called Tonitrus Bolts.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.020
When a student receives eight of those,
they will be immediately expelled,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.020
so be aware of that.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.270
Now, let's work out the finer details.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.730
Turning that child into a honor student...

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.030
Hello, anxiety, my old friend.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.620
Do I look cute in my uniform?

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.700
Oh, you look absolutely adorable!

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.410
Let's go to the portrait studio later!

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.830
Ta-da!

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.880
Do I look cute?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.550
Oh, you look absolutely adorable!

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.170
Could you leave already? How many
times are you gonna say that?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.180
I wanna go on an ooting in this!

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.550
Yes, let's do that!

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.970
Thanks much.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.190
Doot, do! Doot, do! Doot, do!

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.350
Why don't we stop by the park?

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.610
This is my uniform. Ta-da!

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.640
I am wearing my uniform. Ta-da!

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.070
My, your daughter's adorable.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.620
She goes to Eden? I'm so jealous.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.120
Oh... Hello.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.420
Mom, I'm hungry.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.830
And what would you like for dinner?

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.420
Hamburg steak!

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.430
So you <i>do</i> prefer your old mother.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.510
I want to be with them forever.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.770
I know that we're just a pretend family.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.430
But...

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.150
Maybe I could be more of a mother to her.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.940
Mama!

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.200
I just showed everyone how cute I am!

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.370
Make sure you don't dirty your
uniform before you go to school.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.040
Say, Miss Anya. Why don't we stop
by the supermarket on our way home?

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.880
Loid said he was going to be home
late, so I'll make dinner tonight.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.590
Ooh!

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.250
Can you cook, Mama?

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.840
Yes. I will do my very best.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.180
Hey, is that kid from Eden?

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.720
Huh?

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.850
Is the chick next to her the mom?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.220
She's gotta be the hired help.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.520
No rich person's gonna
go shopping themselves.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.860
You know, I think I want an allowance.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.230
Me, too.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.740
I'm sure I'll be able to make something
if I have some meat and vegetables.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.990
I'm not sure what any of these are,
so I'll just buy all of them.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.280
Ta-da!

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.290
I'm going outside now. I'm bored.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.710
Oh, don't wander off too far!

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.710
Hello there, little lady.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.340
Be a good girl for just a little bit.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.010
Once your maid pays up, we'll let you go.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.260
Bad guys!

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.520
Eden has bullying and kidnappings...

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.230
She was right!

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.690
I heard you can even sell their
uniforms for a sweet price.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.900
Excellent. In that case,
little lady, let's take your—

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.360
What do you think you're doing?

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.870
Uh-oh! Looks like we're gonna have
to tack on some medical bills, too.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.830
Let's see your wallet, Miss Hired Help.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.710
I'm afraid I used up all of
my cash, so I have none left.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.710
So I must ask you to leave.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.050
I see. Then I guess we're just gonna
have to strip the little lady.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.180
You're gonna be fired anyway,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.560
so go back to the countryside,
you shitty little maid!

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.940
Sh-She destroyed that pumpkin
with her bare hand?!

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.990
I am that girl's mother!

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.570
If you do not want to end up like
that vegetable, leave at once!

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.620
Mama...

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.870
Are you all right?

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.670
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have
let you out of my sight.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.920
There, there...

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.160
And I've ruined all of the ingredients...

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.510
I'm such a failure as a mother.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.020
But I love that my Mama
is so strong and cool.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.060
There, there.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.060
Killer punch, kapow!

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.520
I-I'm so embarrassed!

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.400
Mama!

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.900
Train me, please!

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.650
T-Train you?

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.820
I know it's really dangerous to
be an Eden student now.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.290
But it won't be as scary if I train!

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.120
I can do my best at school without dying!

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.750
I wanna be like you, Mama!

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.710
Even if I can't be like a normal mother,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.340
I'm going to do everything I can for her.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.930
All right. Let's go straight
home and start your training.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.760
Training!

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.110
I'm home...

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.600
Hah! Hah!

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.980
What are you doing?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.480
Preparing her to go to school!

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480
Hah!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.900
Hah!

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.530
Yeah... I'm filled with nothing but anxiety.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:58.990
Hah!

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.530
Hah!

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.450
Hah!

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.200
You are truly the chosen.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.210
Due to your hard work, or perhaps your parents,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.710
you have made it to the
hallowed halls of Eden.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.630
To our honorable new 228 students...

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.050
Congratulations, and welcome to our school.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.560
Everyone here at Eden welcomes you
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.760
We finally made it this far...

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.020
Papa, a lot of people are
wearing the same thing I am.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.270
Yes. That's what a uniform is.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.820
I still have a mountain of
problems to tackle, but...

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.190
Listen up, Twilight.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.570
There are requirements to attend
Desmond's social gathering.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.990
The student must be an Imperial Scholar.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.330
And for that to happen, they
must receive plenty of merits.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:55.590
Do not forget that the future of the
East and West depends on this mission.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.710
Turning this child into an elite...

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.340
I've mostly given up on that task.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.300
Shock!

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.680
This school is already filled
with the best of the best.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.470
It'll be difficult to maintain a top position.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.390
More importantly...

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.560
Next, we will announce the houses
and their housemasters.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.770
Please come forward when
your name is called.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.400
Class one: Specter Hall.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.900
William Howard.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.570
Theodore Russell.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.740
Grace Fein.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.950
Jessica Clark.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.700
Next, we have class two: Cline Hall.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.080
I wonder what class I'm gonna be in.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.500
Who knows?

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.960
Lucy Garrett.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.370
Actually... I do.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:41.630
Because I changed parts of the
lineups to help with my mission.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.250
Class three: Cecile Hall.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.590
Alice Paulette.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.380
To ensure that Anya...

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.880
Edward Perkshire.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.050
Damian Desmond.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.550
would be in the same class as him.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.350
The second son of my target,
Donovan Desmond...

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.310
Damian.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.820
That's Lord Damian to you.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.110
He got into Eden just
like his older brother.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.490
I've had my eye on him ever since I saw
his name on the list of students applying.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.320
Jesse Capel.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.950
If plan A to get Anya to become an
Imperial Scholar proves too difficult,

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.990
we'll go to plan B.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.080
I call it... the Friendship Scheme.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.330
THE FRIENDSHIP SCHEME

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.290
Step one: be in the same class
as him and become friends.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.420
Step two: be invited to his
house and bring me along.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.040
Come over!

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.500
Step three: direct contact with the target!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.460 line:20%
Welcome

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.460
Thank
you

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.720
I'm sure it won't actually go that easily,

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.260
but the more insurance we have, the better.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.430
Anya Forger.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.260
Go ahead.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.020
Anya must have grown up around kids
her age at the orphanage for years.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.270
I'll put my faith in her
communication skills.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.190
That's the evil boss's kid.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.030
What's with her?

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.520
Heh, I see.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.070
She's already realized how
amazing I am and fallen for me.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.240
You've got good taste, kid.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.620
Playing hard to get, I see. Cute.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.790
Becky Blackbell.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.580
Geh...

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.540
Pleasure to meet you!

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.010
That's...

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.430
The daughter of the CEO of the major
military contractor, Blackbell.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.720
What?! And behind her is the daughter
of the vice president of parliament!

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.560
And among the boys, there's the son of one
of the key members of the secret service!

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.520
Her classmates are a
treasure trove of intel!

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.400
Make sure you become friends
with all of them, Anya!

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.890
Loid gets so worked up when
it comes to his daughter.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.610
I'm Becky! What's your name?

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.530
She looks like a baby. I guess I wouldn't
mind taking care of her a bit.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.120
Hmph.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.290
Those will be the 29 students in class three.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.950
Hey!

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:34.990
Hello?!

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.460
And you will be under the
tutelage of Master Henderson.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.420
Oh, it's the nice teacher.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.540
So he didn't get fired after all.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.380
I feel it's unfair for a housemaster
to have to teach new students,

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.130
but I guess it could've been much worse.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.550
I'll just have to whip these rugrats
into shape like I used to.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.990
And now, the new students will accompany their
homeroom teachers on a tour of the campus,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.270
then head to their
respective classrooms.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:07.980
During that time, there will be a meet and
greet in Tower C's lounge for the guardians.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.530
Do your best, Anya.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.780
You'll be on your own from here on out.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.650
Okey-dokey!

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.880
You there! Stay in line!

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.080
I'm so worried...

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.380
It is always nerve-racking to send
them off into the world.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.500
I totally understand.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.670
This is the dining hall.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.680
The best chefs will present you with
the most elegant dishes daily.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:37.310
Beyond those doors is a special dining
hall reserved only for Imperial Scholars.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:43.400
Anyone can become an Imperial Scholar if they
achieve elegant grades and earn eight Stella.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.860
I trust that you will all do your best.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.900
Yes, sir!

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.190
However, those who fall behind

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.240
will receive Tonitrus Bolts and face
punishment or expulsion, so stay on your toes.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.160
Why are you looking at me?

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.330
Lord Damian's gonna be an
Imperial Scholar in no time!

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.660
Of course I am.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.290
We'd expect nothing else!

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.330
I mean, my father is the head
of the National Unity Party.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.670
Wait, really?!

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:05.670
Wow!

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.340
My Papa says we owe a lot
to the Desmond Group!

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.210
Silence! No private conversations!

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.470
They're so dumb.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.310
What about you? What does your father do?

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.680
If he's important enough, I'd consider
letting you be my friend, too.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.020
I will stay calm for the mission.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.440
He's a sp—a feelings doctor.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.490
Hmph. So he's just a nobody.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.450
You're probably not that rich, either. Lame.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.660
I wanna go play at your house.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.410
You moron! Know your place, uggo!

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.700
This is the problem with
measly little peasants.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.210
You're gonna get your gross
peasant germs on him! Scram!

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.880
Now is the time for me to
unleash my killer punch!

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.460
Listen carefully, Miss Anya.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.210
Gasp!

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.920
Anyone who lets their
emotions control their fists

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.050
does not know the meaning of true strength.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.890
If someone's just being a little mean,

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.600
being able to laugh it off
makes you the cooler, bigger girl.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.180
A big girl!

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.300
And if you can keep a smile on
your face, fights will not happen.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.270
Hey, stop being so pathetic.
At least say something back.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.280
Heh. Like I care.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.240
Heh.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.740
H-How dare she smirk at me
like she's mocking me?!

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.210
Look at that composure!
She's so mature! Amazing!

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.500
I was wrong about her being a baby!

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.040
You're way more grown-up than
I thought. I'm impressed.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.380
I'm a grown-up?

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.510
Heh.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.600
Don't get cocky, you stupid uggo!

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.520
Uggo, uggo, Queen Uggo!

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.140
Lord Damian, perhaps you should
broaden your vocabulary...

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.640
What's your problem?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.020
Sure, she's uglier than me,
but you don't have to be so mean.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.400
Shut your mouth!

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.650
You there! How many times must I warn you?

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.900
Do you want punishments on your first day?

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.160
Curse you... How dare you
embarrass me like that?!

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.370
You'll pay for this!

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.330
Mama, you liar. Smiling didn't help at all.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.420
If you don't quit it,
I'm gonna tell the teacher!

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.840
What? You have proof that we did it?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.180
Yeah, yeah!

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.930
Go on. Move!

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.140
Hey, you smug uggo!

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.480
I'm gonna bully you every single day!

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.030
I'm gonna teach you a lesson so you'll
never be able to smirk again!

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.440
Her feelings doctor father might
be able to fix her if she cries.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.150
Seriously? Well, that's impressive!

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.510
Aren't you a special widdle girl?

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.590
Hey, where do you think
you're looking? You scared?

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.840
What is the meaning of this?!

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.010
Sir! She just punched Lord Damian!

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.390
I just reached out my hand ,
and somehow, he ran into it.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.310
You liar! You're not fooling anyone!

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.560
You were even making sure the
teacher wasn't looking earlier!

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.020
You got any proof I did it?

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.280
You left the imprint of
your fist on his face!

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.780
I trust you are aware that
perjury is a disgraceful act,

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.530
Anya Forger.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.030
That's not what happened, sir!

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:29.620
She was holding back all day,
but these bullies just...

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.000
So it's true that she hit him?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.800
Listen carefully, Miss Anya.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.550
Gasp!

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.970
The only time it's all right for
you to use force is, for example,

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.930
if you're saving a friend in trouble.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.930
H-Her foot...

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.350
He stepped on it.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.900
So I got mad...

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.980
I'm sorry.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.610
She did that for me?!

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:00.940
Oh, Anya!

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.240
She held back her own personal anger,

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.780
Thank you! Thank you, Anya!

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.740
and had the courage to stand
up to a lad for her friend.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.910
I'm so moved!

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.160
Truly elegant, Anya Forger.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.330
But I'm afraid...

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.500
So the Desmonds didn't appear after all.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.760
Well, there's no need to rush.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.840
Now that she's enrolled,
we have all the time in the world.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.890
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:29.240
The students' orientation is now complete,
so please head toward the courtyard.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.680
And I was able to make some connections.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.480
If you would gather round,
we will take a group photo.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.190
Where's Anya?

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.230
Forger.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.020
Come with me.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.650
She punched a boy?

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.940
Are you hurt at all?

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.490
And it just happened to be Desmond's son?

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.660
Usually, acts of violence would
immediately mean three Tonitrus Bolts...

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:43.860
What in the world?

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.660
But at my discretion, it became one.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.250
That is as much as I can do.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.930
I'm terribly sorry, Loid!
All because I trained her...

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.420
I will speak with his parents, too.

Plan A

Plan B

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.590
It's the first day of school
and she lost a point.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.570
To top it off, her relationship with
Damian couldn't be any worse.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.050
All right, everyone! We're taking the picture!

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.710
The family on the right over there!
Smile a little more!

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.550
Say, "Cheese!"

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.740 position:20% line:20%
Stella needed to become an Imperial Scholar: 8
Tonitrus Bolts until expulsion: 7
Relationship with Damian: -100

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.660
THE TARGET'S SECOND SON
