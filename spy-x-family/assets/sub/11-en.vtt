WEBVTT

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.630
"STELLA"

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.490
Impossible... All of our pursuers are...

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.160
Let's go back to our hideout and regroup.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.460
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.090
No way... Bondman, this can't be happening!

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.390
I can't believe this! Hey, hey! Wake up!

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.760
Hey, Anya.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.640
Anya is busy right now.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.350
This is just awful.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.400
No! I don't wanna study!

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.520
Now, hold on.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.820
We made a deal. You agreed
to start studying at 5 PM.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.460
You demon! Papa is a demon!

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.070
Operation Strix, Phase 2...

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.620
In order to attend the
target's social gathering,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.500
I need to make sure my daughter
Anya becomes an Imperial Scholar.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.500
For her to achieve that,
she will need to get good grades

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.260
and receive Stellas.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.970
PROVERBS

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.350
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.520
That's supposed to be an "E," not an "A."

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.360
B-But, Loid-san, her math
score here is pretty good.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.980
Well done, Anya-san.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.980
He has two-eighths of his bullets left!

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.160
Is this because of her cartoon?

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.490
Oh, that's right.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.580
This proverb is the same one
Bondman was saying in episode 16.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.500
I forgot...

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.750
Well, remember!

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.880
You know, it's the episode where the
guy with the sideburns appeared.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.130
I just happened to mess up my
mind-reading cheat on this test.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.590
From now on, I'm gonna spend a lot of time

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:33.650
Good at: ??

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.260
trying to figure out which classmate
is good at what subject.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.310
And then I will definitely
get perfect scores,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.650
no problem.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.980
I tried sounding like Papa.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.150
It would be easy to make her every score
an A+ by using backdoor methods.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.910
But if she suddenly scores that high,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.580
the school and those around
her will become suspicious.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.830
In order to make this all
seem as natural as possible,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.910
I need to nurture her basic knowledge.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.750
If she ends up being shunned by her
classmates, it may affect her life at school.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.260
I can't have her not
wanting to go to school.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.130
If I read everyone's minds to
get 100s, they'll all hate me?

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.680
Hey, how do you even know that?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680
You creepy little witch!

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.310
I guess forcing her to study too
much might be a bit rough on her.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.280
If her motivation remains low,
her concentration won't improve,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.030
so she'll have a lesser chance of learning.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.910
A change of pace is also important.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.700
There are ways of earning
Stella besides academics.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.700
Right, then.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.660
Why don't we take a break
from studying and draw?

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.220
For example, art.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.700
Hey, that looks really cool!

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.630
Is it a cheetah? No, wait...

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.510
I bet it's a panda!

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.720
It's a moo cow. The one that was at school.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.340
For example, music!

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.480
This is a violin for children.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.990
There's always sports!

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.990
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.460
Come on, don't cry.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.790
Stay calm, Twilight.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.420
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.340
She's still in first grade.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.930
I need to figure out what she has a
talent for and help her excel in it.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.060
Why don't we do some jump rope?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.640
It's a lot of fun.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.020
Right. Don't panic.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.060
It's not like Desmond is immediately
going to make his move.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.440
It takes an incredible amount
of time to begin a war.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.940
But...

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.450
HQ was estimating that she'd be able to
receive eight Stella in about four months.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.120
Do we actually have that much time?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.290
Papa...

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.460
Anya will do her best.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.880
Now untie me.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.470
Uh, right.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.180
Anya.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.970
Why don't we go out tomorrow?

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.310
An ooting?

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.560
Academics, the arts, sports...

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.860
But there is actually one
other way to earn Stella.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.730
Community service.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.370
Thank you so much for agreeing to
volunteer at our hospital today.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.370
I will now go over the duties
we'll be asking you to perform.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.920
We will have you split up into
your families to perform your duties.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.420
In the past, there have been
many cases where students

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.250
did long-term volunteer work
to earn their Stella.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.090
Rescuing others or helping
apprehend criminals

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.260
were also methods a few used
to earn Stella, but rare.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.390
We could use more personnel from
HQ to act out these scenarios,

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.980
but considering the risks that could entail,
we won't be able to easily pull that off.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.770
That is what we will be
expecting from all of you.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.770
Even if she isn't immediately
able to receive any Stella,

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.780
it would be beneficial to Anya to learn
the importance of community service.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.790
Now, if I can have the Forgers
clean this dressing room.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.790
There's a pool!

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.000
Yes, for physical therapy.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.170
Maybe cleaning was a bit difficult for you.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.800
Then let's have you organize
books in the library.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.180
Excuse me, sir, could you
do something about... that?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.560
Could you go work somewhere else?

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.090
Anya is bored with chores.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.740
I wanna do the job where I give
the doctors their scalpels.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.450
Huh?

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.330
I'mma go to the operating room!

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.540
Hey! Stop that! Come back here!

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.340
We've had enough of your "help"! Please leave!

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.270
Papa, I'm sorry.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.890
Don't worry about it.
Everyone fails sometimes.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.940
But what do we do if our chances of earning
Stella through community service also dry up?

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.530
Hey, is physical therapy hard?

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.990
It is,

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.030
but you need to work hard
so that you can run again.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.660
Man...

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.790
Three more minutes.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.420
Hey, is the water in the pool cold?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.960
Don't worry about that. Go on, get changed.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.800
I'll go get changed, too.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.640
All right, one, two. One, two. One, two.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.300
I wonder if that's the adult pool...

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.720
Focus on your toes.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.350
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.440
Man... it really is kinda cold.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.730
You're almost there! One, two. One, two.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.320
Ken?

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.450
Huh? Is he still changing?

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.960
Hmm... I might have to ask HQ
to reconsider our game plan.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.380
C-Can't... breathe...

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.710
My legs... won't move...

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.510
The pool!

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.380
Papa!

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.720
What is it? You just went to
the bathroom, didn't you?

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.140
Someone's drowning in the pool!

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.430
What?! How do you know that?

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.310
Exactly who are you?!

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.860
Help me... Help me...

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.980
Papa...

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.860
Anya is terrible at volunteering.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.900
So I...

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.410
I'm gonna become a pro swimmer and get stars,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.950
so I'm gonna go practice in the pool!

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.370
What?! Come back here!
That's not a public pool!

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.370
Ken!

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.010
He must've snuck out.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.800
Hey!

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.640
Where are your parents?

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.560
Wow! The pool! How fun!

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.600
What's that about?

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.690
Where is the drowning person?

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.400
I'm...

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.490
I'm... gonna die...

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.570
What are you doing, little girl?!

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.430
Anya... can't... anymore...

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.400
Hey, are you two all right?

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.700
Ken!

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.820
Papa...

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.490
Someone get a doctor!

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.410
I tried to swim and found this boy sinking.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.460
Ken!

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.830
Are you all right?

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.590
Ken!

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.380
Calm down, miss.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.590
Is everything okay?

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.630
Ken! Ken!

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.010
But there were so many people around.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.510
Did you hear anything?

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.310
I'm so sorry! I had no
idea you were drowning!

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.100
It was a drowning response.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.980
Children tend to drown more
quietly than you would expect.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.570
Many die because no one
notices they're drowning.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.690
Please make sure you keep your eye on him.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.410
And good job for noticing.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.530
I saw bubbles.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.200
And you should be careful, too.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.290
Thank you! Thank you!

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.500
Well done, little girl!

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.350
First-year student from the
Cecile Dorm, Anya Forger,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.730
has earned a Stella for rescuing a boy.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.900
You're amazing, Anya!

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.990
You're the first of the
first graders to get one!

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.990
I'm so proud of you for some reason.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.330
Ultra-amazingly elegant, Miss Forger.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.910
Well done, Anya!

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.910
She beat me.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.930
You're amazing, Miss Anya! Truly amazing!

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.770
I'm so happy for you!

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.810
She unexpectedly earned a Stella.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.440
An excellent result,

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.770
but how do I describe this?

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.530
It's similar to how I feel when
I've thwarted a terrorist attack.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.530
I'm so proud of her.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.700
Well done.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.040
Anya's powers actually helped someone?

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.750
Eheh!

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.420
All right, then. I'm going
to make you a feast today.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.050
Anya wants Papa to cook.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.890
Stella needed to become an Imperial Scholar: 7
Tonitrus Bolts until expulsion: 7
Everyone's respect: +100

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.180
Shock!

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.360
I heard that your daughter earned
a Stella, Agent Twilight.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.240
Yes, Handler. She somehow managed it.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.620
Couldn't we set things up with other agents

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.830
to fake whatever you need
to get the other Stella?

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.580
People would get suspicious.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.630
More importantly, we can't
take risks that could potentially

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.920
expose the identities of other
agents or get them arrested.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.590
Yes, you've got a point.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.600
Is HQ panicking a bit?

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.100
No.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.360
But there are numerous
businesses surrounding Desmond

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.940
that seem to be engaging in shady
financial dealings lately.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.940
We can't be too laid back in this situation.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.110
Try to make contact with Desmond immediately.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.070
Give your daughter some candy or
something to get her motivated.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.370
Morning!

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.030
Did you see that thing yesterday?

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.830
I forgot my homework!

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.260
Heh.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.350
Hey, is that her? The girl from
Class 3 that suddenly got a Stella?

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.970
Apparently it's a new record.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.600
I heard she rescued someone.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.560
This star is just so brilliant
that I stand out now.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.890
Really?

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:24.320
Heh.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.410
Good morning, Anya!

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.620
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.210
Call me "Starlight Anya."

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.080
Uh... Sure.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.050
You're totally like a celebrity now.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.760
Everyone looks up to you.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.930
You might even make a hundred friends!

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.600
Bam!

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.100
I totally see you in a new light,
Miss Anya! Be my friend!

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.600
You should totally come over
to my place with your dad!

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.600
Bam!

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.110
Well done, Anya! The mission is now a success!

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.820
And so the world was at peace.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.160
Don't get a big head.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.740
What's their problem?
Ugh! They make me so mad!

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.860
That didn't go as planned.
The world is in peril.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.250
Let's go, Anya.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.220
Let's go, Starlight Anya.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.090
Yup.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.720
Ugh, what a pain.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.140
Ha. That's hilarious.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.770
Who does she think she is?

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.900
She keeps showing off her stupid badge.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.320
Who actually comes to school wearing it?

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.120
Who would believe such a violent
girl actually rescued someone?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.540
They say she saved a kid from drowning,

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.500
but she probably kicked him
in and let him sink herself.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.250
Oh, I could totally see that!

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.960
What if she actually paid the school
a bunch of money for her Stella?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.670
What? She doesn't look that rich to me.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.220
Shock...

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.680
Don't even worry about it.
They're all just jealous.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.310
Hey, Damian. Wouldn't you agree?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.310
She totally cheated, didn't she?

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.310
Do you really think we go
to some third-rate school

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.280
that would hand out Stella by mistake?
Or because someone was being underhanded?

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.490
Is that what you think?

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.320
Uh, no...

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.320
If you've got a problem with our school,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.370
why don't you take the
transfer exam for another one?

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.080
He's so manly at times like this.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.830
Gosh, he's cool.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.380
The fact that she didn't cheat is why I'm so
mad that this little shrimp got ahead of me.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.190
Maybe he's more earnest than he looks.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.180
Let's begin class.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.610
By the way,

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.280
have you decided what your
reward's going to be,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.150
Anâ€”Starlight Anya?

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.110
Reward?

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.700
Of course! Whenever you work
really hard on tests or contests,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.490
you're supposed to get a reward.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.080
You mean I can get peanuts?

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.620
Come on, you should ask for
something way more expensive.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.040
After the test we had the other day,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.000
I got them to buy me a cute
little dress and a tiara!

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.630
But I mean...

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.840
I guess they haven't given me that much.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.770
Is your family part of a secret
organization that pulls the world's strings?

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.640
What are you talking about?
They run a perfectly legitimate company.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.070
Then Anya wants a castle.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.820
That might be asking for too much.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.280
Where would you even put it?

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.660
Then...

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.990
A year's worth of peanuts?

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.080
That shouldn't be a problem at all,
but is that really what you want?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.120
Rewards are difficult.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:16.420
Well... I think the reward that made
me the happiest is my little Wiesel.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.180
Oh, that's my puppy! It's the cutest!

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.220
Come here, Weezy!

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.100
Mister Dog?

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.230
Do you have a dog, too, Second Son?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.860
Huh? A dog?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.190
What are you asking that jerk for?

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.780
Max!

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.710
Who cares?

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.790
Don't talk to me!

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.170
Anya has a doggy now, too.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.590
All right! Let's see who's cuter, yours or my Max!

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.460
Bring it over to my place! And your dad, too!

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.430
Well, hello, Mr. Forger.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.430
Let's stop this war, Mr. Desmond.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.140
And so the world was at peace.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.390
Heh.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.400
You want a dog... as a reward?

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.070
Mm-hm.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.820
Having a dog will bring peace.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.860
Peace? Like peace of mind?

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.570
Hmm... Well, I was thinking
of buying you something.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.450
Miss Anya...

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.540
Taking care of a living creature
requires a lot of work.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.830
It is a very big responsibility!

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.170
Responsibility...

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.470
A dog, huh? Yeah...

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.090
Let's discuss this a bit further.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.300
Loid...

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.390
Papa!

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.980
A properly trained dog may prove
useful in securing this house.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.310
Dogs are so violent, though.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.940
I'm so terribly worried that one
might rip Miss Anya to shreds.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.280
Anya would like a cute puppy, please, Papa.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.490
A tiny one.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.700
Huh? Sure, all right.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.040
Ah, well. I'm sure we can find
a small dog that's still capable.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.540
I'll see if HQ can get us one later.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.050
All right. Why don't we go
to a pet shop this weekend?

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.260
We get a buyer yet?

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.060
Things are pretty tough right now.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.600
We got some punks who think
they're revolutionaries.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.490
What, they gonna use 'em as bomb dogs?

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.820
These little guys sure have it rough,

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.990
getting tinkered with just so they can
end up as toys for some humans.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.230
Shut up! If you want food, quit yer yappin'!

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.770
They sure don't look that smart.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.010
Do Numbers Three and Five look weaker to you?

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.490
Hell if I know. Who cares?

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.520
God, it always reeks in here.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.240
Yeah, let's get the hell outta here.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.020
Anya wants this one...

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.240
Or this one!

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.790
Oh, thank goodness. They look very weak.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.870
PENGUIN PARK
