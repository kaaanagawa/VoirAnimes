ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:40.934
Now, who can answer this problem?
Anya Forger?

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.939
3/3!

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:51.445
Huh. That's completely wrong.

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:05.125
So Twilight, how is
your daughter's academic performance?

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:11.131
Headquarters estimates that eight Stellas
should be achieved in about four months.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.302
Four-- That's no problem.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.971
You've become a terrible liar.

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.682
<i>I'm sure she'll be able to get</i>
<i>eight Tonitos in two months.</i>

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.476
Never mind. By the way,

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:26.938
this morning, an informant
at City Hall was hit.

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.691
The enemy is tightening their grip.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.943
Beware, Twilight.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.528
In addition to the city,

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:37.199
there's no telling if there will be
surveillance within Eden Academy as well.

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.702
<i>The counterintelligence agencies</i>
<i>in this country are formidable.</i>

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.713
What do you guys want?

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.216
We're the National Security Agency.

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.676
Jim Hayward?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.346
We're going to bring you in
on suspicion of espionage.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:03.225
What?! A spy?
What are you talking about? Hey!

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.977
Stop! Let go!

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.522
Your defense will be heard
at the government building.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:17.155
…and that just happened this morning!

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.659
It was so scary!

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.994
I heard that the finance department member

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:26.040
who was taken away was leaking
documents from the government.

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:27.165
What a bad person!

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.334
Good morning.

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:31.211
Oh, good morning!

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.921
Good morning, Camilla.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.800
Oh by the way, Yor,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.261
my boyfriend told me that you haven't even

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.930
told your brother about your marriage?

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.434
Oh, shoot! I forgot!

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.020
Huh? You forgot… For a year?

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.855
What shall I do?

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:50.814
Apparently,

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.775
he said that he'd call here later.

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.404
<i>That's right! I haven't even given him</i>
<i>my new home phone number!</i>

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:00.282
<i>I was so relieved at getting married</i>
<i>that I forgot!</i>

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.285
Hey, is your brother handsome?

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.788
Aw, how cute!

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:09.916
Yes, Yuri is very cute.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.628 line:20%
<i>He's always right by my side saying "Sis!"</i>

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.922 line:20%
<i>Ew, he loves his sister a bit too much…</i>
<i>Never mind.</i>

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:20.760
<i>How can she forget to tell him about</i>
<i>her marriage when he adores her so much.</i>

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.847
Now, let's start again from the beginning.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.476
What type of files and how many copies
were taken out of the government office?

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.896
What's the name and description of
your client and how did you contact them?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.440
When, where and how many times
did you meet with them?

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.774
Take me home.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.780
<i>The National Security Agency.</i>

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.701
<i>The organization aims to</i>
<i>maintain national security,</i>

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.245
<i>and its main task is to hunt down</i>
<i>spies and monitor citizens.</i>

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:53.001
<i>Assault, wiretapping, intimidation,</i>
<i>and torture are routine for them,</i>

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:57.005
<i>and out of fear,</i>
<i>the citizens call them the Secret Police.</i>

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:00.842
Hello, Lieutenant. Boss wants me
to take over the interrogation.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:02.636
Okay. Then,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.139
I'll leave the rest to you,
Second Lieutenant Briar.

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:07.641
Yes, sir! I'll do my best!

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:13.188
<i>Yuri Briar, 20 years old.</i>
<i>The man was in the Secret Police.</i>

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:18.193
Why did the boss let that
naive guy join the team?

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.988
I admit he's brilliant, but honestly, he's
still a kid… Wasn't he a former elite of

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:24.866
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
who had a major leap in his career?

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.910
The boss said…

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:34.668
Huh? Well, isn't Yuri adorable?
He's like a dog.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.378
So, that's that.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.171
I see…

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:42.175
I guess our organization needs
guys like him too.

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.094
<i>Also, when he sets his mind to something,</i>
<i>he does it well.</i>

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.055
<i>It's like he loses his perspective…</i>

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.891
-Hello, Mr. Hayward.
-I'm not going to say a word!

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:52.978
My sister works
at the same City Hall as you do!

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.438
-Huh?
-Do you know her?

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.275
She's beautiful and kind.
I'm proud to call her my sister!

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.986
I'm actually going over there today
to celebrate her marriage!

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.405
I haven't seen her in a while
so I'm really excited!

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.033
So, I'd like to
wrap this up quickly and go home.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.910
Why don't you just tell me everything?

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:11.663
I don't know anything!

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.417
Here are some photos
from your transaction.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.503
This is you, right, Mr. Hayward?

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:22.674
Hey! Since when did you have all this
important photographic evidence?

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.385
I'm sorry. I forgot to turn them in.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.096
It's better for you to be honest.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:36.771
So I just passed on the documents
as instructed and was paid in return.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.942
The only thing I know about him is that
he's from the West.

00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:42.235
I don't even know his name.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.486
Did that man

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.906
have anything particular
about his speech or body language?

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.451
Maybe he didn't seem his age?

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.786
Uh, no, not really…

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.456
I see. Then,

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.293
have you heard the name Twilight?

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.587
Huh? Who?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.798
A spy for the West.
He seems to be a master of disguise.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.802
He is the devil who is responsible
for throwing this country into chaos.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.721
You could say that he is our arch nemesis.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:14.351
If I can help you arrest him,
will my crimes be forgotten?!

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:18.020
-Do you know something?
-Wait. Let me remember… Um…

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:23.276
Be aware that if you lie,
you'll be charged with even more crimes.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.614
I just wanted money to hang out with some
women! I didn't mean to cause trouble!

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.949
Don't you have a wife?

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.327
You're a man! You understand, don't you?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.664
I was just passing along some paper.
I'm no political offender!

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.832
Give me a break! Please!

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.043
Mr. Hayward.
I actually haven't told my sister

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:45.674
that I work for
the National Security Agency.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:48.718
I don't want her to worry
because it's a dangerous job,

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.345
and most of all

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:55.767
I don't want her to know
I'm doing dirty work!

00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:00.605
Mr. Hayward.
What you have done is treason.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.483
It may be a piece of paper to you,

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:07.862
but it could put many lives
in our country at risk!

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.864
Do you understand?

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:13.827
I'm not like you.
I actually love my family… My sister.

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:18.790
I'll do anything to protect this country
where my sister resides.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.751
And I mean anything.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.881
<i>No matter how much you harm me,</i>

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:30.844
<i>I'll never sell out my partners!</i>

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.470
<i>You're so stubborn, Bondman!</i>

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.974
<i>If only she'd concentrate this much</i>
<i>on her studies.</i>

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.017
<i>There are two bullets left!</i>

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:41.062
How many bullets does
Bondman's pistol carry?

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.983
Hm? I believe his gun can
hold up to eight bullets.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.484
2/8!

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.612
That's right! That's correct!

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.865
The number of remaining bullets are 2/8!

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.366
How do you know that phrase…?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.786
<i>Is it easier for her</i>
<i>if she relates it to her cartoons?</i>

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.874
We're in trouble, Loid!

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.625
Welcome home, Yor.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.378
Number of remaining bullets are 2/8!

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:09.632
Apparently, Yuri, my younger brother,
is coming to our house today!

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:11.843
Today?!

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.846
…so that's why

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:17.640
he's saying
he wants to come today to celebrate.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.351
What shall we do?
Do you think he'll find out we're lying?

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.605
Don't worry. I've prepared

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.357
a "friendly spouse set"
for such occasions.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.033
Father and Mother are lovey-dovey.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.201
-We're not!
-We're not!

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.872
Mother's brother still hasn't come?

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:41.998
He's your uncle.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:42.957
Uncle…

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.588
It's late so you can go to bed.

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:51.466
Anya wants to welcome Uncle too…

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.469
It seems like he's working late…

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:02.852
<i>I lost control back there</i>
<i>and now I'm late…</i>

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.898
<i>But… I finally get to see Sis!</i>

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.858
<i>It's been so long! Yay!</i>

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:14.614
<i>The rib that Sis once broke tingles.</i>

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:18.368
<i>My whole body is numb remembering</i>
<i>the love that she wrapped me in!</i>

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.664
<i>Anyway, I wonder why Sis didn't tell me</i>

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.333
<i>about her marriage for an entire year…</i>

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.838
<i>Maybe he's a nefarious person</i>
<i>whom she can't introduce me to?</i>

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:36.386
<i>I'll eliminate all threats</i>
<i>from this country where Sis resides.</i>

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.097
<i>That goes for her partner as well.</i>

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.892
<i>Loid Forger. If he's a son of a gun</i>
<i>threatening my sister,</i>

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.103
<i>I'll have him thrown in jail immediately!</i>

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:49.607
<i>No, relax. She can't find out about</i>
<i>the other side of me.</i>

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:52.443
<i>In order to protect</i>
<i>our happiness and my job,</i>

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.612
<i>I must keep this side of myself hidden!</i>

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.614
<i>Yuri Briar.</i>

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:59.826
<i>The only relative of the Forger family.</i>

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:03.705
<i>The closer you are, the more likely</i>
<i>you are to be exposed. We must be careful.</i>

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:08.877
<i>I can't afford to lose this family</i>
<i>that I've built up so well.</i>

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.881
<i>We all have a side of ourselves</i>
<i>that we don't show anyone.</i>

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:18.386
<i>Whether it's towards our friends, lovers,</i>
<i>or even family,</i>

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.391
<i>we hide our true feelings and true nature</i>

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:25.393
<i>with fake smiles and deception.</i>

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:28.897
<i>And that's how the world is maintaining</i>

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.691
<i>its temporary peace.</i>

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.655
<i>Foreign Minister Windsor held a meeting</i>
<i>with Westalis Foreign Minister Blanz</i>

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:41.326
<i>on June 6th to normalize</i>
<i>diplomatic relations…</i>

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.702
<i>-I'll see…</i>
<i>-I'll determine…</i>

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:46.372
<i>-If this man is detrimental or not.</i>
<i>-If he's fit to be my sister's husband.</i>

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.666
<i>No, there's no way he's fit for that.</i>

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:53.004
I'll take your coat and bags.

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.049
Oh, it's fine. Thank you.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.677
I can quickly prepare something to eat

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.888
so the two of you can go ahead and relax.

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:03.973
Please don't worry about me.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.267
<i>Why would I eat something you cooked?</i>

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:09.520
Yuri, you're scowling.
You must be nervous.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:10.939
No I'm not!

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.442
<i>Oh, no. My hostility was on my face.</i>

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:16.277
-Please, relax.
<i>-I'm still highly strung.</i>

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.445
<i>It was that interrogation.</i>

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.823
<i>-I have to act like a nice wife!</i>
<i>-I have to act like a public servant!</i>

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.744
<i>There's no way I can tell him that</i>
<i>I only got married</i>

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.454
<i>so I could continue my job as an assassin!</i>

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.958
Thank you for the flowers, Yuri.

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:35.964
But Sis, I haven't acknowledged
your marriage yet.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.925
Why didn't you say anything
for an entire year?

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.636
I can't understand it
unless you give me an explanation!

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.722
<i>It's a legitimate response. Now…</i>

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.225
Regarding your brother,

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:50.311
why don't you just tell him everything?

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:53.815
I'm sure that your brother would
understand that the issue of

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.359
a single woman being viewed
with suspicion by the public

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:59.362
is a serious one in this day and age.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:00.655
No!

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:03.992
My brother can be a bit sensitive…

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:06.035
He'll be distraught if he finds out

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.163
that I married someone that

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.873
I don't even love…

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:14.419
That might end up causing you some trouble

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:18.506
and I also don't want my brother to worry.

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.468
Don't worry!

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.847
I have a great excuse for all of this!

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.684
<i>I know Yuri the best,</i>
<i>so please leave it to me!</i>

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.269
<i>I'm counting on you, Yor.</i>

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.522
So why was it, Sis?
Why didn't you tell me?

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:36.524
It was because…

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.527
I forgot to!

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:45.366
Huh? Yeah. Um…

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.534
I forgot to!

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.037
Then how about when
we spoke on the phone last time?

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.457
Why didn't you tell me
you had a husband then?

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.541
That was because…

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:57.420
I forgot that I forgot to tell you
about my marriage.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.385
If you say so, Sis! I understand.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.471
-I'm sorry!
<i>-He's convinced by that?!</i>

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.432
<i>The man had no sense of logic</i>
<i>towards his sister.</i>

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.852
Oh, you're so goofy, Sis!

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:14.437
<i>This is normal in the Briar household?!</i>

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:18.399
Thank you for waiting.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:21.944
<i>Ugh. Don't intrude on</i>
<i>my fun time with Sis!</i>

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.946
<i>No…</i>

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:28.033
<i>If I continue to be rude to him,</i>
<i>Sis might not like me anymore…</i>

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:28.951
<i>I have to pretend…</i>

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.664
Isn't Loid's cooking delicious?

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:39.253
<i>Don't think I'll acknowledge you</i>
<i>with just your cooking, you outcast!</i>

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:44.342
That's right, I brought some wine!
Here you are.

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:46.260
How kind of you.

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:49.013
<i>I'll get you drunk</i>
<i>and make you expose your filthy self!</i>

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.475
-None for you, Yor.
-I know!

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:53.518
<i>What a bummer.</i>

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:57.355
So, where did you two meet?

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.607
At a boutique on Third Avenue.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.527
I felt a stranger staring at me

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.904
-I thought, "Wow!"
-Well, you know.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:08.032
It was because she's so beautiful!
<i>That made me sound suspicious!</i>

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:12.286
<i>This topic is going to get us exposed.</i>
<i>I have to change the subject.</i>

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.040
After a few more meals together,
we hit it off.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:20.128
When, where, how many times,
and at which restaurants did you eat at?

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:24.215
How many times did you meet before dating?
What made you decide to marry her?

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.341
Um…

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:27.051
<i>What's with this interrogation?</i>

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.804
What do you two call each other?

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:32.557
Huh? Well… Yor and…

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.309
<i>Yor?! Even I don't call her Yor!</i>

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.103
Sis, what do you call him?

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:39.272
-Loy Loy, or Lotty or something?
-Huh?

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:43.151
Ahh! Lotty!

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.695
Damn it!

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.866
I just call him Loid!

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:54.871
<i>The man loses his cool</i>
<i>when it concerns his sister…</i>

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.956
Are you okay? Here, some water.

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:05.089
<i>What does Sis like about him?</i>

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:09.093
<i>Just because he's a doctor</i>
<i>that can cook a little,</i>

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:11.846
<i>is handsome, tall, and considerate…</i>

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.640
Damn it!

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.601
Relax, Yuri!

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:19.145
<i>I guess the Briar family</i>
<i>can't handle their liquor.</i>

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:22.398
By the way, Yuri,
you're a diplomat, right?

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:23.649
<i>Let's change the subject.</i>

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.610
That's such a great job.

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:28.613
Yor is always bragging about it.

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:29.614
Huh?

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:33.868
Dominic told me
that you went to Hugaria recently!

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.286
Huh? Oh.

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:37.663
It was just for work.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:41.417
<i>But you're right. It was a beautiful city.</i>

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.669
<i>I wish I could've shown you, Sis!</i>

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:48.090
<i>There were lots of cafes. In a restaurant</i>
<i>where the Empress used to go…</i>

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:52.762
Was it in the capital Obda?
There are lots of delicious restaurants.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:56.140
I went once a while back
for medical training.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:57.683
Really?

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.977
<i>I used to go to Carpathia a lot.</i>

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.647
<i>The soup made by the owner was excellent.</i>

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.607
<i>I ate that too!</i>

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:10.112
So this wine was from Hugaria!
What a great product.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.864
<i>-This.</i>
-Oh, that's…

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.116
<i>I bought it on Hedger Street.</i>

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.119
…something I came across
at a store on Hedger Street.

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:19.121
It must've been expensive.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.626
<i>-Probably 200 dalcs.</i>
-No, only about 200 dalcs.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.628
<i>I knew it.</i>

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.632
That's plenty expensive. Thank you.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.260
<i>These questions and answers.</i>

00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:36.138
<i>They're one of the fictional story manuals</i>
<i>used by Ostania's intelligence agencies.</i>

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:40.142
<i>A template for faking a trip</i>
<i>to another country.</i>

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.895
<i>Which means, this story is a complete lie.</i>

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.399
<i>In fact, Carpathia's owner has</i>
<i>put his son in charge of the restaurant.</i>

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:50.736
<i>The price of this wine also rose to</i>
<i>300 dalcs due to the poor harvest.</i>

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.531
<i>You might be able to trick a newbie,</i>

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:56.659
<i>but it won't work on me, Yuri Briar.</i>

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.745
<i>I was wary when I heard he worked</i>
<i>for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</i>

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:03.165
<i>Being a diplomat is like</i>
<i>a gateway to becoming a spy.</i>

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.960
<i>I had Franky check, and there is</i>

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:09.171
<i>evidence that he worked as a staff member</i>
<i>until about a year ago.</i>

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.425
<i>He must've been scouted by</i>
<i>the intelligence community after that.</i>

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.969
<i>From the bit of information I have,</i>

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:17.888
<i>this man belongs to</i>
<i>the domestic counterintelligence agency.</i>

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:21.183
<i>WISE's enemy, the Secret Police!</i>
<i>But, well,</i>

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:25.354
<i>although it's risky, it's not a bad idea</i>
<i>to continue our friendship</i>

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.690
<i>as long as he doesn't suspect</i>
<i>my true identity.</i>

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:31.485
<i>If I can outsmart him, he can be a</i>
<i>great source of information on the enemy!</i>

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.696
I'll send you something in return.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.199
Yuri, isn't it great that you have
such a nice older brother now?

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:40.202
<i>It seems like he's hiding that identity</i>
<i>from Yor as well.</i>

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:43.748
<i>It may be quite easy to</i>
<i>keep him under control.</i>

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:44.957
Yuri?

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:48.711
I told you I won't acknowledge him, Sis!

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:51.089
Who'd call someone like him a brother?!

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:52.965
You're being rude, Yuri!

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.967
It's just like you said.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:59.555
I became a respectable member of society
and can now afford expensive liquor.

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:01.974
But that's all thanks to Sis!

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.810
We were poor when our parents died,

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:08.397
<i>so we couldn't afford</i>
<i>proper learning supplies. But…</i>

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:12.693
Sis is late…
I wonder if she's still working…

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:15.237
I'm home, Yuri!

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.447
Sis!

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.785
What happened? You're covered in blood!
What kind of a job were you doing?

00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:24.455
Oh, don't worry! It's just blood splatters
from someone else!

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.208
Never mind that, Yuri. Look what I got!

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:32.005 line:20%
Ta-da! The illustrated reference books
you wanted!

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:35.049 line:20%
I got paid a lot from my part-time job,
so I bought it!

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:37.718
Sis…

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:38.677
Ta-da!

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:42.723
<i>Sis worked herself to a pulp just for me.</i>

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:45.142
<i>So I decided that</i>

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:48.687
<i>I'd quickly become successful, so that</i>
<i>I could become a man who can protect Sis.</i>

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:53.234
<i>I was the one that was going to protect</i>
<i>my only blood relative.</i>

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:57.321
Do you understand how I feel
when a flimsy man like you

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:00.741
takes the most important
person in my life?

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:03.244
Yuri…

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:05.579
Of course, I wanted you to get married

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.873
and be happy sooner or later.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:12.253
But that person has to be someone
who can protect you more than me!

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:15.256
Are you really going to be able to
fill that role?!

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.591
-Lotty!
-Lo…

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.179
<i>I don't want my brother to worry…</i>

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:24.557
I…

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:28.561
love Yor as much as you do.

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.439
My daughter loves Yor too.

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:35.068
<i>No. He's just acting</i>
<i>to convince my brother.</i>

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:38.362
She's already family to me.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:41.074
Even if spears were to fall,
or meteorites were to fall,

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:45.202
I will protect her
for the rest of my life.

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:47.830
<i>The man was a blatant liar.</i>

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.042
<i>Did he say meteorite?!</i>

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:54.336
<i>I'm confident that I can protect her</i>
<i>from spears but a meteorite?!</i>

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.339
<i>Maybe he's quite amazing after all. How?</i>

00:20:57.423 --> 00:21:01.094
It's easier said than done, you liar!

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.345
Yeah! You have the face of a liar!

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:05.598
Oh, no!

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.683
Yuri has always been a bit sloppy.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:10.603
<i>I have the face of a liar?</i>
<i>Has he seen through me?</i>

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.104
<i>No, that can't be.</i>

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.445
Huh? You've been married for a year

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:21.822
and just because your hands touched?

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.075
Huh? Are you two really married?

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.370
What are you saying?
We're always lovey-dovey.

00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:30.331
That's right!

00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:31.540
It's suspicious.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:35.127
If you really say you're married,
prove it!

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.631
-We have our marriage certificate.
-That's not what I mean!

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.634
Kiss each other right now.

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:43.051
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.137
If you love each other,
it's easy, isn't it?

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.598
But in front of someone?

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:51.769
Just once, and I'll be convinced.

00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:54.688
If you can't, I'll go and have
the marriage revoked!
