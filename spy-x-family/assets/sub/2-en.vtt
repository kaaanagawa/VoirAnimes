ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.556
It's not going to work.

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:37.807
What?

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.350
Anya doesn't want this mother.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.520
Franky, you're not suited
to playing the role of a mother.

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:46.315
With your skills,
couldn't you have done a better job?

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.776
There's only so much I can do
with your height and body.

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:52.196
I can't believe I did all this for you!

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.574
-Operation Strix.
-I'll give you some peanuts.

00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:57.827
We passed the written exam to
infiltrate the prestigious Eden Academy,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.328
for a top-secret assignment

00:01:59.412 --> 00:02:01.956
given to me,
as an agent of Westalis Intelligence,

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.959
to stop the war plans of Desmond,

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.211
a key figure in Ostania.

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:11.173
But I had no idea that they'd require both
parents to be present at the interview.

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:14.176
Oh well…

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:16.012
I guess I'll get married.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:17.179
SECURE A WIFE

00:02:17.263 --> 00:02:20.433
Did you hear that
we might've been burgled?

00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:25.021
I heard that all the women's
personal information files were ransacked.

00:02:25.104 --> 00:02:27.690
How creepy is that?

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:30.401
I think our manager is creepier.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:33.029
He was staring at me creepily
just this morning.

00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:35.656
It's because
you're wearing such a short skirt.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.576
What? Well, it makes my boyfriend happy.

00:02:39.452 --> 00:02:42.496
Sharon, you have a nice body too,
you should show more leg!

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.582
You don't do such things
when you have a kid.

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.877
What do you think, Yor?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.337
Isn't it creepy?

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:51.380
Hm?

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:54.175
Is that coffee for the manager?
We should put a booger in it!

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:55.134
Huh?

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:58.262
Will putting a booger in it
make it taste better?

00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:03.934
Yor, you're so unique.

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:04.852
Wha--?

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:08.648
I agree! You're so odd that
men probably aren't attracted to you.

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:09.857
Hey, Millie.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.735
Yor, you have great features,
so if you dress up more,

00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:14.612
I'm sure you'll be popular!

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:15.529
Oh…

00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:18.616
I'll introduce you to some of
my favorite cosmetics!

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.870
If I can keep my job,
that's good enough for me.

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.915
But you're already 27, aren't you?

00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:27.917
You should be careful.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.545
You know how
there's been a lot of spy activity?

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.924
Because of that, people have been
reporting even the smallest things.

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:38.302
Just the other day,
a woman in her late twenties was

00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:42.431
reported by her neighbors saying she
was suspicious because she lives alone.

00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:44.976
What? Really? How crazy!

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.228
Camilla, you're so well-informed!

00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:51.107
I guess it is odd that she's alone
at that age. How suspicious.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.152
I see. Thank you for the warning.

00:03:57.196 --> 00:04:00.908
That's right! I'll be having a party
at my house this weekend!

00:04:00.992 --> 00:04:03.327
You should come, Yor.

00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:05.204
Of course, you're welcome to bring a date.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.376
Don't you think you set the bar too high?

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.963
Maybe the creepy culprit who broke in here
would be willing to accompany her.

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:16.090
How mean!

00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:22.471
Hello? Briar residence.

00:04:22.555 --> 00:04:24.140
Hey sis! How are you?

00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:25.641
Yuri!

00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:27.226
How's work?

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:30.479
It's fine.
I'm still working at the same place!

00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:33.691
You're a bit odd, so I'm worried.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.568
I'm normal! How rude of you.

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.071
Are you thinking of marriage yet?
Is there anyone special?

00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:40.698
That topic again?

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.451
Actually, I'm being offered a promotion,

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:47.830
so I'll be busy flying around
even more than I am now.

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:52.460
But I'm worried about leaving you,
so I'm debating whether to take it or not.

00:04:53.127 --> 00:04:56.756
I'm the person I am today because of you,
and I'm grateful to you.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.716
That's why I want you to be happy.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.720
I know. Thanks, Yuri.

00:05:03.304 --> 00:05:04.930
I can introduce you to someone.

00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:07.391
What? No, it's fine!

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:10.728
In fact,
I'm going to a party this weekend!

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.229
Of course, with a date!

00:05:12.313 --> 00:05:13.814
What? You have a boyfriend?

00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:17.109
Yes! So don't worry about me.

00:05:17.193 --> 00:05:21.238
I'm so glad! It's a party for work, right?

00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:22.782
Yes, at Camilla's.

00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:27.745
Oh! Then I'll have to talk to Dominic
and ask him what kind of guy he was!

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:28.662
Huh?

00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:31.332
You're really gullible,

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:33.751
so I'll have to get rid of him
if he's a loser.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.169
Huh? Um…

00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:38.506
I'll put my promotion on pause
until I'm sure he's a good guy!

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:39.882
You don't have to do that!

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:42.968
I'll be looking forward to it!
Bye! Good night!

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.101
What shall I do?
I have to find someone for the party.

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:52.728
If he finds out I'm lying,

00:05:52.812 --> 00:05:57.650
I'll lose even more credibility
because I'll be a freak and a liar.

00:05:57.733 --> 00:06:00.903
I have to find someone good, so my
little brother will take the promotion!

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:06.075
Yuri, I was lying!
I was only joking earlier!

00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:09.912
Oh? A rare sibling fight?

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:13.666
Oh, "Shopkeeper"?
I'm sorry, that was a mistake.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.671
Good evening.
I have a client for you, Thorn Princess.

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:21.382
The Royal Hotel.

00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.052
Room 1307.

00:06:28.264 --> 00:06:33.519
I'm sorry, my lady.
This floor is currently reserved.

00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:36.730
-Did someone order a woman?
-I don't know.

00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:42.361
But I heard that
there was a traitorous bastard here.

00:06:45.698 --> 00:06:46.907
What was that?

00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:49.201
There's an intruder! It's a woman!

00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:58.377
Excuse me, you're Deputy Secretary Brennan
of the Auditing Board, correct?

00:06:59.003 --> 00:07:00.921
I'm terribly sorry,

00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:05.926
but may I take your last breath?

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:13.309
Her codename is Thorn Princess.
She's an assassin.

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:17.062
She has been trained in
the art of killing from an early age,

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:21.734
and has continued to take on dirty jobs
at the behest of her employers.

00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:23.903
It won't come out!

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.365
What? No! What am I going to do?

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:33.120
This is my only good dress!
How can I go to the party?

00:07:36.332 --> 00:07:38.167
Is there anyone special?

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.669
I guess it is odd that she's alone
at that age.

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:43.255
Of course, you're welcome to bring a date.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.799
It's impossible…

00:07:45.883 --> 00:07:50.763
The only housework I'm good at is
cleaning up.

00:07:53.057 --> 00:07:54.016
Scruffy!

00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:58.520
I got a list of unmarried women
from City Hall for you.

00:07:58.604 --> 00:07:59.563
Thanks.

00:08:00.064 --> 00:08:03.567
A woman who's okay with children
and a divorcee, but with class worthy of

00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:07.196
a prestigious school, and ready
to proceed with marriage within 48 hours.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:09.865
I'd love to worship such a goddess
if she exists.

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.910
I'm not picky,
but I can't even get a date.

00:08:13.744 --> 00:08:15.955
-How pathetic.
-Don't call me pathetic!

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.210
Are you at a disadvantage because of me?
Will Anya get in the way?

00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:25.422
You won't be in the way.
Don't worry and go watch some TV.

00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:26.340
Okay.

00:08:33.973 --> 00:08:38.227
Why don't you just use a female agent
or someone from your agency?

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.439
The recent spy hunts have wiped out
most of them, so there's no one good.

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:45.025
Oh, because people are
all about snitching these days.

00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:49.488
They're so understaffed that
another new assignment came my way.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.283
They want me to destroy
a certain smuggling ring.

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:56.578
How dangerous is that?
Let's just hurry up and choose one.

00:08:56.662 --> 00:09:00.457
The quickest way is to find someone
who wants to get married as well.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:04.044
We can try to find their weakness. If
they don't have one, we can make one up.

00:09:04.128 --> 00:09:06.547
I want to avoid unnecessary risks.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.550
What are you saying?
She's already risky enough.

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:13.554
She doesn't look like a daughter
from a good family at all.

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:18.058
You're right. I have to do something
about her appearance.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:25.065
I'll take her measurements,
so this way, young lady.

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:27.484
You're going to sell Anya!

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.528
If you're a good girl, I won't sell you.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:33.657
Where does she learn to say those things?

00:09:36.702 --> 00:09:39.246
The seamstress is married.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.167
The mistress was on the list of
unmarried women earlier,

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.462
but she has history of
an arrest for political campaigning,

00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:48.047
which will pose a risk.

00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:52.051
When it comes to favorable conditions,
it's not easy.

00:09:54.136 --> 00:09:56.096
Excuse me!

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.807
Oh, Yor! Long time no see!

00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:02.603
Hello. I want you to fix my dress.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.271
May I ask you to rush it?

00:10:04.355 --> 00:10:07.358
Of course, since you're a regular here.

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:10.611
How did she sneak up behind me?
Who is she?

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:14.365
Yor… Yor… There she is.

00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:18.660
Yor Briar, 27 years old.
No history of marriage or divorce.

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:22.748
Both her parents are deceased,
but she has a younger brother.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.709
They're both public servants
and their backgrounds aren't suspicious.

00:10:26.585 --> 00:10:29.880
Maybe I didn't notice her
because I've been a bit careless lately.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:34.802
Um… You've been staring at me.
Did you need something?

00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:38.097
What? She noticed I was observing her?
Oh! I'm sorry…

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.349
I was just thinking how beautiful you are.

00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:45.562
Does that mean you like my appearance?

00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.398
Huh? Well, yes.

00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:52.611
Yor, you have great features, so if you
dress up more, I'm sure you'll be popular!

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:53.862
Um--

00:10:53.946 --> 00:10:57.199
Father! We measured Anya's length!

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.118
Oh, who's she?

00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:00.285
Another customer.

00:11:00.369 --> 00:11:01.620
He has a child…

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:06.166
I almost invited someone's spouse.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.003
I've heard that actions like that can
get you killed by the wife.

00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:12.464
In my case, I'd just kill them back, but…

00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:13.674
Huh?

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.926
No, no. People will find out

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:19.263
that I'm an assassin if I keep on
thinking like this.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.598
I need to become more normal.

00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:24.101
Assassin?

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:27.813
Spy? Assassin? Anya is…

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.022
excited!

00:11:29.106 --> 00:11:31.316
The girl was hungry for entertainment.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.821
I thought about taking her as my wife,
but maybe not.

00:11:36.572 --> 00:11:40.200
I was hoping to have him
be my date for the party,

00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:43.078
but I'll have to abort to avoid drama.

00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:49.418
Oh, Anya's so sad that
she doesn't have a mother!

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.752
Why so suddenly?

00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:53.714
I miss the presence of a mother!

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.757
You're not here with your wife?

00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.426
Oh… no.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:02.556
My wife died two years ago, so
I've been raising her as a single father.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.934
I won't be killed even if I invite him?

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.645
Um!

00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:13.150
Pretend to be your boyfriend?

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:18.197
Yes. I lied to my brother
and told him that I have a boyfriend.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.159
If it is not too much trouble, I'd like to
ask if you could come to a party with me…

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:26.413
I don't have
any ulterior motives or anything!

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.415
And of course, I'll thank you properly.

00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:32.961
I just want to
give my brother peace of mind.

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:36.715
Okay. I'll accept.

00:12:37.633 --> 00:12:38.800
Really?

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:41.220
However, I'd like to
ask you for something in return.

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:45.891
Therefore,

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:49.519
we'd like to ask you to pretend to
be her mother for the interview.

00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:51.104
A mother?

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:57.027
In these uncertain times, I want
my daughter to get into a good school.

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:01.573
That is also the wish of my late wife.

00:13:01.657 --> 00:13:03.075
Father's a liar.

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.369
What a wonderful person!

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.205
First, I'll get her to agree
to a small request,

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.958
and then I'll eventually get her to
agree to a formal marriage.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.709
I'll do whatever I can.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:16.546
Thank you.
Then I'll see you at Saturday's party.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.881
Okay.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:24.096
I requested a babysitter for Saturday,
so be good, okay?

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.764
Stock up on peanuts!

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.391
Fine.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:30.102
Here. Ten pents change, ribbit.

00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:32.104
Thank you, ribbit!

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:33.146
Ribbit?

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.276
T? No. An F cipher.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.409
Additional mission details?

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:51.581
Recover art stolen from the West
and destroy the smuggling ring.

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:55.419
Execution is at 6 p.m. on Saturday
when the target contacts the buyer.

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.421
Saturday?

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:01.425
Therefore,

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:05.512
we have to finish this quickly, so I can
make it to the party in time. Help me.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:09.641
Wait! I'm just an informant,
my fighting skills are garbage!

00:14:09.725 --> 00:14:12.060
And you hardly ever pay me for anything!

00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:16.106
Seventy-eight works of art worth
a total of three million dalcs.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:20.068
I'm sure they won't notice
one or two of them missing.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.070
Leave it to me.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:26.742
I'm the guy who invented
new spy stuff for a day like this!

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:27.784
How useful.

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.792
Loid is late…

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:40.172
I hope he's not been
in an accident or anything…

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:48.722
You didn't tell me
there would be so many of them!

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.642
There are 38 of them.

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:54.269
I can't spend more than
ten seconds on each person!

00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:04.196
It's endless!

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.323
I packed everything! Get in!

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.788
Woo!

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.707
Now, which one shall I have?

00:15:18.377 --> 00:15:19.628
I'll have this one.

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.422
A diamond! That's not fair!
That looks expensive!

00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:24.007
It'll be part of my disguise.

00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:25.842
Shut up and give it back!

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:41.608
I see… I guess
this is what they call "being played."

00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:47.239
For my brother's sake, I must maintain
good relationships at my workplace.

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:51.493
Therefore, I can't afford
to miss this party.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:57.374
You're late, Yor!

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:00.377
I'm sorry. This is for you.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.420
Huh?

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:04.589
I heard you were bringing your boyfriend.

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:07.342
He had some urgent business to attend to.

00:16:07.426 --> 00:16:10.387
What! How disappointing!
I wanted to meet him!

00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:12.514
What kind of excuse was that?

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:13.849
It makes me cringe!

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:17.144
I knew for sure she was
bluffing about having a man.

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:18.895
Shall we report her for being a liar?

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:19.896
Yes!

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:25.068
She must be a spy used to
lower the birth rate in our country!

00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:26.945
What? What a lame tale.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.906
She's just a girl who can't get a man.
Just ignore her.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:34.369
Aw, I was so excited
to meet your boyfriend.

00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:36.413
D-Dominic.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:40.125
Since Yuri's always worried about you.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.420
Um… Could you tell my brother that

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:46.423
I brought a nice man?

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.508
What? No way!

00:16:48.592 --> 00:16:51.511
Do you really want to go that far?

00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:53.930
That'll just make you seem more miserable.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:57.350
-Hey, stop Camilla!
-Stop chatting with someone else's man!

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:01.897
I'll be honest with your little brother
and tell him you came alone.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.067
Will she benefit in some way
from doing that?

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.446
What a nuisance.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:12.699
If all the adults here die,

00:17:12.783 --> 00:17:14.576
my brother won't have to find out…

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:17.454
I'm sorry. Have fun while you're here!

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:21.583
Come on, Camilla. Help me cook the gratin.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.671
And that guy…

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.173
Mommy!

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:34.346
My older son here is taking the
entrance exam for Eden Academy this year!

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.140
How amazing!

00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:39.559
-He's going to be an elite!
-That must be what it's like.

00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:42.312
To be normal…

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:47.275
I guess my brother
wanted me to be like them.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.903
Hey, she's still here.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.696
How is she so mentally strong?

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.866
I can't believe she had the courage
to come alone.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.704
I see. I guess I don't belong here.

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.291
I'm sorry,

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:05.919
I'm going to excuse myself--

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:14.177
I'm sorry I'm late!
I'm Loid Forger, Yor's husband.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:18.974
Um, you don't have to be my husband.
Just my boyfriend…

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.308
Oh, shoot!

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.060
I got it confused with my mission.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:25.021
Oh, Mr. Forger. You're bleeding…

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.899
Oh, sorry. One of my emergency patients
got a bit out of control.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.361
It's quite common
in the field of psychiatry.

00:18:31.987 --> 00:18:33.363
Were you having fun, Yor?

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.739
You must be joking.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.117
You are married, Yor?

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:38.994
Why didn't you say anything?

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:40.704
Uh… Well…

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:44.332
It's a bit embarrassing, but I was
once married and I have a child,

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.376
so maybe she was just a bit concerned…

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:51.047
This can't be true! There's no way
Yor has such a handsome husband!

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.216
I'm going to humiliate her!

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.678
Yor! The gratin is fresh out of the oven!

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.222
Oops! I slipped!

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.065
It's good that you value food,

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:12.152
but it's rude to use your feet, Yor.

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:13.737
I'm sorry!

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.573
-That's what they got out of this?
-This is good!

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:17.741
Yes, it is.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.076
Mr. Ranger, did you know?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.994
It's Forger.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:26.041
I heard she had a shady job
before she came to the government job!

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.793
-What was it?
-Stop it!

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:34.007
Men would call you and you'd go to hotels
to give them massages? How scandalous!

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.759
That was…

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:39.220
I was called in to stab someone
disguised as an acupuncturist…

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:42.891
No, she's got it wrong, Loid. I…

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:44.309
-It's admirable.
-Huh?

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.647
Yor lost her parents when she was young

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.025
and had to work hard to
look after her younger brother.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:56.988
It requires more than just determination
to endure and continue hard work

00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:00.992
for the sake of someone or something,

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.869
at the expense of oneself.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.997
That's something
she should be proud about.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.793
-Let's go home, Yor.
-Okay.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:12.003
Thank you for the delicious food.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.176
I'm sorry I said husband…

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.302
Oh, no problem.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.555
What should we say
if word gets to your brother?

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.643
Well, Loid…

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.269
This is just an idea, but…

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:34.234
What?

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.112
Are they remnants of the smuggling ring?

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.239
-Hold on tight, Yor!
-Huh?

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:48.373
How did they know where we were?
Was there a tracker in the art?

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.835
You're being really careless
these days, Twilight!

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.379
Who are they?

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:56.339
Um…

00:20:56.423 --> 00:21:00.719
It seems like my patient's hysteria
has not subsided yet.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:04.097
It must be hard being a doctor.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.348
She believed that?

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:08.059
Let's get away for now.

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:12.063
The van is abandoned.

00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:15.400
They must be hiding somewhere.
Let's split and find them!

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.408
Yor, come this way!

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:28.163
Is it okay to punch your patients?

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:29.414
Well, um…

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:34.294
It's a new treatment method in the medical
field called concussive therapy.

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:35.420
I see.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.840
I don't know if she's sharp or dull.

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.176
Be careful, Yor!

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.846
Another one? I can't get him--

00:21:50.852 --> 00:21:54.314
I'm sorry! I'm an amateur,
yet I just treated a patient!

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:58.818
I'm actually good at self-defense
and stuff. My brother taught me and…

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:01.821
Thank you, Yor!

00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:08.244
How amazing! You sent him flying!

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:11.414
I'm sorry for sending him flying.

00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:14.125
There they are!

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:18.213
Don't go easy on them! Finish them!

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:29.015
Um, Loid. I'm sorry to bring this up
at a time like this,

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.226
but would you like to get married?

00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:37.148
What?

00:22:37.232 --> 00:22:40.527
Just something like
an extension of our terms…

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:44.906
Apparently single women, such as myself

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:47.492
are found to be suspicious,

00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:49.536
so to blend in…

00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:52.789
In order to continue my job
as an assassin as well.

00:22:53.331 --> 00:22:54.541
What I'm trying to say is…

00:22:55.124 --> 00:22:58.837
Rather than just ending it
after the interview,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.548
what about making it official?

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:04.551
For our mutual benefit!

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.388
He's probably the only person

00:23:08.972 --> 00:23:11.558
who'll accept me for who I am.

00:23:14.644 --> 00:23:17.897
Then let's stop by City Hall on
the way home and get the process started.

00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:18.898
Now?

00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:21.943
Strike while the iron is hot.
Oh, that's right.

00:23:25.238 --> 00:23:26.781
Where did I drop it?

00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:28.908
Bastards!

00:23:28.992 --> 00:23:31.077
We found them!

00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:34.789
Shoot 'em dead!

00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:37.500
Yor, in times of sickness…

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.295
and in times of sorrow,
