WEBVTT

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.270
The time has come.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.990
Let us check our personal effects.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.830
All clear, sir.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.330
And now, our appearances.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.590
All clear, sir.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.530
And a final check of our verbal etiquette.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.280
All set, please. Will do my best, please.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.850
I feel nothing but anxiety about this,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.440
but we've done everything we could.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.980
Now, onward...

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.090
THE PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL'S INTERVIEW

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.140
To Eden College's interview!

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.300
It's so big!

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.190
Well, it is one of this country's top schools.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.460
And there are so many examinees...

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.310
They're all our rivals.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.870
Anya, are you going to
be okay in this crowd?

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.240
I'll be okay, please.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.180
Let us go, then.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.040
This feeling...

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.440
There's no doubt about it.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.330
I've experienced this many times.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.570
Someone is watching us. Could it be...

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.570
Is there an enemy hidden in this crowd?

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.330
An enemy?

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.860
I feel someone's gaze...

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.300
No, that's not it.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.670
I'm not the only one being watched.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.930
It's always an unpleasant
feeling to be observed like this.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.020
There.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.710
Four in the overhead passage.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.100
Four in the bell tower.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.400
More in the buildings to the left and right.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.990
I have information on most
of the staff at this school.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.910
Those... are the instructors.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.840
They're observing every action that
everyone is taking and scoring them

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.650
to see if they're worthy of this school.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.880
Which means... the exam has already begun.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.390
I need you two to be on your guard.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.220
We're being watched by the examiners.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.030
Huh?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.790
We'll do this just as we practiced.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.360
D-68, fail.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.780
A-12, fail.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.420
G-114, pass.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.050
I must say, the examinees
this year lack refinement.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.460
They all lack true elegance.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.850
Good morning, Housemaster.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.840
Eden College

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.280
It displeases me to know their crude feet

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.940
are trudging upon the blessed
ground of our school.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.910
Elegance creates tradition.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.640
Elegance is what truly makes
this world a paradise.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.250
Fail any family lacking
elegance immediately.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.850
Yes, sir.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.460
Hm?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.700
Oho...

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.680
It appears that not all hope has been lost.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.680
They are paying their respects
to the statue of our founder?!

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.420
I, Twilight, am a man of a thousand faces.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.380
Becoming exactly the person my target
wants me to be is mere child's play.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.410
Behold!

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.510
I haven't the slightest clue
as to who this gentleman is,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.920
but everything should be fine as
long as I do what Loid is doing.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.180
Baldy head!

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.030
S-So elegant!

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.270
How very elegant!

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.360
Who is that family?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.030
K-212. They are the Forgers, sir.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.460
Their daughter Anya just barely passed
the written exam with a score of 31.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.520
Absolutely not elegant!
And such awful penmanship!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.680
So the father has remarried?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.420
Might they be an impromptu
family for admission purposes?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.260
I am not certain. We must investigate.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.250
We must ascertain whether
or not they have true elegance.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.250
We'll confirm your admission numbers here.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.230
G-114. Please go to Hall 1.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.180
Ah, A-12. Please enter Hall 2.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.380
I see they're wasting no
time with the screening.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.690
K-212. Please head to Hall 1.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.690
We're still being observed.
Don't let your guard down.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.470
It's so nerve-racking
being watched like this...

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.540
I need to pick my nose.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.670
Absolutely not.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.830
Oh, no!

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.370
I've accidentally fallen into
the gutter, and I can't get out!

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.070
Uh... That's too blatant if
they're trying to test us.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.230
Oh, no. Whatever shall I do?

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.080
Perhaps they're thinking
he might be a threat,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.080
Ah, I don't know what I should do.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.960
but no one is trying to go near him.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.900
Who knew there'd be a gutter here?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.410
But if he is part of the test,
we must deal with this accordingly.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.630
I'm so shocked. I'm really stuck.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.130
Papa! Mama! There is someone
who needs our help, please!

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.350
Let us save him!

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.890
Are you all right, lad?

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.760
Oh, no! I've slipped and I cannot get up!

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.190
This is all for merits... More merits!

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.240
Precisely.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.510
You're heading to an interview. You wouldn't
dare sully your clothes with sewage.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.780
Now, how will you elegantly get through—

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.610
Are you hurt?

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.260
Use my hanky, please.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.120
Make sure you go to
the infirmary, just in case.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.290
Clearly, I expected too much.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.040
In the end, they were just some
commoners from the countryside.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.800
Do not think for a second that you can

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.310
set foot in our house of
learning wearing soiled clothes.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.390
Throw K-212 out immediately.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.600
Oh, no... These people are
going to fail because of me.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.140
Um, I'm so sorr—

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.720
Thank goodness we anticipated this,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.020
and prepared a change of
clothes just in case!

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.540
Who in the world would
ever anticipate that?!

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.570
Besides, your grey suit seems to
fit the attire at this school more.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.330
If I had continued wearing my previous suit,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.960
we would've been mistaken for
commoners from the countryside.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.140
Thank you for giving us the
opportunity to change, lad.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.230
On top of everything else,
they even thanked the boy!

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.130
Brilliant... So smart, and elegant!

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.130
Curse you and your cunning, Loid Forger.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.860
Housemaster, we are supposed
to be testing the child.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.690
Silence!

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.790
Children learn from their parents' example!

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.280
Yes. The parents of a child who scores 30
points must also be only worth 30 points!

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.390
I'll make you reveal your true identity yet!

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.830
Oh, no!

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.860
The animals have escaped the farmhouse!

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.160
You're really going this far, Eden College?!

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.950
Hey, don't push me!

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.680
Just go, you moron!

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.420
Mommy! Mommy, Mommy!

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.650
Shut up!

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.220
Are they trying to see if we reveal
our true selves in an emergency?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.930
We'll be playing right into the
examiners' hands if we panic.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.080
Do not break Formation D.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.770
We will show these animals
nothing but benevolence!

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.930
Hey.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.420
Who told you to go that far?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.930
Wait...

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.250
It wasn't you, Housemaster?

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.390
Impossible! Is this...

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.860
an actual accident?!

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.730
There are some very important
people among the examinees!

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.780
Go stop this mess before they're hurt!

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.120
I'm the Vice Minister of
the Ministry of Finance!

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.480
Hell if I care! I'm the
CEO of the Central Bank!

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.290
Wait! Father!

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.650
Well done, you!

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.230
Are you all right?

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:00.740
Loid!

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.370
It's happening to Miss Anya again.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.870
The mass panic must've hit her.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.610
The test is the last thing
I need to worry about now.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.880
That must be the leader of this herd.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.770
That's the one I need to stop,
but I'll have to use my gun—

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.420
No...

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.400
Please look after Miss Anya for a moment.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.420
Yor?

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.940
I-It's not what you think!

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.580
I once learned about pressure points that
can stop one's movements in a yoga class!

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.990
I-I figured they might work on cows, too!

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.020
Please don't look at me like that!

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.260
Ms. Cow?

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.960
Is she scared?

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.540
That's dangerous, Anya!

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.400
S'okay, please. Don't be scared.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.130
What are you—

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.890
They're gonna go home now.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.270
Apparently so.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.910
Thankfully, no one was hurt.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.040
E-Ele...

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.630
Ele-le... Ele-le-le-le...

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.430
Elegance!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.180
Housemaster?

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.260
Forger!

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.520
He's...

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.510
one of the housemasters.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.280
Is he in charge of this exam?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.730
Y-You helped us avoid a crisis. I thank you.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.390
And... you have bested me for today.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.250
To give us all time to collect
ourselves after this chaos,

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.570
we will be delaying the
start of the interviews.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.670
Return to your hall once you've
had a moment to tidy yourselves.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.700
Your family has the right
to apply to our school.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.810
Sir...

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.190
It looks like we've avoided failure.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.290
I humbly thank you for your generosity.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.400
But have no fear.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.200
We anticipated something like this...

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.520
and prepared another change of clothes.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.040
This isn't about elegance anymore!
These people are just scary!

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.370
The Forgers successfully make
it to the actual interview.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.550
You truly thought you could apply to
our school without even knowing that?

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.400
Huh?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.620
Well? Cat got your tongue?

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.520
Huh?

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.820
Um, uh...

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.480
Thank you very much.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.910
What kind of answer was that?!

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.510
I've been a spy for over a decade,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.840
and for the first time...

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.550
I'm actually nervous.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.420
Even when I infiltrated the ranks
of an evil terrorist group,

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.590
or when I managed to stop the launch of
a missile with one second remaining...

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.480
I never found it so hard to
breathe as I do right now.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.850
The fear of letting someone else
decide my success or failure...

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.840
Next, the Forgers.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.020
Yep!

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.020
Yes, sir.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.960
Yes, this is definitely going to be...

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.340
the most crucial moment of Operation Strix!

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.680
Please, have a seat.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.250
Thank you for having us.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.530
So you've come, Forgers.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.650
The Forgers shall prevail in this
game of information warfare.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:34.370
First, we will begin by asking
the parents a few questions.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:43.510
Walter Evans (59)
Housemaster of Dorm 5
Subject Taught: English
Personality: Mild-mannered • Sincere • Conservative

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.720
The housemaster of Dorm 5, Malcom Hall.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.320
Mild-mannered, sincere, and conservative.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.270
The students are very fond of him.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.050
As long as we respond with
sincere, logical answers,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.910
we'll score highly with him.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.600
I was informed that this is your second
wife. May I ask how you two met?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.960
I see we're getting straight to the point.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.360
Eden College does prioritize
family values, after all.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.720
I met my wife at the tailor shop that
handles this school's uniforms,

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.120
and I was in awe of her grace.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.150
Ever since I lost my first wife,

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.800
I was hesitant to pursue another
relationship because of my daughter.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.600
But the more we spoke, the more
I felt that she was a kindred spirit.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.540
She is truly kind and cares
dearly about family.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.250
I came to the conclusion that she'd
get along well with my daughter.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.100
Ah... And what about you, Madam?

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.720
Well...

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.620
L-Loid is a wonderful person who
truly cares for his daughter.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.600
He's also very considerate of me.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.440
Ah, I'm happy to hear that you
have such a loving family.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.040
Why would a beautiful girl like you choose
to be with a man who's got baggage?

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.850
That was rather uncouth, Master Swan.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:55.880
Murdoch Swan (47)
Housemaster of Dorm 2
Subject Taught: Economics
Personality: Arrogant • Greedy • Callous

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.120
The housemaster of Dorm 2, Cline Hall.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.200
He's the only son of the former
headmaster, and a legacy hire.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.130
Arrogant, greedy, and callous.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.050
His wife filed for divorce last month,

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.210
and he just lost custody
of his daughter, as well.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.540
Reviewing all of his previous
interview questions and comments,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.750
he is clearly jealous of other families,
and takes out his frustrations on them.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.270
It's best that we avoid provoking him.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.020
Now for our next question.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.990
Could you tell us why you
chose to apply to our school?

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.820
For only one reason, sir.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.630
To get close to my target, Desmond!

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.750
The quality of the instructors at
this establishment is superior.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.120
Of course, you are all very
knowledgeable and cultured,

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.820
but when it comes to teaching anything,
from patriotism to how to be an elite,

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.090
the instructors of the
prestigious Eden College

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.250
are second to none.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.840
Henry Henderson (66)
Housemaster of Dorm 3
Subject Taught: History
Personality: Elegant

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.650
Elegantly done, Loid Forger.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.850
I knew I saw potential in you.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.360
Now then, how would the two
of you describe your daughter?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.800
Please let us know about her
strengths and weaknesses.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.610
Anya is an extremely curious child.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.740
Her habit of sticking her nose where it
doesn't belong could be seen as a weakness,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.360
but she is a truly intelligent child.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.450
Intelligent?! Her?!

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:02.870
Shock!

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.230
Sometimes, it's like she
sees right through me,

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.910
Yikes...

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.130
which keeps me on my feet.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.990
I would say her main shortcoming
is that she's a picky eater.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.450
Ah...  And how would you describe
your parenting style, Madam?

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:18.880
Just like we practiced...

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.970
As you already know, I am
not her biological mother.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.540
At first, I spoiled her quite often
in hopes that she would like me.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:34.190
But for the sake of her future, I'm hoping
I can become a bit stricter at times.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.050
We've been told that your
daughter is a picky eater.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.910
What kind of meals do you cook at home?

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.430
Huh? C-Cook?

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.200
Um...

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.640
I actually do most of the cooking.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.590
Though when I'm busy, my wife
is kind enough to cook for me.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.130
Not that that's happened even once yet.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.940
You're joking! What kind of wife
can't cook for her husband?!

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.500
You should probably be stricter with
yourself before you worry about that child.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.130
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.940
She is extremely tidy and excels
at keeping our house spotless.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.350
She is also an excellent
mother to my daughter.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.350
Yes, well, both of those are
things women are expected to do.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.210
That's—

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.840
I-It's all right, Loid.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.540
Now, now...

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.600
Yes. Calm down.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.210
Why are you getting irritated, Twilight?

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.200
She's not even your real wife.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.480
A lovey-dovey hot couple? You make me sick.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.150
I'll keep jabbing at you until you slip up.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:36.200
If I can't make sure these two fail,
there's clearly no justice in this world.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.050
He doesn't like Papa and Mama!

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.830
I need to do my best!

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.750
N-Next, let's ask the
young lady some questions.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.700
Here it comes.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.300
First, could you tell us
your name and address?

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.470
My name is Anya Holger!

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.270
My address is in... Berlint, West District...

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:57.060
128 Park... Avenue!

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.280
And what do you do on your
days off, young lady?

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.880
We go to moozeums...

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.570
and eat operas...

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.850
Good. These were questions we anticipated.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.210
What would you like to do once
you get into this school?

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.210
Um, uh...

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.280
What was I supposed to say?

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.890
In my case, I first need to
participate in a social gathering,

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:19.050
and get to the bottom of what the boss of
the enemy organization, Desmond, is planning.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.350
I-I want to find out what the boss
of the organization is planning!

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.780
What in the world are you saying?! Hello?!

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.490
The boss of the organization?
Maybe you meant the headmaster.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.820
I do apologize. My daughter
is rather ambitious.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.640
She's extremely curious about the headmaster,
since he's clearly made it to the top.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.510
Oho...

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.850
The desire to learn from her
predecessors at such an early age...

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.610
That's quite elegant.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.430
Do you happen to know the name
of the principal, young lady?

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.830
Um, B-Be...

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.740
Yes. Benedict Ivan Goodfellow.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.930
Mr. Benedick Advent Goodheller.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.290
Hmm... Then,

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.890
could you tell us how hard you would have
to work in order to succeed like him?

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.730
Yes. Like getting through
the jungle with no supplies,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.860
and dancing with death over
and over to get brave!

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.450
That was the training montage the
protagonist of her spy cartoon did yesterday.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.080
S-Such incredible resolve!

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.070
It appears as though I have
underestimated this young lady.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:19.970
I don't think you have to do quite that much.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:24.420
Let's change the subject.
What does your father do for a living?

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.300
He's a sp—a speshulist in
mental health. A very good one.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.850
Hm? Are you a little stuffed up?

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.760
Then how do you feel about your new mother?

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.550
She is very nice.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.880
But she's scary sometimes.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.980
If you were to give your parents
a score, what might that be?

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.010
A perfect 100 points.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.770
My Papa and Mama are both so
much fun, and I love them very much.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.140
I want to be with them forever.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.410
Tch. God, no one needs this rubbish.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.630
In that case, would you score your
old mother or your new mother higher?

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.200
Come now, Master Swan...

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.080
Is there a problem?

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.140
May I respectfully request
a different question?

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.860
Absolutely not. If you do not
answer, you will lose points.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.980
I don't know exactly how she
ended up in that orphanage,

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.130
but her actual parents
are probably already...

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.810
Ma...ma...

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.800
Anya...

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.970
Mama...

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.800
I see, I see.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.130
So you do prefer your old mother.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.450
This is too cruel!

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.660
Please calm down, Yor.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.370
But this is just—

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.220
We need to remain calm for
the sake of this mission.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.150
We have plenty of students here who live
away from their parents in our dorms.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.070
If she's going to cry over
every little trifling thing,

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.140
she'll never survive at our establishment!

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.810
So what if he's being slanderous?

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.450
We are nothing more than a pretend family.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.340
Trifling? You call this trifling?

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.290
This is nothing.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.480
Now, now, Mrs. Second Wife.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.400
Don't snap at me just because
she loves her real mother more.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.190
Oh, I feel so much better.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.160
Restrain yourself...

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:04.900
Twilight!

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.200
I do beg your pardon.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.660
There was a mosquito.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.350
Thank you very much for your time today.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.460
Hey, where are you going?!

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.420
The interview's not over yet!

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:28.280
If making light of a child's feelings is part
of your establishment's educational policies,

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.480
then I'm afraid we have
chosen the wrong school.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.460
You fiend! You dare
disgrace our fine school?!

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.450
Come now, you two.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.370
Please excuse us.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.020
Don't think you'll ever walk
through our gates again!

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.410
That's quite enough, Master Swan.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.530
Are you taking issue with my methods?

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.150
He may be the former headmaster,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.820
Now, now...

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.640
but my father's influence
within this school is still strong.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.910
It'd be wise for you to
watch that mouth of yours.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.420
Hey! Hurry up and call the next one in!

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.950
...the instructors of the
prestigious Eden College

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.970
are second to none.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.670
If all I can do is curry
favor with the authorities,

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.050
I have no right to call myself an educator.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.620
I must ask, who truly disgraced our school?

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.320
Huh?!

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.900
Wha—

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.100
Hmm...

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.850
That was rather elegant,
if I do say so myself.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.460
Now, will you be able to face
the instructors at Eden head-on,

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.890
Forgers?

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.130
Yeah... We definitely failed.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.340
I-I'll go make us some tea.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.750
I've failed yet again as a spy.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.120
I let unnecessary feelings get
in the way of the mission.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.050
Papa...

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.010
I'm sorry.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.060
I'm so sorry that I couldn't do better

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.710
on my tests.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.820
It's all right, Anya. You have
no reason to apologize.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.290
You don't want to go to
a school like that, do you?

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.680
But I want to go to school...

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.610
Huh?

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.020
If this mission fails...

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.220
I have to go to school or...

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.290
...we won't be together anymore.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.120
Anya...

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.950
If she fails, of course,
our life here together will be...

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.880
But that doesn't matter.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.380
I'm just worried how this may affect my work.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.190
Hmm... But to be honest,

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.160
Hell will freeze over before you pass.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:31.930
Shock!

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.150
I-I'm sure everything will be okay!

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.460
It'll all work out!

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.570
The grandpa with the glasses and
the grandpa with the half-glasses

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.760
were really nice!

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.080
Yes, exactly!

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.290
I'm sure they'll vouch for us!
Let's believe in them.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.470
Spies don't believe in anyone
other than themselves.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.570
They always expect the worst-case
scenarios and prepare for them.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.090
I want to be with them forever.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.170
But... Maybe just a little bit...

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.130
Yes. Let's leave the result to fate,

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.730
and try to recover from how
exhausting that exam was.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.550
Right now, just for a little bit...

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.320
To our family's bright future!

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.990
Something just fell!

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.740
Our family portrait fell to the floor.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.860
It just fell...

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.230
What will become

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.940
of their mission?

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.660
WILL THEY PASS OR FAIL
