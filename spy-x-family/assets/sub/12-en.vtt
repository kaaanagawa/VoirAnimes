WEBVTT

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.980
The capitol of Ostania, Berlint.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.650
This old woman is a contact for
Westalis's intelligence agency, WISE.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.010
This man's name is Loid Forger,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.260
otherwise known by his code name, Twilight.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.390
His occupation: spy.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.390
It appears as though, on top of the current
important mission he is conducting,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.940
he's been given another.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.370
This has been my life for decades now.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.790
Every day remains the same,
and peace is fleeting.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.460
Will we ever see a day

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.210
when we're not needed anymore?

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.910
Mission complete.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.790
Good day, or perhaps, good evening, Twilight.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.080
We thank you for completing
that mission so quickly.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.420
How goes Operation Strix?

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.010
That is his top-priority mission to maintain
peace between the East and the West.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.140
That mission...

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.720
It's going smoothly.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.930
I have secured both a wife and child.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.150
...is meant to bring the enemy
country's plans for war to light,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.480
establish a family in said country,
and infiltrate a certain academy.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.910
Very good. Not standing out is
an iron-clad rule for a spy.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.490
Continue acting as a
completely mundane family.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.790
I know.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.830
Did you quit smoking?

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.460
Well, I have a child now.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.840
And thus, the Forgers came
to be without issue, but...

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.380
Loid did mention that he
was going to be late,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.590
so why don't we eat out tonight?

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.350
Yep.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.100
Doctors sure are busy. It must be difficult.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.810
Papa is not actually a doctor.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.730
His daughter, Anya, whom he just happened
to adopt from an orphanage...

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.400
Papa's real job is a spy.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.200
Today, he went to take down an arms dealer.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.620
...is an Esper who can read minds.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.950
I bring you my dish!

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.460
Thank you very much, Miss Anya.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.710
Hmm... It's just not washing off...

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.710
His wife, Yor, who agreed to this arrangement
because of a common interest...

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.220
I can still smell the blood
from yesterday's kill.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.260
...is a hardcore assassin.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.850
A spy, a telepath, and an assassin.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.640
The three decided to live under one roof

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.400
for their own reasons while
concealing their true identities,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.650
and so their less-than-mundane
family life continues on.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.650
PENGUIN PARK

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.360
I keep getting all these extra missions
every day, on top of Operation Strix.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.080
HQ must be in dire straits
over the personnel shortage.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.660
When I get home, I have my
pretend family to deal with.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.080
I am an agent. Therefore,
my soul has no time to rest.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.760
Hey, don't you think the husband
across the hall must be in trouble?

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.930
It's supposed to be a day off, but he's
working late into the night again.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.930
They're our neighbors...

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.100
And they have a little child.
That poor, neglected thing.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.060
I rarely see the three of them together.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.190
He's probably off cheating somewhere!

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.500
How awful!

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.700
Maybe he actually got fired,
and he can't bring himself to go home.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.620
I was careless.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.700
I was so consumed by my other missions

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.250
that I neglected playing
the role of the father well.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.790
Even the slightest suspicion or mistrust
from those around us in a deception operation

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.920
can be detrimental.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.670
I must do everything I can
to remedy this situation.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.300
A threat to our family is
a threat to the world!

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.300
We're going out next weekend!

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.310
The three of us will have a good time.
Where do we want to go?

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.810
Oh? Is that a penguin, Anya?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.070
I know. Let's go to the aquarium.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.820
Um... You seem exhausted.
Why not get some rest?

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.990
Yor, in order for our pretend
marriage to continue,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.000
we must do everything we can to
seem like a normal, happy family.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.580
So look forward to the weekend!

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.830
So exciting!

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.300
I need to take care of all of
my other missions before then.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.100
Well... let's go.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.850
Loid, perhaps you really
should get some rest.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.190
I'm perfectly fine.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.610
Oh, if it isn't the Forgers.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.860
It's so rare to see all of you together.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.490
We're about to go enjoy some
time together at the aquarium.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.120
Isn't that exciting, Anya?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.370
I see...

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.500
We need to show our neighbors
what a happy family we are

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.630
so they don't ever suspect
that we're a pretend family.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.710
My papa, who is taking us on an ooting,

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.220
and my mama, who is very kind to
my papa, are both very good people.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.630
I think our family is completely normal.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.720
That sounded more like an explanation
than anything else, but good enough.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.390
Now, then...

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.020
If you'll excuse us.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.110
Please wait, Papa, who is a
very good and normal person!

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.820
Ba-donk ka-chonk!

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.530
Another summons?
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.120
I'm going to go buy us some drinks.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.910
All right.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.380
Agent Twilight, we've got another
additional mission for you tod—

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.630
I cannot.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.140
This is straight from WISE HQ—

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.470
I cannot. Today is a very
important day for Operation Strix.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.640
Papa!

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.310
We need to hurry, or the
aquarium will go out of business!

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.610
Don't worry, they just remodeled the place.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.650
Just wait patiently.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.780
There you have it.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.860
Anyway, I'll take one coffee, one juice—

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.410
Hang on! Did you say "aquarium"?

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.120
Splendid, Agent Twilight.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.000
The location of this mission just
happens to be Berlint Aquarium!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.790
I am blown away at how prepared you are!

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.670
No, really. This was a coincidence.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.630
Could I get that coffee and juice now?

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.750
There will be some intel
traded at the aquarium—

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.930
My coffee and juice, please.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.840
Listen to me carefully, Twilight.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.600
This intel contains instructions from another
country for making a new chemical weapon.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.170
If terrorists get their
hands on this information,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.440
many will perish in our country!

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.450
So many... fishies!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.990
An octopus!

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.110
Starfish.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.740
A tiny shark!

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.910
She looks like she's having fun.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.450
Loid...

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.620
You look so pale. Are you all right?

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.540
I ended up taking the mission.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.760
But we did successfully show the
neighbors how well we get along.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.470
As long as I can get through
this separate mission...

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.970
Oh, if it isn't the Forgers
from across the hall.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.470
What a coincidence.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680
Oh, hello.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.390
You can't... be serious!

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.730
We just got here, too.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.190
Now I definitely can't relax.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.480
Actually, we just need
to shoo them off, and—

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.360
Would you like to join us?

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.860
Yor!

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.110
What a great idea.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.950
Papa is funny.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.200
If we want to appear normal,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.700
we need to keep up a good
relationship with our neighbors.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.210
Very well, then.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.420
I'll take care of this mission immediately,
and then return to weekend mode.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.000
According to our intel,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.340
they smuggled in a capsule containing
film by making a penguin swallow it.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.010
Why a penguin?

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.430
It was brought in sometime
yesterday at an unknown time.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.600
The recipient has not appeared yet.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.100
You must retrieve the goods before the
enemy organization does, no matter what!

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.020
Why don't we check out the penguin exhibit?
It seems to be the main attraction.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.230
Okay.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.780
I like penguins! I wanna see!

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:43.370
Welcome to the world's biggest penguin park!

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.870
P-P-P-Penguins!

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.870
Our most recommended
attraction at this aquarium

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.960
is our adorable underwater show
that stars 200 penguins!

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.380
Exactly which penguin is my target?

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.630
There's no time to check
each and every penguin.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.260
I'd have a better chance of stopping the
terrorist from obtaining the film...

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.310
No... Since I don't know when
the recipient is going to show up,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.560
that'll be difficult, as well.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.690
I won't be able to keep an eye
on all of these penguins alone.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.150
What am I going to do?

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.900
There has to be something...

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.700
They must've marked the penguin somehow
to tell it apart from the others.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.320
Papa is troubled.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.160
Loid is so enthusiastic. I guess he lets
his inner child out sometimes, too.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.040
Hey, that fish looks tasty.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.840
Wait, where did my kid go?!

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.170
I hope my girlfriend stops being so angry.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.470
Fish...

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.180
It's hard to read the minds of penguins.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.100
Let's play.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.430
I'mma eat some fish.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.720
I'm hungry.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.390
Come over here.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.440
Papa, that penguin looks like it can't breathe.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.320
It's drinking a lot of water
only to spit it all back out.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.700
It's possible there's something
stuck in its throat.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.950
This is definitely worth investigating.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.160
Sorry. I'm going to go buy
some drinks real quick.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.330
Loid... His exhaustion must
be making him so thirsty.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.960
Hey! Where's the new guy
we're supposed to get today?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.760
He's this late on his first day?

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.800
Sorry I'm late!

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.390
What's wrong with you young'uns today?

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.470
I'll show you how to feed
the penguins. Follow me.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.470
Yes, sir!

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.600
The fastest way to get closer to the target
penguin without causing a commotion

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.230
is to disguise myself as
one of the aquarists.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.230
Agent Twilight's Specialty: Disguises

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.990
The first thing a newbie has to learn
is all of the penguins' faces and names.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.700
Did you memorize the roster?

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.000
Yes. I glanced through it
quickly in the staff room.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.210
You glanced through? You moron!

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.080
Even with me, it took two
years to learn all 200...

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.420
Oh, Chief. You're about to step
on poor Petilda behind you.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.510
This is indeed Petilda.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.510
This one is Pemas, and this is Pescar.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.520
How can you tell, newbie?

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.440
Huh? Well, all of their patterns
are completely different.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.770
Their faces and heights, too.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.980
Even I still mistake them
every once in a while.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.790
I can't believe this guy's
observation skills and memory.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.990
All right, then. Let's get to feeding them.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.950
This way.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.790
The penguin I spotted earlier is...

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.790
Right there. Parles, the emperor penguin.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.630
I need to get to him immediately and...

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.460
Wh-Wha?!

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.800
I-I can't go any further.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.220
We've got big eaters and fussy eaters.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.350
Each penguin has unique
eating habits, so pay attention.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.930
I don't have time for this.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.020
I need to hurry back, or the
neighbors will be suspicious.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.810
Chief!

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.770
Allow me to do the honors!

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.560
What?

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.570
I figured this out watching
veteran aquarists...

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.570
The most important thing
is how each penguin eats.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.320
How much they eat, what kind of food it is,

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.660
and where each group is located.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.490
As long as I can figure these things out...

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.090
Controlling the masses is mere child's play.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.960
That's no ordinary newbie!

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.300
Uh-oh. Apparently Parles isn't very hungry.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.930
He might be sick, so I'll take
him to the treatment room.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.190
If you'll excuse me for a bit.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.730
S-Sure...

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.730
Sorry, little guy.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.820
Bingo! There's something
stuck in his throat.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.780
Upon closer observation, it seems there's
a mark on the bottom of his foot, too.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.000
Just a second, little guy.
I'll get it out for you.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.500
You there.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.750
What are you planning to
do with that penguin?

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.260
He's not feeling well, so I'm
taking him to the treatment room.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.880
I see. Allow me to do that for you.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.430
I'm terribly sorry. Only staff
are allowed to handle them.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.760
My apologies.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:22.690
I'm a professor from Berlint University's
marine biology research lab.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.770
I'm in charge of the marine animals here.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.830
This ID is fake.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.290
It's not even well-made.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.540
Who do you work for, you—

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.000
You're not getting away!

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.840
Hey, be still!

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.880
Hey, newbie!

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.550
Where are you taking that penguin?

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.390
The treatment room is that way!

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.970
I can't carelessly let him go without
knowing how many enemies are here.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.770
My top priority is retrieving this film.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.060
I'll have to give up on chasing after him.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.740
Oh, no... Now where did
Miss Anya run off to?

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.120
I need to let my comrades
outside know to kill that man,

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.450
and retrieve the film—

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.000
Who the hell are you?!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.960
Mama! I'm being kidnapped!

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.750
Miss Anya?!

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.500
Let go of me!

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.880
What are you talking ab—

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.630
What do you think...

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.220
you're doing to my daughter?!

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.470
Wow.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.970
Are you all right?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.980
Oh, no. I definitely overdid it.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.940
I hope he's not dead...

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.480
Wow.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.530
And so, Twilight was able to retrieve the film

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.150
and get information about the enemy
organization from the man they captured.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.740
You know, your husband
hasn't come back at all.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.910
I'm telling you, he's cheating!

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.000
How awful!

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.870
Huh? That's not...

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.170
I'm sorry I took so long!

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.250
Loid!

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.630
Ta-da!

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.130
A penguin!

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.000
Oh, what a big stuffed penguin!
Where did you get it?

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.260
It was a prize from the penguin name-guessing
challenge they were doing over there.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.930
I just had to get it for Anya,
so I kept trying over and over.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.520
Boy, it sure was difficult.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.770
Papa is a liar. He actually got it in one try.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.780
He got so worked up. How adorable.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.280
You're a better father than I thought.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.780
I'm impressed.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.950
You flatter me.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.040
I'm just a simple father trying
not to stumble around too much

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.040
It's bigger than you, Miss Anya.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.290
as I protect my happy little family.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.800
Now that I've gotten a closer look
at you, you're quite handsome.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.140
Looks like things are going
to work out here, too.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.850
But I'm absolutely done with
all this excessive overwork.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.810
I'm going to file a complaint to
HQ and request a long vaca—

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.820
No...

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.200
Maintaining a world where
children don't cry...

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.490
A world with no war...

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.610
That is my duty.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.410
I have no time to stand by idly.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.290
Papa! The dolphin show is gonna start!

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.330
Sorry, could you walk a little slower?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.790
What?! You want me to be the chief?!

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.170
But why?!

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.220
I have nothing more to teach you.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.770
I am Director Chimera, the boss
of the secret organization P2.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.310
So you're the new recruit, eh?

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.940
I am called Penguin, please,
and I come from the aquarium.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.150
It is a pweasure to meet
your acquaintenance.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.940
Indeed.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.160
Agent Anya, you know what to do.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.870
Yep!

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.210
We have a ritual in which we both
eat the halves of a split peanut.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.050
Once you have completed this task,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.230
you will be officially recognized
as a member of this organization.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:23.760
Om...

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.100
Starting today, you will be
known as Agent Penguinman.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.390
Do your best for peace.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.480
Yep.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.150
Agent Anya, show our new
agent around our hideout.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.610
Okey-dokey!

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.370
This is our hideout's command room.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.620
We gather intel from this machine every day.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.370
* She watches cartoons

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.300
This is Agent Papa. He is a
super-elite that can do anything.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.760
Um... what? Is she pretending to be a spy?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.930
This is Agent Mama.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.100
She's strong, but fails at everything else.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.010
Am I that much of a failure?!

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.390
They are Anya's trusted lackeys.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.690
Okay, onward to the next spot.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.190
It looks like Miss Anya has taken
quite a liking to that plushie.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.200
Mm...

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.660
This is the bathroom!

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.500
You can heal your wounds from battle here.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.210
This is Anya's room. I train in here every day.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.060
* She studies

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.300
And...

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.050
The most top-secret spots in our hideout.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.520
Papa's room and Mama's room!

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.270
Be on your guard.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.760
If you discover the secret of
these rooms, you won't leave alive.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.800
We might find the ultimate knife,
or the ultimate bomb!

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.300
Now, then...

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.250
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.040
How many times have I told you not
to go in there without permission?!

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.550
Er, it's just, there's a lot of dangerous things
in there, like scissors and heaters.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.940
Honestly, there are far more
dangerous things in there.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.020
Yes, you shouldn't go in mine, either.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.520
My room has poisoned needles and such.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.320
Papa and Mama, I hate you both!

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.510
Anya's gonna run away from home!

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:42.430
Not good. At this rate,
Operation Strix is going to collapse!

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.440
What should I do?

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.760
A-Agent Anya!

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.400
There's no time for crying!
World peace is on the line!

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:58.410
L-Let's wrap up the tour of the hideout
and head out for our next mission!

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.730
Y-Yes! Let's go beat the bad guys!

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.600
Okay! Follow me, you two!

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.800
The bad guys have taken over
the candy store on 2nd Street.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.210
Let's go save them!

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.000
Huh?

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.190
Be careful.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.550
The enemy might have set traps.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.690
W-Well done, Agent Anya.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.130
What is that?

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.690
Aw, what a sweet family.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.010
A spy must not stand out...

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.200
Later on, Anya's mood improved
after they bought her a snack,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.370
and peace was restored
to the Forger household.
