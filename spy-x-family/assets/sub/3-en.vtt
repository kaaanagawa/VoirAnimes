00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.540
Everyone has a side they
don't show anyone else.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.220
To their friends, their significant others,
or even their families.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.580
They hide what they're truly feeling
through fake smiles or bravado,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.350
and keep their true identities secret.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.870
That is how the world keeps up
the appearance of its temporary peace.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.280
In an era in which the nations of
the world were waging a fierce war

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.670
of information just out of sight,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.170
two countries were at odds with each other.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.170
Ostania, in the east, was secretly
plotting to start a war.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.940
Westalis, in the west, wanted to
put a stop to those plans.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.110
In order to keep an eye on the actions of a
leading figure in Ostania's government,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.560
Westalis set Operation Strix in motion.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.670
The one tasked with this operation
is the skilled agent, Twilight.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.000
The mission given to the master of
disguise with a hundred faces was...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.970
to start a family.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.730
128 Park Avenue, West District
Capital City of Berlint, Ostania

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.970
Is this everything you own?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.550
Yes.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.160
It's not very much.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.480
Um, Loid... about the
sleeping arrangements...

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.390
We'll be sleeping in
separate rooms, of course.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.960
We'll share one for appearances
anytime we have guests over.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.520
R-Right.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.120
Welcome to Anya's house!

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.470
Thank you for the lovely welcome, Miss Anya.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.950
This house is home to
a rather unusual family.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.190
The father, Loid Forger, is a psychiatrist.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.050
His true identity: a spy.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.120
Code Name
&lt;Twilight&gt;

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.990
Code name: Twilight.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.100
The mother, Yor Forger, is a civil
servant who works at city hall.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.150
Her true identity: an assassin.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.630
Code Name
&lt;Thorn Princess&gt;

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.530
Code name: Thorn Princess.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.840
The daughter, Anya Forger.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.510
Her true identity: a telepath.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.270
I'm so happy to have a mama now!

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.180
Mama...

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.660
I'm gonna help.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.190
Oh, right. By the way...

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.430
I had a friend of mine who's a judge
make it so we got married a year ago.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.530
By that, I mean he forged the certificate.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.760
We can figure out why we lived separately
and what to tell your brother later.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.910
All right.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.890
It would make the school suspicious if we
got married just before the interview.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.130
I got permission from the Shopkeeper,
so I feel much better.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.290
So exciting...

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.800
Father, mother, daughter...

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.110
These three created this pretend
family to further their own ends,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.680
and are living under the same roof as they
hide their true identities from each other.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.170
PREPARE FOR THE INTERVIEW

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.530
I'm going to show Mama around!

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.560
Once we get settled in,
we'll practice the interview.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.720
This is the kitchen!

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.780
Papa is good at cooking!

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.060
Oh, I see.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.680
This is the toilet. And that's the bathtub!

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.830
Everything's so clean.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.700
I can wash my face all by myself!

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.080
You're such a big girl, Miss Anya.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.580
This is Anya's room!

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.560
Welcome!

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.980
Thank you for inviting me in.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.850
My, what an adorable room.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.590
I'll introduce you to Mr. Chimera.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.350
I am Chimera. It is a pweasure
to meet your acquiantenance.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.900
It's very nice to meet you, Mr. Chimera.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.860
I am Miss Anya's mama.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.830
This is Papa's room!

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.310
So this is Loid's room...

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.150
This is your room, Mama.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.700
Come in, Mama.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.260
Why, thank you.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.380
So this is my...

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.290
What a lovely room.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.470
I'm glad you like it.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.660
This should be everything.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.470
Is the furniture arranged to
your liking? I also cleaned a bit.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.440
Yes, everything is wonderful.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.490
I helped clean, too!

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.180
Really? Thank you so much.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.330
Am I a good girl?

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.500
All you did was tip over a bucket of water.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.700
Shock!

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.280
This is such a lovely room. I don't
know what to do with myself.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.810
What do you mean?

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.600
Please make yourself at home.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.720
Actually, this <i>is</i> your home now,
so make yourself comfortable.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.350
Thank you.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.680
I'll come get your boxes once they're empty.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.100
Loid, I've got everything put away.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.070
You're quite efficient.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.350
Ah, this must be your younger brother.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.970
Oh, yes.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.620
You said he's also a civil servant?

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.320
Yes. He seems quite busy lately,
so I've only spoken to him on the phone.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.440
It seems you two are quite similar.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.650
I should properly introduce myself
once Anya's entrance exam is over.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.870
Um, Loid. About that...

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.460
I don't have anything suitable
to wear to this interview...

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.780
Then let's go to the tailor today.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.180
Thank you very much.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.700
Helping, helping...

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.420
M-Miss Anya, I'll take care of that!

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.920
I have my work weapons and poison
powerful enough to kill an elephant in there.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.740
Can I get you something, Loid?

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.120
Some coffee, please. Black.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.200
I want hot cocoa!

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.100
With sugar and milk.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.210
That's the stuff!

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.440
They look amazing. Are those cookies homemade?

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.180
It's actually my first time making cookies.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.590
I just followed a recipe from a cookbook,
so they should be decent.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.430
I hope you like them.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.470
Thank you.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.900
They're wonderful! You really
are an amazing cook!

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.140
It's not that impressive, really.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.180
I helped with the cookies, too!

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.440
Oh, I see.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.500
After you got covered in
flour and got in my way,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.810
you just snacked on some peanuts.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.370
Once we're settled in, let's begin.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.820
Eden College is one of the most
prestigious schools in the country.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.870
During the interview, not only
will the child be evaluated,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.650
but so will the parents.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.660
They will be evaluated on their social
standing as well as how cultured they are.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.870
Understood?

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.530
Now, let's start the questions.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.940
First, please state your name and address.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.540
Anya Fo...Fo...Horger. Address?

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.820
The place we're at right now.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.090
This is Anya's house!

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.720
That's not what I meant.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.820
Er, so, Miss Anya... How do
you spend your days off?

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.990
Papa orders me to stay home,

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.460
so I have to watch TV all alone.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.820
Now, wait a second.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.020
That makes a terrible impression. Madam?

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.970
Yes?

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.100
Why did you choose Eden College,
and how do you plan to pass this exam?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.970
How do people usually pass?

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.970
Um, pass, passing...

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.090
Perhaps because of cardiac arrest,
or excessive bleeding?

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.680
Or compound fractures throughout the body?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.950
Oh! Maybe their skull was caved in.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.350
Kill me now. Next question.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.680
Could you describe your parenting methods?

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.680
Huh? U-Um... Strike first to be victorious?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.420
I'm amazed her brother turned
out to be a decent human being.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.310
I've been a spy for over a decade.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.700
I've completed countless missions,
yet only now do I find myself losing heart.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.670
This is pointless. There's no way we'll
survive the interview at this rate.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.300
Let's give up on getting
her into that school.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.090
Loid! Please remember
your late wife's wishes!

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.460
Clearly, we weren't ready
for this mock interview yet.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.580
All right, let's go out for a bit.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.450
Let's broaden our horizons, become versed
in what is normal for an upper-class family,

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.380
and make sure that we're
all on the same page.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.260
We're on an ooting,
an ooting, la, la, la, lah!

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.840
You mean "outing."

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.040
Wanna hold hands, Mama?

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.220
I-If you don't mind.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.860
Thank goodness Anya's taken a liking to her.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.040
The plan is set.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.590
After today, we'll seem like a normal... no.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.110
We'll be seen as an upper-crust family.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.070
Oh... This reminds me of when my little
brother was still small and adorable.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.740
And that one time I hugged him too hard
and ended up breaking two of his ribs.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.340
I must be careful.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.300
Wait... what? Maybe not...

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.360
B-By the way, where are we headed?

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.770
I've acquired a variety of tickets
through my connections at work.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.760
Tradition and status are
everything at Eden College.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.530
We'll have to experience and get accustomed
to the best that life has to offer,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.960
and make sure we don't slip
up if we let our guard down.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.620
All right, next.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.050
Anya, no yelling while we're here.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.650
'Kay.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.350
We've experienced first-class music,

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.950
so now for some first-class art...
And you know the rest.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.920
Papa! I can see her boobies!

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.140
Head's been choppy-chopped!
Body's been choppy-chopped!

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.400
What did I just say about yelling?

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.110
Yor?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.520
Y-Yor...?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.330
I wanna do that!

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.120
Drawing? Sure.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.050
Yor, why don't we sit down for a bit?

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:11.860
All right.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.420
Anya's house is a big castle.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.800
The boss of the secret organization
is Director Chimera.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.170
Papa is a spy! Pew, pew!

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.000
Mama is an assassin!
Stabby, stabby, sploosh!

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.670
We should probably get going.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.980
Yes.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.400
All done!

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.400
Anya, we're going to our next stop.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.000
If Papa and Mama see this,
they'll find out about my powers!

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.140
Wow, that's quite a masterpiece.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.990
There seems to be a pig in a forest.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.460
That's Mr. Chimera, and he lives in a castle!

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.430
I see. I definitely see
Bondman there, though.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.370
I'm right, aren't I?

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.460
Yep...

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.410
It's that spy cartoon you
were watching last week.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.050
So this witch-looking one
must be the princess.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.490
That part seems rather graphic.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.800
Oh, but that cat is cute.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.720
That's a doggy!

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.930
I see. Then I apologize.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.350
We're going to the tailor next.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.890
Sorry to have you do this on your day off.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.120
It's quite all right. This is
something we need to do.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.600
My going-out clothes are so cute!

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.080
They fit perfectly!

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.680
This shop is great! I love it!

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.870
Why, thank you.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.880
This is my first ooting
in my going-out clothes.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.120
Then it must be a day of celebration.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.700
A day to celebrate this ooting!

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.480
In that case, we can stop by
a photography studio next.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.610
Yor, dear. Right this way.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.450
Coming.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.570
If you're looking for a semi-formal dress,
I think this color would do nicely.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.680
What do you think?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.960
I'd honestly prefer a black or red dress.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.510
Really? I think this would
look nice on you, Yor.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.940
Then how about this?

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.400
Judging from her lack of luggage,
I thought she had no interest in clothes.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.670
I see you're particular
about matching colors.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.150
No... I wouldn't say that.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.990
This color's lovely, but I'm worried that
blood splatters would be too noticeable.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.640
Looks like Yor finally found someone nice.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.880
Hopefully they last. Having a child
already is an instant no for me, though.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.580
Looks like the extra outfits will
be ready by the interview, too.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.610
I'm so sorry to have you get so many.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.870
Well, you look nice in
colors besides red and black.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.270
We'll be going out more often, too.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.940
Ootings! Ootings!

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.590
You're a regular at that shop, aren't you?

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:38.900
I'm sure we'll continue to shop there, so next
time, we should tell them we're married.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.330
Oh, right.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.810
We, the Nationalist Party, believe that
there is a road to peace with the West.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.030
Patriotism is also important within Eden.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.740
You moron!

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.120
Kill all the bastards in the West!

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.710
Continuing to treat Westalis as
the enemy will do us no good.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.720
I'll need to make sure she's knowledgeable
of politics and history, as well.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.240
Piss off, traitor!

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.030
Gimme money, gimme money, gimme money...

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.870
Those bastards killed my family!

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.360
Get lost with the pleasantries!

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.480
First I lost my job, then my home!

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.050
What's the matter?

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.360
I don't like places like this...

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.810
Kill all the shitheads in the West!

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.420
Sorry. Maybe this was a
little scary for you.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.100
Let's go rest somewhere.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.560
The East did nothing wrong!

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.660
Go back to your Western masters!

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.660
Damn it!

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.760
You pig!

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.870
You stupid baldy!

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.860
Your feet smell, too!

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.540
Papa, I'm hungry.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.380
Huh?

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.540
Are you all right or not?

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.980
No, Anya. Don't just pick the nuts off
the top, and no eating with your hands.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.960
And Yor, uh... Hmm...

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.560
I've been a spy for over a decade.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.470
I've completed countless missions,
yet once again I find myself losing heart.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.210
S'all good, Papa.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.140
What is?

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.740
Yeah, I definitely picked the wrong child.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.650
No, this is all because I was
expected to rely on others.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:08.230
I shouldn't have put the key to success in
the hands of others, let alone civilians.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.660
Predicting every possible
situation, preparing for it,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.230
and acting from a carefully laid-out plan.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.100
Those are the ironclad rules of being a spy.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.670
Which means that I need to list every
possible question the interviewer can ask,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.440
then have these two memorize the
perfect answers to go with them.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.290
If all else fails, make sure
I can back them up—

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.170
Um...

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.620
Why don't we go get some fresh air?

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.290
The people look like bits
of trash from up here.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.790
Where did you get that from?

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.880
My cartoons.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.780
Ah...

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.350
I had no idea there was a park like
this on the outskirts of town.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.780
I don't come here that often either,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.050
but I wander over here when
I'm exhausted from work.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.320
Thinking about how the work I do
helps everyone in this city out

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.300
encourages me to work harder.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.100
Oh, this place must be awfully
boring! I'm terribly sorry!

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.300
I like this place better
than crowded places!

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.100
Oh, that's wonderful!

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.650
Thief! Someone help!

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.510
That old lady should've been more careful.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.190
You won't get away with this!

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.060
Hold it right there!

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.190
Oh, damn it.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.700
I lost track of him.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.440
Are you all right, ma'am? Are you hurt?

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.890
I'm fine. Just a few scratches.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.910
I promise I'll catch him for you!
And I'll take you to the hospital later!

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.990
Why, thank you.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.470
I left Loid and Anya behind.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.470
He blended in with the crowd.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.470
I'm very sorry, Yor, but you probably
won't be able to find him now.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.490
Man, I'm starving.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.100
So expensive...

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.170
Aw, this is so cute.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.860
Crap, I'm gonna piss my pants.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.480
My feet hurt.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.480
That shopworker is so cool.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.900
I wonder if there's a million
dalc lying around somewhere.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.180
Oh, I forgot to pay my rent.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.920
Man, he's late.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.040
Honestly, this child...

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.000
What am I going to do? I failed my test again.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.920
That bastard. I'm gonna murder him.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.390
Maybe I'll say hi...

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.410
Hey, this again?

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.490
Man, that old crone was loaded.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.520
Papa!

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.840
Whoa, what?

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.590
I wanna eat cake!

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.510
What?!

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.260
We just left the restaurant...

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.100
He's...

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.350
He changed his clothes, but it's not
so easy to change the way you walk.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.950
Don't think you'll get away from me.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.430
Loid!

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:47.980
Mama's here.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.760
Yor, look after Anya for me.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.390
I'll be able to have plenty of
fun for a while with this much.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.980
First, I'm gonna treat myself
to the finest meal and—

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.900
A filthy swine like you deserves
nothing more than the foulest meal.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.440
What's going on?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.340
A guy just dropped from the sky.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.440
A spy must not bring attention to himself.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.890
Did he fall?

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:18.080
Pardon me. This fellow is a purse snatcher,
so please call the police and hand him over.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.630
A purse snatcher?

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.830
Thank you for escorting
me all the way here.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.730
I had money to get my grandchild
a gift in my purse.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.670
Thank you so much. You were a big help.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.730
Oh, actually...

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:36.640
The one who got it back
was my, um, husband.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.010
No, if you weren't there, Yor,
I wouldn't have even gone after him.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.720
Thank you so much. What a
fine gentleman you are.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.870
Er, again...

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.180
Hero who casts no shadow,

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.790
the great deeds you and your fellow
agents do shall never see the light of day.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.020
Thank you.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.810
I guess... receiving thanks every
once in a while wouldn't hurt.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.350
Papa is a softie.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.250
Thank you, Yor.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.470
Today was a nice change of pace.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.070
Now I'll be able to work hard again.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.320
Papa and Mama are flirting.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.870
We are not!

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.570
Does Anya get a thank you, too?

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.120
Well... I guess we did find the thief
because you were hungry again.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.370
Good girl.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.670
My, what a lovely family you are.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.370
Here's some candy for you, dear.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.770
Candy!

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.370
Make sure you say, "Thank you."

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.410
The ooting is over!

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.400
What a long day.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.390
Mama!

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.890
I want some hot cocoa, please!

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.150
As you wish.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.920
Hey, more importantly, we need
to retry this mock interview.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.110
So, Miss Anya, how do you
spend your days off?

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.980
We go to the opera, the museum,
and eat at restaurants.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.980
Yes! Exactly!

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.220
If you're asked this question,
make sure you talk about today.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.570
Okay, next question.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.110
You've seen your friend
do something naughty.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.110
What will you do?

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.050
I'd jump on top of them, beat them up,
and make them eat the foulest meal!

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.090
Hmm... Pretend you never saw that, okay?

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.570
Yup, this is hopeless. I'm done.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.610
Papa, you were so cool!

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.560
Yes, he was.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.950
Ka-bam!

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.870
It's the foulest meal for you!

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.450
Hot cocoa is the best.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:09.600
My, what a lovely family you are.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.860
I guess if she saw us that way...

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.530
About one percent of my
preparations are complete.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.710
THE PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL'S INTERVIEW
