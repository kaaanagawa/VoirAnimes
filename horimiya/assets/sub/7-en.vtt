You find what you were looking for?

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.040
No. Maybe I should just order it in...

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.000
You could ask a clerk to help.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.370
Nah, I'll just keep looking for it!

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.660
Mmkay, I'm gonna grab this.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.080
Oh, I'll come with you.
I'm gonna buy something, too.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.750
Ow!

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.750

What? You taking out the trash?

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.790
Yup. You grab the burnables.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.120
So I'm helping you now? Whoa!

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.660
This one's heavy as shit! I see what
you're doing, Yoshikawa. Real smooth.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.080

Come with me to pick it up later.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.160
Urgh...

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.700
I'll let you borrow it later!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.500
You okay?! I'm so sorry!

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.790
No, I was the one who ran into <i>you</i>.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.410
How embarrassing.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.700
Hold on a sec!

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.120
I'll be right back!

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.870
Oh, okay.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.200
Sorry! We gotta watch where we're going.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.160
No, you're fine.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.790
I really hope it doesn't leave a stain.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.040

A-Are you dating Ishikawa-kun?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
No, we're not dating.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Oh.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.040
I wasn't sure if you'd be able
to wear that home, Kono-san.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.620

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.500
Huh?! You want me to wear this?

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.910
Oh, crap, I should've just brought you yours!

What's with the jacket?

It's a long story.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.910
Where's Remi?

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.620
Oh, she had to head home
to take care of some stuff.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.700
She did open the window, though.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.120
She's keeping on top of her window duty, huh.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.870
Hey, Sengoku-kun.
What is it that you like about her?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.830
I can't believe <i>you're </i>asking me that, too.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.910
I-Is it <i>that </i>shocking for me to ask?!

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.040
Sorry, sorry.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.160
I guess the fact that she's not
very strong, so she needs me around.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.250
So you want someone weak to stand
next to you to make <i>you </i>look strong?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.330
No, that's not it! I don't control her,
just, like, I want to <i>protect </i>her!

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.580
She makes me want to protect her.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.120
But that's kind of what I like about her.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm not even that strong in the first place.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.500
But Remi makes me want to
be stronger, if just for her sake.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.870
Because she's behind me, pushing me forward,

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.660
I have the strength to give
her the push she needs, too.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.830
In the end, she's protecting me.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.370
Just like how she protects you, right, Sakura?

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.700
You look really cute, Sakura!

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.750
Yeah, she does.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.540
She gives me courage.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.290
Courage to try just a little bit harder.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.120
Ishikawa-kun?

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.200
Oh, hey, Kono-san.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.830
Thank you for lending me this.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.660
Sorry it took me so long to give
it back. I wanted to wash it first.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.950
Aww, you didn't have to
go through all that trouble!

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.750
--It's okay. Thank you again for the help.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.120
--Ishikawa! Can I borrow you, dude?
--It's okay. Thank you again for the help.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.910
--Ishikawa! Can I borrow you, dude?

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.660
Coming!

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.370
Later.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.370
Hey, uh...

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.250
I-I made too many cookies, so, uh...

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.450
Huh? Are those for me? Sweet, thanks!

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.540
I-I hope you like them!

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.120
Yo, these are great! I'm impressed!

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.750
Especially these <i>sakura</i>-pink ones!

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.830
D-Do you like Sakura?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.830
<i>Sakura</i>? Yeah, I love <i>sakura</i>.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.950

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.620
I said I'm coming!

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.000
Sorry!

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.330
Oh, but if you make these again,
bring more! I love 'em!

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.660
Took you long enough!

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.290
Gimme a break!

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.910
Nice! I got the last one--

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.620
Why'd you do that, Yuki?
You've been looking for that forever.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.870
She looked like she wanted it,
and I can always find it another day.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.370
It's no biggie.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.830

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.620
Coming!

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.620
Hey, Yuki.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.830
I haven't seen you and Toru
together for a bit. Everything okay?

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.950
Yeah. He's probably off
somewhere eating cookies.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.950

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.250
I've only known her for three years,
but I can read her pretty well.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.330
Ooh, we've got study hall next! Sweet!

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.250
The less she wants you to know
she's upset, the bigger she smiles.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:18.620
Even when she desperately wants something,
she'll never say so out loud.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.080
And she'll never say "I love this"
or "I want this" with all her heart.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:33.450
So the things she loves or
wants tend to escape her.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.200
I wanted to thank you for
lending me that handkerchief.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.410
I'm good, thanks.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.540
Oh! Wow, I love cookies!

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.870
Thanks, Kono-san!

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.700
For real, though, thanks, Kono-san.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.450
I'm glad you like them!

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.160
I do! They're so frickin' good!

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.250
I wanted to thank you.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.080
They're good.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.620
Might as well just take them
if they're gonna be this good.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.790
I'm so ugly.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.290
Huh? A cake?

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:36.580
Yeah. I've never made one before.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.450
It doesn't have to be fancy.
I just want it to taste good.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.910
Guess that's kind of hard, though.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:49.500
You know, Yoshikawa-san,
I wasn't born knowing how to bake a cake.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.620
Huh?

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.750
Nobody's good at anything when they first start.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.950
If you mess up, just give it another shot.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.450
Right!

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.000
Wow.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.700
These took you a whole <i>week</i>?

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.950
They're <i>cupcakes</i>, right?

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.500
We're really starting from
square one, here, huh?!

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.870
Why don't you want Toru in on this?

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.620
B-Because he'd totally make fun of me!

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.660
He wouldn't, especially if he
knew you're making them for him.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.950
I'm not making them for him!

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.250
Hey, there you are!

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.580
You having a party? Why wasn't I invited?

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.910
Don't look!

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.790
Is this a cupcake?

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.700
Give it back!

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.950
Ugh, these taste like crap.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.660

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.410

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.540
I know, okay?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.750
Can't wait for the next batch!

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.040
Same!

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.160

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.450
I'm on it!

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.080
Miyamura went up to Hokkaido, right?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.540
Yeah, he's visiting family
up there for five days.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.790
So he won't be here all week.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.790
Wait, then I'll have to
read different lines in class!

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.950
Miyamura was gonna read the fifth line, so...

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.080
Ugh, now mine's super long!

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.410
Oh, this one's way easier.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:51.700
Made it to Hokkaido. It's a lot cooler up here.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.330
My battery's almost dead.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.450
And I forgot my charger...

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.910
Uncle, can I borrow your phone charger?

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.200
Sure, does mine work with yours?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.040
Oh.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.410
Nope...

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.330
Can we go to the convenience store?

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:21.200
We're a little busy, honey.
I can't drive you anywhere right now.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.790
Hold tight for a bit, okay?

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.290
You're gonna drink two?

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.410
Yeah, uh, I'm thirsty.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.950
Gotta stay hydrated in this heat.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.910
You keep downing those sugary drinks
and you'll get fat, Yoshikawa.

Miyamura comes back today, yeah?

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.660
Sometime this evening, right?
Or later than that?

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.160
No idea.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.620
Hey, I wanna watch <i>Hurricane Star</i>!
It's already started!

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.750
Why're you binging the news?

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:13.410
Our next story tonight: carry-on
restrictions at airports continue to...

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.830
Wait, what?

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.790
Hey, Kyoko!

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.790
And it's back.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.450

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:39.250

You big dummy.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.750
I never knew how long five days could feel.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.290
Welcome back.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.910
Hey, uh... thanks.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.540

What doesn't he like?

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.370
Miyamura doesn't like horror movies.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:04.080
But he'll still watch them with me,
so maybe he does like 'em after all.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.870
Because you're making him watch them.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.500
Hey, Hori,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.870
you're gonna push him away if you
keep watching all that scary stuff.

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:12.370
You think so?

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:17.040
A cute girl gleefully watching
slasher flicks is pretty creepy...

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.450
C'mon now, I'm not <i>that </i>cute.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.370
That wasn't the point there, Hori.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:28.450
I agree with Yoshikawa! It's a total turnoff.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.040
Y-You think so?

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.580
I borrowed this for us, Hori-san.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.200
It has lots of dogs in it!

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.870
Can we watch <i>Right Behind You:</i>
<i>The Third Nightmare </i>instead?

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.580
Sure.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:52.370
You're gonna push him away if you
keep watching all that scary stuff.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:56.870
Miyamura, so, uh, this movie's, uh...

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.620
...gonna be pretty scary, huh?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.080
What're you talking about?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.250
Compared to the PG-13 gorefests we always watch,

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.830
this G-rated one's totally harmless!

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.830
Yuki!

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.370
You should pretend to be scared!

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.080
I'm scared!

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.660
You scared me...

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.040
Ayasaki-san!

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.410
Maybe this just won't work...

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.290
Maybe you could hold his hand?

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.950
Wow, I'm so scared...

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.120
I just want to have fun
watching a movie with him...

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.000
I'm sorry I'm such a scaredy-cat. I'm so sorry.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.580
N-No, don't apologize!
It's not your fault, Miyamura.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.120
I know. Give me a second, I need a moment alone.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.500
He's totally done with me...

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.250
It's over!

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.790
I'm so lame.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.540
Hori-san?

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.120
Hori-san?

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.540
I'm not cute at all.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.410
Huh? What do you mean? You're really cute.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.700
I don't get scared. I can't even <i>act </i>scared.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.830
I can't do anything cute. I'm hopeless.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:25.160
Wait, were you doing all that for me?

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.250
Who cares, you big dummy?!

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.450
I'm sorry, Hori-san. I was too
freaked-out and scared to notice.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.910
Why do <i>you </i>keep apologizing to <i>me</i>?!

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.450
Don't look at me, dummy!

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.250
You're the big dummy here, Hori-san.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:45.830
I didn't fall in love with
a "normal girl." I fell for <i>you</i>.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.620
Let's go watch the rest of the movie.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.040
It's raining pretty hard.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.120
Yeah, wow.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.660
I did, too.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.120
I fell for <i>him</i>.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.500
His long eyelashes, his scaredy-cat jumps,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.580
his sarcastic quips,
how thin he feels in my arms.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.580
His voice, and... and...

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.330
Izumi.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.870
What's up?

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.830
I'm listening to your heart.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.250
What's it saying?

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.950
How cold it is.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.620
Your hands and ears are really cold, Miyamura.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.040
Probably from the rain.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.870
Could be.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.910
You can't go home in this downpour.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.120
There was a heat within me,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.830
and I wanted Miyamura to feel it, too.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.790
Look, it's you, me, and my big sis!

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.000
Sota?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.120
You know, she's... <i>my </i>big sister.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.410
Are you worried I'll take her away from you?

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.700
I won't. She's <i>your </i>big sister, Sota.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.950
And you're my bro?

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.660
Yeah. I'm your big bro.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.790
I won't take your big sister away, Sota.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.250
But could I have Kyoko?

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.120
Okay.

Your hair's getting longer.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:31.000
If you cut it again, everyone'll see that mark.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.950
Why'd she bite you?

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.580
I have no idea.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.950
Looks like a mark of ownership,
but maybe I shouldn't tell him that.
