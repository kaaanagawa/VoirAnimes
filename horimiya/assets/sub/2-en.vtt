00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.040
Thanks for helping out today.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.620
Sota's been eating me out of house
and home, so shopping's been rough.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.370
He's a growing boy.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.450

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.040
♪ Now go, fight! ♪

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.290
♪ Believe in yourself and your friends! Let's go! ♪

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.000
That's from an anime.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.540
W-Was I singing along?!

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.750
Yup. You're a good singer, Hori-san.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.950
I'm so not!

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.870
I can't believe I was singing that
in public... I gotta pay attention.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.410
What's wrong with liking anime music?

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm not into it, but Sota is.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.830
He listens to those same CDs over
and over, so now I know the lyrics.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.160
Well, what kind of music <i>do </i>you like, Hori-san?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.450
Me? I like...

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.660
I have no idea what's popular!

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.660
But I know all the words to an anime song!

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.250
I'm back!

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.330
Welcome home!

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.750
Wait... Mom?!

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.660

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.120
Wow, so you've been having
lots of fun with him, then?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.830
Uh-huh! He comes over
all the time to play with me!

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.040 line:20%
"You Wear More Than One Face"

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.040
Uh-huh! He comes over

"You Wear More Than One Face"

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040
He even bought me a book, see?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.160
He even bought me a book, see?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.870
Wow, how nice!

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.660
Good going there, Kyoko.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.250
So, what's he like? Is he cute?

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.830
He reminds me of the
dark villain in a detective movie...

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.250
What kind of description is that, Kyoko?
Isn't he your friend?

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.040
Well, yeah, but...

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.540
I'd love to talk with him one-on-one sometime!

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.870
What do you wanna discuss with him alone?!

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.160
Okay, all done.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.870
That felt good! Thank you.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.290
So what's his name?

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.500
Huh?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.160
Your villain.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.080
His name's Miyamura.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.500
Miyamura-kun?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.330
Yeah, Miyamura. First name...

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.330
What's Miyamura's first name?!

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.870
Oh my God, he's been coming
over to my house for forever now,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.080
but I still have no idea what his first name is!

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.450
And our teacher took
the attendance sheet with him...

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.330
Why don't I just ask him?

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.750
Hey, Miyamura, you got a first name?

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.410
What?

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.950
No way! That's the absolute
<i>last </i>thing I should do!

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.290
Let's go get changed.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.000
Hey, Miyamura, what's P.E. gonna be today?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.450
Pretty sure we have a combined class.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.160
Someone call him by his first name! C'mon, boys!

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.660
Hori-san's watching us change!

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.120
H... Hori-san?!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.410
You were peeping? Are you pent up
and frustrated or something, Hori?

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.500
Yeah.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.540
Wait, what?!

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.000
Dammit...

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.160
If he were a little bit smarter, I'd know!

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Hori? You heading home?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.080
Toru! Good timing.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.700
I need to ask you about Miyamura--

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.750
Miyamura?

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.040
My broken heart's still healing!

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.290
Some help you are!

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.410
Who knew trying to find out
his name would be this exhausting...

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.750
Hey, Kyoko, is there
something wrong with my curry?

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.410
This is the third day in a row
we've had microwave curry.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.040
So you've got no school tomorrow.
Will Miyamura-kun be coming over?

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.370
I dunno, probably.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.830
Wow, really? Oh, boy, I'm so excited!

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.040
Why? He's not coming over to hang with <i>you</i>, Mom.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.950
Wait, he might tell Mom his name!

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.120
Yes!

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.750
Hi! I'm so glad to finally meet you! Come on in.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.370
Thank you, ma'am.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.540
H-Hori's mom! So <i>this </i>is what she's like.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.950
Oh, I brought you this.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.540
My, thank you so much!

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.080
I'm sorry, Kyoko's out
on some errands right now.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.950
She's told me <i>so </i>much about you.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.500
--Hi, Mom!

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.660
--Oh, Sota's home late.
--Hi, Mom!

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.120
--Oh, Sota's home late.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.750
Hey! You're here!

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.540
What a lovely name!

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.330
I'd love to sit and chat,
but I have to get back to work.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.120
That's okay. I'll be heading out soon, too...

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.700
You're leaving already?! C'mon, stay!

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.410
Thank you for always helping out.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.080
You're welcome.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.540
Wait, where's Mom?!

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.410
Uh, she went back to work.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.160
Which one do you want?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.200
The one with the strawberry!

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.080
That witch! She sent me on errands
so she could talk alone with him!

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.700
Your mom's the first person to call me
by my first name since 6th grade.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.080
It felt kinda awkward.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.120
Wait, what?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.200
She used my first name.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.700
I heard you the first time!

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.120
Oh, you mean how she used it?

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.750
She used -kun. Your mom's pretty young, huh?

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.000
Has this guy literally ever had
a coherent conversation with me?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.950
Ugh, that's not what I meant!

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.250
You know, Hori-san, you've been
acting kind of weird lately.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.200
W-Weird how?!

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.660
I mean, you were watching
the guys change at school.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.330
Yeah, but I had a reason.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.790
Wait, do you have a crush
on someone or something?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.500
No, it's because...

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.120
My <i>name</i>?!

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.910
That's what you've been so worried about?!

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.500
My name though, really? Wow.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.870
Wow, sis, you're so lame!

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.040
How am I supposed to ask you that, huh?!

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.370
--I'm borrowing your pen. Give me a sec.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.040
--You're such a lame-o!
--I'm borrowing your pen. Give me a sec.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040
--You're such a lame-o!
--I'm a lame-o?! Could a lame-o do this?!

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.160
--Ow, that hurts, you lame-o!
--I'm a lame-o?! Could a lame-o do this?!

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.700
--Here.

Izumi Miyamura?

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.000
Oh, sorry, let me write down the pronunciation.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.330
--Hand it back.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.660
--I can read it!
--Hand it back.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.790
Whatever, I'm keeping this,
just in case I forget it again.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.410
I'd really rather you didn't forget it.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.830
I-I know, okay?!

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.500
You'll remember it easier if you say it!

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.830
I-Izumi.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.410
That's right, Hori-san.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.500
No, it feels weird.
I'll just keep calling you Miyamura!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.370
Oh, c'mon, Hori-san...

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.700
Hold up, Miyamura!

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.580
Do <i>you </i>not know <i>my </i>first name?!

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.000
What? It's Kyoko, right?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.330
I look like a total moron!

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.580
Sometimes, Hori-san says the dumbest things.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.330
W-Well, start laughing! I know it's funny!

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.540
But you'll get mad at me if I laugh.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.410
Yeah, I will!

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.330
That's no fair!

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.040
Sorry about all this, Hori-san.
I know you're already so busy.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.580
It's totally fine! I'd do
anything for you, Sengoku-kun.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.120
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.040
Hold onto these for a sec, Sakura.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.450
Okay.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.370
Things go much smoother when
you've got capable people on the job.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.950
Y-You think so?

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.870
On that note, Hori-san,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.870
could I ask another favor of you?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.080
Huh?

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.540
I-I'm so sorry, Hori-san.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.450
The student council is
really swamped right now...

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.500
I-It's okay. I know how it is, Sengoku-kun.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.500
Whoa, look at your bags!

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.410
I have bags?!

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.330
These what the Student Council
wanted you to handle?

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.040
Yeah.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.330
Why do you have to do their work, Hori?!

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.040
Most of their members are new
right now, so they're having a hard time.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.870
Is that how it works?

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.000
It's still weird that they're
having you do this important stuff.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.290
They're just using you, Hori!

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.330
Sure, but they need the help, so I don't mind.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.700
What?! You should!

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.160
She's got it rough.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.370
Yeah.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:54.370
And we're too dumb to help out with anything.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.910
Yeah.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.450
President Sengoku's top of the class, right?

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.330
Really?

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
The girls all like him, too.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.120
Maybe Hori-san's helping
him out because she likes him.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.950
Hori-san, you around?

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.450
Oh, Ayasaki-san!

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.750
Here are the files and notebooks I worked on.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.700
Watch out, they're heavy.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.790
I've got 'em! Thanks!

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.410
Whoa, she's gorgeous!

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.910
That's President Sengoku's girlfriend.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.700
They're hot <i>and </i>dating each other?!

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.450
Ayasaki-san's on the council, too.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.290
Though I don't think she does much work.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.040
She's like their mascot.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.790
What?! So they're just pushing
the hot girl's work onto you, Hori!

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.160
Jeez, don't put it like that.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.410
Though you're right,

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.040
the work I just did <i>was</i>
Ayasaki-san's responsibility.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.750
They're totally making her do her work...

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.200
I'm gonna head home.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.500
Okay.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.540
I hope Hori-san's okay...

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.290
I wonder if she'd feel better
if I baked her a cake.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.160
H-Hey, are you okay?

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.700
Watch where you're going!

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.700
--I did, though--

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.620
--I don't have time for this! Hurry up and help!
--I did, though--

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.500
--I don't have time for this! Hurry up and help!

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.580
Huh?

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.910
Ugh, Sakura's gonna yell
at me again for being late!

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.000
Hey, what about this?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.620
Uh, I probably don't need it,
so just throw it out!

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.700
Bye!

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.580
What?!

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.750
I couldn't even get a word in,
and now she's gone...

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.950 line:20%
"Budget Report"

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.500
What's going on?

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.620
I told you, I gave you everything I worked on!

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.330
I know, but there are papers missing.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.910
--And we can't find them anywhere.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.330
--Huh? What's happening over here?
--And we can't find them anywhere.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.040
--Huh? What's happening over here?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.000
Miyamura-kun! You gotta help!

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.160
It's Hori! She's in trouble!

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.040
Hori-san?

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.700
The student council's yelling at Hori-san!

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.290
I gave you everything yesterday,
including the budget paperwork!

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.040
You saw, right, Ayasaki-san?!

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.120
Remi says she didn't see.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.000
You didn't check to see
if it was everything, did you?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.950
Sure, but shouldn't you guys--

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.790
You're right, some of the blame falls on us.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:14.370
But only if those budget papers
were in the pile you handed over.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.910
Hori-san, were they in there?

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.910
They were.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.540
But to be honest, I was so tired,
I can't remember...

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.910
Hori-san messed up?

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.790
The girl in Class 1?

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:34.830
I hear the council's running behind
because she lost those papers.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.000
The poor Prez...

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.160
If it's your fault, I just want
an apology. That's all, Hori-san.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.750
Sengoku, you asshole--

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.750
Cool it, Ishikawa!

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.950
Stop! Hori finished working
on the budget! I saw her do it!

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.200
She gave it to you yesterday!

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.120
Man, all she has to do is apologize.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.540
C'mon, just say sorry.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.910
Ishikawa-kun.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.830
Miyamura?

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:09.370
Can you hold my bag and glasses? Thanks.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.450
Well, Hori-san?

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.250
--I'm--

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.370
--You don't have to apologize.
--I'm--

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.580
--You don't have to apologize.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.410
You don't have to tell them anything, Hori-san.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.500
Miyamura?

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.120
What do you want?

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.870
Mr. President.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.000
What?!

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.580
What the hell are you doing?!

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.200
Sengoku-kun!

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.700
Violence is unacceptable!
Why did you think you could--?

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.870
Is this what you were looking for?

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.330
The budget files! Why do you have them?

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.370
I found it in the hall yesterday.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.040
Ayasaki-san told me to throw it away.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.410
I didn't tell you to--

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.080
Ohhh, you mean in the hall...

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:20.450
Remi...

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.790
I'm sorry!

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.580
So it wasn't Hori-san's fault?

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.200
What happened, then?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.040
Who knows?

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.620
I'm just glad it got resolved.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.040
I was this close to crying.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.410
You're super organized, Hori.
No way it could've been you.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.290
Oh, c'mon.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.290
You really helped me out there, Miyamura.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.910
Thanks.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.830
I just happened to be there is all.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:12.330
But why'd you need to headbutt
him if you had the papers?

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:16.500
Oh, I was just kinda pissed at him.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.870
I've been wondering, Hori-san.

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.290
Does the Student Council Prez
have some dirt on you or something?

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.370
Huh?!

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.950
I mean, you always do
whatever he asks you to do.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.830
That <i>is </i>weird!

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.040
Why do you do it?

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.790
C'mon, it's just 'cause
the student council's so busy!

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:41.790
And Sengoku... -kun and I have
known each other for forever!

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.410
Sengoku, you're such a crybaby!

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.910
Stop, Kyo-chan!

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.540
But I <i>hate </i>peas!

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.870
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.450
When high school starts,
I'm not going to be your dog anymore!

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.580
My <i>dog</i>? Wow, that's how you saw yourself?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.450
That's kind of hilarious.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.750
And you're going to use
an honorific with my name!

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.080
I want to have a normal,
happy time in high school!

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.500
Really?

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.370
You'll do it, or I'll tell <i>everyone</i>
how you treated me!

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.330
What, treated you <i>how</i>?

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.830
Like this! This is what I'm talking about!

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.080
Fine, then,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.330
S-Sen...

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.870
Sengoku... -kun.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.040
That's it. Thanks, Hori-san.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.370
Seriously, I've known him forever!

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.910
He definitely has dirt on her.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.250
Morning, Prez.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.830
Good morning, sir!

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.040
Sengoku was traumatized by what happened.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.120
Hey, it's almost Hori's birthday.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.000
Wait, really?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.120
It's at the end of March.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.870
Oh, so it's during spring break.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.870
I was thinking of getting her something.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.620
But she's turned me down once already.
I'd just be bothering her.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.000
I don't think it'd bother her.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.080
There's nothing wrong with
wanting to get her something.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.450
I guess, but I've got no idea what to get her.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.200
It's the thought that counts.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.080
Just get her whatever you want.
Maybe some jewelry or something.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.580
No way, that's way too serious.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.040
What about a desk ornament?

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.620
Don't you know what kind
of stuff she likes, Miyamura?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.580
A present for Hori-san...

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.410
What would I give her?

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.120
Hey, do you think my bro will
come here every day over break?

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.660
Not every day.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.790
And remember, this won't last forever.
He'll stop coming someday.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.910
Okay... when will that be?

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.330
When you graduate high school?

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.700
When <i>will </i>Miyamura stop coming over?

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.120
I don't know.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.660
You'd be sad if he stopped coming over, right?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.160
I'd be really sad!

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.040
Hori-san.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.910
Yeah, I'd be sad!

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.950
C'mon, sis, be a little
more honest with yourself.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.120
Sh-Shut it!

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.500
Happy birthday!

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.040
Right, it's my birthday!

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.580
Spring break made me
totally forget about it. Thanks!

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.040
This is from me. Happy birthday.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.250
Whoa, what is this?

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.910
A CD of all the songs people
our age are into? The popular ones?!

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.040
Yeah. The ones I like, at least.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.910
Thank you, Miyamura.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.750
How strange.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.910
How'd he know that this was what I wanted?

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.870
You're such a weirdo.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:53.200
If it's my birthday, that means
spring break's almost over.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.660
Yeah.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.540
We'll be third years soon, huh?

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.950 line:20%
"That's Why It's Okay"
