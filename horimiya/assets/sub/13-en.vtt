00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.450
Graduation's coming up soon.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.620
Yeah.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.290
Hey, Yuki...

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.450
You haven't been taking
your stuff home, huh.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
Yep.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.580
C'mon, I'll help out.
Show me what you wanna keep.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.080
--Okay.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080
--And throw all those papers out!
--Okay.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.040
--And throw all those papers out!

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.500
Okay.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.330
Hori's acting like Yoshikawa's mom.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.450
Ishikawa-kun, you sure
have a lot of stuff.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.790
So do you.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.080
You guys are such pigs.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.950
You're supposed to take
stuff home every day!

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.160
Do you have a free hand, Hori-san?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.750
--Huh?

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.040
--Could ya help me out here, Hori?
--Huh?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.950
Me, too!

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.250
What?

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.910
I swear, you guys...

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.790
Your arms are so <i>strong</i>, though!

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.410
Damn, Hori-san, you had
this much crap piled up?!

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.580
No, <i>these guys </i>did!

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.120 line:20%
"Take all personal belongings home today!"

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.120
No, <i>these guys </i>did!

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.830 line:20%
"Take all personal belongings home today!"

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.830
Wait, you have like, no stuff at all.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.040
Wait, you have like, no stuff at all.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.120
Right? 'Cause I was a good boy
and took it home every day!

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120 line:20%
"<i>Iura </i>was doing his job
and you guys <i>weren't</i>?"

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120
Right? 'Cause I was a good boy
and took it home every day!

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.580 line:20%
"<i>Iura </i>was doing his job
and you guys <i>weren't</i>?"

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.580
Please, Hori-san.
Don't look at me like that.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.910
Please, Hori-san.
Don't look at me like that.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.250
Oh, I've got this CD!

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.620
Wait, really?! This must've been one
I forgot to give back to you. Sorry.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.290
Oh, snap, yeah, I'll take it.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.580
Sorry, man.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.620
Come to think of it, I have
some DVDs I borrowed off you.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.450
Huh?

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.000
Same here.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.410
What?

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.120
Well, there goes my sweet,
light-handed commute.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.540
Sorries!

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.040
All good.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.750
You still have way more
than all of us, Yuki.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.910
A couple of us stronger guys could
help you carry it down to the entrance.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.750
Like me, Ishikawa, or...

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.500
...Hori-san!

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.580
What'd I do?!

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.200
H-He means you're so dependable, Hori-san!

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.000
He didn't mean anything insulting by it!

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:36.540 line:20%
"Horimiya"

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.790 line:20%
"I Would Gift You The Sky"

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.000 line:20%
"I Would Gift You The Sky"

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.000
Remi, could you get the trash...?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.660
Remi, could you get the trash...?

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.290 line:20%
"Fun Spring Trips!"

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.250 line:20%
"Fun Spring Trips!"

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.250
She's distracted again.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.250
She's distracted again.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.250
What're you reading? A travel mag?

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.620
Uh-huh.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.500
Is that a zoo?

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000
You wanna go see a big herd of giraffes?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.750
I mean, sure, but...

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.290
Sengoku-kun, Yanagin!
You wanna go to the zoo, too, yeah?

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.700
Which one? The same one as before?

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.120
No, a different one.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.750
Whoa, this is pretty far away.
We'd have to make it a two-day trip.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.160
We'd need a car.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.910
And a hotel.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.950
So we can go if we get a car and a hotel?!

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.620
Don't encourage her, boys.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.000
You're going to make her
think this might actually happen.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.620
--She's such a mom.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.000
--Okay, mom.
--She's such a mom.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.580
A car, though... Sure
would be nice to have one.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.410
We could get to way more places.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.910
I can't wait to get my license.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.330
Huh?

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.790
If I had a car, I could take you anywhere
you wanted, Remi, not just that zoo.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.580
O-Oh. Yeah, that's right.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.500
Perhaps this isn't about going
to the zoo, but something else?

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.700
What do you mean?

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.290
I'm gonna go buy a drink!

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.870
Hold it, Remi.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.120
What's going on? What's bothering you?

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120
Nothing!

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.040
We won't know unless you tell us.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.660
Grab her, Sengoku-kun.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.750
It's nothing, I swear!

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.330
So tell us what it is.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
H-Hey, uh...

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.040
If you won't let us help you,
then you're going to force my hand.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.200
I'll show Yanagi-kun what you look
like with your cheeks all stretched out.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.870
K-K-Kono-san?!

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.870
Fine, do it! Get it over with!

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.330
Ayasaki-san?!

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.410
What on Earth is going on?!
Is this something you do often?!

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.200
Certainly you can't force
her to talk like... like...

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.870
Oh, wow, her cheeks...

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.660
Kono-san, Ayasaki-san
can't talk like this!

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.750
Sengoku-kun, please make her stop!

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.950
Take a good, long look. You don't
get to see her like this that often.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.450
Why?!

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.950
Are you okay?

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.290
I'm fine. That felt nice.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.120
It did?

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.410
Look, it's not bothering me or anything.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:01.200
I just figured we could go somewhere
fun while we're still in high school.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.160
But as soon as you talked
about getting a license,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.500
I realized he could use it
to go really far away.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.700
Or he could just use it
to do everyday errands.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.370 line:20%
"Getting a car = going away???"

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.370
Or he could just use it
to do everyday errands.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.910 line:20%
"Getting a car = going away???"

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.910
Oh...

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.200 line:20%
"Fun Spring Outings"

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.200
Oh...

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.910 line:20%
"Fun Spring Outings"

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.910
I mean, we don't have to go
to the zoo or anything.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.580
I mean, we don't have to go
to the zoo or anything.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.750
You don't need to worry.
We'll be friends forever.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.660
Really? You won't treat me like
a stranger the second you graduate?

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.830
Not at all. That'd be a lot
of effort on our part.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.660
Here's an idea.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.120
Huh?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.410
Once I get my license, would you
all like to go on a road trip?

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.120
That sounds nice. Where would we go?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.910
L-Let's go to the ocean!

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.870
Are you fond of the ocean, Kono-san?

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.950
I-I wanna go to the ocean, too!
We can go swimming!

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.330
I won't swim. I just
want to see the ocean.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
Then that's what we'll
do after graduation.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.330
Let's go to the zoo, too, Yanagin!

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.580
Why don't you get your
license, too, Ayasaki-san?

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.160
Because I call shotgun!

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.620
No fair, Remi!

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.040
Sengoku-kun...

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.790
Hori-san?

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.250
Earth to Hori-san...

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.290
She's fast asleep.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.790
Makes sense after carrying
all that heavy stuff.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:19.870
Miyamura.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.830
Yeah! I'm here!

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.370
Guess she just wanted a pillow.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.290
She's frowning in her sleep.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.330
She makes that face a lot, huh.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.450
Hori-san, you're going to end up
with wrinkles on your forehead.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.330
She eats a lot, moves a lot,
and sleeps a lot.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.410
She's so funny.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.370
I hope these days never end.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.160
Even after graduation.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.790
If that tiny happenstance
hadn't occurred...

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.580
If it hadn't...

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.750
If it hadn't happened...

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.160
Are our graduation essays due
on the last day of school?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.000
Oh, crap, I totally forgot!

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.750
They took our graduation
picture super long ago, huh.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.660
I have no idea what I look like in mine.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.080
--I was next to a guy
I'd never spoken to before.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.000
--Ishikawa! Let's head home!
--I was next to a guy
I'd never spoken to before.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.330
--Ishikawa! Let's head home!
--It was totally awkward. I don't
even remember if I said anything.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.700
You're in the same class, though!

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.750
Sorry.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.500
Oh, it's okay.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.790
You wanna go to karaoke today?

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.580
How'd your sister do on that exam?

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.000
Didn't pass.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.450
Oof. That sucks.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.040
Oh, Sengoku-kun!

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.120
Kono-san?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.330
I was just in the student council room...

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.370
Oh, did you finish cleaning?

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.370
Yeah, I did.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.330
Got it.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.660
C'mon, Sakura, let's go!

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.450
Okay.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.450
She looked so much better with long hair.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.040
He's so unfriendly.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.910
C'mon, hurry!

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.370
Hey, Remi! Don't rush me!

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:24.000
Oh, right! You know that shop
you told us about before?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.910
Sakura?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.200
Do you know them?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.950
Huh? Oh, no, I don't.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.120
Taking my stuff home is such a pain...

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.750
Ugh, taking my stuff home is such a pain.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.080
I should've brought it home ages ago.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.250
I should've just brought it home ages ago.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.830
--All students, please head home
so the all-staff meeting may begin.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.870
--Kyoko-chan! Let's go!
--All students, please head home
so the all-staff meeting may begin.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.580
--Yeah, I'm coming.
--All students, please head home
so the all-staff meeting may begin.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:09.540
We have a whole 'nother
week until graduation...

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.410
I hope it'll be warmer for graduation.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.500
For real.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:20.910
Kyoko-chan!

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.870
Did you see that guy?!
He was a mega hottie!

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.500
Wait, where? He a third year?!

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.080
Man, I didn't see!

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.120
Whoa, someone's still here?

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.660
Gotta find my phone...

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.410
Whew, found it.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.370
Hey.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.290
You dropped this.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.700
Huh? Wh-What?

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.330
This was on the floor.
Looks like an earring.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.540
Is it yours?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.910
I-I don't know!

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.750
Hey, dude!

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.870
The hell? What a weirdo.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:13.620
Somehow...

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:28.080
My high school days feel like
they amounted to nothing.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.160
This is all hypothetical.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
I know there's no point considering it.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.870
But it wasn't hypothetical for you.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.250
Yeah.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.080
Miyamura?

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.080
Sorry, I was spacing out.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.660
You okay? What's got you all spaced out?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.370
Just thinking.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.750
So many coincidences brought me here.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.370
What would it be like if
one of them didn't happen?

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:21.160
Sounds like the fact that we're here
together now is the work of fate.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.410
Maybe.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.330
It was never completely
unfathomable, but it's real.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.450
You're here with me.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.870
Everyone is with me.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.330
I'm here with them now.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.830
Even if the "fate" you
mentioned doesn't really exist,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:50.410
I'm sure the world would slowly but surely

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.830
move in the direction I want it to.

All graduating students,
please return to your classrooms.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.790
Miyamura-kun, you little punk!

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.620
I'm sorry! I didn't do it on purpose!

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.750
Yo, Miyamura!

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.910
Nice sneeze!

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.750
It was <i>not nice</i>!

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.370
He's so scary!

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.950
Sorry, Ishikawa-kun!

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.410
Shoot, I lost him!

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.950
C'mon, dude, should the graduating student
speaker be sprinting through the halls?

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.080
Nice speech, by the way.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.750
So what were you chasing Miyamura for?

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.410
What do you <i>think </i>I was chasing him for?!

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.700
I've gotta apologize to him later.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.870
Nice day out.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.450
You're having fun.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.620
Yup.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.450
You cut your hair.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.120
They found out about the
piercings. And my tattoos.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.290
I have a lot of friends,
plus a girlfriend.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.080
You finally looked at me.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.200
Sorry.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.040
I promise I won't pretend
you're not there anymore.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.290
I'll disappear for you.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.830
Congrats on graduating.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.370
There he is! C'mon, Miyamura,
we're gonna take a class photo!

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.540
You gotta hurry back, or...

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.700
What's up?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.500
Nothing.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.040
The wind's so strong today.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.000

Sensei, let's take a picture together!

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.620
I want one, too!

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.620
Aww, well, okay, I guess.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.750
You're supposed to take
pictures of <i>all </i>of us, Yasuda!

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.200
Why would I take pictures of guys?

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.290
I'll grab a snapshot of you
with my eyes. There, done.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.410
Oh, come on! This is a big life moment!
Get a picture of us, please!

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.040
Hori-senpai!

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.700
I'm so sad I won't get to see you anymore!

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.870
What's up?

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.950
Y-You can still come over to see me!

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.580
Really?!

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.330
Not too often, though!

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.700
It's her last day.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.200
Might as well let her have it, then.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.000
Our last day, huh...

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.660
I'm looking for Remi, have you seen her?

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.120
Oh, Ayasaki? No, I haven't.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.790
Oh.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.870
Hey, so...

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:53.080
So, uh-- Sorry, I just...

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.330
Thank you.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.870
I had so much fun this year. Really.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.080
I had the best time of my life,

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.000
and part of that was
because of you, Ishikawa-kun.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.250
I like you, Ishikawa-kun.
And I like Yoshikawa-san, too.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.790
I'll never forget you.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.040
Same. Neither will I.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.870
Well, good. Thanks.

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:23.870
Yeah, same.

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.500
Bye, then!

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.160
Take care. See you again soon!

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.080
See you later!

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.250
Guess she's trying to leave
her feelings behind at school.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.160

I'd like to go somewhere

You mean as a group?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:04.910
Yeah. We had this conversation
with the student council the other day.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.700
It made me think, once I get my license...

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.750
All of us best buds could travel!

Hori-san, Kono-san...

--Just the same as always.
--We'll take Miyamura-kun,
Hori-san, Kono-san...

--Sure.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.450
--Huh?
--Sure.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.330
Sounds great! Let's do it!

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.200
Oh, good!

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.700

Nothing's going to change after
graduation, and if it does, that's fine.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.000
We'll still be friends.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.290
Now there's my special boy!

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.370
Kyosuke-san!

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.910
Whoa, is that Miyamura-kun's dad?!

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.790
He's so young!

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.330
They look so similar!

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.540
Similar <i>how</i>?

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.370
I wanna get a picture
with my wonderful kid!

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.870
Okay, let me get Hori-san--

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.200
Why the hell are you here, Dad?! Huh?!

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.120
I'm here to have Dad fun!

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.500
Get out of here before someone
sees you in this ridiculous outfit!

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.790
Miyamura! Where's <i>your </i>mom and dad?!

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.870
They were here for a bit,
but had to head home for work.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.250
Man, why you gotta be so mad?

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.830
Shut up and get lost!

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.700
C-C'mon, now...

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.750
Okay, you're good!

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.580
You serious, Iura?

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.660
Dead serious, dude.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.160
Big brother!

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.120
Hey, Moto, you came?

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.620
--Yeah.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.540
--Whoa, is this your little sister?
--Yeah.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.000
--Whoa, is this your little sister?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.160
Yup!

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.950
You come to pick your big brother up?

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.790
Mom said she wanted you home early.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.580
Plus I figured I could see what
my new school would be like.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.660
Wow, really?!

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.700
God, that ceremony was so long!
Why'd they talk so much?

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.330
Okey-dokey, let's get
our butts home, Moto!

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.790
That's all, folks! Bye bye!

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.080
Nice to see Iura peppy till the end.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.120
All's right with the world.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.040
Big brother.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.200
Yes, little sister?

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.080
Is it really you?

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.000
Yep, it's me.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.620
Miyamura!

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.540
I'm in!

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.500
Sweet! Let's head out, then.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.250
Kyosuke's gonna be so thrilled,
like, annoyingly so.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.700
Okay!

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.000
There's no distance between us.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.200
I've never been this
close to a person before.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.580
There's no boundary between us.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.870
I used to be terrified of that.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:34.120
I was so scared of this, Hori-san.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.120
You know,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.000
I had no idea

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.870
that I could feel

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.870
so many different emotions.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.290
I don't think either of us knew

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:51.910
how scary or nerve-wracking being
yourself around others could be.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.200
But you made me realize all of it.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.950
What can I do for you?

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.620
How can I make you smile?

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.870
You're so much stronger
than I think you are,

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:13.250
and you're so much weaker
than I feel you are.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.540
You're delicate.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.700
You're fragile.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:25.160
That's why wherever you go,
bright, sunny days follow after.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:31.080
For years, the only person
I knew this well was myself.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.700
I never knew a world
like this even existed.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.040
Thank you for shattering my reality.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.620
Thank you for wanting a future with me.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.830
What can I do for <i>you</i>?

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.830
How can I repay you for what you've done?

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.040
C'mon, Miyamura!

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.950
Oh.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.620
The spring sky is bluer
than I've ever seen.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:19.870
If only I could gift you
this wonderful sky.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.660
No, I know what you'd like better.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.790
A cake with lots of whipped cream on top.
