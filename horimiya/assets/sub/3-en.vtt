Sorry.

Didn't she just say she
didn't know who I was, though?

you gave me that song I wanted?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.540
No.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.830
You can't have him. I'm not giving him to you.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:48.540
Huh? But you said you're just friends, right?

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.910
I'm not giving you Miyamura.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.290
I'm taking him!

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.200
No, you're not!

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.950
But Miyamura-kun's <i>not </i>your boyfriend!

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.290
He doesn't belong to you!

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.290
Miyamura's...

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.700
Miyamura's <i>mine</i>! You can't have him!

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.950
Not ever!

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.700
I'll never let you have him!

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.450
Wonder if the cafeteria's open yet.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.290
O-Okay, bye!

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.580
I'm so stupid. Miyamura
doesn't <i>belong </i>to anyone.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.330
I know I shouldn't be
surprised, but seriously...

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:59.000
Sota needs to stop changing in here
before he goes out to play!

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.870
Huh? He's not here again today?

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.540
He probably came home,
then went right out to play soccer.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.040
What an energetic little rascal.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.910
You can't do blueberries, right, Hori-san?

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.410
Ever since Sota started grade school,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.250
we've been spending a lot
more time alone together.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.160
That fruit tart you brought over
the other day was really good.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.120
Whoa, really? I actually made that one.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.700
Oh, cool! That's neat.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:40.700
Sometimes, our conversations peter out.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.830
That looked totally real!

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.580
C'mon, it's just CG. Special effects.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.700
You're just saying that because
you're scared, right? Right?!

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.910
No, that's just the only way it
could pop out at them like that.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.000
C'mon, Miyamura. It's just my phone.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.500
Oh, my mom's gonna be late again.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.450
I'm so embarrassed.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.620
A blackout?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.660
H-H-Hori-san! Where's your breaker box?!

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.370
It'll be back in a second. Calm down.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.500
Calm down?!

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.950
See? It's back.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.200
This house is definitely cursed!

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.200
What're you looking so scared for?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.870
Okay, let's move on to disc two!

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.160
Disc two?! There are <i>more</i>
in this horror collection?!

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:35.620 line:20%
"IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU:
Real Horror Stories #49"

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:35.620
Disc two?! There are <i>more</i>
in this horror collection?!

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.870 line:20%
"IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU:
Real Horror Stories #49"

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.870
How many discs are there?!

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.700 line:20%
"IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU:
Real Horror Stories #49"

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.700
We're gonna watch the first three,

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.040 line:20%
"IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU:
Real Horror Stories #49"

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.040
then the last two after Sota gets home.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.290
then the last two after Sota gets home.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.000
We're watching <i>five</i>?!

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.580
Wow, Yoshikawa-san was right.
You're double-jointed.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.450
I'm what?

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.750
Your finger.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.500
Oh, yeah.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.250
Dang, Yuki, your hands are tiny!

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.580
Wait, what're you doing?

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.040
Doesn't it make your heart skip a beat
when someone grabs your hand?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.000
I dunno.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.330
Look at Yuki's hands! They're so tiny!

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.580
Sure, but your hands are small
compared to us guys, Hori.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.580
I'm not comparing them to guys' hands right now.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.200
Grab my hand and you're a dead man.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.450
You hear that, Miyamura?

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.290
I could <i>die </i>if I touch Hori!

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.160
It's okay, Ishikawa-kun! My hand's open!

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160
No thanks!

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.790
Whoa, your finger's double-jointed!
Is it just your index finger?

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.830
Yeah, it's always been like this.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.410
Did you break it or something?

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.750
Nope, just born that way.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.080
I wonder how the joint works.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.290
No idea. I'd have to get an x-ray.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.750
Your hands are so pale, Miyamura.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.830
Is that a writer's callus, Hori-san?

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.250
Yeah.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.000
It's so weird how your hands
are bigger than mine, Miyamura!

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.660
Huh? Isn't that normal?

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.330
I totally thought they were smaller.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.700
I, I love you.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.830
What?

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.540
Your hands! I love your hands,
they're--they're nice!

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.370
My hands?

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.200
Yeah! I was just thinking, "Man, I love 'em!"

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.000
Thanks. And I hold my pencil right,
so I don't have a callus like you.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.160
H-Hey! No fair!

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.290
Well, cool.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.750
I love yours, too.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.290
Okay.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.700
I love you.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.330
Yeah, I heard you.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.750
Okay.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.500
I'm back!

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.750
Hey, there!

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.620
Sota! Did you wash your hands?

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.200
Not yet!

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.000
What're you doing?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.080
Hori-san put the DVDs back in
the wrong cases, so I'm fixing it.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.200
C'mon, time for dinner!

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.540
Wash your hands, first!
You're eating with us, right, Miyamura?

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.830
Oh, yeah, if that's okay.

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.410
Okay, then you and Sota
need to go wash your hands!

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.500
You got it. Let's go, Sota.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.950
Okay!

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.750
So I was just talking to her,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.250
and she said she's "never
letting me have Miyamura-kun"!

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.370
What?

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.410
I mean, I was just joking,
but she got like, actually mad!

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.410
That's 'cause you take
your jokes <i>way </i>too far, Remi.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.910
Yeah, but still!

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.200
Hori-san was sooo scary.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.120
Morning, Miyamura!

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.040
Morning.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.080
What?! What happened to your face?!

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.000
I got into a fight and got hit in the face.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You got into a fight? With who?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.120
Ishikawa-kun.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.250
With Toru?!

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.910
I mean, sure, he's a big dummy dum-dum,

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.500
but I never thought he'd
get violent with a friend.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.160
U-Uhh, Hori-san, actually--

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.750
Nope, I don't want to hear it.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.290
I know <i>just </i>the kind
of guy he is now, thank you!

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.750
Morning, Ishikawa!

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.160
Whoa, holy shit!

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.750
Toru!

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.250
Hey, mornin'.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.330
You got into a fight?

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.540
Yeah.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.540
So you beat the crap out of each other?

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.330
No, not really...

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.370
I dodged everything 'cept that first punch.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.700 line:20%
"ashamed"

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.700
Then I beat Ishikawa-kun to a pulp...

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.040
Then I beat Ishikawa-kun to a pulp...

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.040
You're kinda scary, Miyamura.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.750
Why were you fighting?

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.330
It's none of your business, Hori.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:09.620
Okay, fine. I still can't believe
you two got into an actual fight.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.950
So, Toru, who won? You or him?

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.200
What's that look for?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.660
Oh, nothing.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.830
Pretty sure I lost.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.540
Look, I know it's not happening, okay?

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.450
Okay.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.080
Seriously, dude, <i>listen</i>!

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.750
I'm listening! I swear!

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.500
Hori's in love with you, Miyamura.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.200
You mentioned that before,
but I still think you're wrong.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.830
You're just imagining things--

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.370
I am not!

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.700
How would you react if I said I wasn't?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.120
Are you trying to psych me out?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.450
If Hori said, to your face,
that she loves you, what would you say?

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.660
Would you just brush it off like that?

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.080
Hori-san just sees me as a friend.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.750
Why do you keep going back to that?

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.120
Because if I don't, you'll keep
asking me the same question.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.500
Well, yeah, but...

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.450
Besides, it's obvious
she doesn't like me like that.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.950
I'd like to know why you think you're right.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.700
Well--!

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.410
I know your own feelings
probably influence your perception,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.540
but you can't assume how
Hori-san feels without asking her.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.160
Look!

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.910 line:20%
"WHACK"

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.910
Look!

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.160
Y-You startled me, okay?!

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.040
You moron!

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.080
Moron?! You're insulting me now?
What gives, Ishikawa-kun?!

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.700
You're not gonna listen otherwise!

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.370
--The hell does that mean?!

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.080
--It means--
--The hell does that mean?!

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.290
Shit, sorry!

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.200
That hurt.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.080
Yo, your eyes are scary!

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.160
Miyamura! Time out, time out!

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.200
It... It was self-defense!

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.830
You beat the shit out of me!

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.200
That was uncalled for <i>and</i>
has nothing to do with Hori!

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.450
It was just 'cause I startled you, then?

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.910
No, I was also kind of pissed at you.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.450
You're not supposed to admit that!
You're freakin' me out, man!

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.450
I pushed Miyamura too far. It's my fault.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.410
I'm so sorry, Miyamura.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.660
C'mon, go apologize to him and make up.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:33.250
Wow, Miyamura said it was all his fault.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.870
That's not what Toru said.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.870
First they beat each other up,
now they both take the blame?

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:38.750
They're so weird.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.700
I know!

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.450
Man, what were they even fighting about?

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:50.700
We were fighting about Hori-san.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.540
Please don't tell anyone.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.370
What? What is it?

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:02.000
It's so cool that guys can just
duke it out with each other.
