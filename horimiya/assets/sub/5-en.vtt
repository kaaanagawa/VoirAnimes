Yeah, I still feel a little yucky.

Yeah? How'd he look?

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.000
He was walking with a girl.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.290

They're probably just friends.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.750

Hey, don't make a mess!

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.160
A girl? Wrapped around his arm?

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.450
Why?

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.750
This is stupid. I should just text
him to see what really happened.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.950
She could be a friend from
middle school, like Shindo-kun.

He's here. He was real worried about you, Hori.

He's sitting over by the window.

I didn't see her in homeroom.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.370
She was here for first period,
but she was, like, really on edge.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.290
Like in a really foul mood.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.830
Almost seems like she doesn't wanna talk to you.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.160

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.160

The other day, you were awake, right?

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.120
I said it because I knew
you were awake, you know.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.160

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.000

Yeah, uh, she goes to Yasaka--

I've <i>never </i>heard you
call a girl by her first name.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.410
<i>And </i>she was hanging off of you in public, too.

It's Shindo! Chika-chan is Shindo's girlfriend!

Chika-chan slipped and twisted her ankle,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.250

so I lent her an arm to lean on.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.040
Yeah.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.450
Cool, cool.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.080
Oh, shoot! Was I interrupting something here?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.160
Huh? N-No, you weren't!

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.330
You sure?

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.790
You've got long eyelashes.
Anyone ever told you that?

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.080
'Scuse me, coming through.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.660
Kyoko... could you put it
on the table next time?

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.700
Sure, next time.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.750
Sorry, I have no idea where she
gets this from. She's so violent.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.290
Oh, no, I wouldn't say she's violent...

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.370
Not at...

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.910
You're an only kid, or you got siblings?

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.250
I'm an only child.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.830
Uh-huh.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.370
You can't have my daughter!

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.500
Huh?!

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.700
Just kidding! Man, I <i>always </i>wanted to say that!

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.700
You're kind of freaking me out here!

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:52.080
Umm, so Hori-san calls you
by your first name? That's surpri--

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.870
Miyamura-kun, you know, my name's Hori-san, too.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.330
Could you call my daughter by her name?

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.910
O-Of course. I'll use her first name.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.620
--Kyo--

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.080
--C'mon, I'm just kidding!
--Kyo--

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.200
It'd be totally awkward switching
to her first name out of the blue!

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.290
I wish I were anywhere else right now.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.660
Kyoko! Kyoko-chan!

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.120
What? I'm coming.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.160
What's the deal with you and
Miyamura-kun? Is he your boyfriend?

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.750
W--

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.830
We--

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.950
Well, yeah, got a problem with that?!

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.830
--Watch out, it's gonna fall!

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.620
--Hori-san...
--Watch out, it's gonna fall!

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.410
I don't like boys with long hair!

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.500
Have you looked in a mirror lately?

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.750
I'll-I'll cut it.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.950
I'll cut it short, sir.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.910
Nah, you should just tie it back.
Wouldn't want it to go to waste.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.500
Just ignore him, Miyamura.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.290
L-Like this?

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.080
Kyoko-chan, get us some bobby pins!

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.830
What? Oh, come on...

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.450
The girls must be all
over you, huh, Miyamura-kun?

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.330
Huh?! No, not at all!

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.000
So you're fine settling for Kyoko here?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.540
Yeah. She's the one I fell for.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.910
Aww, man! I wish I could go back to high school.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.830
Here are your bobby pins.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.370
You're exactly like Yuriko was way back when.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.500
And I bet <i>you've </i>been this immature
since then, too, you big, fat loser.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.790
Kyosuke...

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.660
Oh...

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:50.120
Oh, no! We won't have enough dinner for you!

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.580
Seriously?!

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.250
Kyoko, Sota, me, Izumi-kun...

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.790
Oh, it's okay, I'll go home.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.910
You heard her. I guess you could
borrow Miyamura's silverware.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.830
Where'd mine go?!

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.290
We have some disposable
chopsticks you could use...

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.700
I don't have chopsticks, either?!

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.000
Sorry about Kyosuke being super annoying.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.040
It's okay.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.080
You sure? He's always so pushy.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.450
Somehow, him being a Hori
kind of justifies his behavior...

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.790
Miyamura?

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.950
What is it, Hori-san?

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.750
Hori-san, I...

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.330
I don't know very much about you.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:04.250
But I'd like to learn more
about you, little by little.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.950
At least, I hope I can.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.040
Yeah, well, the feeling's mutual.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.160
Really?

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.540
Yeah.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.750
I can walk from here.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.790
Okay, be careful.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.750
See you tomorrow.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.620
Hori-san!

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.910
Thank you.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.200
S-Sure.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.370
Now I know how hard it is
to say "see you tomorrow"...

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.870
...and just how fast her heart can beat.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.200
Yeah, so how many problems
did we have to do for Math?

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.290
Oh. Okay.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.870
Yeah, yeah.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:12.700
Don't be stupid. I called <i>you</i>.
Don't worry about it.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.870
You made it happen. Good for you.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.910
It's fine. Yeah.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.290
See you at school.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.200
Aw, crap...

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.410
I'm so lame.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.700
I was the one closest to her, man.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.620
Miyamura...

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.120
Maybe I'll get a part-time job!

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.290
Whoa! Then you should work at our place!

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.450
He looks kind of down today...

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.580
Sakura! Sakura?

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.500
Sakura!

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.580
What's up? You're spacing out.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.080
N-Nothing's up!

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.790
We should head to the student council room.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.500
What were you looking at?

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.540
I-I said, nothing!

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.290
Yeah, right! You were totally
looking at something!

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.870
Look, I wasn't. Let's just
get to the council room.

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.950
Remi!

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.000
Is it something you need to hide from me?

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.580
Huh?

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.950
You've been acting weird lately.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.660
No, I haven't.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.200
Oh, c'mon. What was that
daze you were in just now?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.290
What happened? If something's
bothering you, I'll listen!

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.580
She's got such big eyes

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.950
and a thin figure.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.580
Hori-san's like that, too.
That's why Ishikawa-kun likes her.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.950
She's pretty and cute.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.290
You wouldn't understand, Remi.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.580
Why, because I'm stupid?
You really think I can't help you with it?

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.700
No! No, you're just...

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:13.450
You're cute, and I'm not, so you
wouldn't get what's bothering me.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.660
What the hell?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.910
I'm being serious here!

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.620

I'm hopeless.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.450
Why is Ayasaki always hanging around Kono?

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.540
They're like, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>!

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.290
I don't want to be Beauty.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.040

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.200

I've never seen you blush before!

You know, you're always so calm and
level-headed, but when you blush like this,

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.540

about the English midterm.

I mean, a little. Sorry.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.750
