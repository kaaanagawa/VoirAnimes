00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.580
You know, we've got a lot of
only children in our group, huh?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.790
I've got a little brother.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.160
And I have an older sister.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.200

You have a point, though.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.200
But the biggest shock of them all
is that Shu's an older brother.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.040
What?

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.830
Wait, you didn't know?

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.330
--A sister?

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.790
--A brother?
--A sister?

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.000
--A brother?
--Or a sister?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.370
--Calm down, he doesn't have that many!
--Or a brother?

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.910
--Calm down, he doesn't have that many!

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.790
I only found out when I went over
to Shu's house not too long ago.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.160
I'm back!

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.120
Thanks for having me over.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.040
Hey.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.750
Try to keep it down.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.750
You got it.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.830
And don't touch me.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.580
Oh, hello.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.290
Your little sister?

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.660
Yup, three years younger.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.370
I totally figured his
little sister would be all...

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.500
Tee-hee! Welcome home, big bwuther!

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.620
They look pretty similar,
but she wasn't all that friendly with him.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.950
Wow. Can't believe Iura's a big brother.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.330
He's a big bwuther...

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.040
He's pretty chill outside of school.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.370
Whoa, really?

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.540

after school, whaddya think?!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.620
You'd better start
acting more responsible!

Iura-kun is quite the comedian, isn't he?

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.830
Hey, Yanagi-kun,
why do you always talk so formally?

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.250
Wait, I do?

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.370
Yeah, you've been super polite
to us ever since the day we met.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.250
Sorry, I suppose it's just habit.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.830
But you're real casual with Yuki.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.910
Really?

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.290
Yeah, just the other day...

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.790
Bye-bye!

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.830
Oh, goodbye.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.040
Yanagin, "bye-bye"!

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.000
Right...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.700
Yanagin! Bye-bye!

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.120
B... Bye-bye.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.080
Ohmigod, you said it! You're so cute!

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.370
Remi-Remi, I don't know if I should
be impressed or weirded out.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.000
Thanks for waiting, Hori.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.290
What's going on there?

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.330
Ayasaki-san's messing with Yanagi-kun.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.620
Whoa.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.790
Oh, are you guys heading home? Bye-bye!

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.950
Bye. See you, Yanagi-kun.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.870
Goodbye.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.290
Later.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.250
Yeah. Later.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.870
See?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.700
I'm not sure why that is...

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.830
I'd sure like to know why.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.250
Okay, Yanagi, why don't you start
calling everyone by their first name?

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.200
Huh?!

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.620
I'll call you Akane!

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.160
It's times like these that I get really
jealous of Iura's peppy personality.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.500
You can use my first name, too!

You can use my first name, too!

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.910
I've never called a friend
by their first name before.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.580
I don't think it will come easily to me.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.750
No! Stop using your polite voice!

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.290
--Huh?

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.330

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.700
Owie!

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.950
Stop bothering Yanagi.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.700
Oh, no, he's certainly not bothering me...

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.700
I... Well, I can assure you,
not even <i>I </i>appreciate the fact...

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.250
...that I keep such distance between
myself and others with my words.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.660
But I'd like to become closer friends
with Ishikawa-kun and Miyamura-kun...

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.580
And of course, all the rest of you, too.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.080
What's going on in here?
This is quite the odd bunch.

this guy here until recently, either!

But look how close we
are now! Isn't that great?

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.700
Boy, you couldn't pay me
to do that with the Prez.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.500
They managed to creep out Iura-kun!

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.370
That's quite the feat,
Ishikawa-kun, Miyamura-kun!

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.000
Sengoku! We're good buds now, right?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.160
What?!

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.910
We got to be best buds right away, too!

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.700
We are n--

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.830
O-Of course we're best buds!

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.410
I'm best buds with all
of you, Yanagi-kun, too!

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.700
Way to go, Prez!

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.750
--For real! Let's finish 'im
off with a wrestling move!

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.370
--Guys are so weird.
I'm gonna go follow Yuki.
--For real! Let's finish 'im
off with a wrestling move!

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.080
H-Hey, no wrestling holds!

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.910
Best buds...

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.620
Best buds can settle any argument
with rock-paper-scissors!

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.370
Don't blatantly lie to him, Ishikawa-kun!

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.870
Yeah! The poor prez always loses!

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.120
You lose way more than I do!

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.620
Really?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.370
Who knows.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.620
I'm not <i>that </i>bad at
rock-paper-scissors, am I?

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.250
How do you not know?

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.370
You lose every time we decide
who goes to the vending machines.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.450
Fine, then I'll win next time.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.540
Hey, uh...

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.250
Would it be all right if I
called you "Toru," Ishikawa-kun?

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.160
Sure!

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.040
What about me? What about <i>me</i>, Akane?

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.160
One at a time! Please,
let me do this one at a time!

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.540
Well, I wanna be next!

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.080
Are you gonna start calling him Akane?

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.290
It'd be weird if I were the only one.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.830
I mean, I could,
I just need a bit of time.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.660
Huh.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.660
What?

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.000
Nothing.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.330
Yanagi-kun might be on my
personal blacklist, I guess.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.040
Wait, why?! Why's he on your blacklist?!

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.540
Just kidding.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.790
What?!

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.790
Sorry, forget it.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.580
That's not a very funny joke, you know!

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.290
Miyamura-kun.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.950
I won't take them away.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.200
Huh? Take what away?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.790
What's he gonna take from you?

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.580
Or did he already take it?

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:48.540 line:20%

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.830
You dummy!

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.540
You're a big dummy, Akane!

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.370
And there he goes.
What the heck was he talking about?

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.910
Yanagi looks happy 'bout it, at least.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.750
Look, I told you, you're wrong!

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.080
No, I'm telling you...

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.330
Oh, Kono-san!

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.080
Kono-san!

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.580
I'm taller than him by a little, right?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.830
We're the same height, aren't we?

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.160
Wait, are you two fighting or something?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Not at all! Akane just said he got taller.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.200
And Miyamura-kun said I didn't!

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.500
So you <i>are </i>fighting.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.080
No, because I'm taller than Akane!

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.290
Well, I told him neither of us are 170
centimeters tall, and he got all mad!

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.250
That was uncalled for, Miyamura-kun.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.950
And you shouldn't have
blown up at him either, Yanagi-kun!

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.700
I'm sorry.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.040
Hey! You beat me to apologizing! No fair!

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.660
It's completely fair. I'm sorry.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.370
You did it again!

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.540
I'm glad the two of them
are such close friends.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.540
Sawada, how do you feel about this one?

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.700
Normal.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.540
What about this one?

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.000
Normal.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.950
Wow, you've gotten a lot
better with guys lately, huh.

That's right.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.500

comfortable Sawada's getting with guys.

Wait, where do I rank, then?!

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:38.790
"Ishikawa: Nice. Talks to me."
"Sengoku: Easy to talk to."
"Iura: Loud. Like, really loud. And annoying."
Wait, where do I rank, then?!

"Ishikawa: Nice. Talks to me."
"Sengoku: Easy to talk to."

Sweet!

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.120
Sweet!

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.250
I've got some snacks here, Sawada-san.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.410
You like chocolate, Sawada-san?

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.750
You can have all of these!

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.790
Look, she's eatin' them
right outta my hand!

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.450
--Just you wait.
I'll shake up that tier list.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.410
--What the heck...
--Just you wait.
I'll shake up that tier list.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.000
Iura-kun, not a peep! Stay quiet!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.370
Huh? What? Sorry, I can't hear you!

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.120
Hey, Sawada-san!

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.950
Nope!

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.330
Huh?! C'mon, now,
Sawada-san, it's me, Iura!

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.660
Nope!

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.540
Iura-kun, you've got some learning to do.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.500
What am I learning?!

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:34.290
Sawada, Iura-kun isn't <i>trying</i>
to scare you. He's a good guy.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.080
Miyamura!

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.830
I mean, I don't care if he's a good guy.
That's not the problem.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.160
Sorry, Iura-kun. No luck.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.540
I can't stand people
who are loud and annoying.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.830
My throat's all scratchy.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.700
You coming down with a cold, Iura?

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.370
You keep coughing.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.450
I don't feel sick. I just can't talk.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.040
Well, you're acting
like the same old Iura...

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.080
But I do feel... kinda fatigued.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.620
You're totally sick! Go home!

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.450
C'mon, you've totally got a fever, too!

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.500
Why're you grabbing me like this?!
Why're you grabbing me like this?!

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.250
Be gentle with me!

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.580
My throat's dead!

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.870
If it hurts that bad,
then go the hell home!

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.250

and passed out, and I'm feelin' great!

At least say the whole word!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.540
Wait, why are you congratulating me
for beating a cold, anyway?

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.120
Your little sister's studying for high
school exams. Don't get her sick.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.330
Sawada-san?

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.200
H-Hey...

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.160
Do you need Iura-kun?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
Wait, you think he's mad at you?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.200
Yeah.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.450
Does he even <i>get </i>mad?

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.080
--Huh?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.950
--I've never seen him angry, ever.
--Huh?

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.290

H-Hold on, is he <i>really </i>mad at you?

H-Hold on, is he <i>really </i>mad at you?

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.620
I can hear him laughing,
so I think you're okay.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.120
Do you want him to like you?

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.750
Whoa, it's Kono-san and Sawada-san!

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.200
Oh, Miyamura's not here, but Hori-san is!

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.910
What're you and Kono-san talking about?

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.370
Wait, if it's private,
you don't have to say!

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.250
Did everything work out yesterday?

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.450
Sheesh, the science room is so far away
from the second-year classrooms.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.250
I was worried you'd end up late to class!

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.830
Y-Y-You're so annoying!

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.200
And she hates me again.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.450
Iura-kun, your <i>timing </i>is annoying.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.790
M-My <i>timing</i>?!

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:21.410
Ah, hmm... You want to try for East High?

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.200
Yes, sir.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:29.160
East High, huh. And you're dead set on it?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160
Huh?

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.620
I mean, look. You might
want to aim a rank lower.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.080
Your grades are pretty average.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.870
I don't think your grades in any
subject would be high enough...

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.200
But that's not to say that's bad, no.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.540
East High, though... You may want
to think that over once more.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.500
Give it some thought,
then come back to me...

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.580
Yo, Moto-Moto. You know where Grampa is?

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.200
No.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.370
Mmkay.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.080
Whatever.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.370
I'm not gonna have dinner tonight.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.040
Why not?

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.700
I told my teacher where I wanted to go
for high school, and he laughed at me.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.830
Why does him laughing at you
mean you're not gonna eat dinner?

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.910
Th-That's not what I meant.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.450
You're going to eat dinner.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.500
You are, okay?

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.660
O-Okay, fine.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.540
Where do you wanna go, Moto?

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.290
You're gonna laugh, too.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.200
No, I won't. I wanna know
where you wanna go.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.290
East High.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.290
Wait, I thought it was gonna be some
funny name! That's not funny at all!

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.250
My teacher didn't laugh
at the name, dummy! He...

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:08.040
H-He laughed at my grades.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.580
What, are they laughably bad?

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:31.040
You're always throwing your notes
and textbooks at me, so I took a peek.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.750
The pages of your textbooks are
worn down from how much you study.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.410
You highlight and write
notes all over them, too.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.620
You're trying really hard.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.700
Which teacher laughed at you? Bring 'im over.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.160
I'll punch his lights out.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.500
I'll do it so you don't have to.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.830
Why?

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.120
How? Why?

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:09.540
I try, but my grades keep slipping.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.700
My teacher said it's hopeless.
He said I should "rethink things."

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:22.040
My friends, they... Their grades are
good enough to get in, but mine...

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.700
I'm...

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:32.200
What should I do, big bro?
I don't know what to do!

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.450
I try, and I try, and I try,

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:41.410
but I can't make it happen.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.870
The East High uniforms suck.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.410
If you don't get in, you'll have
to try a lower-ranked school,

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.450
but you could totally get into Katagiri.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:57.290
Our uniforms are real cute.
You'd look good in 'em.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.290
Just do the best you can.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.830
Mmkay.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.790
And eat your fill of dinner.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.910
Hey, Hori-san, I've got a favor to ask.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.250
Oh! Motoko-chan?

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.040
Iu... er, your <i>brother </i>sent you over, yeah?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.160
Yes.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.000
Come on in!

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.120
Thank you for having me.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.080
Head upstairs, the door
right at the top is my room.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.870
Go on in and sit wherever.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.790
I'll go get us some drinks.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.580
Oh, sure.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.950
Hello.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.290
H-Hello.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.830
Hello!

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.750
Hello.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.830
Guess she's got two brothers...

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:01.500
You want me to tutor your
little sister? Me? Really?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.370
Kind of. I just want you to see
if she could test into East High.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.200
I mean, if that's all, then sure.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.660
And if there's no way she'll get in,
I want you to tell her straight out.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.790
Wait, really?!

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.540
No, I'm kidding.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.910
Just help her out a little,
at least till the exam.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:20.660
You got it.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.160
He looked like a big brother there.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.660
Sorry for the wait.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.870
You good with hot chocolate?

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.000
Yes, thank you.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.750
You look a lot like your brother.
Has anyone ever told you that?

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.750
I suppose because both me and
my brother are the quiet, brooding type.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.910 line:20%
"The quiet, brooding type?"

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.950 line:20%
"The quiet, brooding type?"

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.950
H-He is?

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.410
H-He is?

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:02.160
I, uh, brought my textbooks,
and my notes and stuff, too.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.290
Oh, don't bother.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:09.620
I know it's tough trying to study in
a stranger's house right off the bat.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.160
Let's just talk. You get the day off today!

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.790
A-Are you sure?

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.080
Once you've relaxed a little,
we can get to studying.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.290
If you want more people to talk to,

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.000
I can call in our resident high-school
and elementary-school boys.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.910
Hey, bro, who was that girl?

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:33.160
Our friend's little sister, Motoko-chan.
She's here to study.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.950
Huh.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.000
Today I've got banana cupcakes!

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.700
Banana!

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.250
Let's show her we're rooting for her.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.200
Yeah!

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.120
No way! Middle schoolers
have cell phones, now?!

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.080
Yeah, everyone has one now.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.700
Damn.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.120
Oh, but I don't have contact
info for much of my class.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.500
I basically only text my brother.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.200
So you two are close.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.830
Not at all!

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.950
We barely talk, and when I come home late,
he just sends me an angry text. That's it!

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.540
We could be in the same house
and he'll text me instead of talking!

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.500
So you <i>are </i>close.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:21.040
You don't think he hates me?

"Lucky Charm"

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:30.200
Yo, Shu, what're you so worried about?

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.620
Which one will make her
pass the test for sure?

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.040
Pick it yourself, moron!

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.000
I'll just go with the biggest one, then.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.080
Um, they're all the same size...

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.080
Then I'll take the most expensive one.

"Guaranteed Exam Success"

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.290
That for your sister?

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.830
If she wants it, I guess.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:54.040
You bought it for her, right?
I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.290
Hey, it's snowing.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.410
I hope...

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.790
...she doesn't...

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.580
...he doesn't...

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.540
...hate me.
