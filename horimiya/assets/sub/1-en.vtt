00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.200
Remember, you'll be studying
for college exams next year,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000
so you won't get to enjoy
your next summer vacation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.620
Go out and enjoy the pool
or the beach while you still can.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.330
I'd be happy to go with you.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.450
What? Why the hell would we
invite a <i>teacher </i>to come with us?

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.750
Oh, please, Ishikawa!

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.120
There's no point in going to the
pool or beach with a bunch of <i>guys</i>.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.330
Oh, right.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.500
God, they're so dumb.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.790
Yasuda's pretty hot, but he
keeps opening his dumb mouth.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.370
He's a good teacher, too.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.160
Ugh, just ignore him.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.410
Why? Did something happen
between you and Yasuda-sensei, Hori?

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.000
Yeah, this morning.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.040
Hori! Keep your chin up, okay?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.870
What? Why?

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.660
Here's a little-known fact about me:
I love flat-chested girls!

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.950
So have a little self-confidence!

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.040
That's how he tried to cheer me up.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.700
Sorry. I have no idea what
he was trying to do there.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.870
Oh, hey, Hori!

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.080
A guy from another school
asked me for your number.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.620
Can I give it to him?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.160
He didn't have the guts to ask
me himself, so no. Turn him down.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.330
Aww, again?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.160
Yo, wanna hit up karaoke on our way home?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.120
Karaoke?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.450
I got these coupons that expire today.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.660
Half off two hours! That's a sweet deal!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.290
Wanna go, Hori?

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.910
C'mon!

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.040
Sorry, I gotta pass.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.410
You <i>always </i>pass!

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.410
I'm really sorry!

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.370
Hori-san.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.500
Huh?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.790
You dropped your phone.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.370
Oh, thanks.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.330
God, Miyamura sounds so gloomy.
Same as always, I guess.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.410
I bet he's a total otaku.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.750
Oh, I like <i>this </i>angle!

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.330
The "<i>so moe</i>!" kind?

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.120
Oh, yeah, totally!

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.370
What's he really like, Toru?

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.950
Don't really know.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.080
Doesn't seem like he has
any friends we could ask, either.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.370
Sorry, gotta run!

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.580
Hori's always in a hurry to get home.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.250
It's probably because she's
got a boyfriend or something.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.830
A boyfriend?!

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.830
I mean, she's pretty and popular.
I wouldn't be surprised.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.500
Okay!

I think he's okay now, so I'm gonna go.

had to take care of him...

why don't you come in for a few?

It sure is.

He's a good kid.
Introduced himself and everything.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.370
O-Oh, thank you. He's a real
handful most of the time, I swear.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.040
Still, I'm really impressed that
you take care of all the housework.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.620

Oh, no...

Miyamura, can I have a sec?

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.080
Huh? You want me to come over again?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.080
N-Not me! My little brother!

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.000
Sota wants 'that cool dude'
to come play with him.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.540
Really? Then I'll pick up
a picture book for him or something.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.330
It's fine. You don't have to
go out of your way or anything.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.450
Whew, okay. Sota'll be really thrilled.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.580
This is a surprise.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.500
What is?

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.910
You talking to me.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.200
I thought for sure after yesterday,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.700
you'd just avoid being around me.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.870
Why would I do that?

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.580
I mean, yeah, it was a little
awkward and freaked me out a bit.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.410
You're so not like that here at school.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.330
But I'm kinda in the same boat,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.830
so I don't really have
a reason to avoid you or any...

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.870
Why're you blushing?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.830
Uh, I guess I'm just not
used to hearing this stuff...

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.620
It's kinda weird.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.370
But thanks.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.160
What?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.870
You've got a nice smile.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.750
Huh?!

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.870
You should wear your hair up more often.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.370
And lose the glasses, too.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.750
I could, but then they'd see I have piercings.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.830
You've got a lot, too. How many?

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.580
Nine, I think. Four on
each ear and one on my lip.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.580
That's way too many piercings.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.040
My mom said the same thing.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.160
Here are a few things I've
learned about Miyamura so far:

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.830
I like manga, but I'm not
into all that <i>moe </i>stuff.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.250
He's not an otaku.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.040
I brought some cake!

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.200
His family runs a cake shop.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.040
Yeah, it hurt a lot when I did it.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.450
He pierced himself with
a safety pin back in middle school.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.080
And...

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.910
Oof...

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.830
He's not a very good student.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.040
You're incredible, Hori-san!
You've got almost straight A's!

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.790
Yeah, but I don't think she knew it was me.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.620
Oh, huh.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.950
Let's dig in!

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.160
Look out, don't spill.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.200
Okay.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:35.950
I kinda don't want anyone else
to see you like this, Miyamura.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.870
Sorry, never mind! Forget I said that.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.500
I forgot to get out drinks. Is barley tea okay?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.370
Are you gonna eat?

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.370
Hori-san, I...

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.290
When I get to see you like this,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.450
cooking dinner, or getting mad
and yelling really loud...

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.620
Like, the fact that you don't care
what your hair looks like at home,

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.410
or the way you're kinda brawny, in a good way--

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.870
That's enough!

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.910
I don't want anyone else
to see this side of you, either.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.500
Neither do I.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.620
It kinda feels like this moment
belongs to me and only me.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.660
Don't say stuff like that, you dummy!

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.830
Can I have some, too, please?

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.370
Thanks!

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.580
Ugh, how can he say something
that cringey with a straight face?!

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.000
Does he not realize? Is he that dumb?!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.160
--You dummy. You're such
a dummy! You big dummy!

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.620
--I'm a dummy...?
--You dummy. You're such
a dummy! You big dummy!

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.790
--You dummy! Dummy, dummy, dummy!

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.250
--My sister can't stop saying "dummy"
after she says it once. Watch.
--You dummy! Dummy, dummy, dummy!

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.870
--Really?
--You dummy! Dummy, dummy, dummy!

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.410
Dummy, dummy, dummy!

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.580
You're right!

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.620
Why're you laughing?!

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.200
Everyone has a side of them they
don't want anyone to know about.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.540
It's not that I don't like
the way you are at school,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.540
I like this side of you that gets
mad and dresses plain at home.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.950
I think you're way cuter like this.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.660
The two of us ended up sharing
this "secret self" time with each other.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.450
Ugh, whatever, you big dummy.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.540
It's only gonna get hotter from here on out.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.950
Yep.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.160
Wearing this jacket all
the time's gonna be torture.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.290
Yeah, but at least...

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.450
Hori-san, I'm in trouble!
We're gonna be swimming in P.E.!

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.750
I'm screwed!

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.120
Oh, yeah, you're right.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.950
What's wrong with swimming?
Better than making us run a marathon.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.290
Swimming is way worse!
They're gonna see <i>everything</i>!

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.370
What do you mean, <i>everythi</i>--

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.500
What do I do about <i>these</i>?!

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.290
Sometimes I'm not sure if you're incredibly bold

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.870
or incredibly stupid.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.450
...at least swimming was optional, huh?

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.450
Yeah, for real...

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.910
But what if we <i>do </i>have to run a marathon?
I <i>have </i>to wear my jacket!

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.910
I'll die of heatstroke!

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.790
I don't think they're gonna
make us run a marathon.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.250
Huh. You see the two of
them together a lot lately.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.120
I never expected <i>him </i>to be in the picture.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.450
Hori, lemme see your notes!

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.250
Oh, I wanna see, too!

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.750
Ugh, fine, but you really need to take your own.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.790
Thanks, Hori!

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.000
Popular, huh?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.750
What, uh, what's popular?

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.450
Hori.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.830
Oh, yeah. I wish I could
get good grades like her.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.120
Miyamura.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.330
Huh? Wh-What?

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.500
You and Hori sure have
been getting along lately.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.950
You two dating?

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.660
No! Of course not, that's ridiculous!

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.830
Yeah, thought so.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.950
The two of you aren't anything alike.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.580
Yeah, you're right.
We wouldn't make a good couple.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.910
We just don't match up, uh...

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.660
Use your words, man!

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.620
Don't see those two together often.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.700
Let's go, Hori!

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.950
S-Sorry--oh.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.870
What?

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.450
Ishikawa-kun, do you have a crush on Hori-san?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.830
Wha--?!

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.200
S-So what if I do?!

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.580
Wait, really?!

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.330
What?!

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.040
So <i>that's </i>why you always glare
at me when I'm talking to Hori-san!

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.370
W-Well, yeah, I do! So don't...

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:50.370
Sorry, Ishikawa-kun, I didn't know
you had a crush on Hori-san!

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.250
Don't announce it to the whole school!

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.000
Oh, sorry! Is it still a secret? I'm so sorry!

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.200
Yo! What're you guys doing? We gotta go to P.E.!

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.540
We're already gonna be late,
so let's take our time heading over.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.120
Actually, here's something I've
been wondering about for a while.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.410
Why are you wearing your winter
uniform in the middle of summer?

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.580
Um, uh...

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.000
I get cold?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.450
You're sweating buckets.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.790
I know what it's going
to sound like, Ishikawa-kun,

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.160
but the only person who's seen me
without a shirt on is Hori-san.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.200
What?! Why?!

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.250
Ishikawa-kun, you won't snitch
on me to a teacher, right?

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.200
Hell no, I wouldn't!

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.450
It'd be a real pain if they found out...

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.290
So please don't tell anyone.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.200
What the hell? Are those tattoos?
Wait, they're <i>real</i>?!

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.330
Yeah.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.790
Yeah, I can see why you can't wear
our short-sleeved uniform now.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:49.660
Yeah.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.370
Holy shit.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.830
I totally had you pinned for
the weird, gloomy, otaku type,

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.500
but damn, was I wrong.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.830
You're wrong about otaku,
but everything else is spot on.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.250
Now that I'm getting a good look
at him, he <i>does </i>have a nice face.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.080
Though his hair is obnoxious.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.620
Was P.E. in the gym today?

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.040
Is this the kind of face Hori's into?

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.080
Wh-What?

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.790
Whoa! Dude, you have piercings, too?!

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.080
Okay, next!

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.120
You're a funny guy.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.870
Why get inked or pierced if
you're just gonna end up hiding it?

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.080
You know how you do things
in the spur of the moment?

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.500
No, I don't.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.370
If you're gonna keep hiding them,
then I won't tell anyone.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.580
Though I wanna know why you and
Hori-san suddenly got all buddy-buddy.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.370
It wasn't sudden.
It happened a little while back, actually.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.160
But I get the feeling
she's just being nice to me.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.000
We're not anything more
than friends, don't worry.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.450
So you don't mind if I ask her out?

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.620
Wh-Why are you asking for my permission?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.250
I dunno, just felt like it.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.620
That's up to Hori-san, not me.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.120
I can't believe you skipped P.E., Toru...

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.040
You had gym duty, too! Instead,
I had to be the one to clean up!

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.290
I said I'm sorry!

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.870
Think about what you've done!

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.080
I am! I know!

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.120
You were hanging out with Toru? That's random.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.080
Oh, yeah. We were just talking.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.660
Hey, why're you avoiding me?

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.410
I'm not.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.160
Look me in the eye when you're talking to me!

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.500
I-I'm not, it's just...

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.330
What is it? Did I do something wrong?

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.660
N-No...

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.250
Hori!

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.370
Huh?

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.700
I wanna talk to you later. Is after school okay?

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.790
After school?

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.410
Oh, but I--

00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.080
Hori-san, I'll go pick up Sota for you.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.910
Go talk with Ishikawa-kun, okay?

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.750
Huh? But...

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.950
Oh, she's home!

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.620
If they ended up dating,

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.700
I'd be a huge third wheel.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.580
Sorry I'm late, Sota!
I'll start dinner in a little bit.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.410
Okay!

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.700
Welcome back.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.290
We need to talk.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:50.910
If she says, "you need to stop
coming over," then that's that.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.500
Toru told me everything.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.620
Oh.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.830
Did you seriously tell him you
don't think we're a good match?

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.410
Wha...? Huh?!

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:06.080
Did you really say that you think I'm,
I'm just being <i>nice </i>to you?!

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.080
Wait--What about Ishikawa-kun?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.160
Forget about Toru right now!

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.000
Huh?!

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.500
Did you say that?

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.000
Did you tell him all that, Miyamura?!

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.330
I did.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.790
That's really what you think this is?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.750
You've been thinking that the
whole time you've been coming over?

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.120
No!

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.540
No, just... Ishikawa-kun's right,
I'm so gloomy and boring,

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.580
I figured I was dragging down
your reputation, or bothering you.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.160
So it's not like I think it's true or anything!

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.450
Hori-san?! Why--?

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:49.830
Why...? Why?

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.120
Why would you give
a crap about my "reputation"?!

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.790
Don't just <i>assume </i>stuff without even asking!

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.700
Don't you ever say something
like that again, dummy!

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.160
Sorry, Hori-san. I'm really sorry.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.500
Just remembering what you said

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.160
makes me so mad!

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.870
Wha--? Hori-san?!

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.410
If you stopped coming over, Miyamura,

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.330
--who'd wake me up when
I fell asleep watching a movie?

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.080
--H-Hey--
--who'd wake me up when
I fell asleep watching a movie?

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.290
--who'd wake me up when
I fell asleep watching a movie?

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.120
--Or eat your portion of dinner?

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:18.830
--Huh?
--Or eat your portion of dinner?

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.870
--Huh?
--I'd have food left over!

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.370
--I'd have food left over!

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.200
Toru?

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.910
I turned him down.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.290
Aww. He seems really sweet, though.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.040
What? You're creeping me out.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.410
Do you have a crush on him or something?

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.950
Why don't <i>you </i>guys date?

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.830
Oh, I don't think we'd make a good couple.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.700
That's your first reaction?

"You Wear More Than One Face"

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.450
Morning, Miyamura.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:26.040
So, uh, yesterday, I...

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.370
You don't have to say it out loud, Ishikawa-kun!

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:33.410
You're such a sweet guy!

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.620
What's going on?

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.790
No idea. Maybe he's getting asked out?

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.000
Who's doing the asking?
