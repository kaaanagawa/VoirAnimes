00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.620
There you are.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.410
P.E.'s already started.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.450
They threw my gym clothes in the garbage.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.620
Did they?

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.290
You're right, I remember that now.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.250
Everyone's having so much fun. I hate them.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.200
I did, didn't I?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.120
I hate people in cliques, too.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.910
Because it made me feel like I was
getting excluded for no good reason.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.250
I hate breaks, too.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.410
Because it felt like everyone was
pointing out how isolated I was.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.290
I hated teachers, too, because
they made us work in groups,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.410
and I'd get excluded.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.870
I especially hated special events at school.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.870
Thinking back on those days, I can't
remember a single thing I didn't hate.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.120
Nobody needs me around, anyway.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.540
Can I just die?

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.250
You should probably hold off on dying.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.580
Wait a little longer and you'll make
a friend. An annoying one, but still.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.830
You'll also meet a tall guy who's
kind and a girl who's friendly,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.830
and a kinda-cowardly student council
president and his little posse.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.410
Lots of people will want to be friends with you.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.120
Not only that,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.660
but you'll meet someone
who cries for you, laughs for you,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.450
gets sad for you, gets mad for you,
and scolds you when you need scolding.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.540
She's waiting for you, I promise.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.040
If that's true, then...

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.330
Then...

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.290
Huh? What was I just dreaming about?

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.870
I wanna see Hori-san.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:34.580 line:20%
"Horimiya"

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.410
The boy I love is really weak.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.000
Really, really weak.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.910
He doesn't actually like yelling at people.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.290
He'll laugh about being unathletic,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.120
when really, he wishes he wasn't.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.910
Boys and girls alike all fawn over him,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.410
which makes him happy,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.830
but every now and then,
it makes him feel anxious.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.830 line:20%
"The Truth Deception Reveals"

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.790 line:20%
"The Truth Deception Reveals"

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.790
There's so much he struggles with,
and I love him so much.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.910
There's so much he struggles with,
and I love him so much.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.370
O-Oh, no! Sengoku-kun, get it, I'm scared!

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.620
His expression screams "I'm scared, too!"

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.250
But...

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.120
That really freaked him out. Good job.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.790
The boy I love is weak,
but he tries really hard.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.950
But you know,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.370
back when we met,
he was a totally different person.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.370
Man, I have such a crush on Ayasaki.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.790
Her face is so tiny and cute, you know?

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.410
Yeah, totally!

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.910
She's so hard to approach, though.
Like, she thinks she's too good for us.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.370
Probably 'cause she knows all
the guys have the hots for her.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.790
Out of all the girls,
Ayasaki and Kono really stick out.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.580
They're like Beauty and the Beast.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.500
You think so? They're both pretty normal.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.620
C'mon, dude, Ayasaki's super hot.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.580
Not really. They both look normal.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.910
What were you reading in class just now?

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.790
Some manga?

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:04.660
Goethe.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.950
Gerta? What's that?

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.870
Goethe. He's an author.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.580
Oh, that's not the name of the book. Is it good?

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.000
Do you like to read, too, Ayasaki-san?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.370
Not during class, but yeah, I like reading.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.040
Like <i>Grimm's Fairy Tales</i>.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.500
You mean like, <i>Snow White</i>?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.000
Yeah, like <i>Snow White</i>.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.370 line:20%
"Snow White"

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.000 line:20%
"Snow White"

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.000
I brought these for you to borrow.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.160
I brought these for you to borrow.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.790
Really?

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.750
There are a bunch of stories in there,
so hopefully you'll find one you like.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.700
Wow, thanks!

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.580
That'll be a fun read, Remi.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.160
Yeah!

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.750
Oh, do you like books like these, too, Kono-san?

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.450
Wait, me? Yeah.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.830
Then you can borrow them after Ayasaki-san.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.700
I really like the third story in
the collection. It's really captivating.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.540
Wait, are you sure?

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.160
Yeah.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.620
Th-Thanks.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.540
You're welcome.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.540
I really liked these. Thanks!

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.790
Then here, read these next.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.450
Whoa, more books?! Sweet!

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.950
How many books do you own?

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.910
They're mostly my parents'. We have
a whole room full of them at my house.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.870
Really? I wish I could see.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.120
You want to? You can.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.330
Oh, don't worry; I won't be
weird about it or anything!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.870
Oh, uh, sure, got it.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.950 line:20%
"Sengoku"

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.370 line:20%
"Sengoku"

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.370
Wow, you really <i>do </i>have a whole roomful!

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.410
Wow, you really <i>do </i>have a whole roomful!

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.330
We haven't cleaned in here much,
so watch out for the dust.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.330
Are you okay?!

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.120
I'm fine! I shouldn't have
touched without asking.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.910
I just wanted to see this one book.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.200
Oh, that one's really old.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.870
What's it about?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.000
The day before the world ends, I think?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.160
Is it the whole world,
or just Japan that gets destroyed?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.580
Think it's the whole world.
Everyone goes into a panic.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.080
If you knew the world was going to end tomorrow,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.910
you probably wouldn't feel like
doing much of anything, huh?

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.370
You think so? I'd wanna
blow through all my money.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.040
And I'd load up on desserts, too.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.000
Huh? You're spending your
last day on Earth eating dessert?!

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.540
There are tons I've never tried! Might as well!

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.250
I see.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.080
Are your pigtails up higher today?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.250
Y-Yeah, I just felt like it.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.290
I like it. It looks nice!

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.290
Really?!

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.080
If you're cute, you can do
whatever, you'll still be cute!

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.580
Guess you don't understand where
I'm coming from, though, Sengoku-kun.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.870
Sorry to interrupt! Can I borrow you?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.120
Thanks for lending these to me! I read 'em all.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.120
You didn't have to rush through them.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.700
I didn't! They were so good,
I ended up on a reading binge.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.370
Man, though, I really wouldn't
want the world to end tomorrow!

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.250
What about all those desserts, though?

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.830
The end of the world is no time for desserts!

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.700
Kamioka has a crush on you, Ayasaki-san.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.830
Mmkay.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.870
Hey, can I go over to your
place again today, Sengoku-kun?

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.040
Sure.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.370
Just, I know you're used
to talking to guys, Ayasaki-san,

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.160
but I might get the wrong
idea about your intentions.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.370
You'll like this series, Ayasaki-san.
It's long, but totally worth the read.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.250
Can't wait to read it, then.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.870
Hey, Sengoku-kun?

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.790
So, Sengoku-kun, I, uh...

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:13.910
What is it?

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.250
Nothing, just, uh, what if--

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.250
What if the world was gonna end
tomorrow? What would you do?

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.040
Huh? Oh, you mean like that book?

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.910
I mean, kind of, but... sure.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.450
I'd tell you I liked you.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.910
Then I'd turn to space dust.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.830
The end.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.790
Was that a joke?

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.410
No.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.040
It wasn't.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.500
Never mind, just forget it!

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.660
Why're you so embarrassed?

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.580
I-I am <i>not </i>embarrassed!

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.410
C'mon, don't lie.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.580
I'm not lying! I'm not embarrassed at all!

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.330
I know you are. Your face is all red!

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.120
I'm glad.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.620
Yeah, sure.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.450
You know,

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.370
I like you, too, Sengoku-kun!

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.080
I like you, too, Remi.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.500 line:20%
"Through the Seasons With You"

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.500
Here. Thanks for letting me borrow it.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.700
Here. Thanks for letting me borrow it.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.450
Huh? You finished it in just one day?!

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.830
I finished studying early,
so I had some extra time.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:48.330
Oh, cool. What'd you think
of this bestselling tearjerker?

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.830
It was okay.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.080
He's lying.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.000
He cried while reading it last night.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.750
When we met, he didn't get swept away
by those around him. I loved him then.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.000
And I love who he is now, too.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.290
His weak points, the fact that
he can't lie, how hard he tries--

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.950
I love all of him.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.540
So... why the sudden urge to give me a manicure?

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.120
Well, I was cleaning my room
and found some unopened bottles.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.000
I thought this color'd look good on you.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.790
Okay.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.370
O-Oh, no.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.500
I shouldn't, but I want to.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.080
She'd be so mad.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.540
Miyamura, other foot!

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.450
But...

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.790
Miyamura?

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.370
Gimme your other foot, c'mon--

"PLOP"

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.410
I thought if I stepped on you...

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.660
I'd get enough EXP to level up.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.330
What?

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.370
I'm kidding! I'm so sorry!

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.660
You're always messing with me,
so I figured I'd try messing with you today!

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.950
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.870
It's okay, I'm not, like, mad.
I'm just kind of surprised.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:14.080
Plus, like, you're always going off
on Shindo-kun and Sawada-san,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.200
but when you're with me,
you're so calm and well-mannered,

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.950
so are you, like, faking it for me?
Is this not you?

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.500
No, this is the real me, I promise.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.790
Oh.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.580
I mean, would you rather
I yelled at you and hit you instead?

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.790
No, definitely--

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.250
Goddamn. C'mon, Kyoko!

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.160
Who the hell d'ya think
you're talking to, bitch?!

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.790
Actually, that's kind of hot.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.160
What?!

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.040
Mornin', Miyamura.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.700
Hey. How's it hangin', Ishikawa?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.700
Fine.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.290
Damn, dude,

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.160
you still listening to this, Iura?
I mean, it's all bangers, but damn.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.700
--Dude.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.450
--I have no idea, man!
--Dude.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.450
--I have no idea, man!

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.410
Oh, Miyamura-kun. Could I please
borrow your Math B textbook?

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:09.330
Man, seriously, Prez? You forgot yours?
Get your shit together, man!

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:10.750
Ishikawa-kun!

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.120
Don't look at me! I got no clue what's going on!

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.790
What's up with you today, Miyamura?

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.000 line:20%
"Gloom"

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.000
What's up with you today, Miyamura?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.870 line:20%
"Gloom"

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.870
Kill me.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.080 line:20%
"Gloom"

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.080
Huh?

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.450
Huh?

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.540
I'm guessing this is something Her Highness
the Ice Queen wanted you to do.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.370
Yep.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.080
If you don't want to do this,
then you should tell her.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.330
Morning!

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.000
I'm begging you, Ishikawa-kun, get it together!

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.950
Stop making this my problem!

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.660
Wow, it was that tough?

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.750
Guess I'll never get to see you
get all violent with me, then.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.830
Well, I'll just wait for you
to forget, then give it a try.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.620
Really?! Oh, man, I can't wait!

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.700
Later.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.910
See ya!

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.620
Yup!

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.750
Wait, I don't think the physics
room is open during lunch.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.500
What? Oh, I think you're right!

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.540
Ugh, I'll drop these off after lunch.
Just tell our teacher I'll be late.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.580
Want me to go instead?

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.370
Nah, I got it.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.000 line:20%
"Sigh"

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.000
Excuse me. Do you have a moment?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.040
Huh?

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.950
Wait, hold on. Is this it?
Is now the time to try that?

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:26.750
But how should I act? What would make her happy?

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.580
Oh, hey, remember that--

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.870
Who the hell do you think you're
talking to, you frickin' airhead?!

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.950
Stop actin' like we're all buddy-buddy,
'cause we're not! Now shut the hell up!

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.370
Hori-san, I really can't do this!

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.790
That's the last time I'm gonna yell at you.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.580
Hori-san... I'm so lost.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:13.450
And now they're all talking about
how we were fighting in the AV room.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.500
I feel bad for freaking out the underclassmen.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.120
What's up, Yuki?

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.370
Huh?

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.370
Oh, just...

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.950
Just what?

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.410
You got asked out?

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.160
Yeah, four days ago.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.040
That long ago?

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.250
Don't leave him hanging.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.410
W-Well, I have to go turn him down!

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.200
Huh? You're turning him down?

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.450
Of course I am! I don't even know him.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.290
He looked, like, really serious, too.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.620
I just feel bad going up to him
with only a "Sorry, no dice!"

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.200
Why don't you have someone
pretend to be your boyfriend?

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200
Like Toru!

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.790
Oh, he'd hate that.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.290
I don't think he would, as long
as you explained what's going on.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.910
I dunno...

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:06.370
Yeah, it's happening after school.
Yup. See ya then.

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.700
Ishikawa-kun's in.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.370
That was fast!

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.660
So, what do you want me to do?

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.330
Just kind of feel her up
while she turns him down.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.700
Calm down, Satan!
I can't do him dirty like that!

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.290
C'mon, Hori!

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.410
So what class is he in?

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.620
Class 6, I think?

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.790
Yeah, Class 6. His name's Yanagi-kun.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.500
Hold on, Yoshikawa. You sure
you wanna use me for this?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.330
Wouldn't you want, like, a way
hotter guy to pull this off?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.910
W-Well, you're definitely a little
hotter than him, so it's fine!

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:38.950
Oh. 'Kay.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.500
Just a little! Just a <i>little</i>, okay?!

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.870
Heard you loud and clear.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.540
Shouldn't we head out already?

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.450
Yeah.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.540
Wait, you're coming, too?!

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:47.750 line:20%
"I wanna see who it is!"

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:47.750
Wait, you're coming, too?!

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.000 line:20%
"I wanna see who it is!"

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.000
Heck yeah! I'm worried about you!

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.660 line:20%
"I wanna see who it is!"

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.660
Oh. Thanks, Hori.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:53.830
Oh. Thanks, Hori.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.830
Okay, let's go.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:59.750
Huh?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.450
We're dating, right? Just for today.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.500
I forget who's even in Class 6.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.200
Yeah, hard to remember
when they're not in your class.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.000
Maybe Ayasaki-san knows?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.200
Just for today.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.660
You don't have to say anything, Toru.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.660
You sure?

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.910
Yeah. Sorry for making
you go along with all this.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.120
You better be sorry.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.080
Let me say just one thing to him, then.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.790
Like, "She's <i>my </i>girlfriend." That okay?

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.830
What?!

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.580
Y-You just have to <i>pretend</i>
to be my boyfriend, you know!

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.080
Yeah. That's pretending.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.950
Sure, whatever, say it!

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.250
I can't hear what they're saying.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.160
Oh, there he is!

00:18:52.160 --> 00:19:00.750
I'm so sorry I'm late, Yoshikawa-san!

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.950
Our teacher needed me for something.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.580 line:20%
"S H O C K"

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.580
Holy crap, he's gorgeous!

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.000
He's a <i>zillion </i>times hotter than Toru!

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.950
C'mon.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.160
Um, uh, I'm...

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.330
Oh, hello. I'm Akane Yanagi from Class 6.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.200
God, even his <i>name </i>is cool!

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.330
I'm Ishikawa.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.950
Miyamura's the pretty guy in our group,
and even <i>he </i>pales in comparison!

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.290
Hang in there, Ishikawa-kun!

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.870
So you have a boyfriend.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.620
Yeah. Sorry.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.410
I'm genetically inferior on every level!
Why should I bother existing?!

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.120
Hell, if he asked me out, I'd say yes!
What are you, blind, Yoshikawa?!

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.660
I guess that's that, then.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.330
I mean, Ishikawa-<i>kun is</i>
a lot more attractive than me.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.910
<i>Stop, I'm already dead</i>!

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.870
I'd better get going.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.040
Oh, okay.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.660
Yuki!

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.620
Why'd you turn him down?! He's a total hottie!

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.830
Huh?! Oh... he's kind of <i>too </i>hot, you know?

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.910
And I'm not into like, fancy,
expensive food and stuff.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.540
She's a total pleb.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.040
God, for a second there,
I thought I'd just died on the spot.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.200
That really scared me. He was <i>way </i>too hot.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.040
I had no idea we had
someone like that in our grade.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.750
Yanagi-kun?

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.370
Yeah, I know him.
He's super hot and totally hilarious.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.870
Hilarious?

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:18.620 line:20%
"WHACK"

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:18.620
Hilarious?

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.120
Ouch!

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.200
Yanagi, where're your glasses?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.870
Oh, I haven't bought a new pair yet...

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.580
But I'm okay, I don't need them that--

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.790
Yanagi!

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.580
That happens <i>all </i>the time.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.120
All the time?

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.250
His eyesight's really bad.
He's practically blind.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.330
He is, huh?

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.040
H-Hey!

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.290
Yes?

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:49.040
I think you might've had the wrong girl.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.910
S-So there's this friend of mine, Kyoko Hori.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.660
She's way taller than me,
and way prettier than me, too.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.080
A-Are you sure you didn't mean to ask <i>her </i>out?

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.790
Huh? Wait, why are you asking?

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:10.040
Oh, I'm guessing you heard
how bad my eyes are, huh...

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.450
I didn't have the wrong person.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:12.450
Huh?

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.290
I've liked you for quite a while.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.330
So I know what you look like,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.870
but I don't know who this
Hori-san girl is you're talking about.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.830
O-Oh. Okay.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.200
Yuki!

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.040
Hori!

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.120
Oh, sorry! Didn't mean to interrupt.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.870
Hey, it's Yanagi-kun.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.410
Hori-san? We were just talking about you.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.250
Yoshikawa-san said she had
an attractive female friend...

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.370
Hello. I'm Miyamura.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.410
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.040
Ishikawa-kun, you're here, too!

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.950
Nope, I'm Hori.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.620
Sorry! Then who might you be?

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.160
Ishikawa. We literally met yesterday.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.500
I'm so sorry, uh... Miyamura-kun!

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.540
He kinda needs glasses.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.040
Only kinda?

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.830
Oh, right! I just happened to
run into Yoshikawa-san here!

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.910
I wasn't trying anything funny, I... huh?
