Thanks for picking these up for me.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.790
Must be tough handling everything by yourself.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.790
I don't do it all.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.620
Remi and Sengoku-kun handle
the things they're able to handle.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.290
Remi always opens this window for us,
so we get this nice breeze.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.450
It's kind of cool how you work this hard,
even when nobody's looking.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.950
Wait, are you talking about me?

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.160
Yeah.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.910
You good with those papers?

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.750
Huh? Yeah, I'll be fine.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.160

Here.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.000
This for me?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.750
We were supposed to head
home together, but you didn't show.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.540
So Hori-san...

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.830
Ugh, you must be dying of heat!

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.950
Promise me you'll take your
jacket off when you walk home!

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.700
Here, I got some frozen treats.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.200
Have one with Toru when he gets here.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.120
...gave me these. Apparently they were half off.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.200

So I'm your garbage disposal?

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.160
Sorry.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.080
Oh, Miyamura-kun, your tongue's turned white.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.080
Maybe 'cause I'm eating this popsicle.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.910
Let me see yours.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.700
Whoa, it's green! Like, super green!

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.750
Glad <i>you two </i>are enjoying this.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.830
I bet I'm the only one who didn't get anything.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.700
Whoa, Ishikawa-kun, your tongue's kind of long.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.540
Really?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.250
It <i>is </i>long. Like a snake's.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.580
I'll have to tell Remi
and Sakura about it later.

Sakura Kono. She's on the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.500
Oh, the nerdy-looking girl!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.870
Don't call her that.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.290
Come to think of it, there are
a lot of girls on the council.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.410

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.660
You get to use the A/C in the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.620
Like a spoiled king.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.370

Hori-san and Mimyamura-kun have to go!

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.620
They swung by... and brought friends.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.660
I feel like Ishikawa-kun would be
a <i>way </i>better match for Hori-san!

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.330
W-Wait, really?!

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.750
Cut it out. He <i>just </i>gave up on her.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.080
Ishikawa-kun has a crush on Hori-san?

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.370
Yeah, sounds like it.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.580
If you really want to be with Kyo-chan,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.830
you'd better be one hell of a masochist.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.410
Wait, what? Why? Where's this coming from?

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.450
Ishikawa-kun has a crush on Hori-san...

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.700
Oh, crap, the cola!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.660
Who wanted that again?

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.750
They sure are taking their time getting drinks.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.370
I don't mean, like, they're
doing anything weird!

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.250
Yeah. What could they get up to
in the middle of the day at school?

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.330
So... what <i>are </i>they up to?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.450
Sheesh, get it together!

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.080
Sorry...

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.330
See, look what you did.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.870
I shouldn't have put it that way...

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.160

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.290
Stop messing around with my hair!

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.410
Messing around...

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.540
Hey, sorry for the wait!

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.410
We would've been back sooner.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.660

I'm really sorry.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.290
Huh? For what?

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.620
Hori screwed me.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.370
I'm really sorry to do
this to you, Ishikawa-kun.

--Wait, what?
--Stop! I don't want to hear it! Please, don't!

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.040
--What happened?
--Stop! I don't want to hear it! Please, don't!

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.830
He was holding Toru's soda when...

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.540
Oh, damn, that really sucks!

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.160
If I were you, I'd be going after
the guy who did me like that!

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.040
Yeah, Sengoku-kun!
That's how a real man handles it!

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.330
Aw, man.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.500
Yoshikawa?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.830
You've got a bunch of pens, right?

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.000
Could you stab me in the arm with one?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.700
Whoa! Why? Just cause you
got screwed out of a drink?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.910
Yeah, c'mon, Ishikawa-kun.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.330
I didn't mean to. It, like, just... happened.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.540
Yeah, one thing lead to another.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.160
I should've tried to stop it before it happened,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.790
but the deed is done.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.370

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.290
Ugh, c'mon, it's just a soda.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.910
Wait... soda?

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.700
Why's it exploding?! Dammit, Miyamura!

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.450
My hands are all sticky...

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.870
--Now we gotta clean the floor. Got any rags?

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.080
--Miyamura-kun dropped your soda.
--Now we gotta clean the floor. Got any rags?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.830
Man, is that all? I got all worried for nothing.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.000

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.950
Thanks, Kono-san.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.660
You're welcome.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.620
Sorry the A/C's broken.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.160
It's okay, I don't mind the heat.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.410
Though at night, I'll sleep without clothes on.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.200
Ugh, I should just study in the
student council room next time...

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.580
Wait, you sleep naked?!

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.120
Huh?! I mean, I wear underwear!

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.870
I just thought that was normal... Shoot...

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.200
Come to think of it, he doesn't
get embarrassed about undressing.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.950
Wait, was I supposed to get
embarrassed when he undressed?!

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.160
Ugh, just thinking about it
makes me feel embarrassed...

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.700
Hey, Miyamura, can I see your tattoos?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.410
Sure.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:40.500
Don't start stripping!

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.580
Huh?!

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.000
All I asked was to see them
and you just start stripping?!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.620
You didn't even ask why,
you just stripped! You're scaring me!

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.910
Your shouting is way scarier, Hori-san...

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.200
You're just cool with
stripping in front of people?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.160
Huh? I mean, you know what it looks like, so...

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.750
What about if you stripped in front of Toru?

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:04.040
Well, yeah, but he knows
about the tattoos and stuff.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.250
If Toru stripped in front of you,
would you get flustered?

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.540
I guess it depends on the situation.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.370
So that means--

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.250
Stop!

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.540
Hold on, Hori-san.
Why are you asking me all this?

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.410
'Cause you don't seem to
get flustered about anything.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:25.160
I was wondering what <i>would </i>get you flustered.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.660
Like, I haven't really seen
you get embarrassed or blush...

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.660
I'm always the one
freaking out about stuff, right?

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.080
I blush super easily...

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.540
Uh-huh.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.000
Oh, God! He's totally creeped out!

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.330
Wait, was I supposed to be embarrassed just now?

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.200
Okay, let's try it again!

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.790
What's the point?!

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.250
Besides, something's off.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.080
I mean, it <i>is </i>hot.
Going shirtless would feel better.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.830
So you <i>are </i>hot!

00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:01.700
Hey, Hori-san, do you really think
I've never gotten flustered, ever?

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.700
W-Well, kind of. Like a teeny bit.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.950
S-So not long ago, I ran into
a friend from middle school.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.830
A friend?

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.250
Miyamura?

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.040
Shindo?

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.200
Damn, man, I'm jealous!
You're finally growin' up on me.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.790
Wait, what?

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.120
Don't play coy with me, bro!

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.330
You mean me being a senior in high school now?

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.870

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.870
Heard you missed too
many days and got held back.

"Got Held Back"

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.660
That's not what I mean, you moron!

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.500
I'm talking about that girlfriend
you're always walking around with!

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.160
Huh?! Sh-She's not my girlfriend!

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.120
C'mon, like I believe that.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.910
I don't mind the joke, but Hori-san would.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.160
So her name's Hori-san, huh?

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.580
You don't call your
girlfriend by her first name?

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.790
I-I totally do...

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.200
I blurted it out in the moment...

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.370
Wow.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.910
Sorry. I thought I'd be fine with
him thinking you're my girlfriend,

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.450
but it still got me all flustered...

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.540
Oh, but don't worry, I'll tell him
right now that we're not dating.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.790
Uh-huh.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:20.000
I mean, you don't have to tell him we aren't...

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.790
Speak of the devil! It's my friend!

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.660
He just texted me...

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.540
What's that look for?

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.660
Ooh, he sent a picture. Lemme see!

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.450
C'mon, I wanna see!

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.660
One moment, please.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.250
Don't get all polite on me!

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.120
C'mon, please?

we're gonna do a double date sometime!
Don't forget to use protection, wink wink!"

What is that moron thinking?!

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.450
Whoa! Volume!

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.450
Aaaand delete.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.370
I've never seen you this
worked up before, Miyamura.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.450
Huh? Oh, no, it's just 'cause he's such a moron.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:56.700
--Like, for real...

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.290
--Hello? Oh, sup, Miyamura?
--Like, for real...

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.080

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.870
<i>Piss off</i>!

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.790
Is that how you always talk to
your friends from middle school?

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.790
Kinda.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.910
I thought Miyamura was the
kind of guy who never god mad.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.700
Why don't you try that
kind of reaction with Toru?

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.750
Maybe once we get to be better friends.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.540
He's shy about the weirdest stuff.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.750
You guys are pretty good friends
already though, yeah?

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.000
Y-You really think so?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.950
Well, that's creepy.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.830
There's so much I don't know about Miyamura.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.000
I wonder what he was like in middle school...

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.830
Mmkay, I got that, and that...

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.500
Am I coming down with a cold?

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.870
Is it because I blasted
the A/C after it was fixed?

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.290
--No way, only morons catch colds
in the summer. I can't be sick.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.120
--Hey, Hori-san!
--No way, only morons catch colds

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.910
Who're you?

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.200
Wait, their new song's out?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.870
Yeah, I borrowed the CD from Shu.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.500
Apparently it came out last week.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.870
Maybe I'll ask to borrow it, too.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.080
The vocals are awesome...

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.620
Huh? Isn't that Hori?
Is that guy hitting on her?

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.790
Wait, Hori-sa...

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.370
Hey, Hori--

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.950
What the hell are you doing, Shindo?!

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.500
--Hey, Miyamura! What a coinkidink!

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.330
--He punched him without a second thought!
--Hey, Miyamura! What a coinkidink!

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.040
Shut up!

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.250
I've been your friend for forever!
You should at least introduce me!

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.660
Koichi Shindo, second year,
went to my school. There.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.910
Sounds like how you'd find him on Google...

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.160
You know this guy, Miyamura?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.830
Huh? Nope.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.580
You just said he went to your school.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.250
Wait, <i>second </i>year?

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.250
Yup. I'm repeating the grade.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.250
So he's...

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.330
An idiot. It's 'cause he's stupid.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.080
Yeah, but I'm at Yasaka! You're so mean.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.660
"Hasaka High = Best School in the City
AKA Pachi High."
Yeah, but I'm at Yasaka! You're so mean.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.580
"Hasaka High = Best School in the City
AKA Pachi High."
Pachi High?!

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:49.950
Pachi High?!

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.250
Still wish I could've gone to Katagiri with you.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.410
What? Why?

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.790
'Cause you seem to be having a good time there.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.160
Though maybe 'cause of your girlfriend.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.250
I told you, we're not like that!

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.870
C'mon, don't be shy!

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.830
Shut your mouth!

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.410
Guys, if we're gonna stop and chat,
can we do it somewhere with A/C?

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.450
Oh! Why don't we hit up a restaurant, then?

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.330
C'mon, Shindo!

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.330
Aw, crap, that's the bell. We gotta
change classrooms, right? Let's go!

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.700
Hold up, Shindo!

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.160
Crap, I forgot my notebook. Go on without me.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.290
You gonna go to class?

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.660
It starts in two minutes!

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.790
Sheesh, at least pick up your stuff!

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.700
Here.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.410
Uhh, Yamamura?

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.200
Not my name.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.790
Huh? What'd you say?

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.000
That's not my name.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.700
Sorry! Your name's Yamamoto, right?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.200
You're getting even colder.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.160
Just kidding, Yamakawa!

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.950
"Yama" isn't in my name!

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.790
Kawada!

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.250
Now you're just trying all
the "Kawa" names! Come on!

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:23.410
--I haven't talked to a classmate
or raised my voice in so long...

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.370
--Wait, was there a "hashi" in your name?
--I haven't talked to a classmate
or raised my voice in so long...

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.950
--<i>No</i>!
--I haven't talked to a classmate
or raised my voice in so long...

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.370
...that it feels weird to be doing it now.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.750
Miyamura!

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.580
Hey, I was drinking that!

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.750
C'mon, lemme have a sip.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.040
Oh, hey, did you catch the concert
on TV last night? The Osaka one!

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.370
Yeah, I did! It was awesome.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.700
Right? The lighting and stuff were so cool!

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.660
I wanna go to a concert someday...

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.750
Shindo, you've been hanging out
with Miyamura a lot lately, huh?

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.200
Yeah, what about it?

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.700
You should probably stop, dude.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:10.580
He's all gloomy and depressing.
And he has tons of piercings and shit.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.830
I've seen 'em.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.700
When that kind of guy loses his temper,
it's bad news for everyone.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.000
Shindo, you gotta--

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.750
Who do you think made him get that way?

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:27.830
I know you guys are just mad
'cause you think he stole me from you.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.040
Don't worry, we'll hang out again sometime.

middle school experience.

middle school experience.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
--Yeah, though I haven't been yet.
--Shindo changed my whole
middle school experience.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:47.870
--What?!

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.660
--And the person who's changed
my high school experience...
--What?!

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.830
--And the person who's changed
my high school experience...

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.290
You seem to be having a good time there.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.540
C'mon, Miyamura!

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.450
...has got to be Hori-san.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.750
Whoa! Your fever's really high!

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.450
And Mom already went to work...

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.160
Oh, no...

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.540
Where're you going?

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.540
School.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.700
But you have a fever! You should rest!

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.120
I can't be sick. Only morons
catch colds in the summer.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.620
So I can't have a cold.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.750
You totally do, though.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.120
I gotta g...

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.200
C'mon, Sota.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.120
You're gonna stay home and rest today!

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.080
I gotta go to school,
so don't die while I'm gone!

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.200
I'm not gonna die. Have a good day at school.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.870
Thanks, feel better!

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.450
Sota sure is growing up quick...

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.330
Kyoko...

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.700
I'm so sorry, Kyoko,
but there's an emergency at work.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.700
I wish I could stay, but I have to go.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.040
Mama, I...

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.910
Ugh, my nose is all stuffed up...

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.950
Hori-san, do you need a towel?

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.500
Yeah, thanks.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.700
No prob.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.080
Let me know when you need a dry one.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.910
I also brought you a sports drink.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.290
Am I hallucinating? Why're you here, Miyamura?

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.500
Huh?

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.830
Sota called me this morning saying
you "might die," so I swung by.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.330 line:20%
"Cold Meds"

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.330
Sota called me this morning saying
you "might die," so I swung by.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.330
Sota called me this morning saying
you "might die," so I swung by.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.750
Okay.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.620
Did you get dressed for school
this morning? How high's your fever?

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.330
Thirty-ei...

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:58.660
Thirty, uh, <i>seven</i>... around there.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.120
Did you take any cold meds?

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.830
Yeah, not long ago.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.870
Okay then. Good.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.830
You should change out of your uniform...

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.870
Hori-san!

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.290
Wait... what?!

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.290
Huh?

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.660
Where are you going?

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.540
U-Uh, to get you a drink?

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.620
Where are you going?!

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.450
Hori-san, for real, though,
you should go lie down.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.120
Where... are you going?

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.370
Kyoko, you're always so
good at toughing things out...

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.700
I know I shouldn't take
advantage of that. I'm sorry.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.160
It's okay. Dad's not around right
now, and work's rough on you.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.370
I'm not a little kid anymore.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.000
I'll be fine.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.910
Have a good day at work, Mom!

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.040
Why?

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.160
Why are you never, ever, <i>ever </i>here?!

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.580
Where are you going?!

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:17.790
Hori-san, instead of "where are you going,"

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.290
do you mean, "please don't go"?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.410
Where are you going?

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.250
I'm not going anywhere.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.500
Until you say you don't need me here anymore,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.290
or get sick and tired of looking at my face,

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.450
or tell me to buzz off,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.410
I'm going to stay right here.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.160
Mmkay.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.120
Make sure you drink some
water later though, okay?

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.540
Okay, I'm heading out.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:09.040
I called your mom and told
Ishikawa-kun to tell school you're sick.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.790
Also,

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.000
I'm in love with you, Hori-san.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.160
Have been for a while now.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.120
There're drinks and food in the fridge.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.410
If you need anything, call or
text me. I'll come right over.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.790
Huh? What? <i>What </i>did he just say?!

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.580
I'm so shocked, my fever's
practically disappeared!

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.290
Why? Why'd he tell me in the
middle of all that boring stuff!?

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.500
He knew I was awake
when he said all that, right?!

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.870
I don't get it. I need to know if he said it!

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.870
But I don't want to make him say it again!

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.540
If...

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.370
If I pretend I didn't hear it,

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.620
maybe we can stay like this
for a little while longer...
