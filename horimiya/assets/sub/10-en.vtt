00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.500
I'm freezing! I'm definitely
gonna wear a scarf tomorrow.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.250
It gets pretty cold in the evenings now, huh.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.620
Y-Yo.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.950
Hey.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.160
Hey, you! Don't you go
stealing <i>my </i>Miyamura, Tanihara!

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.700
I-I'm not stealing him from you, jeez!

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.330
You guys are so weird! You're always
cuddling with each other and stuff!

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.410
S-Sorry, but that's all it is!

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.830
We've kinda gotten close lately, that's it!

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.040
The hell do you mean, you've gotten close?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.790
Closer than <i>just friends</i>?

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.500
Oh, please. I'm not Shindo.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.040
Dude!

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.750
W-Wait, really? Is that
what Shindo-kun is to you?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.410
"Creak..."
W-Wait, really? Is that
what Shindo-kun is to you?

"Trembling"

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.200
Absolutely not!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.700
C'mon, Tanihara, spill the damn beans!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.870
I mean, I saw Shindo go over to
Miyamura's to get a change of clothes once.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.660
Look, he stays over at my place a lot!
Even when I don't want him to!

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.870
A wild Shindo appears!

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.160
Why're you guys blockin' the
sidewalk? What's goin' on, huh?

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.830
Shindo-kun, are you close with Chika-chan?

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.660
Kinda? Though lately,
she's been busy studying for exams,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.540
so we haven't hung out much.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.080
Though I've spent plenty
of nights at Miyamura's!

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.290 line:20%
"* Playing video games."

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.290
Though I've spent plenty
of nights at Miyamura's!

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.870
Though I've spent plenty
of nights at Miyamura's!

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.500
Hey, Shindo, let's go get some Mickey D's!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Can't spell "burger"
without Shindo, am I right?!

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.540
Wait, what? Makes no sense, but okay.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.290
Is that free coffee coupon still good?

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.450
No, it expired.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.700
Miyamura, I just want you
to know something, okay?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.830
I'm not worried about <i>girls</i>.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.330
But when I think about
some <i>guy </i>taking you, I can't...

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.160
Taking me <i>how</i>?!

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.750
Promise me this! If you fall for
someone else, it better be a girl!

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.290
No guys, okay?!

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.700
O-Okay!

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.000
So I had to promise her "no guys" yesterday.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.330
You guys need to stay away from me, okay?!

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.080
Sure, but... what about when
you need to use the bathroom?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.500
I just won't go!

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.200
Good luck with that, bro.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:58.620 line:20%
"Horimiya"

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.700
Man, this is my day off!

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.750
You could've gone shopping
for art supplies by yourself!

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.250 line:20%
"Until the Snow Melts"

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.250

"Until the Snow Melts"

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.200
I want to hit up the bookstore, too.
I can't carry everything by myself.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.080 line:20%
"Until the Snow Melts"

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.080
Or you could just go to
the bookstore another day.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.250
Is that you, Yoshikawa-san?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.500
Yanagi-kun? Whoa, you're wearing glasses!

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.040
I thought it was you. What're you shopping for?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.830
Oh, books and stuff, but mostly art supplies.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.910
Art supplies? I didn't know you
were an artist, Yoshikawa-san.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.700
Oh, they're not for me, they're for my sister...

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.040 line:20%
"Stare"

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.370
This is my older sister.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.330
Pleased to meet you, I'm Akane Yanagi.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.370
Likewise. Didn't know Yuki was
friends with a hottie like you.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.290
Unless you're her <i>boyfriend</i>?

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.250
No, ma'am. She turned me down.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.370
I figured. You wouldn't date--

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.910
Wait, she turned you down?!
Not the other way around?!

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.660
Oh, my God, shut up!

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.450
Wait, hold on...

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.160
No, I'm far out of her league.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.660
Wait, Yuki's league? <i>This </i>Yuki?

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.660 line:20%
"You let this high-class meal go to waste?"

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.750 line:20%
"You let this high-class meal go to waste?"

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.750
You can stop looking at me like that!
I hear you loud and clear!

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.200
"You let this high-class meal go to waste?"

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.660
Sorry, my sister's such an ass.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.950
It's okay. This was a pleasant surprise.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.950
I never imagined being able
to speak to you outside of school.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.120
Oh, sorry, I shouldn't say that,
or Ishikawa-kun will get mad at me.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.040
No, he wouldn't. You're a good guy, Yanagi-kun.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.450
Toru wouldn't get mad.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.540
I'm such a liar.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.040
I hear those two are dating!

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.410
Wait, really? I thought so!
They <i>are </i>always together.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.290
Yeah!

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.250
They make a good couple.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.870
I know that Kono-san is totally fooled.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.000
Fooled?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.250
Kono-san thinks Toru and I are dating, right?

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.160
Does she? I have no idea.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.700
She sorta asked me about it yesterday,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.370
and I told her we were dating.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.700
Why couldn't I just tell her the truth?
What's wrong with me?

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.830
Did you want to talk to me
to see if I'd tell her the truth?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.250
Yeah.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.870
I'll stay quiet about it if you admit
that you have a crush on Ishikawa-kun.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.040
That's not fair.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.410
What's not fair about it?

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.330
You're the one being unfair, don't you think?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.700
She's right. This isn't fair to her.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:26.330
I lied to Kono-san, knowing it would hurt her.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.580
I'm...

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:43.620
I'd never seen someone's lips
tremble like that before.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.160
Remi-chan, I...

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.370
The truth is...

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.250
Okay. Thanks, Yuki-chan.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.620
I know this won't last forever.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.950
I know Toru doesn't like me that way.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:19.000
We should've stopped
pretending that very same day.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.410
But he holds my hand.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.370
He's nice to me, even when I don't deserve it.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.120
If I asked you to keep up
the act for a while, would you?

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.500
Keep pretending, I mean.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.620
Yeah, sure.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.120
Maybe I just want this lie of ours
to become something real.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.700
But...

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.830
That would never be okay.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.830
Yuki was out today, too.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.910
How many days is that now?

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.660
Three? Four? I think she's been out all week.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.870
Maybe she's sick.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.120
She'd text us back if she were sick.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.620
Right, Toru?

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.950
Toru?

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.620
Oh, sorry, what's up?

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.950
Stop spacing out! We're talking about Yuki!

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.160
Have you gotten any texts
back from Yoshikawa-san?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.410
Nope, she's not texting me, either.
Maybe she's dealing with family stuff.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.790
Huh.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.080
We should probably tell her the test
is gonna cover different stuff now.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.250
Oh, good idea.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.120
How funny would it be if she
threw a tantrum over the test stuff?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.000
I dunno if she'd throw a whole <i>tantrum</i>.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.700
I hope she comes tomorrow.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.250
Yeah.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:59.330
C'mon, you need to go to school already.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.330
Aren't you worried about your attendance record?

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.250
Hello? I'm talking to you!

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.040
Ow!

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.750
This girl called Hori-san called.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.910
She said you turned off your phone.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:20.250
Lemme guess, you want something again, huh?

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.160
Any time you want something,
you never say you want it.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.500
I have no idea why you do this.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:33.580
There's nothing wrong or embarrassing
about wanting something.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.950
But you need to decide
if you're going to get it or not.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.250
You always end up
complaining about it afterwards.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.370
I want a hair clip like hers!

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.370
Yuki-chan, you just said you didn't want one!

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.250
Here, take it.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.870
If you want something, then say so.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.950
You've had this bad habit forever.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.910
Hey, you stopped making those cookies, huh.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.620
That last batch you did was pretty good.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.910
Those pure-white ones, like snow--
like your name. Those were good.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.700
Pure-white, like snow.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.870
Like my name.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.790 line:20%
"12 New Messages"

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.410
"Hori: You're out again today. Sick?
Hope you're okay.
Most classes were self-study today.
Lemme know if you wanna see my notes though."

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.160
"Toru: You getting my texts?
You're not picking up your phone, either.
We're getting worried. At least text us!"

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.790
"Hori: I had Miyamura show me how to make
cookies today, but my batch came out awful.
He ate some anyways, but ended up
in the bathroom for an hour... I feel bad!"

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.290 line:20%

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.000

Huh?

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.080
Huh?

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.200
'Sup?

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.540
Yuki!

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.120
Yoshikawa's back.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.450
Yeah. She looks good.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.910
Oh, yeah, did I tell you the test's
covering different stuff now?

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.950
Yeah, I saw your text. This really sucks.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:47.500
I guess it's still all stuff
I'm crap at, though.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.580
Yoshikawa.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.660
Can we talk?

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.330
Sure.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.870
This is probably the end
of our little game of pretend.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.700
What do you wanna talk about?

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.750
It's freezing up here; let's make it quick!

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.410
I gotta give Hori her notebook back, too.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.120
Did you see my text?

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.450
Yeah, about Kono-san?

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.540
Yeah. When she told me she liked me...

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.620
She told me she didn't need an answer.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.750
What?

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.790
Wait, she doesn't?!

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.370
Yeah.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.330
For some reason she thinks we're dating,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.790
so she just wanted to get that off her chest.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:15.080
Why didn't you tell her, then?
That we're not dating?

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.830
I dunno. I didn't feel like I had
to clear up the misunderstanding.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.910
Besides, I promised you I'd play along.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:32.120
So if you didn't have to pretend,
what would you have told her?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.660
Please, Kono-san's way out of my league.
I wouldn't be good for her.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.830
She'll find someone way better than me.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:53.330
O-Oh. Guess that means
no more <i>sakura </i>cookies, huh.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.660
Yeah.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:04.080
I totally thought he'd go for her,
what with how nice she is.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.540
You haven't made me any of those
burnt cookies lately, Yoshikawa.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.580
O-Oh, shut up. I don't burn them anymore.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.160
I'm a bad person.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.000
Kono-san made him cookies every day,
worked up the courage to talk to him,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.200
and told him how she felt,
even knowing she'd be rejected.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.200
But all I do is run away.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.250
I'm relieved that he's not going to date her,

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.000
but the possibility of him
not reciprocating my feelings

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.370
makes me too scared to breathe.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.870
Even still, I...

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.790
I want to be the one at Toru's side.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.790
I'm so selfish.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.700
If she's warm Sakura cherry blossoms...

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.450
then I'm just gross, muddy,
freezing snow, just like my name.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.080
I can see your breath.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.160
I hear today's gonna be
the coldest day of the year.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.000
If it's gonna be this cold,
it could at least snow.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.160
We didn't get much snow last year.
I was looking forward to some this year.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.040
Nobody wants it to snow.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.620
You think so? It's so pretty, though.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.370
Sure, it's pretty, but only in the beginning.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.660
Shoveling it's a huge pain,
and you can slip and fall.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.120
Yeah, I can see Miyamura slipping.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.250
Yeah.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:49.700 line:20%
"FLOP"

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:49.700
Yeah.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.450
Yeah.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:57.200
And the gross muddy snow sticks
around for so long. Nobody likes <i>that</i>.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.450
Everyone just waits for
it all to melt in the spring.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.250
The snow doesn't melt just because it's spring.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.080
Huh?

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.200
The snow melts because it
decides to melt on its own.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.700
No matter how badly everyone
wants it to stick around,

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.950
the snow makes its own decision
to melt. That's why it melts.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.750
You got that?!

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.870
I-It melts because it gets warmer.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:52.120
So you think the snow melts
because the <i>sakura </i>blossoms ask it to?

00:17:54.830 --> 00:18:00.120
What is this guy talking about?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.000
Sounds like you need to go
back to first-grade science.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.500
E-Excuse me?!

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.410
I can't believe he can say
all that with a straight face.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.450
Still, it makes me happy.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.540
You're so frickin' stupid, Toru.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.580
Not as stupid as you, Yoshikawa.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.450
That's the first time you've smiled all day.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.700
How'd you know?

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.080
I just know.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.450
It's freezing out here. Let's head in.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.750
And whose bright idea was it
to come up here in the first place?

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.950
Yeah, I know.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.620
Your hand's warm.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.790
I really hope we get some snow!

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.290
The pure-white kind.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.250
Huh? You think Sakura got a boyfriend?

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:09.330
Yeah, only because she
seems a lot happier as of late.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.410
It's the exact opposite.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:11.370
Huh?

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.500
Okay, I'm off to tutoring!

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.410
Okay, later.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:22.000
Wait, what's the exact opposite
of getting a boyfriend?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.120
Or was she talking about her not being happy?

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.950
Sengoku-kun?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.250
Why are you cleaning?

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.410
The eraser bits on the floor were bothering me.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:40.410
You should let the first-years
handle that! C'mon, now.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.910
She's definitely in better spirits.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.910
Almost like a weight's off her shoulders now.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.790
And you should open the
window if you're going to clean.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.950
Where's Remi?

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.790
She had tutoring today.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:58.910
Remi always opens the window.
That's why I forgot. Thanks.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:06.910
H-Hey, did something
change for you lately, Sakura?

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:14.450
You seem happier, but I don't think it's
because something good happened...

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.790
I mean, I hope it wasn't anything, but...

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.250
Sorry, I'm overthinking this, aren't I?

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.750
Sakura?

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.950
Huh? Oh, I'm heading home.
Sorry I can't help you clean.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.370
Hold on, Sakura!

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.620
What... What happened?

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.660
Nothing happened.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.750
I got rejected before I even
had a chance to ask him out.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:56.290
That's it. That's all it is.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:05.830
What a moron. He's got to be stupid.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.750
Who's the idiot who didn't want to be with you?

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:16.330
He should be expelled for that.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.410
Am I right?

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.200
Sakura--

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:50.410
That was the first time I ever saw
someone in my grade break down and sob.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.540
It only hurts more because
nobody's in the wrong.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.540
It started snowing.
