00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.750
I went over to Toru's place
for the first time yesterday.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.450
Ooooh! So how'd it go with him?!

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.330
We didn't do anything like that, jeez.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.540
But he's got like, a massive
TV mounted to the wall,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.000
and loads of spare rooms on the
second <i>and </i>third floors of his house...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.790
I thought he was a poor plebian like me!

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.660
S-Sorry to hear that...

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.500
What's up?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.790
Shut it, you rich asshole!

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.370
--Wow, what the hell?

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.910
--You wanna order a cake?
--Wow, what the hell?

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.250
Yeah, I forgot to pre-order one this year.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.040
We should be able to handle it.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
We don't take that many pre-orders,
so we're not swamped or anything.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450
What kind of cake do you want?

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.200
Ooh, can I get one with
tons of whipped cream?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.540
Okay.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.750
I invited Yuna-chan over for Christmas!

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.330
So we'll have you, Yuna-chan, Miyamura...

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.580
Wait, is he gonna be able to come?

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.330
You'd better invite him over.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.250
Hell, I don't care if you can't make it,
but Miyamura better be here.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.160
Sounds like you might be
sleeping in a manger on Christmas.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.290
Christmas?

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.040
I'll probably be really busy helping
out at the shop from the 23rd on.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.790
Y-Yeah, I figured.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.580
Sorry. But if I get time,
I'll definitely come over!

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.250
It's okay, you don't have
to squeeze in time for me.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.660
Once we eat dinner,
we're basically done anyway.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.830
Sorry.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.700
What?! You're not coming
for Christmas, Miyamura-kun?!

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.370
No, sorry. I already have lots of work
waiting for me at home today.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.410
You're not coming for Christmas?!
Please come! Please!

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.500
S-Sorry, Sota...

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.580
Please!

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.410
I'm so sorry!

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.660
Bro!

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.200
Miyamura-kun!

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.120
Please, bro!

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.870
You know he's dating <i>me</i>, right?

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.290
Miyamura-kun!

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.000
Bro!

"Horimiya"

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.830
You know how up until recently,
I had a crush on Hori?

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.160
How recently?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.120
I thought he gave up on her ages ago.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.160
And you know how there was
the whole thing with Kono-san?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.200
Why does he think "we know" this?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.500
I have no idea what that
"whole thing" even was.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.580
And Yoshikawa and I are
definitely more than just friends,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.080
but I'm not gonna start
dating her or anything.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.410
--What?

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.290
--What?
--What?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.950
What?

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.370
--What?

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.450
--What?
--What?

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.540
--What?

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.620
What?

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.910
I thought they were already dating.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.660
See, I thought that's how you'd react!

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.700
I thought you thought
"I thought they were already dating"!

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.540
Stop <i>thinking</i>, you're gonna
give Iura-kun an aneurism!

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.330
You thought... we thought...

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.540
Look, we're not dating!

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.250
Well, okay, but...
don't you have a crush on her?

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.870
Hell yeah, I like her!

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.500
How are you not embarrassed
to admit that out loud?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.790
I mean, do you guys think this is weird?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.160
I don't think it's weird,
I'm just surprised.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.500
But, like, shouldn't you be more
concerned about what <i>she </i>thinks of you,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.500
rather than what <i>we </i>think of you?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.080
If you two are happy with your
current relationship, then that's fine.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.700
It's not my place to say
whether it's right or not.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.370
Wait, what?

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.250
You're so cool, Sengoku-san!

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.910
Advice sure sounds different when
it's coming from a master romancer.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.620
When was I ever a "master romancer"?!

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.580

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.000
Can I come by your place
to play video games today?

"Hitherto, and Forevermore"

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.330
I wanna finish the game we started before.

"Hitherto, and Forevermore"

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.950
You do? Yeah, sure, you can come over.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.290
You do? Yeah, sure, you can come over.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.410
Wait, no, not today.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.410
Oh, why? You have plans already?

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.500
No, I don't have plans.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.700
It's something else...

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.160
No, it's fine. You can come over.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.200
Really? It's fine if
today's not a good day!

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.000
No, it's fine. It was gonna
happen sooner or later...

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.910
Sheesh, I never get used
to how huge your house is.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.580
I'm home.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.120
Why are you being so quiet?

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.450
C'mon, Yoshikawa,
let's get upstairs. C'mon, c'mon!

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.330
Huh?

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.290
C'mon, c'moooon!

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.080
Ugh, why is this hallway so long?!

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.870
Oh, maybe his mom or dad are home...

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.700
And he doesn't want me to meet them?

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.830
Sorry to rush you, Yoshikawa.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.450
No, it's my fault.
I wish I were a hot guy.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.450
What? Wait, why?!
What are you talking about?

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.080
I mean, if I were, you wouldn't...

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.660
W-Wait, why are you locking the door?

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.540
Huh? I mean...

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.870
Wh-Why are you loosening your tie?!

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.080
Huh?!

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.580
I mean, I always take
my tie off when I get home.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.620
Yoshikawa--

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.200
There.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.330
Huh?

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.410
I'm not gonna try anything weird with you,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.410
but I don't want you to
be uncomfortable in here.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.950
I have no idea what I did wrong.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.540
I-It's not your fault!

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.410
I'm not uncomfortable
or scared or anything.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.500
Oh, uh, is that right?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.330
Yeah.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.660
Oh.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.790
Toru-kun?

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.790
Oh, no, I forgot!

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.580
--Huh?

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.120
--That's weird. Why are you
closing the door on me?
--Huh?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.000
--That's weird. Why are you
closing the door on me?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.950
Do you have a friend over?

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.950
Hey! Yeah, I do! Don't barge in!

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.450
Wait, is that your mom? Is she your mom?!

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.540
Oh, then let me get you two some drinks!

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.040
No thanks! We're good! Thank you!

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.950
She's blocking it with her foot.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.750
Come now, don't be rude to your guest!

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.700
I can leave if I shouldn't be here, Toru!

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.200
No, you're good!
Stay right there, Yoshikawa!

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200
Okay!

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.540
So her name's Yoshikawa-san, then?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.330
Do you like cake?

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.040
Y-Yes, ma'am.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.540
Let me go get you some.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.750
I told you, we're good!

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:02.910
--But she's our guest!

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.410
--Wh-Who is she?
--But she's our guest!

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.080

I'll go get that for you.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.660
Fine.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.580
And don't barge in without knocking.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.500
Weren't you gonna go get us some cake?!

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.700
Okay, okay. You're so impatient.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.080
Is that your mom?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.410
Thank God she's not. That's Yashiro-san.
She helps out around the house.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.790
She always bombards me
with questions about you.

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:35.370
--Really?

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.950
--Like, "Who were you walking
with the other day?"
--Really?

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.500
--Like, "Who were you walking
with the other day?"

always inviting over?"

She's such a weirdo.

Who, me?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.910
I told you to knock!

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.910
Oh, c'mon.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.620
Which would you like,
shortcake or cheesecake?

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.950
Short... no, cheesecake.

and I'll tell your mother.

I'm not gonna <i>try </i>anything now

I brought a girl over.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.000 line:20%
"Next Time: I Would Gift You the Sky"

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.500
Do you go to the shrine
on New Year's every year?

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.250
I try to. How about you?

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.040
Only when it gets less crowded.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.750
Wanna go together this year?

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.120 line:20%
"shake shake"

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.160 line:20%
"Fortune"

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.160
What's yours say?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.950
"Keep calm and carry on," basically.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.000
You sure that's it?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.660
I mean, as long as you keep smiling,
I don't need much more.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.580
What was that? I couldn't hear you.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.410
Nothing.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.250
Really?

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.620
I didn't say anything.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.410
I'm happy as long as you're smiling, too.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.700
So you <i>did </i>hear.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.370
Hear what?

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.700 line:20%
"Amazake"

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.580
It's kind of weird, you know?

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.330
You're the last person I see this year,

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.080
and the first person I see next year.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.500
Yeah.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.080
I hope it'll be like that
every year from now on.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.450
Hey, Miyamura?

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.200
Will we be together forever?

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.330
Yup, together forever.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.660
Forever.
