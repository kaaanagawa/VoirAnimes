00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.080
How long are you gonna stay here, Dad?

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.830
I dunno. You'd be sad if I left, right, Sota?

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.000
Gotta pee!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.370
Mmkay, don't fall in!

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.660
I'm wondering the same thing, sweetheart.
How long are you staying?

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.870
Why're you asking?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.580
Yuriko... do I not have a home here?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.330
I'm just wondering if your <i>job </i>is
okay with you being here so long.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.500
I'm back. Kyosuke, Miyamura's here.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200
Whoa, really?!

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.660
Thank you for having me.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.250
Who the hell are you?

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.290
It's your best buddy, Miyamura.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.750
Um, uh...

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.160
Th-Thank you for having me...

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.370
Hot damn, it <i>is </i>you!

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.040
Yes, it's me.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.870
C'mon, it's hot enough without
you smothering him. Get off.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.250
Damn, you sure are sweating hard.
Makes sense with the summer heat.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.120
Yes, right...

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.330
It's actually a cold sweat.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.000
I got an idea, Miyamura-kun!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.160
Yes, sir?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.410
You should take a bath with me!

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.870
Wait, what?!

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.750
I've already filled the bath.
Feel free to jump in.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.830
It'll be a while before dinner is ready.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.410
Oh, no thank you.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.790
You don't wanna bathe with me?

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.080
Huh? No, that's not it.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.950
Really? Sweet, let's hop in!

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.870
--Aww, don't be shy, it'll be fun!

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.620
--Aww, c'mon. Don't be shy.
--Aww, don't be shy, it'll be fun!

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.450
--U-Umm, sir, could I...?
--Aww, don't be shy, it'll be fun!

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.910
--U-Umm, sir, could I...?

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.410
K-Kyosuke-san! Please don't freak out!

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.000
These aren't yakuza tattoos, I swear!

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.790
Oh, right.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790
I know this is gonna be a dumb question,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.830
but these are disposable chopsticks, right?

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.790
You ate dinner with them and you just noticed?

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.660
But Miyamura-kun's got part of a matching set.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.160
I'm so sorry.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.910
Oh, it's getting late! I'm sorry
for overstaying my welcome.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.040
Might as well just stay the night.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.450
Huh?! Thanks for the offer, but I shouldn't...

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.000
If Izumi-kun sleeps over, we won't
have a futon for you, sweetheart!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.540
Why's it his?! And why
does <i>he </i>get priority over <i>me</i>?!

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.410
Are you gonna sleep over?!

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.040
I wouldn't want to impose...

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.250
Ooh, ooh! You can sleep in my room!

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.160
No! Miyamura-kun's gonna sleep with Daddy!

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.080
Awww!

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.700
Mmkay, goodnight.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.830
Sorry you've gotta share
a room with this old fart.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.870
It's all right.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.870
Bet you wish you were in Kyoko's room.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.750
Oh, no, no, no!

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.450
So, Miyamura-kun.
What do you like about my daughter?

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.700
I like...

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.750
...how she doesn't judge people by appearances.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.750
K-Kyosuke-san?

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.580
He passed out!

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:17.620 line:20%
"Horimiya"

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.450 line:20%
"This Summer's Going to Be a Hot One"

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.040 line:20%
"This Summer's Going to Be a Hot One"

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.040
Feels like I barely got any sleep.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.040
Feels like I barely got any sleep.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.660
Morning.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.910
Hey, g'morning.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.040
She's wearing her middle-school gym clothes.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.790
See you later!

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.950
Have a good day at school!

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.160
Want me to walk you there?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.080
Follow me and you're dead.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.160
See you later!

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.000
Thank you again.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.620
Izumi-kun.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.370
When you leave home in the morning,
you should say "see you later."

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.700
S-See you later!

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.950
I hope we do.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.660
Hold up... Did they just
come out of the same house?

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.700
Holy shit, Hori from Class 1?!
I thought she was single!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.290
Hori? You have elective with her, right?

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.040
She's super smart, and pretty cute, too.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.120
Yeah?

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.200
Why the hell is she dating Miyamura?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.040
It's crazy! Hell, I'd be
a way better match for her!

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.040
I hear Hori-san's dating Miyamura-kun!

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.370
For real?!

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.290
That emo-looking guy?! Oh my God,
what's <i>wrong </i>with her?!

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.120
Talk about terrible taste!

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.080
They're all talking shit about
them behind their backs!

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.290
And they're probably hearing it, too.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.830
Well, yeah! They were yapping
about it in the same damn room!

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.580
Even people from other classes
are joining in on it, too. Assholes!

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.040
I know. Just when Miyamura
had finally gotten there...

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.370
What?! Why are <i>you </i>crying, Yoshikawa?!

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.540
There, there, it's okay.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.660
Hey, Hori. Are you really dating Miyamura?

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.040
Yeah, why?

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.540
No way! Bet all the guys you rejected
are crying about that right now!

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.370
I didn't turn down that many, you know.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.370
C'mon, don't get all humble on us, Hori-san.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.500
Don't pay attention to them,
Miyamura. They're all idiots.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.330
I told Hori this, too, but keep your chin up!

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.000
It's fine, Miyamura. I don't really care.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.870
Aww, where's your hubby?

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.660
I dunno.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.080
Oh, shit, is he skipping school?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.250
Ow!

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.250
He'll be here after lunch.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.450
What the hell, Ishikawa?

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.410
Morning.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.040
What?!

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.200
Miyamura-kun! Why'd you cut your hair?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.700
Oh, I mean, it's summer.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.500
He cut it 'cause it's summer!

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.870
Cool!

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.370
Hey, why are you still
wearing your winter uniform?

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.290
I-I get cold.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.950
Wow, your piercings are so cool!
When did you get them?

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.080
Middle school.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.950
Your family runs a bakery, right?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.790
Holy crap... Talk about a cold glare!

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.580
I'm kind of cold...

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.450
Wow, me, too...

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.330
This probably won't last long.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.080
Huh? What won't? What're you talking about?

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.000
Why is it so cold in here?!

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.120
'Sup, Miyamura? How's it hangin'?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.500
Shu, you win the award for Best Reaction.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.500
Oh, it's just you, Miyamura! You cut your hair.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.250
Changing things up for summer?

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.540
Yeah, thanks.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.450
Summer is a good time for that kind of stuff.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.080
--Huh?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.000
--That chick just took a picture.
--Huh?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.120
--That chick just took a picture.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.290
I'll text it to you!

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.040
Ugh, that's so gross.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.870
Hey, Hori--

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.450
C'mon, don't try to outdo them!

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.950
Dad! Dad, check out his hair!

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.040
Thanks for havi--

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.950
Who the hell are you?

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.950
You can't recognize your
best buddy after a haircut?

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.700
Whoa, Miyamura-kun?! What a transformation!

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.750
Did you get dumped or something?! Chin up, man!

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.330
If I'd dumped him, I wouldn't bring him over!

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.540 line:20%
"Shindo"

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.910
Who's that?

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.120
Another girl?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.700
No, a friend of mine...

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.200
What do <i>you </i>want?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.790
Candy?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.200 line:20%
"Citrus"

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.410
Whoa, there...

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.200
Sorry we're late.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.000
What're you doing?

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.580
What's wrong with you?!

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.580
Miyamura! You've, you've...

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.410 line:20%
"My Miyamura"

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.410
Miyamura! You've, you've...

"My Miyamura"

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.700
My sweet, precious Miyamura!
He's gone, gone forever!

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.370
My sweet, precious Miyamura!
He's gone, gone forever!

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.830
I don't belong to you.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.450
C'mon, Shindo-kun, his hair'll grow back.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.160 line:20%
"Durian"

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.160
C'mon, Shindo-kun, his hair'll grow back.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.950 line:20%
"Durian"

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.950
Damn, this is a huge bag. Is it all just candy?

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:53.580
Damn, this is a huge bag. Is it all just candy?

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.000
Yeah. I won an online contest.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.120
I gave a bunch out to
people in my class already.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.410
Hori-san, what flavor do you like?

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.290
I'll take whatever.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.830
I've got pomegranate and fig.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.500
Do you have any strawberry?

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.500
No, Chika took all the normal flavors with her.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.660
So now you've just got the weird ones.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.370
Which flavor is that one, Hori-san?

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.290
Let's see...

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.080
Cheese?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.540
Cheese? You don't like cheese, right, Shindo?

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.830
Hell no. I'd rather throw my wallet
in a ditch than choke down cheese.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.580
Right.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.370
Say, "ahh."

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.080
Miyamura's feeding me candy!

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.160
This may never happen again!

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.580
But it's cheese flavor... <i>Cheese flavor</i>!

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.410
Are these guys really friends?

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.290
Is it good?

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.950
You know it's not, asshole!

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.330
You big meanie!

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.080
Which flavor's that one?

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.290
Huh? Uh, clay?

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.370
Clay?!

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.200
It's really bitter.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.540
Huh?

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.580
Miyamura, could you get me some water?

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.160
You're such a pain.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.620
Hey! You're the one who made me eat it!

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.500
What's up, Hori-san?

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.660
He stole my candy.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.250
Aww, what flavor was it? I have a bunch more.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.040
I-I'm good, thanks!

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.700
Okay, then you should give this flavor a try!

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.040
She's right. It tastes like clay.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.120
The girls've stopped
coming around to bother you.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.500
Guess the novelty wore off.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.660
Honestly, it's a big relief...

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.660
What the...? Do you know her?

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.870
No, I don't think I do.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.620
Why was she glaring at me?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.790
Why was she glaring at you?

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.950
No idea.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:16.540
We were watching TV when it came on
out of nowhere! We were so freaked...

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.160
What's up, Hori?

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.450
Oh, nothing, just...

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.660
Hori-senpai!

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.580
Who're you?!

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.410
Are you Miyamura-senpai's girlfriend?

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.580
Well, yeah.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.700
And?

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.330
Sorry to bother you!

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.910
Okay, she's really freaking me out here!

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.580
Hey.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.200
So, uh...

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.200
When are you breaking up with her?!

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.040
Huh?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.120
When are you breaking up with Hori-senpai?!

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.450
Wait, what?

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.370
Is he two-timing her?

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.750
Wait, no!

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.830
When are you breaking up with her?!

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.700
Never!

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.580
I'm Honoka Sawada from
Class 2-5, and I'll be back!

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.830
You really don't have to come back.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.910
I will!

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.830
What the hell...?

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.700
So she's a second-year, huh.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.950
She comes to stalk me on every break.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.950
What's her name again?

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.750
Honoka Sawada!

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.580
See?!

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:49.080
Okay, what do you want?
Why do you keep following him around?

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.290
I-I just...

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.410
You just <i>what</i>?!

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.200
Hori-san!

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.080
I can't help it! I like you so much!

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.160
I had no idea you were taken!

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.000
He's so lanky and has so many
piercings! Why do you like him?!

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.370
I had a crush on you <i>first</i>, Hori-senpai!

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.080
What a twist!

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.200
Ishikawa-kun!

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.370
Sorry, I was listening in
'cause it looked hilarious.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.000
Hey, quit it! Can you do something about her?!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.120
Hey, uh, Sawada-san? Could you let go of--

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.620
Shut it, you no-good punk.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.870
Huh? What'd you say I am?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.540
A punk.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.250 line:20%
"Yoshikawa, come to the entrance.
You gotta see this."

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.500 line:20%
"Yoshikawa, come to the entrance.
You gotta see this."

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.500
Let go of her!

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.580 line:20%
"Yoshikawa, come to the entrance.
You gotta see this."

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.580
No!

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:39.790 line:20%
"SENT"

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:39.790
No!

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.000
No!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.870
Sawada-san, if you were a guy,
I would've headbutted you by now!

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.290
I like her more than you! I <i>love </i>her!

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.910
Why do you even like this guy, Hori-senpai?!

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.750
Um... Let me think for a second.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.250
You have to think about it?!

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.410
She's <i>mine</i>!

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.370
Took you long enough, Yoshikawa.
The show's practically over.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.500
I dunno, this is still pretty damn funny.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.200
Hori-senpai! I made these in home ec!

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.160
Get your paws off her, Sawada.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.200
There they go again...

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.250
Shut up, Miyamura! Shut your piehole!

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.750
I'm not shutting <i>anything</i>!

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.660
Hori-senpai told me I could still talk to her!

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.540
Right, Hori-senpai?

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.540
Y-Yeah, I said that...

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.040
That's the bell! Let's get back to class!

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.700
Hey!

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.000
Hori-san!

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.910
Please listen to your <i>boyfriend</i>.
Let's go back to class.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.790
O-Okay.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.250
Senpai!

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.500
Miyamura!

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.330
Sawada, you freaking--

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.910
You have to stop popping in out of nowhere!

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.830
Where's Hori-senpai?

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.660
She went home early to get some stuff done.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.700
Guess I'll go home, too.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.580
Why're you going this way?!

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.830
Why're <i>you </i>going this way?!

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.250
Are you kidding me?!

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.040
O-Oh, come on!

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.500
What kind of whacky coincidence <i>is </i>this?

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.910
Oh, jeez, I left the key inside...

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.500
Thanks for the cake!

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.000
Wow, it's so good!

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.370
Do you just let anyone and everyone
into your place, Miyamura?

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.080
No, not just anyone. Hori-san
doesn't even come over that often.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.830
Wow.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.910
Maybe things aren't going as well as I thought!

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.500
No, I just always go over to her place.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.200
Oh.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.200
So, Miyamura, do you have any siblings?

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.290
Nope, it's just me, my mom, and my dad.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.620
I totally assumed you had
a little brother or sister.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.870
Why?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.290
'Cause you're good at taking care of people.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.040
What?

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.790
Why're you laughing?!

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.040
Oh, man.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.620
Honoka.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.370
You know, I...

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.620
I had an older brother.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.750
Huh?

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:01.040
He was a year older than me.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.330
Just kidding! I made it all up!

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.620
What?!

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.580
C'mon, I'm just joking around!

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.040
Oh, they're home!

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.580
Thanks again for the cake. See you later!

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.080
Hey, Sawada?

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.330
You can come over for cake whenever you want.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.660
Thanks.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.580
Yes, that did happen to the Sawadas next door.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.790
It's so sad that they had
to lose their eldest like that.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.580
You probably didn't see him much,
since he went to a different school.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.040
When'd he die?

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.700
Last year in... I don't remember when.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.080
Such a nice boy.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.700
Huh.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.950
Her older brother...

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.660
Who're you waiting for, Sawada-san?

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.200
A friend.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.330
Yeah, right! You're trying to
ambush Hori-san! Go home!

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.370
Who do you think you are?!
You're not the boss of me!

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.290
Hey.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.580
You free right now?

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.580
You're so short. First-year?

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.910
Wow, she got quiet.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:10.750
You scared of us?

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.200
We're not scary.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.620
C'mon, say something.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.370
At least tell us what your first name is!

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.410
C'mon, what's your name?

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.500
Hey, uh... wanna head home?

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.290
Yeah.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.450
Good idea.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.660
I was just trying to think of what to say...

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.160
Do guys make you uncomfortable, Sawada?

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.410
Kinda.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.580
You know, I'm <i>also </i>a guy...

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.910
Man, Hori-senpai sure is late!

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.580
I knew it!

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.200
Sorry that took so long!

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.950
I've taken a bath at Hori-san's house!

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.580
What?! Then I'm gonna do that, too!

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.410
You're not allowed!

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.120
Says you!

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.000
--S-Someone, help...

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.660
--Can we finish watching this later?
--S-Someone, help...

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.120
--Can we finish watching this later?

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.500
No, I gotta return it tomorrow.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.000
Horror movies <i>really </i>freak me out.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.870
I can't believe my own daughter
would bully me like this...

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.500
It's okay, they scare me, too.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.040
This whole series is about a girl
planning to murder her father!

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.750
You're reading too much into this.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.540
Do you really like this movie that much, Hori?

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.540
Man, I <i>so </i>relate to this main character.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.500
Their relationship's a lost cause.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.870
All this time, I sucked it up and took it.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.370
But not anymore!

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:44.200
I'm gonna go buy smokes!
Don't come looking for me!

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.450
Hey, Miyamura.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.250
You never make any moves on me, huh.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.750
Huh? What?

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.250
Do you want me to?

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.040
She's the one who said it,
but now she's all embarrassed.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.290
What's so funny?!

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.750
Nothing, just thought
you were being really cute.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.500
What?!

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.910
Hori-san, what kind of moves
do you want me to make?

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:36.160
W-Well, I...

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.000
Miya--

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.040
Kyoko-chan! You got any change?

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.750
Man, how embarrassing!
I totally forgot my wallet!

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.450
What's up, Kyoko?

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.620
Ow, ow! Owie!

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.410
What, did I interrupt something
goin' on in here? Am I a third wheel?

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.750
Yes.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.290
Let's reenact that scene from the movie.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.750
Miyamura-kun, help me!

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.950
