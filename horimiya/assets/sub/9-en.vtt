00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.290
I braided it the other day, too.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.620
You just let her do what she wants, huh.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.620
Oh, wow!

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.540
That's so cute, Miyamura-kun!

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.080
I love your hair like that!

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.660
Me, too! You should keep it that way!

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.580
Oh, Hori-san did it for you? It's adorable!

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.080
Man, your face is so tiny and cute, too!

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.160
Oh, there's the bell.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.120
See you tomorrow!

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.950
--Ow!

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.910
--Hori! It's not his fault!
--Ow!

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.290
--Hori! It's not his fault!

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.080
C'mon, let's go!

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.700
Hey...

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:11.620 line:20%
"Horimiya"

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.750
Hey, can I have my bag?

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.450
Are you mad at me?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.000
Is it because of those girls?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.580
Well, yeah, duh!

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.870
They treated you like you were invisible before,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.830
but as soon as you cut your hair,
oh, <i>now </i>they see you!

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.160
And they keep putting their paws
all over you right in front of me!

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.870
Not really.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.950
You sure?

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.250
Miyamura?

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.660
It <i>is </i>you.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.120
You should probably stop, dude.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.450
He's all gloomy and depressing.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.500
Whoa, I totally couldn't tell.
Good eye, Tanihara.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.660
Dude, you're such an ass.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.750
So what? You been doing okay?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.410
--Yeah.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.200
--Damn, dude, you got tall.
And holy shit, your piercings.
--Yeah.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.540
--Damn, dude, you got tall.
And holy shit, your piercings.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.290
Glad you guys are doing okay, too, Tanihara.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.120
Ugh, when you say my name,
it totally skeeves me out.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.290
What, did you finally grow
a pair in high school? Dumbass.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.950
And what the hell? You having
some weak-ass chick carry your bag?

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.870
Cut it out, Tanihara.
She might be his girlfriend.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.870
Damn, you really scored, Miyamura. Nice job.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.540
C'mon, say something.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.500
Are you done?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.040
Oh, hey, are you his girlfriend?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.200
Do you know what he was like in middle school?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.870
He was so emo and always by himself!

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.700
Talk about pathe--

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.080
Hey.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.200
I'm <i>asking </i>if you guys are done talking.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.120
Are you?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.290
Huh?

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.910
If you are, then piss off, assholes.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.450
I mean, I was already in a crappy mood,

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.370
but then they started treating you like that.
How was I supposed to hold back?

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.620
Yeah.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.910
Seriously, I can't believe
they were so mean to you!

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.410 line:20%
"It's Hard, but Not Impossible"

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.410
Yeah.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.750 line:20%
"It's Hard, but Not Impossible"

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.540
A small fry and a drink. Is that all?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.500
Damn, Tanihara...

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500
Did you start taking
karate classes or something?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.700
I just ran into Miyamura.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.000
Miyamura?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.910
Didn't you use to tease
him back in middle school?

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.660 line:20%
"Bunnies"

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.040
Whatever.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.080
Y'know, there was this chick with him.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.160
I think she was his girlfriend.
Do you know her, Shindo?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.500
Miyamura's girlfriend? Oh, you mean Hori-san.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.580
So her name's Hori-san.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.540
You should probably stop
teasing him like you did back then.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.040
Miyamura's really leveled up his DEF stats.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.660
What, is his girlfriend his summon or something?

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.700
He says he doesn't care about him,
but he keeps bothering him.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.580
He just can't get him out of his head.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.660
Does it hurt?

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.040
Huh? What're you talking about?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.540
Never mind.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.580
Thanks, Hori-san.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.410
What's going on? Out with it!

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.700
I have someone who'll get mad on my behalf.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.370
She's right here with me.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.870
U-Use your open hand.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.910
Just a little slap!

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.450
No.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.200
Why not? You did it before,
just do it again, like <i>bam</i>!

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.450
I <i>said</i>, no way!

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.790
C'mon, please!

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.250
Just one more!

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.950
That is the least punchable face ever.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.000
C'mon, she's begging you, Miyamura!

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.370
Where the hell did you come from, Shindo?!

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.040
Over there.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.750
I was just gonna stalk you from afar,

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.120
but you were being so mean to
Hori-san that I just couldn't just watch!

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.540
What kind of man are you?!

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.500
You were stalking me?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.250
Stay out of this.
You have no idea what's going on.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.620
I mean, it's probably something sexual, right?

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.870
Not at <i>all</i>.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.410
Aww, what, do you not love me anymore?

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.160
Th-That's not it!

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.580
Aww, poor Hori-san!

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.040
Quiet, you!

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.330
Hey, I can help you instead!

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.450
Whatever you want, I'm here.
Or am I the wrong man for the job?

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.620
Yep. It's gotta be Miyamura.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.540
So it <i>is </i>something sexual!

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.410
Do you even have a brain in there, dude?!

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.450
Look, we're leaving! C'mon, Hori-san.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.750
Hori-san?

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.290
Louder.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.290
Oh my God!

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.830
Move your ass, Kyoko!

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.540
Later, Shindo! And this
<i>isn't </i>anything sexual, got it?!

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.370
G-Got it.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.870
Ooh, can we go by the
convenience store, Miyamura?

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.620
Sure, you dumb bitch!

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.330
What the actual hell?

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.290
Tanihara.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.830
I'm thirsty. Buy me a drink.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.910
Buy your own damn drink!

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.370
Whoa, who put a stick up <i>your </i>ass?

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.750
Shut up.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.000
Stop loitering in the parking lot, morons.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.410
The hell's your problem, bitch?!

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.120
<i>It's his summon</i>!

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.950
How about you take your bitch ass and--

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.330
Don't talk to her like that, you moron!

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.000
Why're you yelling at <i>me</i>?!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.370
We're not loitering! We're picking up trash!

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.830
Yeah, yeah! We're Recycling Buddies!

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.870
Oh, is that it? Good work, guys.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.700
That was a close one.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.450
Dude, if you'd pissed her off,
she would've bashed our skulls in!

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.000
What, like some monster?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Hey, isn't that Miyamura?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.370
Ugh. Next time I see that guy--

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.620 line:20%
"Got snacks!"

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.620
Ugh. Next time I see that guy--

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.120 line:20%
"WHAP"
"You sure took your time, bitch!"

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.370 line:20%
"You sure took your time, bitch!"

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.620 line:20%
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
"Get a move on, moron!"

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.790 line:20%
"Us &lt; Kyoko Hori &lt; Miyamura"

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.790
He's a monster, too!

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.120
He's a monster, too!

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.330
Holy shit.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:53.040
What the hell happened to you guys?

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.410
I don't mean to kinkshame, but...

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.040
Is she right in the head?

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.410
Hori-san, look...

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.000
It's fine. Whatever you want.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.700
I'm just going to stop thinking about it.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.250
Miyamura sure has changed, like damn.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.910
A high school transformation?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.790
That's still some transformation.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:32.040
He barely talked back to us in middle school,
and now he's hitting girls?

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.620
I'm leaving.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.910
Wait, you're leaving?

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.080
Dammit.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.660
I'm back!

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.950
I'm heading out!

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.120
Already?

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.750
Be back by dinner!

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.500
You're still here, Kyosuke?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.910
I can't believe I have to say this,
but this is my house, too.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.000
Oh, Kyosuke-san.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.830
Could I ask you for your advice?

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.290
Hell yeah, I'm in!

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.370
Wait, what? That's suspicious.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.910
Shut it, it's time for a man-to-man!

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.660
So, what's up? You good?

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.620
Why're we in the bathroom?

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.500
I had a question for you about Hori-san.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.870
Damn, she preggers again?

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.580
What do you mean, <i>again</i>?!

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:29.750
No, no, just... she really likes it
when I get mad and yell at her.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.410
The hell? Is that her kink or something?

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.040 line:20%
"Deflates"

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.040
The hell? Is that her kink or something?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.410 line:20%
"Deflates"

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.410
That's what I thought, too.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.790
That's what I thought, too.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.790
Maybe it's just 'cause it's the exact
opposite of how you normally act?

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.250
The exact opposite?

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.040
Like if you got all dressed up
to go to the office?

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.580 line:20%
"Smart!"

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.580
Like if you got all dressed up
to go to the office?

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.000 line:20%
"Smart!"

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.000
Ouch, but yeah.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.080
Think of it like taming a fierce golem!

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.160
That makes sense.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.120
C'mon, get out of there.
How am I supposed to bathe?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.830
Kyoko! C'mere and sit down!

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.950
No thanks.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.330
But look how sad and worried Miyamura-kun is!

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.410
You're such a pain.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.580
Miyamura-kun's trying <i>so </i>hard
to live up to your expectations!

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.160
What?! Where's this coming from?!
I don't need <i>you </i>to lecture me here!

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.790
Stop blabbing about stupid crap
and help out with the chores for once!

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.870
She has a point.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.410
Ow, my feelings!

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.870
Hey, I made curry the other day! That counts!

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.330
No, it doesn't!

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.080
All you did was microwave it!

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.790
But you said it was yummy!

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.120
Yeah, because they make
the prepackaged stuff yummy!

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.700
Hey! Sota even got seconds!

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.450
Why is it perfectly warm?!

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.830
Miyamura-kun's dripping wet!

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.540
--Get your clothes off, quick!

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.870
--Wait, hold on!
--Get your clothes off, quick!

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.330
Don't strip in front of me, moron!

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.790
So I went to karaoke with Shu the other day.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.660
Sing in English? No way, man! It's way too hard.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.330
All he ever sings are <i>enka </i>songs and rap.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.290
He sure does listen to everything, huh.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.330
I know he listens to
Western pop, too, but damn...

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.000
Hey, Mizouchi.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.290
Damn, straight ignored.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.370
Probably 'cause I'm here.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.330
Huh?

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.080
Apparently he has a crush on Hori-san.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.200
Damn, how many guys want to be with her now?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.450
"rrrrrumble..."
Damn, how many guys want to be with her now?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.080
"rrrrrumble..."
There's one thing I know
about crushing on Hori-san...

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.700
"rrrrrumble..."
Don't fall for her unless you really mean it.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.120
Don't fall for her unless you really mean it.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.410
Speaking of Hori, where's she at?

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.410
The student council room, I think.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.540
Oh, I don't have my phone.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.410
Did you leave it in the science lab?

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.700
I'll go look.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.700 line:20%
"Science Lab"

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.660
Did you forget something, too, Mizouchi-kun?

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.410
Have you seen my phone?

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.000
No.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.910
Okay.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.080
Why would it be in there?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.540
Well, nobody else has
had class in here since we did,

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.790
so it's gotta still be in here somewhere.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.160
What's your number?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160
Huh?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.080
I'll call it.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.790
Umm, 090...

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.000
Found it.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.200
It was in your pocket the whole time?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.370
Thanks! You're a lifesaver--

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.330
Wait, why's the screen all black?

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.700
How did you break it two seconds later?!

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.040
Why the hell is she with you?!

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.290
No, I didn't mean...

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.120
Hey, Mizouchi-kun...

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.910
If you had to... could you punch Hori-san?

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.750
What?! Punch her?! Like, if were fighting?

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.830
Yeah, I suppose, kinda.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.910
Oh. I could <i>never </i>hit Hori!

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.910
Really?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.120
Then you could never be with her.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.040
Hey, Miyamura! Did you find your phone?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.540
Huh? Why?

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.410
Toru told me you're always
leaving it all over the place.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.330
You'd better be more careful with your--

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.450
Shut the hell up, bitch! Stay quiet for once!

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.620
Move!

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:25.950
--Hori!

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:26.910
--Leave her alone, Mizouchi-kun.
--Hori!

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.830
--Leave her alone, Mizouchi-kun.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.910
Oh... uh, okay.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.410
Miyamura...

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:44.000
I thought you were the kind of guy
who could never stand up for himself.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.040
I thought you were some loser.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.160
But guess it's easy for you to be
confident around your girlfriend, huh?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.200
Yeah, super easy.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.870
Whoa, why are your eyes all red?!
Were you rubbing them or something?!

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.830
Miyamura! Go away, there's not enough room!

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.000
Go where?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.450
Outside, jeez! Where are we, anyway?!

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.750
Outside.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.620
Huh?

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.330
This is outside. The only free space there is.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.660
What the hell?! This locker
or whatever isn't "outside" at all!

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.370
This is what it's like "outside."

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.700
You've always been on the "inside,"
so you don't know how it feels.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.290
Inside, outside, what the hell are you on about?

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.660
You're the one who brought it up.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:39.120
I think this is the first time
we've ever talked like this.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.000
Do you not like tight spaces?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.500
I hate them.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.580
Huh. So do I.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.120
Do you like being on the inside?

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.080
It's better than <i>this</i>.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.290
Even if there's nobody on the inside?

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.410
If all the people on the inside
with you came outside,

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.790
then you'd be all alone in there.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.580
Yeah...

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:08.540
You don't care if you're inside or outside.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.750
You just care that people are there with you.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.540
People who are on your side.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.500
That's it.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.750
I just...

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.580
Huh? Miyamura's number?
Yeah, I have it, but why do you want it?

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.910
Doesn't matter, just tell me.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.870
Okay, just hold on.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:55.330
Everyone knew the rabbits liked
Miyamura better than anyone.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.790
Huh? Why're we talking about rabbits?

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.910
Shut up. Just tell me his number.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.580
Ugh, he's ignoring me.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.200
Izumi! Could you go take the sign in?

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.580
Got it.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.870
You guys closed already?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:35.250
Sorry, we'll be closed tomorrow, too,
but we'll be open the day after...

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.080
If you turn the corner and go down for a bit,
you'll find another cake shop.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.330
You'll find a much bigger bakery
that's probably still open now.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.290
I want something from here.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.580
Oh, uh, you sure?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.370
It's fine, I'll come back
the day after tomorrow.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.830
I hear your cheesecake's good.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.950
It is.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.330
Cool. See you in two days, then.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.250
Oh, our fruit tart's good!

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.910
It's good, too.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.040
Then I'll get that one, too.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.410
Two of each.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.120
Two of each, got it.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.160
I'll be back.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.330
Okay.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.040
Oh, I tried calling you!

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.750
You did?

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.870
Sorry, my phone's busted.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.080
I'm gonna go get it fixed tomorrow.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.700
Oh. Okay.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.700
I totally thought he was ignoring me...

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.620
I was the one ignoring <i>him </i>all this time.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.410
It was me.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.000
Did it stress you out?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.580
Huh?

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.370
No, never mind! I'm heading out.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.160
Tanihara-kun?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.120
Thanks for coming.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.290
I forgot to feed them.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.910
Even though I was supposed to.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.620
By end of summer break, they were all dead.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.540
I was the one who told
everyone it was your fault.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.580
It was me!

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.540
Okay.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:54.250
Miyamura, you know, I'm...

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.330
I'm...

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.080
I'm sorry.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.040
What if I'd been able to tell him back then?

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.950
It hurts my heart to think about it.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.950
Okay, last one.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.290
Thanks for helping out.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.330
Yearbooks!

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.950
Oh, that's from middle school.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.660
What'd she look like back then?

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.540
Peek and you're a dead man.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.700
They're so annoying.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:37.040
They're big, and in the way, but you don't
actually wanna throw them away...

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:43.370
Did you throw yours away already, Miyamura?

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.540

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.040
I wanted to...

"Yearbook"

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.500
But they're so huge and heavy,
I didn't know what to do with them,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.750
so I just ended up keeping them.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:02.330
Now, though, they're actually
pretty important to me.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:07.250
Back then, Miyamura must've
wanted to throw it all away.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.200
I don't know what he was
like back in middle school,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.000
but I get the feeling that he hated
everything and was just drifting along.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.330
That that's what life was like for him.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:24.120
But now, he can look back and feel glad
that he didn't throw it all away.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.620
Wonder what Katagiri's
yearbook is going to look like.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.370
Guess we'll find out when we get it.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.080
They took the pictures
for it back in April, right?

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.000
I hope they got a picture
of me with Mizouchi-kun.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.370
Wait, why Mizouchi?

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.870
We've kinda gotten close lately.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.160
Really?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.660
He helped me find my phone.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.660
He was kind of mean
to me before, but it's all good.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.870
Does he get off on that?

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.370
I think I might get along
with Tanihara-kun, too.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.200
Wow.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.910
It might be really hard,

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.120
but I don't think there's a person in the world

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.700
you can't eventually be friends with.
