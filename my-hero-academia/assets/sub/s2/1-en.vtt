00:00:04.086 --> 00:00:07.174
<i>It all began in China, in Qingqing City.</i>

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.928
<i>There was news that a baby</i>
<i>that gave off light was born.</i>

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.681
<i>Ever since then, superpowers</i>
<i>were discovered in various places,</i>

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.684
<i>and time passed without</i>
<i>the cause being identified.</i>

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.979
<i>The world has become a superhuman society,</i>

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:24.191
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:26.652
<i>In this world swirling with chaos,</i>

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.155
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:31.782
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:33.992
<i>That profession is…</i>

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.250
It's fine now. Why?

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.211
Because I am here.

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:50.551
He's so cool!

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.138
Once I get my Quirk,
I wanna be like him, too!

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.558
BUT…

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.518
I'm sorry, Izuku!

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:01.728
I'm sorry!

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:05.315
<i>I was born without a Quirk.</i>

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:07.526
<i>I was Quirkless.</i>

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:11.280
<i>Even if I wanted to be like him,</i>
<i>I couldn't.</i>

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.660
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>I had to give up on my dream.</i>

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:26.753
<i>But my arm kept reaching</i>
<i>out desperately for that dream,</i>

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:31.967
<i>and thanks to the people who</i>
<i>guided me and keep supporting me,</i>

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:36.638
<i>I am here now.</i>

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:42.978
<i>My dream is becoming reality.</i>

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.942
<i>Even the setbacks in the process are real.</i>

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.071
<i>I'll say it again.</i>

00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:55.949
<i>This is the story</i>

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:01.246
<i>of how I became the greatest hero.</i>

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.301
<i>This is a follow-up report</i>
<i>on yesterday's incident</i>

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.969
<i>at the U.A. rescue training facility</i>

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:42.181
<i>where hero course students</i>
<i>were attacked by villains.</i>

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:45.309
<i>According to police investigation,</i>
<i>the criminals call themselves</i>

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.977
<i>"The League of Villains"</i>

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.730
<i>and have been plotting to kill All Might,</i>

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:53.817
<i>who has been a teacher</i>
<i>at U.A. since spring of this year.</i>

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.945
<i>Police have arrested 72 villains,</i>

00:03:57.112 --> 00:04:00.032
<i>but they still do not know</i>
<i>the whereabouts of their ringleader.</i>

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:07.956
<i>"Greetings. It feels like summer</i>
<i>is just around the corner.</i>

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:12.628
<i>As for you, sir, I hope</i>
<i>that this letter finds you well.</i>

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:18.466
<i>Since spring, I have been</i>
<i>a teacher at U.A. High School</i>

00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:21.512
<i>and have taken on the task</i>
<i>of guiding the next generation.</i>

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:25.307
<i>I thought to find someone worthy</i>

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:28.560
<i>to inherit my power among</i>
<i>the most promising students</i>

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:30.687
<i>aiming to become heroes.</i>

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:36.944
<i>However, before I took up</i>
<i>my post at U.A., I met a young man.</i>

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.281
<i>Even though this young man had no Quirk,</i>

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.741
<i>he rushed toward the scene</i>

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.077
<i>in a situation where pro heroes,</i>
<i>including myself,</i>

00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:46.245
<i>hesitated,</i>

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.748
<i>using what power he had to try</i>
<i>to find a way out of the situation.</i>

00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:52.960
<i>He may not have had a plan</i>
<i>in mind at the time.</i>

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:55.337
<i>Even so, he ran.</i>

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:00.384
<i>I feel like I relearned</i>
<i>from that young man</i>

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:04.221
<i>the essence of what a hero must have</i>
<i>in order to be worthy to be a hero.</i>

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.015
<i>That is why I told him,</i>

00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:10.978
<i>'You can become a hero.'</i>

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.731
<i>I proposed</i>
<i>to transfer my own Quirk to him.</i>

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:21.196
<i>The power cultivated by one person,</i>

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:26.827
<i>who passes it on to another person,</i>
<i>who also cultivates it and passes it on.</i>

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.955
<i>The crystallization of power</i>
<i>that spins together</i>

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:32.499
<i>the voices of those who need</i>
<i>help with a courageous heart…</i>

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.543
<i>One For All.</i>

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.797
<i>The young man inherited</i>
<i>my power without hesitation</i>

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:42.885
<i>and underwent training to be accepted</i>
<i>into the hero course</i>

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.344
<i>at U.A. High School.</i>

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.848
<i>Even as he struggled with his new Quirk,</i>

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:50.601
<i>he kept giving his all</i>

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.019
<i>to make it his own.</i>

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:53.520
<i>I'm proud of him.</i>

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.649
<i>I don't like to toot my own horn,</i>

00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:02.779
<i>but I do not regret passing</i>
<i>on One For All to him at all.</i>

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:06.575
<i>However, I am still inexperienced</i>
<i>as a teacher.</i>

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:11.079
<i>The day may come when</i>
<i>I must trouble you, my old teacher.</i>

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:15.417
<i>I am counting on you when that time comes.</i>

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:19.963
<i>Please take care of yourself</i>
<i>as the seasons change.</i>

00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.383
<i>I will continue to keep you</i>
<i>updated on my circumstances.</i>

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.843
<i>Sincerely yours."</i>

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:30.474
The boy acknowledged by Toshinori, huh?

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:35.771
THAT'S THE IDEA, OCHACO

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:40.234
The police have investigated the group
calling themselves

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.528
"The League of Villains,"

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.823
and there does not appear to be
anyone registered with the name Shigaraki

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.578
<i>in his 20s or 30s with a Quirk that</i>
<i>lets him disintegrate whatever he touches.</i>

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.915
<i>It's the same with the villain</i>
<i>called Kurogiri with the Warp Gate.</i>

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.042
<i>They are probably not citizens</i>
<i>and are using false names.</i>

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.003
In other words, they are people
with unregistered Quirks

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.964
who are part of society's underbelly.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.676
You mean, we don't know anything.

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:07.636
We must hurry.

00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:11.932
Once their ringleader, Shigaraki's gun
wounds heal, they'll definitely try again.

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.017
It'll be a pain.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.936
Their ringleader, huh?

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:17.563
What is it, All Might?

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.690
<i>It was a bold attack</i>

00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:23.277
<i>that normal people wouldn't carry out</i>
<i>even if they thought of it.</i>

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.654
<i>To suddenly go on and on</i>
<i>with his wild statements like that…</i>

00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:28.365
<i>Although he didn't reveal his own Quirk,</i>

00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:31.243
<i>he bragged about that Nomu's Quirk…</i>

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.037
<i>And when things didn't go</i>
<i>the way he wanted,</i>

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.498
<i>he was visibly upset.</i>

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.296
Well, the incident with the Quirk
was to also force my hand, but…

00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:43.922
Even so,

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.176
it was foolish to throw away
the advantage of having unknown Quirks

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.178
when fighting against heroes.

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:52.681
He made immature,
wild statements with a straight face.

00:07:52.848 --> 00:07:55.267
He bragged about his possessions.

00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:58.478
He thought everything
would simply go his way.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.981
Adding that to what I saw of him
when he carried out the attack,

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:03.275
the picture I get of Shigaraki is…

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.279
<i>someone who hasn't gotten rid</i>
<i>of his childish sense of omnipotence…</i>

00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:08.530
<i>A man-child.</i>

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.200
A child with power?

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:13.869
Could it be that he never received
the Quirk counseling every child

00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:14.995
gets in elementary school?

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:18.123
Well, what does that have
to do with anything?

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.294
There were 72 villains
arrested the other day at USJ.

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.756
They were all small-timers
that lurked in back alleys.

00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:31.637
But the problem is how they all agreed
with that man-child and followed him.

00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:34.056
<i>In the current environment</i>
<i>saturated with heroes,</i>

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.142
<i>villainous people who have been oppressed</i>

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.729
<i>may be drawn to that kind</i>
<i>of simple-minded evil.</i>

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.565
That's true.

00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:47.319
There are plenty of people who don't
know what to do with their Quirks.

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.488
This is alarming, though…

00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:51.865
Well, it's thanks to you heroes

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.785
that we are able to devote
ourselves to our investigation.

00:08:55.494 --> 00:08:57.496
We'll expand our search network

00:08:57.663 --> 00:08:59.790
and continue
to assist in arresting the perpetrators.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.501
A man-child…

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.630
In some sense, he's like our students.

00:09:06.797 --> 00:09:08.757
He still has room to grow.

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:14.680
If there was someone capable backing him,
trying to cultivate his malice…

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.894
<i>I don't want to think</i>
<i>about what could happen…</i>

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.859
<i>The day after the</i>
<i>League of Villains attacked USJ,</i>

00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:29.862
<i>school was closed temporarily,</i>

00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:32.614
<i>but it was hard to take it easy.</i>

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.909
<i>Can you see that?</i>

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.786
<i>He's already saved a hundred people!</i>

00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:41.164
<i>That's crazy!</i>
<i>It hasn't even been ten minutes!</i>

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:42.833
<i>That's crazy!</i>

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:45.794
<i>He's laughing!</i>

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:50.299
<i>It's fine now. Why?</i>

00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:53.343
<i>Because I am here.</i>

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.930
<i>What I aspire to be seems so out of reach…</i>

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:00.475
<i>During the USJ incident,</i>

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:03.437
<i>the villains just toyed with us</i>
<i>with their malice and strength.</i>

00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:07.900
<i>We just slowed down Mr. Aizawa</i>

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.693
<i>and Thirteen.</i>

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.281
<i>In order to oppose that evil,</i>

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:18.285
<i>I must make this power that</i>
<i>I inherited from All Might, One For All,</i>

00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:21.163
<i>more and more my own.</i>

00:10:22.206 --> 00:10:24.875
<i>Because time is of the essence…</i>

00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:29.171
<i>Because I'm the one who inherited it…</i>

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:31.548
Izuku?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.091
Yes?

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.136
The food's ready.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.847
Thanks, I'll be right there.

00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:44.394
Today, we're having pork cutlet bowls!

00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:51.652
-Hey, did you watch the news last night?
-Yeah.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.154
Did you see how everyone
in class was on-screen for a second?

00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:57.491
I didn't stand out at all…

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.451
That's true.

00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:02.079
It's hard to stand out
looking like that, huh?

00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:06.750
But man, all the channels
made a big deal out of it.

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:08.168
I was surprised.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:09.378
Can you blame them?

00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:12.631
The hero course that keeps
pumping out pro heroes was attacked.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.801
Who knows what would've happened
if the teachers hadn't come when they did.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.594
Stop that, Sero!

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.638
Just thinking about it's
making me wet myself--

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:21.723
Shut up! Be quiet, scum!

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.518
But man, All Might was great.

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:27.396
He pushed back
those crazy strong villains.

00:11:27.563 --> 00:11:30.107
Yes, his strength is worth wondering at.

00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:34.111
Everyone!
Morning homeroom is about to start!

00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:36.613
Stop talking and take your seats!

00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:38.407
We're already in our seats.

00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:39.908
You're the only one who's not.

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.035
Shoot!

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.287
Don't worry about it.

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:45.539
Tsu, who's…

00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.333
gonna teach homeroom today?

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:53.505
Well, Mr. Aizawa is supposed to be in
the hospital recovering from his injuries…

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.340
-Ribbit?
-Morning.

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:58.010
Mr. Aizawa, you're back too soon!

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.469
You're too much of a pro!

00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:01.972
So you're all right, Mr. Aizawa?

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:04.183
Can you really call that "all right"?

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:07.019
My well-being doesn't matter.

00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:09.938
More importantly,
the fight is not yet over.

00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:11.565
Fight?

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:14.151
-Don't tell me…
-The villains again?

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:18.405
The U.A. sports festival is drawing near.

00:12:20.032 --> 00:12:23.368
That's a super normal school event!

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:25.871
The sports festival!

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.123
That's a super normal school event--

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.208
Wait a minute.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:34.463
Is it okay to have a sports festival
so soon after the villains snuck inside?

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.298
What if they attack us again
or something?

00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:38.967
Apparently,
they think of it as U.A. showing

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:43.680
that our crisis management system
is solid as a rock by holding the event.

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.475
Security will also be strengthened
to five times that of previous years.

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.604
Above all, our sports
festival is a huge chance.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.107
It's not an event to be cancelled
because of a few villains.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:57.611
But that's a good reason, isn't it?
It's just a festival of sports.

00:12:58.654 --> 00:13:01.949
Mineta, you've never
seen the U.A. sports festival?

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.325
Of course I have.

00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:05.244
That's not what I meant!

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:09.248
Our sports festival is
one of Japan's biggest events.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:13.168
In the past, the Olympics
were called a festival of sports,

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.003
and the whole country
was crazy about them.

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:17.256
As you know, with reductions
in scale and population,

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.508
<i>they're now a shell of their former glory.</i>

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.555
<i>And now, for Japan, what has</i>
<i>taken the place of those Olympics</i>

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.557
<i>is the U.A. sports festival!</i>

00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:32.729
Of course, all the top heroes
around the country will be watching.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.940
For scouting purposes!

00:13:35.107 --> 00:13:36.441
I know that.

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:40.946
After we graduate, it's typical
to join a pro agency as a sidekick.

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:43.532
A lot of people miss their chance
to become independent after that

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:46.159
and become eternal sidekicks, though.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.537
Kaminari,
I feel like you'd be one of them.

00:13:48.704 --> 00:13:49.872
Since you're dumb.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.666
Of course,

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:57.045
joining a famous hero agency will get you
more experience and popularity.

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.173
Time is limited.

00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:03.302
If you expect to go pro, then the path
to your future will open up at this event.

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.179
One chance a year…

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.181
a total of just three chances.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:11.351
No aspiring heroes can afford
to miss this event.

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.688
If you understand that,
then don't slack off on your preparations!

00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:16.023
Yes, sir!

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.858
Homeroom is dismissed.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:23.530
LUNCHTIME

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.532
Even though all that stuff happened,

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.201
I'm getting really excited!

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.161
If we put on a good show and stand out,

00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:31.163
we'll have taken the first
step to becoming a pro!

00:14:31.622 --> 00:14:34.291
It was worth coming to U.A.!

00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:37.377
We will only receive a few chances.
We cannot afford to miss this.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:40.589
Ojiro, I'm getting kind of nervous now.

00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:42.841
I need to stand out
at the sports festival!

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:44.218
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-Yeah…

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:49.681
But the pros might not notice you
unless you try really hard…

00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:54.520
Oh dear, what'll I do?
I stand out just by standing still,

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:57.439
so the scouts won't be able
to stop looking at me, right?

00:14:59.608 --> 00:15:00.651
Right?

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.238
You're lucky, Shoji.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.282
Your brawn stands out on its own.

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:10.118
There's no point if I cannot
show them my usefulness.

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.746
I think you'll stand out, too.

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:13.872
USED HIS QUIRK TOO MUCH

00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:17.167
Everyone's so into it.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:18.794
You're not?

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.588
We have enrolled here to become heroes,

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.549
so of course we would get fired up!

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.802
Iida, you have a unique
way of getting fired up. It's weird.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.346
Midoriya, you don't feel the same?

00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:31.056
Of course I do.

00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:32.349
But something's…

00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:34.685
Deku, Iida…

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.855
Let's do our best at the sports festival.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.690
Uraraka, your face! It's…

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.233
What's the matter?

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.694
You don't look carefree at all,
even though that's what your name means.

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.154
PM--

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:50.742
Everyone, I'm gonna do my best!

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.077
Yeah!

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.330
I'm gonna do my best!

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:56.623
Yeah…

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.126
What's wrong?
Your personality's all over the place.

00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:00.919
<i>Now that I think about it…</i>

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:04.173
-Everyone, I'm gonna do my best!
-<i>I never asked Uraraka…</i>

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.383
LUNCH RUSH'S EATERY
CAFETERIA

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:09.011
-Uraraka.
-Yes?

00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:12.973
Why did you decide to come
to U.A. and become a pro hero?

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.141
Huh?

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:17.019
Um… because…

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:19.188
For money?

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:22.107
You want to become a hero for money?

00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:24.318
To boil it down simply, yes…

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.862
Sorry it's such an unwholesome reason.

00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:30.657
You two have such admirable
motivations, it's embarrassing…

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:32.242
Why?

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:36.163
How is having a goal to
support your livelihood not admirable?

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.916
Right. But it's unexpected.

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:43.587
My family owns a construction company,

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:46.882
but we haven't gotten any
work at all, so we're flat broke.

00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:49.801
This isn't really something
to tell other people, though…

00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:52.137
Construction…

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:56.225
With her Quirk, if she gets licensed,
then it'd bring costs way down, right?

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.686
She could make any raw material float.
They wouldn't need any heavy equipment.

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.689
Right? That's what I told
Dad when I was little!

00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:05.192
But…

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.903
You want to work for us?

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.945
Yeah!

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:13.407
When I get big,
I'll help you and Mommy!

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:18.579
I appreciate the thought, Ochaco.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.585
But as your dad, I'd be even happier
if you could achieve your dream.

00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:26.964
When that happens,
you can take us to Hawaii!

00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:30.759
Daddy…

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:37.140
I'll definitely become a hero
and make money

00:17:37.933 --> 00:17:40.310
and let my parents take it easy.

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.235
Bravo!

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:51.363
Uraraka, Bravo!

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:52.531
Bravo!

00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:56.869
-Bravo! Uraraka!
-<i>She's not just aspiring to be a hero.</i>

00:18:00.998 --> 00:18:04.001
Young Midoriya is here!

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:05.627
All Might?

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:06.753
What's the matter?

00:18:07.588 --> 00:18:08.505
Lunch!

00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:10.299
Wanna eat together?

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:11.925
He's like a maiden!

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.427
How about it?

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.430
I'd love to.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:18.891
<i>I wonder what's going on…</i>

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.435
LUNCH RUSH'S EATERY

00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:26.523
I wonder what he wanted with Deku.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:30.277
I heard that when All Might was attacked
by villains during the USJ incident,

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:32.279
he rushed out alone to help.

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:33.989
Perhaps it's about that?

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.365
Oh, yeah!

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.743
Remember what Asui said on the bus?

00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:41.413
Your Quirk is like All Might's.

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:44.249
The boundless power
they both have are similar, too,

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.585
so maybe All Might
has taken a liking to him.

00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:48.253
He's amazing.

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:52.424
<i>All Might… and Izuku Midoriya…</i>

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:53.926
LOUNGE
IN USE

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.344
Only about fifty minutes?

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.095
Yeah…

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.349
That's the limit to how long
I can use my power now.

00:19:00.516 --> 00:19:01.808
I overdid it too many times.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.687
<i>That Nomu was also a tough opponent.</i>

00:19:06.647 --> 00:19:07.898
<i>And it hurt…</i>

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.653
I can just barely maintain muscle
form for 1.5 hours now.

00:19:12.945 --> 00:19:14.112
About that…

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.155
Sorr--

00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:19.409
You don't have to apologize!

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:22.037
Man, we really are alike, you and me.

00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:24.540
Have some tea.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:25.916
Thanks…

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.710
More importantly,
about the sports festival.

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:31.421
You still can't regulate
One For All, can you?

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.215
What'll you do?

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:36.385
But there was one time…

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:39.304
<i>When I aimed a smash</i>
<i>at that brain villain,</i>

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:41.223
<i>there was no backlash.</i>

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.851
Oh yeah, you mentioned that!

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:45.477
What was different?

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:47.396
Different…

00:19:48.105 --> 00:19:50.983
The biggest difference between that

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:54.486
and the One For All
that I'd been using was…

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.698
<i>…my Quirk, Black Hole.</i>

00:19:58.282 --> 00:20:01.869
<i>I can suck up anything</i>
<i>and turn it to dust.</i>

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:05.289
<i>But it is a power that can kill easily.</i>

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:13.297
It was the first time…
I tried to use this power on a person…

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.595
Looks like you succeeded
in putting on the brakes unconsciously.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.974
Anyway, that's progress. I'm glad.

00:20:24.433 --> 00:20:25.684
Now, drink up.

00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:27.603
Oh, thank you.

00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:35.485
Frankly, I don't have much time
left as the Symbol of Peace.

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.447
No way!

00:20:39.198 --> 00:20:44.494
And some of those with built-up
villainous intent are starting to realize.

00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:51.335
I granted you my power
because I want you to succeed me.

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:56.590
I want to be like you.

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:00.052
I want to become
the greatest hero, like you!

00:21:00.219 --> 00:21:02.596
Saving people with a fearless smile.

00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:06.683
<i>You still feel the same</i>
<i>as you did back then,</i>

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.768
don't you?

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:08.977
Yes.

00:21:10.062 --> 00:21:12.606
Then,
the time has come for you to show that.

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:18.111
The U.A. sports festival
is something pro heroes…

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:22.366
no, the whole country is watching closely.
A big event!

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.411
That is what I brought you here
to talk about!

00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:31.375
The next All Might…
the fledgling Symbol of Peace…

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.378
Izuku Midoriya.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:41.218
I want you to tell the world "I am here!"

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:13.977
PREVIEW

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.438
<i>The preview is here!</i>

00:23:16.605 --> 00:23:19.274
<i>The U.A. sports festival</i>
<i>is finally starting!</i>

00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:21.944
<i>The first event is the obstacle course</i>
<i>race that everyone will participate in!</i>

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.029
<i>There's no limit to Quirk use!</i>

00:23:24.196 --> 00:23:26.240
<i>Isn't that very dangerous?</i>

00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:28.075
<i>Even so, aim for the top!</i>

00:23:28.242 --> 00:23:31.995
<i>Show off to the world the fledgling hero,</i>
<i>Izuku Midoriya!</i>
