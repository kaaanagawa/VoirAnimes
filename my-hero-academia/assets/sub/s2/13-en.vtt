WEBVTT

00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:03.086
TATOOIN STATION

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:06.340
<i>In the days off we had</i>
<i>after the sports festival,</i>

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.342
<i>we were to let our injuries recover,</i>

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:11.094
<i>and then we would start</i>
<i>regular classes again today.</i>

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.263
<i>That's what I thought, but…</i>

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.893
Excuse me!

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.604
Midoriya from the hero class!

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.065
Good job at the sports festival!

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:24.399
-You were so close!
-Huh?

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:27.194
-You were in the top eight, right?
-You were so cool!

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.405
-He's smaller than I expected.
-He reminds me of when I was young.

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.116
Yeah, it's like he's trying really hard.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.118
Do your best, hero!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.246
I will!

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.842
<i>It's only morning, but I'm already tired.</i>

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:15.427
Good morning, Midoriya!

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.596
Iida?

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.432
Wearing a poncho and rain boots?

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.476
Why are you walking so slowly?

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.394
-You're going to be late!
-Late?

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.647
There are still five minutes
until the first bell.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.900
U.A. students should always arrive
ten minutes early!

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:37.699
Iida, um…

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.743
If it's about my brother,
there is no need to worry.

00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:42.746
I apologize for worrying you needlessly.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.838
TIME TO PICK SOME NAMES

00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:54.383
It's different when they broadcast
the matches on TV after all, huh?

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.552
So many people talked to me
on my way here!

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:57.886
Yeah, me too!

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.640
People were staring at me, too.
It was kind of embarrassing!

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.517
Isn't that normal for you, Hagakure?

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.020
I had some elementary schoolers
suddenly tell me "Don't worry about it."

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.355
Don't worry about it!

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:14.069
After just one day, we've suddenly been
thrust into the spotlight, huh?

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.196
U.A. really is amazing, huh?

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:18.156
Morning.

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:20.284
Good morning!

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:22.619
Ribbit?

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.205
Mr. Aizawa, your bandages are gone.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.248
I'm glad.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.334
The old lady went overboard
with her treatment.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:33.505
More importantly, we're having
a special hero informatics class today.

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:35.007
<i>Here it is!</i>

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:38.468
<i>"Special"?</i>
<i>Is it a quiz? I hope not…</i>

00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.931
<i>I'm bad at laws relating</i>
<i>to heroes and stuff like that…</i>

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.644
Code names.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.897
You'll be coming up with hero names.

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:52.608
We're gonna do something exciting!

00:03:55.903 --> 00:04:01.283
This is related to the pro hero
draft picks I mentioned the other day.

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:04.369
The drafts begin in earnest
in the second and third years,

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.246
after students have gained experience

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.332
and can become immediate assets
to the pros.

00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:11.043
In other words, for them
to extend offers to first years like you

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.587
shows that they are interested
in your future potential.

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:19.551
These offers are often cancelled
if that interest dies down by graduation.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.136
Adults are so selfish!

00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:25.349
So we'll have to prove
ourselves once we get picked, huh?

00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:26.391
That's right.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.895
And here are the totals
for those with offers.

00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:31.855
CLASS A NO. OF OFFERS
TODOROKI BAKUGO

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:32.981
TOKOYAMI IIDA

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:36.235
KAMINARI YAOYOROZU
KIRISHIMA URARAKA SERO

00:04:36.527 --> 00:04:40.656
In other years, it's been more spread out,
but all eyes were on these two this year.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.658
Gah, there's such a big difference!

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.576
Those pros don't know
a good thing when they see one!

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.329
Todoroki's first, and Bakugo's second?

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:49.790
It's the opposite of their placement
in the sports festival.

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.667
Some people are too scared
to ask for a guy

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:53.418
who had to be restrained on the podium.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.546
What're the pros scared of?

00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:00.634
You're amazing, Todoroki.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:02.970
They're probably all because of my dad.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.723
-Wow, we got offers!
-Yes, yes.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.060
Midoriya, you didn't get any!

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.106
<i>They're scared of you 'cause</i>
<i>of the crazy way you were fighting.</i>

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.149
Yeah…

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.696
Keeping these results in mind,
whether or not anyone asked for you,

00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:23.699
you will all be participating
in internships with pros.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.118
Internships?

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.202
Yeah.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.413
<i>At USJ,</i>

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:33.250
<i>you already got</i>
<i>to experience combat with real villains,</i>

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:39.047
but it will still be meaningful training
for you to see pros at work firsthand.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.216
So that explains the hero names!

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:43.552
Things are suddenly getting
a lot more fun!

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.722
Well, those hero names
are still temporary,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.015
but if you're not serious about it…

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.475
You'll have hell to pay later!

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.272
Because a lot of hero names used
by students become recognized by society,

00:05:55.606 --> 00:06:00.027
and they end up becoming
professional hero names!

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:01.695
Midnight!

00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:04.198
Well, that's how it is.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.701
So Midnight will be making sure
your names are okay.

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:09.953
I can't do stuff like that.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.955
IN SHOTA AIZAWA'S CASE

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:15.209
What? You haven't decided
on a hero name yet?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.171
I don't want to be on the news,
so I don't care what name I have.

00:06:19.338 --> 00:06:22.299
All right! Then…

00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:24.051
You'll be Eraser Head!

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.136
I'll go with that, then.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.223
When you give yourself a name,

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:32.267
you get a more concrete image
of what you want to be like in the future,

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.061
and you can get closer to it.

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:37.064
This is what it means when they say,
"Names and natures do often agree."

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:39.066
Like "All Might," for example.

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:41.735
<i>All Might.</i>

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.281
<i>My hero name…</i>

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.118
<i>A name for what I want</i>
<i>to be like in the future, huh?</i>

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.627
Okay, let's start presenting names
starting with those who are ready.

00:06:58.794 --> 00:07:00.379
<i>We're presenting these?</i>

00:07:00.546 --> 00:07:03.215
<i>Man, that'll take some nerve…</i>

00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:09.471
Here I go…

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.474
"Shining Hero:

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.477
'I can not stop twinkling'"!

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.981
Which means, you can't stop my sparkles!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.649
<i>It's a sentence!</i>

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.693
It'll be easier to use
if you take out the "I"

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.820
and shorten the "can not" to "can't."

00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:26.697
You're right, mademoiselle.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.282
It's okay?

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.243
Anyway, choose one English, or French!

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.412
Then, I'll go next!

00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:36.039
Hero name, "Alien Queen"!

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:37.374
Two!

00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.626
Are you trying for the thing
with acidic blood?

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:40.794
I wouldn't if I were you!

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:42.337
Dang it.

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.047
<i>Idiot!</i>

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.967
<i>Since the first ones were weird,</i>

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.511
<i>it feels like we're supposed</i>
<i>to make them funny now!</i>

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:50.762
Ribbit!

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.348
Then, may I go next?

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:54.641
Go ahead, Tsu.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.936
I've had this in mind
ever since I was in elementary school.

00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:01.148
"Rainy Season Hero: Froppy."

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:04.318
That's so cute!
It seems friendly. I like it!

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.487
It's a great example
of a name that everyone will love!

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:10.782
Froppy!

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.036
Thanks, Froppy!
You've brought things back to normal!

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:16.330
Then, I'll go too!

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.665
"Sturdy Hero: Red Riot"!

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:19.875
"Red Riot"?

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:24.713
You're paying homage to the Chivalrous
Hero: Crimson Riot, right?

00:08:25.214 --> 00:08:26.298
Yes.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:30.928
It's pretty old-fashioned, but the hero
image I'm going for is Crimson himself.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:37.392
If you're bearing a name you admire,
it'll come with that much more pressure.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.186
I'm prepared for that!

00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:42.063
<i>Kirishima's so cool.</i>

00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:45.859
<i>Before I met All Might…</i>

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.446
Hm? Your name after you become a hero?

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.950
Yeah! I can't decide which one to pick!

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.493
Let's see…

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.039
"Mighty All Man,"
"Mighty Boy," "All Might, Jr."

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.582
Junior!

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:05.462
"Mighty Man," "Captain All Might,"
"Super All Might"!

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.297
Super!

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.466
Super!

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.847
<i>I grinned as I thought of names</i>
<i>that sounded like his.</i>

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:16.974
<i>But…</i>

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.019
<i>Now that I've been given his power</i>
<i>and am under his care,</i>

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.980
<i>I see just how big a difference</i>
<i>there is between us.</i>

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:27.734
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>I can take on a name like that.</i>

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.738
Man, I haven't thought of a name yet…

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.408
Why don't I give you one?

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.285
How about "Jamming-yay"?

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.411
JAMMING-YAY
HEMING-WAY

00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:40.080
It's like Hemingway,
who wrote<i> A Farewell to Arms</i>!

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:41.415
Sounds smart!

00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:43.083
-It's cool!
-No…

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.044
It's because even though you're strong…

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.088
-Yay…
-…you always end up like that.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.007
Hey, Jiro!

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:51.758
Stop messing with me!

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.678
"Hearing Hero: Earphone Jack."

00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:56.221
That's good! Next!

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.599
"Tentacle Hero: Tentacole."

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:02.144
It's like tentacle
with some octopus thrown in!

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.022
"Taping Hero: Cellophane."

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:07.024
Nice and simple! That's important!

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.735
"Martial Arts Hero: Tailman."

00:10:09.902 --> 00:10:11.278
Your name reflects your body!

00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:13.614
"Sweets Hero: Sugarman"!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.740
So sweet!

00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:16.116
Pinky!

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:17.826
Peachy pink complexion!

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:22.331
"Stun Gun Hero: Chargebolt,"
combining "charge" with "lightning bolt"!

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.957
Oh, I feel tingly!

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.044
"Stealth Hero: Invisible Girl"!

00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:28.545
That's great!

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.465
Come on, let's keep right on going!

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.343
I hope I will not bring shame
to this name.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.470
"Everything Hero: Creati."

00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:37.596
Creative!

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:39.139
"Shoto."

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:41.433
Your name? Is that okay?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.476
Yeah.

00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:45.145
"Jet-Black Hero: Tsukuyomi."

00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:46.522
God of the night!

00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:49.149
"Fresh-Picked Hero: Grape Juice"!

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.526
Pop and kitschy!

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.027
PETTING HERO: ANIMA

00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:53.779
Okay, got it!

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.490
"King Explosion Murder."

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:58.742
You probably shouldn't use something
like that.

00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:00.035
Why not?

00:11:00.202 --> 00:11:01.828
You should be "Explosion Boy"!

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.080
Shut up, Weird Hair!

00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:06.250
Okay, my turn…

00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:12.506
This is what I thought of: "Uravity."

00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:14.716
Sounds stylish!

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:20.430
Choosing hero names is going more smoothly
than I thought it would!

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:24.059
All that's left is Bakugo,
who needs to rethink his,

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:25.602
and Iida.

00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:27.896
And Midoriya, right?

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:31.900
<i>Tenya.</i>

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.781
I wasn't sure if I wanted
to say anything yesterday,

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:44.162
but actually, I don't have
any feeling in my legs.

00:11:44.997 --> 00:11:46.957
What? No way!

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:50.836
The hero, Ingenium,

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.173
will probably end here.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.719
No! You still have
so many more people to lead!

00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:00.554
I don't like this!

00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:03.557
I don't like this either…

00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:07.895
That's why…

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.023
If you're up for it…

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.360
<i>Will you take this name for me?</i>

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.363
ING

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:21.992
<i>I am still…</i>

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:24.745
TENYA

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.539
You're using your first name, too?

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:32.085
Midoriya, are you ready?

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.504
Yes!

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.758
<i>It's gotta be… this.</i>

00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:41.887
Midoriya?

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:43.805
Are you really okay with that?

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.225
You might be called that forever,
you know.

00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:50.854
Yeah. I didn't like this name until now.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:54.775
But someone changed the meaning of it,

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.694
and that had a huge impact on me.

00:12:58.487 --> 00:12:59.905
It made me really happy.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.867
My "Deku" isn't always going
to mean "useless"!

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:07.120
My "Deku" means "You can do it!"

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.625
This is my hero name!

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:18.173
DEKU

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:23.303
STAFF ROOM

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.223
Offers for the first years
are still coming.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.432
There's one more.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:28.767
Who's it for?

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:29.852
Midoriya.

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.312
Really? Who is it?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.942
This person is…

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:38.610
"Lord Explosion Murder"!

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.863
No, that's still no good.

00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:44.825
Now that everyone's decided
on their hero names,

00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:46.869
we'll go back to talking about
the internships.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.037
They will last for a week.

00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:50.664
As for where you'll have them,

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:53.584
those who had offers from pros
will be given your own lists,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.003
so you can choose from those yourself.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.715
Those who didn't have offers will choose

00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:02.301
from among forty agencies
around the country

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.386
that will be accepting our interns.

00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:07.556
They all work in different places
and have different specialties.

00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:11.059
For example,
Thirteen would be focused

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:14.813
on rescues from accidents
and disasters more than fighting villains.

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:17.816
-Think carefully before you choose.
-Yes, sir!

00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:21.236
I want to fight crime in urban areas!

00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:24.823
I hope I can intern
at a place with floods.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.033
I wonder if there are any?

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.494
Turn in your choices before the weekend.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.496
We've only got two days?

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.457
Make your decision efficiently.

00:14:33.624 --> 00:14:34.625
Dismissed.

00:14:37.753 --> 00:14:39.630
ENDEAVOR HERO AGENCY

00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:43.342
LUNCHTIME

00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:44.551
Hey guys,

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:47.346
have you decided
what pro agency you're going to yet?

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.681
I'm going to Mt. Lady!

00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:52.684
Mineta, you're thinking about
something perverted, aren't you?

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:53.769
Of course not!

00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:55.771
Ashido, you made it pretty far
in the tournament, too.

00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:57.356
It's weird that you didn't get any offers.

00:14:57.523 --> 00:14:58.398
You said it.

00:14:58.774 --> 00:15:00.400
Deku, have you decided already?

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.611
There are only forty heroes
who'll take us,

00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:04.905
so after looking up their specialties
and splitting them into groups…

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:06.156
It's practically an art!

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:08.992
Oh, sorry! I was lost in thought…

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:11.411
You're really thinking
carefully about this, huh?

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:14.039
Actually, I've already decided!

00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:15.207
Really?

00:15:15.374 --> 00:15:16.250
Where?

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.253
-Battle Hero: Gunhead's agency.
-Huh?

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.881
<i>Gunhead's a huge battle type!</i>

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.007
<i>You're going there, Uraraka?</i>

00:15:24.508 --> 00:15:26.468
Yup! I got an offer from them!

00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:27.678
Really?

00:15:27.845 --> 00:15:31.682
I totally thought you were trying
to be a hero like Thirteen.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.017
Ultimately, yes.

00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:38.605
But fighting Bakugo
at the sports festival made me think...

00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:43.652
The stronger I get,
the more possibilities I'll have!

00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:47.114
If I only do what I want,
I'll have a narrower perspective!

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:49.783
I see.

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:53.829
More importantly, this has been
bothering me for a while, but…

00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:55.330
You're trembling, aren't you?

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:56.623
Oh, this?

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.375
It's the air chair exercise.

00:15:58.542 --> 00:15:59.585
Air chair?

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:01.670
Don't tell me you do that
all through class?

00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:02.880
There's no way!

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.798
That's such an old-fashioned exercise.

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:05.924
What are you saying?

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:09.303
The isometric muscle contraction
of the air chair means

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.222
it's an easy way to train without moving!

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.100
Shut up…

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.477
<i>I can't stay the way I am.</i>

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:21.356
<i>I need to be able</i>
<i>to control my Quirk more.</i>

00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:24.818
He who follows two hares catches neither.

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:34.953
<i>Deku,</i>

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.330
let's go home together.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.040
-Okay.
-Iida, you too..

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.000
Huh?

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:43.420
He probably decided on where
he wants to do his internship

00:16:43.587 --> 00:16:45.130
and went to turn it into the staff room.

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:48.091
I am here! In a bizarre position!

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.052
What's the matter?

00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:51.470
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:16:51.637 --> 00:16:52.679
Come with me for a moment.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:54.848
Right…

00:16:57.518 --> 00:17:01.730
Getting straight to the point,
you've got an offer from a hero!

00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:02.773
Huh?

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.858
What? Really?

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:08.487
Yes. The hero's name is Gran Torino.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.866
He was a teacher at U.A.
for only one year.

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.536
The man who was my homeroom teacher.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.540
He knows about One For All, too.

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:22.542
In fact, he probably asked
for you because of that.

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.670
Someone that amazing is?

00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:29.716
Wait, there was someone else
who knew about the Quirk?

00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:33.011
Gran Torino was the sworn friend
of my predecessor.

00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:38.100
<i>He retired a long time ago,</i>
<i>so I forgot to count him…</i>

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:44.022
Was it because I wrote of you
when I sent him the letter?

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:47.276
Or because he couldn't just stand by
and watch my inadequate teaching?

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:50.487
If he went so far as to use
his old name to make an offer…

00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:52.406
It's scary… Too scary…

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.825
Stop trembling, legs!

00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:56.869
<i>All Might's seriously shaking!</i>

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:02.124
Anyway, it is my duty to train you,

00:18:02.291 --> 00:18:07.921
but since you got an offer, you should
go work to your heart's content…

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.257
<i>Just how scary is this guy?</i>

00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:15.512
Internships, huh?

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.515
Yeah. A few already decided.

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:22.060
It's an important event.
Make sure they think about it properly.

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:25.522
There are some third years
that still have regrets about it.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:26.982
Yeah…

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.609
CLASS 1-A - TENYA IIDA
DESIRED INTERNSHIP AGENCY

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.527
<i>The agency Iida wants to go to…</i>

00:18:31.028 --> 00:18:34.531
<i>I'm sure he had offers from better places.</i>

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.200
HOSU CITY, TOKYO
NORMAL HERO: MANUAL AGENCY

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.285
<i>A hero agency in Hosu…</i>

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:41.496
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:46.877
What? You got an offer?

00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:49.004
That's great, Deku!

00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:50.255
Yeah.

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:53.342
IIDA

00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:58.472
Did Iida go home before us?

00:18:58.639 --> 00:18:59.598
Yeah.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.268
<i>After the sports festival,</i>

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.271
<i>I heard about what happened</i>
<i>to Iida's big brother on the news.</i>

00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:10.526
<i>The incident involving Ingenium</i>
<i>in Hosu City, Tokyo.</i>

00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:17.616
<i>The escaping culprit had already killed</i>
<i>17 heroes in the past</i>

00:19:17.783 --> 00:19:21.286
<i>and hurt 23 heroes beyond recovery.</i>

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:25.582
<i>The elusive hero killer.</i>
<i>Villain name: Stain.</i>

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.418
If it's about my brother,
there is no need to worry.

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.421
I apologize for worrying you needlessly.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:36.093
<i>Iida didn't say anything to me.</i>

00:19:37.636 --> 00:19:42.099
<i>Later, I was surprised to find out that</i>
<i>Iida's internship would be in Hosu City,</i>

00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:44.560
<i>where Ingenium had been attacked.</i>

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:50.357
<i>But I couldn't say anything to Iida,</i>
<i>since he hadn't said anything to me.</i>

00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:54.736
<i>And so things remained as we approached</i>
<i>the first day of our internships.</i>

00:19:58.824 --> 00:20:00.951
You all have your costumes, right?

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:04.872
Remember, you aren't allowed
to wear them in public.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.373
Don't drop them or anything.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.666
Yessir!

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:10.627
Speak clearly! It's "yes, sir," Ashido.

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:11.879
Yes, sir…

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:15.883
Make sure you mind your manners
with the heroes at your internships!

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:16.925
Off with you, now.

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.135
Yes, sir!

00:20:18.302 --> 00:20:20.846
Tokoyami, you're going to Kyushu?
That's in the opposite direction.

00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:23.348
Iida!

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.229
If you ever feel hopeless,
make sure you let us know.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.024
We're friends, right?

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.113
Yeah.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:45.078
<i>At that time,</i>
<i>I should have been more emphatic.</i>

00:20:46.038 --> 00:20:51.376
<i>Because I would eventually regret</i>
<i>what happened on that day.</i>

00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:27.681
GRAN TORINO

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:31.393
<i>A hero that even All Might</i>
<i>is afraid of, huh?</i>

00:22:33.896 --> 00:22:35.606
<i>Gran Torino…</i>

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:39.776
