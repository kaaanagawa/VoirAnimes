00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.254
<i>The world has become a superhuman society,</i>

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:08.132
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>In this world swirling with chaos,</i>

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.471
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:14.431
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.517
<i>Heroes of justice</i>

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.478
<i>fighting villains</i>
<i>and saving people from distress.</i>

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:22.397
<i>Yes,</i>

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.610
<i>this is the story of how</i>
<i>I became the greatest hero.</i>

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.456
<i>The first match of the first round</i>
<i>of the finals tournament.</i>

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:05.626
<i>From the hero course, it's Izuku Midoriya!</i>

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.710
<i>Versus…</i>

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.880
<i>From general studies, it's Hitoshi Shinso!</i>

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.632
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:14.635
<i>Force your opponent out of bounds,</i>
<i>or immobilize them!</i>

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:19.389
<i>You can also win by making</i>
<i>your opponent say, "I give up!"</i>

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.310
"I give up," huh?

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:28.106
This is a fight to test
the strength of your spirit.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:33.237
If you know what you want for your future,
then you can't worry about appearances.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.655
<i>Ready?</i>

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.866
That monkey
was going on about his pride…

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.201
<i>Start!</i>

00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.246
But don't you think he was dumb
for throwing away his chance?

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.460
What did you say?

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.341
I win.

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:57.970
I went through the trouble
of warning him, too!

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.848
<i>Hey, hey, what's the matter?</i>

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.851
<i>-It's the important first match!</i>
-What in the world is going on?

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.817
<i>Midoriya! The match just started…</i>

00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:14.111
<i>And he's completely frozen!</i>

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.656
<i>He's got a blank look on his face</i>
<i>and isn't moving a muscle!</i>

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.992
<i>Is this Shinso's Quirk?</i>

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:25.831
<i>He didn't stand out at all,</i>
<i>but could he actually be someone amazing?</i>

00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:29.835
VICTORY OR DEFEAT

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.379
<i>Hitoshi Shinso from general studies</i>

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:35.549
<i>has gotten the better of Izuku Midoriya</i>
<i>from the hero course!</i>

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.051
Who would've imagined this?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.095
Will the bottom really overthrow the top?

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:43.599
That's why I said
the entrance exam wasn't rational.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:44.892
Huh?

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:45.934
What?

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.187
Here's some basic data on the two of them.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.814
Since it's individual matches from here
on out, I had someone compile it for me.

00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:55.444
Shinso failed the practical exam
for the hero course.

00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:59.448
Since he also applied for general studies,
he probably knew that would happen.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.951
His Quirk is very powerful,

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:05.829
<i>but the practical exam</i>
<i>consisted of fighting faux villains.</i>

00:04:06.622 --> 00:04:11.210
<i>That gave an advantage to those</i>
<i>with physical attack Quirks.</i>

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:17.966
Shinso wouldn't have been able
to rack up any points with his Quirk.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:25.057
You're lucky
that you've been blessed, Izuku Midoriya.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:31.021
Turn around and walk out of bounds.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:38.695
<i>Huh?</i>

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:40.405
<i>What?</i>

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.033
<i>Midoriya's being so obedient!</i>

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.826
Deku, why?

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:48.580
If you go out of bounds,
then you'll lose the match!

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.668
<i>That Quirk is…</i>

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.630
<i>Hitoshi Shinso.</i>
<i>Quirk: Brainwashing!</i>

00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:59.132
<i>Answering his question</i>
<i>turns on a brainwashing switch</i>

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.052
<i>in his opponent's brain,</i>
<i>forcing them to do what he says.</i>

00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:06.431
<i>If he doesn't want the brainwashing</i>
<i>switch to turn on, it won't!</i>

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.936
<i>In the fitness test</i>
<i>on the first day of school,</i>

00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:14.147
<i>Midoriya scored pretty low</i>
<i>for the hero course,</i>

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.192
<i>but even in tests</i>
<i>where he didn't use his Quirk,</i>

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.319
<i>he did better than Shinso.</i>

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:23.615
<i>So if they fight normally,</i>
<i>then Midoriya would win.</i>

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.955
<i>If he can just overcome</i>
<i>Shinso's Brainwashing…</i>

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:34.293
<i>Well, either way, this'll end quickly.</i>

00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:39.047
<i>Young Midoriya!</i>

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.466
You can't come here!

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:50.642
<i>No! My body's moving on its own…</i>

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.521
<i>It's like… my head's filled with fog…</i>

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:55.731
<i>No!</i>

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.234
<i>Damn it! Stop!</i>

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.527
<i>Stop!</i>

00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:02.988
<i>Even though…</i>

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.783
<i>Even though Ojiro warned me…</i>

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.327
<i>Crap!</i>

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:09.369
WAITING ROOM

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.163
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.542
A Quirk that can control people, huh?

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.628
Isn't that too strong to beat?

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.756
Yeah, but you can probably avoid
if you know about it.

00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:24.927
I don't remember much
after I answered his question.

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.678
I think that's how it works.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.390
So if I answer without thinking,
then I'll lose right away.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.310
No, but it's not completely impenetrable.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:38.690
I said I barely remembered anything
until almost the end, right?

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:43.946
<i>When we were running away</i>
<i>after Shinso stole Tetsutetsu's headband,</i>

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.658
<i>It looks like I ran into one of the horses</i>
<i>on Team Tetsutetsu.</i>

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:50.619
<i>That's when I snapped out of it.</i>

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.622
I remember what happened clearly
after that.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.959
So receiving a shock can get rid of it?

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.627
It's very likely.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:04.258
Even so, I don't know
what level of shock you need,

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:08.262
and in a one-on-one match, you can't count
on outside forces like that.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.099
Anyway, that's about all I can tell you.

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:14.268
Thanks!
That was amazing!

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:18.146
I'm going to say something selfish…

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.526
But please do your best for me, too.

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.444
Ojiro…

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.950
<i>Damn it…</i>

00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:34.204
<i>This…</i>

00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:36.331
<i>Quickly!</i>

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:39.835
<i>Even though…</i>

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:43.046
<i>Everyone is counting on me!</i>

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.300
<i>In a place like this…</i>

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.969
<i>Like this!</i>

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:03.817
<i>What is this?</i>

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.532
<i>Mov…</i>

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.828
You probably don't understand,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:18.624
but even with a Quirk like this,
I have my own dream.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:23.003
Now, lose for me.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.308
<i>This is…</i>

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.811
<i>Midoriya's stopped!</i>

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.190
Midoriya!

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:45.108
I'm… I'm so glad!

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.195
<i>His fingers are…</i>

00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:51.573
<i>Did he remove the brainwashing</i>
<i>by making them explode?</i>

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.786
That's crazy…

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:58.747
Why?

00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.334
You shouldn't be able to move freely!

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:03.752
What did you do?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.214
<i>I'm the one who discharged my fingers.</i>

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.967
<i>But I wasn't the one who moved them.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:12.636
<i>People I didn't know came to mind,</i>

00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:14.763
<i>and for a second, my mind was clear!</i>

00:09:15.514 --> 00:09:16.682
<i>That was…</i>

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.141
<i>One For All.</i>

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.478
Passed on to me like a sacred torch.

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:23.522
<i>The people…</i>

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:26.358
<i>The presence of the people</i>
<i>who spun together this power…</i>

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.863
<i>Did they save me? Is that even possible?</i>

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.656
What did you do?

00:09:33.532 --> 00:09:35.242
<i>Even if I think about it now,</i>
<i>I won't find the answer.</i>

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:36.285
<i>Later…</i>

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.203
<i>Thinking can come later!</i>

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.041
<i>He won't answer…</i>
<i>Did he figure out my secret?</i>

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:47.296
<i>No, he should've heard</i>
<i>from that monkey from the beginning.</i>

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.757
<i>All I can do is make him talk again.</i>

00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:53.886
Say something.

00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:01.310
You can produce that much power
just by moving your fingers?

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.352
I'm jealous.

00:10:02.978 --> 00:10:05.314
<i>I felt the same way in the past.</i>

00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:09.818
Thanks to my Quirk,
I've been behind from the start.

00:10:10.194 --> 00:10:12.112
Someone who's been blessed
like you can't understand, can you?

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:13.572
<i>I do understand.</i>

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:16.450
<i>But, it's true… I've been blessed.</i>

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.660
Someone like you
who was born with the ideal Quirk!

00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:21.496
Someone who can reach your goal!

00:10:21.872 --> 00:10:23.665
<i>I've been blessed by others!</i>

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:25.709
<i>That's why!</i>

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.546
Say something!

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.716
<i>I can't…</i>

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.178
<i>Lose, either!</i>

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:38.889
<i>Is he trying to push me out?</i>

00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:42.309
You've got to be kidding!

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.062
You get out!

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:54.071
<i>I can't lose!</i>

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.042
<i>Shinso is out of bounds!</i>

00:11:07.793 --> 00:11:10.170
<i>Midoriya advances to round two!</i>

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:18.011
THREE YEARS AGO

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.014
NABOOH CITY MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.182
Wow,

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.727
-Shinso, your Quirk is Brainwashing?
-Seriously?

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.063
That's amazing!
I've never heard of that before!

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.940
I'm so jealous.

00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:32.734
I can't believe you can control anyone!

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.028
You can do as much bad stuff as you want!

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.739
No one'd know it was you.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.368
Don't control us, okay?

00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:46.915
Everyone says that.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.794
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>if someone else had it, the first thing</i>

00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:53.005
<i>I'd think</i>
<i>is that they'd use it for evil, too.</i>

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.715
<i>"Criminal"…</i>

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:59.011
<i>"It's good for being a villain, huh?"</i>

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.680
<i>I'm used to people insinuating that</i>
<i>about me.</i>

00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:03.015
<i>That's just what the world is like.</i>

00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:09.897
But you know…

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:12.691
<i>But…</i>

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.865
<i>In the finals,</i>

00:12:20.032 --> 00:12:22.868
<i>the first person</i>
<i>to advance to the second round</i>

00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:26.622
<i>is Izuku Midoriya from Class A!</i>

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.459
I was so nervous!

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.961
Turning the tables at the last moment!

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:34.922
As expected of Midoriya!

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.257
He did that shoulder toss
on you before, too, didn't he?

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.759
Shut up, Dunce Face.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.720
<i>That damn…</i>

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.890
<i>He was definitely aiming for it!</i>

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.560
<i>He led him right into it!</i>

00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:52.231
<i>Using his power on part of his body</i>
<i>like at the fitness test</i>

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.733
<i>and the throw from the combat training…</i>

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.652
<i>Rather than calling it</i>
<i>the best use of his experience,</i>

00:12:56.818 --> 00:13:00.739
<i>it's like he's using any experience he can</i>

00:13:00.906 --> 00:13:01.823
IZUKU MIDORIYA

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.200
<i>Yahoo!</i>

00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:05.953
<i>That was kind of a boring first match,</i>

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.247
<i>but we should praise them both</i>
<i>for a bravely fought match.</i>

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.665
<i>Clap your hands!</i>

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.377
<i>Someone who's been blessed</i>
<i>like you can't understand, can you?</i>

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.464
<i>Someone who can reach your goal!</i>

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:23.345
Shinso, why do you want to be a hero?

00:13:26.098 --> 00:13:27.266
But you know…

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.937
You can't help the things you long for.

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:39.903
<i>I felt the same way</i>
<i>before I inherited One For All.</i>

00:13:43.282 --> 00:13:44.157
<i>But…</i>

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.078
<i>No matter what I say right now…</i>

00:13:54.543 --> 00:13:56.795
You were really cool, Shinso!

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.883
Good job!

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.551
I was really surprised!

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:04.428
You're the star of general studies!

00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:08.432
You put up a great fight against the guy
who placed first in the obstacle course!

00:14:09.558 --> 00:14:10.434
Besides.

00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:17.274
That Quirk would work quite well
against villains. I wish I had it.

00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:20.444
U.A.'s not very smart
if he's in general studies.

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:23.322
Well,
they've got a ton of people applying,

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.324
so some things just can't be helped.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.701
<i>It was the difference</i>
<i>in combat experience, huh?</i>

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.828
<i>Yeah, it ends up making a big difference.</i>

00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:31.413
<i>What a waste.</i>

00:14:32.623 --> 00:14:34.750
You hear that, Shinso?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.752
You're amazing!

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:47.304
Depending on the results, they'll consider
our transfer into the hero course.

00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:50.349
Remember that.

00:14:51.517 --> 00:14:55.395
Even if it didn't work this time,
I definitely won't give up.

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:58.941
I'll get into the hero course,
get certified,

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:03.695
and I'll definitely become
a better hero than you guys!

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:07.157
Yeah!

00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:09.576
<i>He got me!</i>

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:12.538
Even though the match is over, what's he…

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:18.085
People are usually wary
when they talk to me, though…

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:22.798
At this rate,
someone'll trip you up in no time.

00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:23.841
At least…

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.803
Don't lose in an unseemly way.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.806
<i>Shinso…</i>

00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:33.392
I won't!

00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:40.482
Kiss!

00:15:41.233 --> 00:15:42.192
That should do it.

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:45.362
In the match with Shinso,

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.656
I couldn't smile at all.

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:54.413
Well, his cries hit close
to home for you, huh?

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.708
But that didn't mean that I could lose.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.962
That's what it means
to aim for number one, right?

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.798
Poor thing.

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.801
You put some weird pressure
on him again, didn't you?

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.555
It was necessary! Ouch.

00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:13.557
Oh yeah, All Might.

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.393
I had a vision.

00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:21.899
There were eight or nine people…
I'm not sure exactly how many…

00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:27.821
<i>But when it felt like my mind was filled</i>
<i>with fog from the brainwashing,</i>

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:31.158
<i>the vision appeared,</i>
<i>as if to drive away the fog.</i>

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:35.162
<i>It was like I was barely able to move</i>
<i>just my fingertips for a moment…</i>

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.791
<i>There was someone</i>
<i>with eyes like you, too, All Might.</i>

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:47.424
Was it… the people who had inherited
One For All who did it?

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.218
Scary… What the heck?

00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:51.386
What? I thought you'd know about it!

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:55.474
No, I also saw it before,
in my younger days.

00:16:56.975 --> 00:17:00.771
It's a clear sign that you've got
a better grasp on One For All.

00:17:00.938 --> 00:17:02.105
What does that mean?

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:07.277
I think it's like a trace of something
they left behind in One For All.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.446
It's not something with intent
that can interfere with you,

00:17:10.614 --> 00:17:13.116
and you can't interfere with them.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.744
In other words, that vision
isn't what got rid of the brainwashing.

00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:19.455
<i>It was that when you saw the vision,</i>

00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:23.042
<i>your strong emotions allowed you</i>
<i>to overcome Young Shinso's Brainwashing</i>

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.339
for just long enough
to move your fingertips, I think.

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.135
That explanation's
not satisfying at all, though…

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.762
Don't get too hung up about it!

00:17:33.929 --> 00:17:37.307
More importantly, don't you need
to go see who you'll fight next?

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:38.392
RECOVERY GIRL'S TEMPORARY NURSE'S OFFICE

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.477
Thank you both very much!

00:17:40.644 --> 00:17:41.562
Welcome.

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:42.604
Goodbye!

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:48.110
You were there, too, he said.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.405
That's a good thing.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.325
PLAYER WAITING ROOM 2

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:57.953
<i>Midoriya won, huh?</i>

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.168
You're in my way.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.381
You're acting disgracefully, Shoto.

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:16.889
If you used the power in your left side,
you would've had an overwhelming victory

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:19.141
in the obstacle course
and the cavalry battle.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:23.353
Stop this childish rebellion already.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.607
You have a duty to surpass All Might.

00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:30.402
Do you understand?

00:18:31.028 --> 00:18:32.696
You're different from your siblings.

00:18:32.863 --> 00:18:35.032
You are the greatest masterpiece!

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.536
Is that all you can say, bastard?

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.956
I will win
and advance with just Mom's power.

00:18:43.749 --> 00:18:46.043
I won't use your power when I fight.

00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:51.006
Even if that works for now,

00:18:51.757 --> 00:18:54.218
you'll soon reach
the limits of that power.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.519
Oh, Deku!

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:05.145
Good work!

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:07.022
We saved a seat for you!

00:19:07.648 --> 00:19:08.649
Thanks.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:17.616
<i>Thanks for waiting!</i>

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:20.661
<i>Next up is… these guys!</i>

00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:22.955
SHOTO TODOROKI VS HANTA SERO

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:23.997
<i>He's good!</i>

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:27.835
<i>He's good, but what's with that plainness</i>
<i>he just can't get rid of?</i>

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.254
<i>From the hero course, it's Hanta Sero!</i>

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.339
-That's mean.
<i>-Versus…</i>

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.176
<i>Taking second, then first in the prelims!</i>
<i>You're way too strong, kid!</i>

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.346
<i>He wasn't recommended</i>
<i>for admission for nothing!</i>

00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:42.933
<i>Also from the hero course,</i>
<i>it's Shoto Todoroki!</i>

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.188
<i>And now,</i>
<i>for the second match of the finals…</i>

00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:51.942
<i>-Ready… Start!</i>
-Well, I don't feel like I can win…

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:56.321
But I don't feel like losing, either!

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.491
<i>A surprise attack aimed</i>
<i>to push his opponent out of bounds!</i>

00:19:59.658 --> 00:20:02.744
<i>Don't you think that was the best choice</i>
<i>for this situation?</i>

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:05.247
<i>Seriously, get him, Sero!</i>

00:20:06.415 --> 00:20:07.499
Sorry.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:14.965
What was that?

00:20:15.132 --> 00:20:16.800
What's this vibration?

00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:25.267
What's that?

00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:39.448
Don't…

00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:42.326
Don't you think that's a bit much?

00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:46.413
<i>Sero, can you move?</i>

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.583
Of course not…

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.834
Ow…

00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:53.170
<i>Sero is immobilized!</i>

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:56.548
<i>Todoroki advances to the second round!</i>

00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:04.598
Don't worry about it…

00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.141
Don't worry about it!

00:21:06.642 --> 00:21:10.395
-Don't worry about it!
-Don't worry about it!

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:12.147
Don't worry about it!

00:21:13.232 --> 00:21:15.943
Sorry, I went overboard.

00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:21.615
I was angry.

00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:28.121
<i>Under the eyes of the crowd that started</i>
<i>shouting "Don't worry about it" unprompted</i>

00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:33.335
<i>was Todoroki, melting what</i>
<i>he'd frozen himself with his left hand.</i>

00:21:34.253 --> 00:21:35.212
<i>For some reason…</i>

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:39.299
<i>He looked very sad to me.</i>

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:14.978
<i>The preview is here!</i>

00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:17.689
<i>The U.A. sports festival</i>
<i>finals tournament!</i>

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:21.485
<i>The sixteen players in it clash</i>
<i>with their Quirks and their pride!</i>

00:23:21.652 --> 00:23:23.070
<i>There's only a slight difference</i>
<i>between winning and losing!</i>

00:23:23.237 --> 00:23:24.154
<i>Even so…</i>

00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:26.156
<i>The only ones who can win</i>

00:23:26.323 --> 00:23:28.325
<i>are those who train diligently every day</i>

00:23:28.492 --> 00:23:31.245
<i>and hang on to their dream</i>
<i>of becoming a hero!</i>

00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:33.830
<i>Do your best, you zygotes!</i>

00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:35.541
<i>Next time, "Battle on, Challengers!"</i>

00:23:35.874 --> 00:23:38.961
<i>Young Iida is manipulated by a girl</i>
<i>and is completely humiliated!</i>

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:40.504
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.671 --> 00:23:42.464
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
