WEBVTT

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:04.046
Live TV till after noon!

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:08.383
Today's topic is: "Is sexiness
necessary for hero work?"

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.677
And so, we have these two
in the studio today--

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.724
A rookie hero who debuted
just this year, Mt. Lady, and--

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:20.771
Midnight, who is currently
teaching at U.A. High School!

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.232
Thank you both for coming today.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:24.775
Please, have a seat.

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.652
Now, Midnight,

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:31.865
when you first debuted, your costume
was so extreme that it created a stir,

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.077
eventually leading to the "Regulations
for Exposed Skin in Costumes" bill

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:36.912
being submitted to the National Diet.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.165
You're known as a veteran hero
who changed the country.

00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:42.334
It's still pretty bad right now, though.

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.628
Now I'm going for the "ultra-thin" style.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.258
Many say that because of
the nature of their Quirks,

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.301
clothes obstruct their abilities.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.387
It's not a matter of whether
or not sexiness is necessary,

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.683
but rather that the result of
necessity became seen as sexy.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.143
It's just what you like, right?

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.020
What's with you?

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.188
Trying to pick a fight?

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.024
Of course not! It's just, how do
I put it-- I think you're amazing!

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.235
For your age.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:11.321
Are you trying to show that your
only redeeming feature is your youth?

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:12.531
Even though you're not that young?

00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:14.867
I'm saying that if the older generation
tries too hard,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.660
then it's hopeless for us younger folks!

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.288
<i>-You little…</i>
<i>-Hey, watch your hands!</i>

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:20.873
<i>You, too! Oh, jeez!</i>

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.916
<i>-Stop pulling! It'll rip!</i>
<i>-It's ripped!</i>

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:25.919
What an incredible episode!

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:47.608
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.235
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:53.864
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.407
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:59.972
GEAR UP FOR FINAL EXAMS

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.477
Okay, that's it for class.

00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:08.981
There's only one week
left until the final exams.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:11.650
You all are studying properly, right?

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.235
I'm sure you already know,

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.988
but it won't just be a written exam.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.991
Make sure you train your minds
and bodies at the same time.

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:20.659
That's all.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.913
I haven't studied at all!

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.001
With the sports festival and
internship, I didn't study at all!

00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:32.004
It's true that we had
one event after another, but…

00:03:32.588 --> 00:03:35.716
For the midterms, we'd just started
school, so they didn't cover much,

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:38.468
so I didn't really have
a hard time with them,

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:42.931
but with the back-to-back events
and stuff, the finals will be different…

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:46.143
It'll be tough since
there's a practical exam, too.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.562
Ninth on the midterms?

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.481
And here I thought you were one of us!

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:55.736
Guys like you are only likable
if they're dumb…!

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.905
Where's the demand for this?

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.823
The world, I guess.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.617
Ashido, Kaminari!

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.035
Let's do our best!

00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:06.288
We all want to go
to the training camp together, right?

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:10.292
Yes! As class rep, I also have high
hopes that you'll all be moved to action!

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.670
It's pretty hard to fail
if you just pay attention in class.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.173
Be careful with your words!

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.886
You two, I may be able to be
of assistance with the class lectures.

00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:22.346
Yao-momo!

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.683
I can't help at all
with the practical, though…

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.812
I'm not one of those two,
but can I join, too?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.482
I'm having some trouble
with quadratic functions…

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.317
Huh?

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:38.820
Sorry, me too! How are you
with classical Japanese?

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.989
-Huh?
-I'd like to join, too.

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.908
There's a bunch of stuff I don't get…

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:44.451
Please!

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:47.621
Everyone!

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.331
Yes, of course!

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:50.874
All right!

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:54.837
Then, let us hold a study session
at my residence this weekend!

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.131
Seriously? I can't wait to see your house!

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:03.053
Oh, in that case, I must tell
Mother and have her open up the hall!

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.805
<i>Hall?</i>

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:07.808
What kind of tea are you all partial to?

00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:09.434
<i>Tea?</i>

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.312
In my family, we always
drink Harrod's or Wedgwood,

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.565
so if you have any preference,
let me know!

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.401
Of course, you can trust me
to help you study, too!

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:19.903
I will definitely show you how I can help!

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.782
<i>It's like she casually slapped me with</i>
<i>the huge difference in how we were born…</i>

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.911
<i>…but her bounciness</i>
<i>is so cute that I don't care.</i>

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.123
What was that again? Harry's? That's fine.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.374
Harrod's, right?

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:35.252
Look at the difference in virtue.

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.797
I can do it, too!
Want me to beat it into you?

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:40.007
Yeah, I'm counting on you!

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:42.801
Everyone's panicking now,

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:45.387
even though it won't do any good
to cram this late in the game.

00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:49.183
Shouldn't you try cramming a little?

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.393
What are you talking about?

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.312
What is it?

00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:55.898
The practical exam, huh?

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.233
It's kind of scary
since I can't tell what'll be on it.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.861
I don't think it'll be anything crazy.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:04.406
The written exam questions
will come from what we study in class,

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.116
so I should be able
to manage somehow, but…

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.244
You can manage, huh…?

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.247
Seriously, what'll we have
to do for the practical exam?

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:15.667
"It'll be a comprehensive test
of everything from first semester."

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:19.296
That's all Mr. Aizawa would tell us…

00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:23.217
Everything we did so far…
So, combat training and rescue training,

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.551
and then basic training…

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.804
In addition to studying, we'll have
to keep in good physical conditio--

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.975
Oh, sorry. Your head was
so big that I accidentally hit it.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.227
You're from Class B…

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.937
Um… Monoma!

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:35.979
How dare you--

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.399
I heard you guys met the hero killer.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.318
Just like at the sports festival,

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:44.947
you guys in Class A just have
to have all the attention, huh?

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.742
But that attention isn't because
people have high hopes for you.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.662
It's because you keep
attracting trouble, right?

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.164
Oh, that's scary.

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:58.335
Someday, the rest of us might also
be caught up in the trouble you bring

00:06:58.502 --> 00:07:00.254
and become victims as well…

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.423
Like getting cursed
by the god of pestilence!

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.675
Oh, that's sca--

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.595
Monoma, that's not funny.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.430
Don't you know what happened to Iida?

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.682
Kendo!

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.727
Sorry, Class A. This guy's
heart's just kinda, you know.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:17.729
<i>His heart…?</i>

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.108
You guys were talking earlier
about how you don't know

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:23.235
what's gonna be on the practical exam
for the finals, right?

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:27.197
Looks like it'll be combat against robots
like in the entrance exam.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.407
What? Really?

00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:29.700
How do you know?

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:33.161
An upperclassman friend of mine told me.

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.413
It's kind of cheating, though.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.873
<i>No, it's not cheating.</i>

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:36.915
<i>That's right,</i>

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:39.751
<i>I'm sure gathering information</i>
<i>ahead of time is also part of the test.</i>

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.837
<i>I see, I should've asked</i>
<i>some upperclassmen…</i>

00:07:42.004 --> 00:07:43.380
<i>Why didn't I realize?</i>

00:07:43.547 --> 00:07:45.674
Are you an idiot, Kendou?

00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:48.385
We had an information advantage!

00:07:48.552 --> 00:07:52.389
This was our chance to get
ahead of the detestable Class A!

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:54.808
They're not detestable!

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:57.895
She's like the big sister of Class B, huh?

00:07:58.312 --> 00:07:59.980
All right!

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.274
Oh, it'll be easy if it's robots!

00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:03.734
Yeah, yeah!

00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:07.696
You guys look like you'd have a hard time
controlling your Quirks against people.

00:08:07.863 --> 00:08:10.115
Yeah! But I can just let loose
with robots, so it'll be a cinch!

00:08:10.282 --> 00:08:12.242
And it'll be a cinch for me to melt them!

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.786
Now you just need Yaoyorozu
to help you study,

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.580
and you'll be set for the finals!

00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:20.042
We'll definitely be able
to go to training camp now!

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:26.924
You may one day have
to fight against this great evil…

00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:32.304
<i>In order to prepare to face those words,</i>

00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:34.847
<i>I have to make everything count</i>
<i>from now on.</i>

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.308
It doesn't matter
if they're people or robots.

00:08:36.475 --> 00:08:37.601
They're the same
if you beat 'em up, right?

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:39.977
What're you idiots talking
about it being a cinch for?

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:42.563
-Who're you calling an idiot?
-Shut up!

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:45.359
If you need to control your Quirk,
then control it! Idiot!

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:47.986
Hey, Deku!

00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:58.288
I don't know if you've figured out
how to use your Quirk a little or what,

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:03.210
but you seriously keep
rubbing me the wrong way.

00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:07.714
Oh, he must be talking about how Deku
was moving like Bakugo the other day.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.299
Oh, yeah!

00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:13.053
I don't need another half-assed
result like at the sports festival.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.222
At the upcoming finals,
we'll get individual scores,

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:18.100
so we'll see who's better
whether you like it or not.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.895
I'll beat you
with an indisputable difference!

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.856
I'll kill you!

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:27.484
Todoroki!

00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:28.527
You, too!

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.285
It's been a while since
I've seen Bakugo that intense.

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.327
Impatience…?

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.663
Or hatred?

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:46.086
<i>Bakugo has gotten worse than I thought.</i>

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:50.132
YAOYOROZU

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:51.633
Wow…

00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:57.014
I knew she was rich,
but I didn't think she was <i>this</i> rich…

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.142
<i>Everyone, I have been waiting for you!</i>

00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.144
<i>Please, come in.</i>

00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:08.483
I feel so out of place,
it's making me nervous…

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.860
Me, too…

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:13.739
What is it?

00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:16.700
Oh, nothing…

00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:34.801
WRITTEN EXAM - DAY ONE

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.440
Pencils down, everybody.

00:10:48.607 --> 00:10:51.318
The last person in each row, collect
the answer sheets and bring them here.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.320
Thanks, Yao-momo!

00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:55.197
I didn't leave anything blank, at least!

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:59.952
<i>And so, our three days</i>
<i>of written exams were over.</i>

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.538
<i>And then, it was the day</i>
<i>of the practical exam.</i>

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:05.123
PRACTICAL EXAM AREA - CENTER PLAZA

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.213
Now, we will begin the practical exam.

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:14.591
Of course,
it is possible to fail this exam.

00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:18.011
If you want to go to the training camp,
then don't make any stupid mistakes.

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:20.514
There are a lot of teachers…

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.976
I expect that you all have
gathered information ahead of time

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.186
and have some idea
of what you will be doing.

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.730
We're fighting robot warriors
like at the entrance exam, right?

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.732
Fireworks! Curry! Test of Courage!

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:31.859
Too bad!

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:36.071
For various reasons, the exam
will be different starting this time!

00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:37.823
Principal Nezu!

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.991
Different?

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:43.328
From now on, we want to focus on
person-to-person combat and hero work,

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:46.540
and stress teaching
that is closer to actual fighting.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.667
So…

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:54.798
We'll have you form teams of two
to fight against one teacher!

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.968
Against… the teachers?

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.220
In addition, the pairs

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:03.223
and who each pair will be up
against have already been decided.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.809
These were determined at
my discretion based on various factors,

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:09.229
including fighting style, grades,
and interpersonal relationships,

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.564
so here they are:

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:13.525
First,
Todoroki and Yaoyorozu are one team.

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:16.028
And they're fighting me.

00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:19.114
And Midoriya and Bakugo are a team,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.617
and their opponent…

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:28.332
I… will do it!

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.751
All Might?

00:12:31.502 --> 00:12:34.922
Work together to beat me, you two!

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:41.094
A FEW DAYS AGO

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:45.474
With the connection between Hero Killer:
Stain and the League of Villains,

00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:48.310
there is the possibility that
the villains will be reinvigorated, huh?

00:12:48.477 --> 00:12:52.314
Of course, it would be better
to prevent that before it begins,

00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:54.358
but as a school, it would be
best to be completely certain.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.235
If we consider

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.738
how fights against villains will continue
to intensify in today's society,

00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:02.991
then combat training
against robots is not practical.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:08.205
<i>Originally, robots were used</i>
<i>to avoid complaints</i>

00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:10.707
<i>about people being injured</i>
<i>in the entrance exams.</i>

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:14.711
We can just ignore those.
Let them say what they want.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:17.256
We can't exactly do that now, can we?

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.842
I understand
why you want to change the exam,

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:24.096
but having the students
fight us in teams of two…

00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:26.890
Yes, I think that is a bit unfair.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:30.310
If we win too easily,
we won't be able to give them grades.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.188
Of course, we would take that
into consideration

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.440
and give the students a handicap.

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.985
Principal Nezu, what do you think?

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:43.073
Of course, I also agree
with changing the practical exam.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:48.912
What should we do to keep the students
from being in even more danger?

00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:50.497
The answer is simple.

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:53.083
We must have the students
themselves become stronger.

00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:54.877
That's true.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.086
I have no objections.

00:13:56.253 --> 00:13:59.131
Then, to determine the teams--

00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:00.340
First, Todoroki.

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:03.135
<i>In general, he's doing well,</i>

00:14:03.302 --> 00:14:05.429
<i>but overall, he has a tendency</i>
<i>to use brute force.</i>

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.184
<i>And Yaoyorozu is an all-rounder</i>
<i>but lacks the ability</i>

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.144
<i>to make spur-of-the-moment decisions</i>
<i>and apply them.</i>

00:14:12.561 --> 00:14:14.479
Therefore, I will erase their Quirks

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.356
and take advantage of
their weaknesses in close combat.

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.399
No objections!

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:20.402
<i>Next, for Midoriya and Bakugo,</i>

00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:22.613
I'm leaving them to you, All Might.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.159
For these two, I didn't pair
them up based on ability or grades.

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.162
Just on how badly they get along.

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:33.373
You like Midoriya, right?

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.335
<i>Please instruct them well.</i>

00:14:36.502 --> 00:14:39.171
<i>Aizawa, you're paying attention.</i>

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.049
And now, we'll announce the teams

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.926
and the teachers
they'll be up against all at once!

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.677
1ST MATCH

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.429
2ND MATCH

00:14:47.596 --> 00:14:49.181
3RD MATCH

00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:50.933
4TH MATCH

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.684
5TH MATCH

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.436
6TH MATCH

00:14:54.603 --> 00:14:56.188
7TH MATCH

00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:57.940
8TH MATCH

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.691
9TH MATCH

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:01.443
10TH MATCH

00:15:01.944 --> 00:15:04.404
The time limit for the exam
is thirty minutes!

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:08.200
Your objective is either to put
these handcuffs on the teacher,

00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:12.204
or to have one of you
escape from the stage!

00:15:12.371 --> 00:15:15.332
Capture the teacher or escape…

00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:17.584
It's kind of like the combat training.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.461
Is it really okay to run away?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.796
Yup.

00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:24.424
But it'll be different
from the combat training!

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:28.554
You'll be up against someone
way better than you!

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.681
Better… than us?

00:15:30.848 --> 00:15:32.558
I can't really imagine it, though…

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.435
Dummy! Hey girl,
watch your mouth! You hear?

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:39.606
This time, your exam will be
very similar to a real battle.

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.192
Please think of us as villains.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.528
Assuming you come across the enemy,

00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:47.030
if you think you can win a fight
against them, then that's fine.

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:48.073
However--

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.492
In cases where there's too big
a difference in your abilities,

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:53.328
it would be smarter
to run away and get help.

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.164
Todoroki, Iida, Midoriya.

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.083
I'm sure you three understand this well.

00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:03.589
Idiot! The hero killer is after me
and that kid in white armor, right?

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:06.925
Don't fight back.
It'd be better if you ran away!

00:16:07.593 --> 00:16:09.636
<i>I won't make that mistake again.</i>

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:13.140
<i>I will pass this test and prove that!</i>

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.393
Fight and win, or run and win.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.897
That's right! Your decision-making
skills are being tested!

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:24.151
But with these rules, you're probably
thinking the only choice is to run, right?

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:28.405
That's why we had the support course
make these for us!

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:32.993
Ultra compressed weights!

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:37.497
We'll put on about half
of our body weight.

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.541
It's to give you a handicap.

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:43.170
It's old-fashioned, but it makes it hard
to move and eats up stamina!

00:16:43.337 --> 00:16:45.797
Oh shoot,
they're heavier than I thought…

00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:48.425
By the way, there was a competition
to decide on the design,

00:16:48.592 --> 00:16:50.594
and we ended up using Young Hatsume's.

00:16:50.761 --> 00:16:51.678
Hatsume!

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:54.681
To allow us to consider fighting you, huh?

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.350
You're underestimating us.

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:00.562
I wonder.

00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:03.524
All right,
each team will take the practical exam

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.068
in order on the prepared stage.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.237
Sato, Kirishima, get ready.

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:09.279
Yes, sir!

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:12.366
Those waiting their turn
can watch the exams

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.242
or think of strategies as a team.

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:16.286
Do what you want.
That's all.

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:20.999
Ojiro, I would like to see
what we can do with our Quirks.

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.041
Of course.

00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:24.920
Tokoyami, let's come up with a plan.

00:17:25.087 --> 00:17:26.128
Very well.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.258
The problem is how to strip
Ms. Midnight, right?

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.468
No. You're such a scumbag.

00:17:32.845 --> 00:17:35.889
MONITOR ROOM

00:17:36.807 --> 00:17:40.394
Well, it looks like
I'll have a lot of work today.

00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:41.979
Oh?

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:43.814
You're watching, too, Deku?

00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:44.898
Yeah.

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:48.610
We don't have many chances to see
other students and the teachers fight.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:54.116
Besides, even if I wanted
to talk about strategies…

00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:56.618
<i>I see.</i>

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.370
Well, for me…

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:01.623
It's like there's no point
trying to talk to him.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:03.876
<i>Aoyama…</i>

00:18:04.293 --> 00:18:07.963
That's why I thought I'd try to use
everyone else's fights for reference.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.006
Yeah.

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:12.759
I have to pass this exam
by any means possible.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:17.181
Team Sato and Kirishima, practical exam.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:18.473
Ready, go!

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:20.809
For this exam,

00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:24.730
we'll definitely get a higher score
by capturing rather than running, right?

00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:26.023
I think so.

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:37.492
Mr. Cementoss moves slowly.

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.579
Let's break through from
the front and aim for a high score!

00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:42.539
All right!

00:18:42.998 --> 00:18:46.001
Rikido Sato. Quirk: Sugar Rush!

00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:49.880
For every ten grams of sugar, he'll be
five times as strong for three minutes!

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.424
However, when he uses sugar for power,

00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:54.968
his cognitive function
goes down accordingly.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:58.388
You came from the front after all, huh?

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:01.433
Let's go, Sato!

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.518
All right!

00:19:18.951 --> 00:19:19.952
Not yet.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.746
You can do it, Kirishima, Sato!

00:19:23.372 --> 00:19:24.456
They won't win at this rate.

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:29.002
<i>Kirishima and Sato's Quirks are amazing,</i>

00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:31.171
<i>but there's a limit</i>
<i>to how long they can use them.</i>

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.008
<i>On the other hand, I don't think</i>
<i>Mr. Cementoss has that.</i>

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:36.718
The more time passes,

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.012
the more of a disadvantage
Kirishima and Sato will be at.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.806
No way…

00:19:40.973 --> 00:19:45.102
This practical exam is
pitting students against teachers

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:46.770
they'd have a hard time with on purpose.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:51.733
I think the key will be how they deal
with their weaknesses to pass.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.026
That's exactly right.

00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:56.488
Before your own turns come around,
you should think carefully

00:19:56.655 --> 00:20:00.284
about your compatibility
with the teacher you'll fight.

00:20:01.952 --> 00:20:03.787
<i>I knew it.</i>

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:07.541
This is never ending, man!

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:11.336
No matter how many I break,
they just keep coming!

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:14.756
I'm sleepy… I'm tired…

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:15.883
Hey, keep trying!

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.177
I'm sleepy…

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.972
I'm running out of breath…

00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:27.978
You're both extremely weak
in a war of attrition.

00:20:28.854 --> 00:20:29.855
Listen,

00:20:30.022 --> 00:20:33.734
in a fight, you have to see just how much
you can push the things you're good at.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:38.572
Team Sato and Kirishima retires due
to both members losing consciousness.

00:20:38.739 --> 00:20:40.824
-Seriously?
-That's…

00:20:40.991 --> 00:20:42.743
Kirishima's…

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:46.163
Oh dear, it's only the first match,
and I already have work?

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.206
No way…

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.917
It was this one-sided?

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.169
Their Quirks were too
ineffective against his.

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:58.008
<i>This exam is much harder</i>
<i>than what I imagined.</i>

00:20:58.509 --> 00:20:59.426
<i>On top of that,</i>

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.846
<i>Kacchan and I are up against…</i>

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:04.723
PRACTICAL EXAM LOCATION TWO

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:09.102
We, the examinees, are starting
from the middle of the stage, huh?

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:13.315
In order to escape, we must pass
through the designated gate, right?

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:17.319
Which means, the teacher's
probably waiting for us by the gate.

00:21:18.904 --> 00:21:21.907
<i>Team Asui and Tokoyami, practical exam.</i>

00:21:22.074 --> 00:21:23.867
<i>Ready, go!</i>

00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:27.204
I forgot to tell you…

00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:32.376
We teachers are also trying
to crush you with everything we have.

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:37.631
Prepare

00:21:38.674 --> 00:21:40.300
your determination and resolve!

00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:14.144
<i>It's the preview!</i>

00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:16.563
<i>Asui and Tokoyami</i>
<i>are up against Ectoplasm!</i>

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.943
<i>And Todoroki and Yaoyorozu</i>
<i>are up against Mr. Aizawa?</i>

00:23:22.027 --> 00:23:24.321
<i>The match has been decided</i>
<i>before it even started, huh?</i>

00:23:24.488 --> 00:23:27.282
<i>Hurry up and finish it</i>
<i>so we can get to my turn!</i>

00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:30.744
<i>Aoyama, before that,</i>
<i>there's still Iida and Ojiro's exam…</i>

00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.496
<i>That should be finished quickly, as well.</i>

00:23:32.663 --> 00:23:33.664
<i>I can't do anything about it!</i>

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.791
<i>Next time, "Yaoyorozu: Rising."</i>

00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:39.002
<i>I'll say something shocking in</i>
<i>the last scene, so look forward to it.</i>

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:40.462
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:42.673
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
