WEBVTT

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.339
It was only a short time,
but thank you for taking care of me!

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.177
I don't feel like I did anything
I need to be thanked for.

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:12.471
Your internship ended up
the way it did, too.

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:16.308
No, it was thanks to your instruction in
ideas and your continuous sparring with me

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:18.894
that I was able to do something
even against the hero killer.

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:20.395
Ow…

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.482
Against a hero killer that wasn't serious!

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.696
Well, it was better than if you tried
for a single killer shot at 100%

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:33.242
and then ended up missing,
I guess I should say.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.828
But that arm had stress fractures,
didn't it?

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:40.082
At the last minute, you went
over the permitted five percent limit.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:41.708
You still strain yourself
in your impatience,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.752
and when you lose focus,
your control wavers.

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:46.213
You must always be alert and calm.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.216
I'm sure you already know this,

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:53.428
but if you want to become
a great hero like All Might,

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.681
then you still have a lot to learn.

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.100
Yes, sir!

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.102
See you around.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.232
Can I ask you one last thing?

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:08.694
I thought it was rude,
so I never got a chance to ask…

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:11.154
I could never find a good time for it,
but…

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.574
Hurry up! I want to eat <i>taiyaki</i>!

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:19.580
Even though you're really strong
and even trained All Might,

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:25.586
the name "Gran Torino"
is almost unknown…

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:28.839
Is there a reason for that?

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.552
Oh, that's because I was never
interested in working as a hero.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:34.595
What?

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.766
I had a goal in the past that required
me to be able to use my Quirk freely.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.603
That was the only reason I got my license.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.231
It'd be better to hear
more about this from Toshi--

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:50.068
I mean, All Might. Expect more from him.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.321
All Might…

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.907
That's all! Be well!

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.408
Yes, sir!

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.785
Thank you very much! Excuse me!

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.416
<i>The greatest hero, huh?</i>

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.002
<i>You're completely different</i>
<i>in appearance and personality,</i>

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.923
<i>but he certainly is just like you,</i>
<i>Toshinori.</i>

00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:14.134
<i>The man chosen by my sworn friend…</i>

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:19.973
<i>And the one that man</i>
<i>chose to inherit One For All…</i>

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:22.684
Kid!

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:25.687
-Who are you?
-You're asking now?

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:28.440
Um, well… I'm Izuku Midor--

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:29.858
That's not it, is it?

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.568
Huh?

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.323
I'm Deku!

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.456
<i>Let's watch over him together, Toshinori.</i>

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:48.377
<i>Until the day you pass into history…</i>

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:54.174
<i>Until the day the name "Deku"</i>
<i>is celebrated as the Symbol of Peace…</i>

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.573
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.242
<i>and a student at U.A High.</i>

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.871
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.372
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.853
LISTEN UP!! A TALE FROM THE PAST

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:35.234
Seriously? Seriously, Bakugo?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.944
Stop laughing!

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.905
My hair's gotten used to it,
so it won't go back even after I wash it!

00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:41.156
Hey, stop laughing!

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:42.199
I'll kill you!

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.326
I'd like to see you try, Side-Part Boy!

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:45.827
What'd you say?

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.162
It's back!

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.082
Wow, you even got to fight villains?

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.500
I'm so jealous!

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:54.336
I just helped people evacuate
and did logistical support,

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.129
so I didn't do any actual fighting,
though.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.131
It's still amazing, though!

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.426
All I did was train
and go on patrols, too.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.388
There was just one time when we caught
smugglers from a neighboring country.

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:06.098
That's crazy!

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.226
What about you, Ochaco?
How was your week?

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.814
It was very worthwhile…

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.816
Ochaco's awakened, huh?

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:17.985
She went to that battle hero's place,
right?

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.071
That's a huge change for just one week…

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.740
Change? That's not it, Kaminari.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.743
Women are all demons.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.621
They're just hiding
their true personalities.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.665
What did you see at Mt. Lady's place?

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:35.460
I was kind of fawned over
and had a good time.

00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:38.463
But the ones who changed the most,
or at least went through the most

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.673
were you three, right?

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.675
Oh, yeah! The hero killer!

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.678
I'm glad you guys made it out alive!
Seriously.

00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:46.805
I was worried.

00:05:47.306 --> 00:05:49.600
I heard Endeavor saved you, right?

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.561
That's amazing! As expected
from the number two hero!

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.193
Yeah. He saved us.

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:00.444
Yeah.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.197
I saw on the news

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.325
that the hero killer was
connected to the League of Villains.

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:11.163
Imagining someone that scary
coming to USJ freaks me out.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.126
He <i>is</i> scary, but did you
see the video, Ojiro?

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.962
-Video? You mean of the hero killer?
-Yeah.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:23.258
<i>Seeing that, you can see how he's really</i>
<i>single-minded and, like, tenacious.</i>

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.093
Doesn't it almost
make you think he's cool?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.386
Kaminari!

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.138
Huh? Oh, Ii--

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:29.181
Sorry!

00:06:29.348 --> 00:06:31.058
No, it's fine.

00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:33.894
It's true that he was tenacious.

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:37.064
I understand how people
could think he's cool.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:41.818
But he chose purging
as a result of his beliefs.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:46.490
No matter what he thinks,
that part is definitely wrong.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.577
In order to keep anyone else
from turning out like me,

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:55.040
I will once again walk on
the path to becoming a hero!

00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:56.458
Yeah, Iida!

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.669
Now, it is time to commence class!

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.337
Everyone, take your seats!

00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:01.463
He's so loud…

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.715
It's 'cause you talked
about weird stuff, Kaminari!

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.468
Sorry about that.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.014
Until I become a true hero,

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.100
I think I want to leave
my left hand as it is.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.478
<i>You're cool, Iida!</i>

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.941
Okay, I am here.

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:25.612
Anyway, we'll start now.
Right. It's hero basic training!

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.531
Long time no see, boys and girls!

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:28.699
How've you been?

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:31.952
For this time's hero basic training--

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.954
Since you've all just
gotten back from your internships,

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:38.333
we'll have some fun with
a rescue training race!

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.129
If we are doing rescue training,
then shouldn't we do it at USJ?

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:45.215
That place is for training for disasters.

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.343
Do you remember what I said?

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.928
That's right! I said "race"!

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:52.848
This is Field Gamma!

00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:57.019
A dense area filled with factories
laid out like an intricate labyrinth.

00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:58.604
You'll break up
into four five-person groups

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.772
and go through the training
one group at a time.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.692
<i>When I send out a distress</i>
<i>signal from somewhere inside,</i>

00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:05.694
<i>you'll all start at once</i>
<i>from the outskirts of the city!</i>

00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:09.740
<i>It's a race to see</i>
<i>who will rescue me first!</i>

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:13.285
Of course, you'll have to keep
damage to buildings to a minimum.

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:15.078
Don't point at me!

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.748
All right, first group, get in place!

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.214
Iida hasn't completely recovered yet,
right?

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.548
He should just watch.

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.551
This group has everyone
in the class with good mobility.

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:34.306
Hmm, perhaps Midoriya
is at a slight disadvantage.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:38.936
That's true. Honestly,
I'm still not sure how good he is.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:42.063
And whenever he does something,
he always gets badly injured…

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:45.067
Who do you think'll win?
I think Sero'll be first!

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.445
But Ojiro's there, too.

00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:51.949
I think it'll be Ashido.
She's really athletic!

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.700
Deku will be last!

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.287
Even if he's injured,
I still think it'll be Iida.

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.455
Ribbit.

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.791
Okay, here we go!

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.084
Start!

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.052
See, look!

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:15.264
In a place all jumbled together like this,
it's standard practice to go up!

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.934
Which means, Sero's got an advantage
since he's good in the air, huh?

00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:22.145
Hey, isn't this place
a little too perfect for me?

00:09:26.984 --> 00:09:29.695
It's too perfect…
for the training I did!

00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:33.615
Wow, Midoriya?

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.367
What's with those moves?

00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:37.286
No way!

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.039
<i>Yeah, now that I think</i>
<i>about it, those moves are…</i>

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:45.294
Wow! He's hopping… like…

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.796
<i>My moves!</i>

00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:52.509
<i>While I was spending</i>
<i>my time uselessly at my internship…</i>

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.052
<i>Again…</i>

00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:56.430
<i>Again!</i>

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.225
Midoriya's jumping?

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.227
His broken bones are already healed?

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.188
<i>Calm down!</i>

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.691
<i>I can do this.</i>
<i>Just calm down! Stay at five percent!</i>

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.571
<i>Always be alert and calm…</i>

00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:14.698
<i>Huh?</i>

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.533
Finish!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.659
THANKS FOR SAVING ME

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.912
Thank you! And congrats.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.121
Thanks!

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.749
-I can't believe this!
-Midoriya, are you all right?

00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:27.294
<i>I see, when jumping in</i>
<i>an area with unstable footing,</i>

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:30.339
<i>I have to take where</i>
<i>I'm jumping into consideration, too…</i>

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.508
<i>I have a lot to learn.</i>

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:36.220
Young Sero came in first,
but compared to the beginning of the year,

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.889
you've all gotten a lot
better at using your Quirks.

00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:42.434
Keep going like this and
start preparing for your final exam!

00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:43.477
Yes, sir!

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:46.980
Group one, you can leave the field.
Next group, get ready!

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.693
You surprised me.
I couldn't believe my eyes!

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:56.240
Come find me after class is over.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:58.492
Yes, sir…

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.621
The time has come when I must tell you

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:06.124
about me and One For All.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:10.879
That was some hard training.

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.507
Our first class in a while made me sweat!

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:16.009
I need to work on my mobility.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.929
You must compensate
for it by gathering information.

00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:21.098
That'll put me a step behind everyone.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:23.851
I'm jealous of guys like you and Sero.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.400
<i>I wonder what he wants.</i>
<i>It's a little scary…</i>

00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:32.985
Hey, Midoriya!

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.695
I discovered something crazy!

00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:35.737
Come here!

00:11:36.572 --> 00:11:38.407
Look at this hole, Shawshank!

00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:40.826
It is probably thanks to the efforts
of those who came before us!

00:11:40.993 --> 00:11:43.120
<i>Next door is, you know…</i>

00:11:43.287 --> 00:11:44.496
<i>the girls' locker room!</i>

00:11:44.663 --> 00:11:46.164
Stop this, Mineta!

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.875
Peeping is definitely a criminal act!

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:51.879
My little Mineta
is already a criminal act!

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.089
Yaoyorozu's ample yaoyoro-boobs!

00:11:54.256 --> 00:11:56.133
Ashido's slender waist!

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.509
Hagakure's floating underwear!

00:11:57.676 --> 00:12:00.304
Uraraka's fine uraraka-body!

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.849
Asui's unexpected boobie--

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:07.060
Jiro's Earphone Jack!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.437
With its brutal combination of precision

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:10.606
and surprise attack abilities,
it's super strong!

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.482
Thanks, Kyoka.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.067
How despicable.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:15.736
Let us close this up right away!

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.907
<i>I'm the only one he didn't</i>
<i>say anything about…</i>

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.492
<i>My eye!</i>

00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:32.377
Excuse me!

00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:37.424
Have a seat.

00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:39.927
<i>He seems… different…</i>

00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:43.597
You went through a lot, huh?

00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:45.891
I'm sorry I couldn't be nearby.

00:12:46.058 --> 00:12:49.311
That's… not something you
need to apologize for, All Might…

00:12:50.062 --> 00:12:51.480
More importantly…

00:12:51.647 --> 00:12:54.066
Um, what did you mean when you
said you wanted to talk about One For All?

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.485
I heard

00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:59.446
that the hero killer
got a lick of your blood.

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:00.948
Oh, yes…

00:13:01.532 --> 00:13:04.952
<i>His Quirk was one that could keep someone</i>
<i>from moving after ingesting their blood…</i>

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:07.079
What about it?

00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:10.082
Do you remember what I said

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:11.500
when I gave you my power?

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:12.709
"Eat this."

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.753
No, not that part.

00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:19.007
<i>I said that it didn't matter what it</i>
<i>was as long as you took in my DNA.</i>

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:23.053
Then don't tell me,
the hero killer has One For All now!

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.596
No, that's not it.

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:27.558
I thought you might've
been worried about that, but…

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.519
I see… You forgot about it, huh?

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:36.650
One For All cannot be transferred
to anyone unless the bearer wishes it.

00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:39.319
It cannot be stolen by force.

00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:41.780
It <i>can</i> be transferred by force, though.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:43.782
<i>Kind of like this:</i>

00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:45.492
<i>This is just out of obligation!</i>
<i>Obligation!</i>

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:47.286
<i>Why are you there?</i>

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.497
It's a special Quirk.

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:53.834
Yes, and this is how it came about…

00:13:55.294 --> 00:13:59.214
One For All was derived from
a certain Quirk that existed in the past.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.466
A Quirk that existed in the past?

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:06.972
The name of that Quirk is "All For One."

00:14:07.723 --> 00:14:10.851
A Quirk that could steal Quirks
from others and make them the holder's,

00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:14.188
and one that could give
those Quirks to others.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.692
"All"… Everything for one person?

00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:21.904
<i>This was when superpowers</i>
<i>were first showing up,</i>

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.657
<i>before society had figured out</i>
<i>how to deal with the changes.</i>

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.118
<i>With the appearance of Quirks, suddenly,</i>

00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:31.622
<i>what made someone</i>
<i>a normal human crumbled away.</i>

00:14:32.331 --> 00:14:35.125
<i>With just that, laws lost their meaning,</i>

00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:37.127
<i>and the progress of civilization stopped.</i>

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.630
<i>It was literal decay.</i>

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.758
"If superpowers had never appeared,

00:14:42.925 --> 00:14:46.470
then humans would be taking
interstellar holidays by now."

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.556
Someone important said that in the past.

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:50.599
That's right.

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:53.560
<i>During that chaotic period,</i>

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:57.356
<i>there was someone who was</i>
<i>the first to unify all the people.</i>

00:14:57.773 --> 00:14:59.858
<i>I'm sure you've also heard of him.</i>

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.153
<i>He stole Quirks from people</i>

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.115
<i>and with his overwhelming power,</i>
<i>he spread his influence.</i>

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:09.159
<i>He moved people in a calculating way,</i>

00:15:09.326 --> 00:15:12.371
<i>committing evil acts</i>
<i>to his heart's content.</i>

00:15:12.538 --> 00:15:15.207
<i>In the blink of an eye,</i>
<i>he became the leader of the evildoers</i>

00:15:15.374 --> 00:15:17.376
<i>and ruled over Japan.</i>

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.255
I often see rumors about this online,

00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:23.882
but isn't this a fabrication?

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:25.759
It's not in the textbooks or anything…

00:15:26.385 --> 00:15:29.680
They can't put secret dealings
in textbooks, can they?

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.767
If people get powers,
they look for places to use them.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.273
How does this relate to One For All?

00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:43.443
I said that All For One
could give Quirks to others, right?

00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:48.782
<i>He made others trust him or</i>
<i>surrender to him by giving them Quirks.</i>

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.580
<i>But apparently, there were many</i>
<i>given Quirks who could not bear the burden</i>

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:58.292
<i>and became like living dolls</i>
<i>who couldn't speak.</i>

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:01.295
<i>Just like the Nomus.</i>

00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:09.052
Meanwhile, there were also Quirks that
changed or mixed once they were passed on.

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:12.681
<i>He had a Quirkless younger brother.</i>

00:16:13.182 --> 00:16:18.312
<i>His brother was small and sickly,</i>
<i>but he had a strong sense of justice.</i>

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.231
<i>It pained him to see</i>
<i>his older brother's deeds,</i>

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.692
<i>so he kept resisting him.</i>

00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:30.365
<i>He forced a Quirk that could</i>
<i>stock power onto his younger brother.</i>

00:16:30.866 --> 00:16:34.745
<i>At this point, it is impossible</i>
<i>to know if that was out of kindness</i>

00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:36.538
<i>or to force him into submission.</i>

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:39.291
Don't tell me…

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:45.839
<i>Yeah. He was thought to be Quirkless,</i>
<i>but there was something inside him.</i>

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.800
<i>Something that neither he himself</i>
<i>nor those around him noticed.</i>

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:52.804
<i>He had a useless Quirk</i>
<i>that could pass on Quirks!</i>

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:58.310
The Quirk to stock power mixed
with the Quirk to pass on Quirks.

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.813
That was the origin of One For All.

00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:06.026
It's ironic

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.904
that justice always comes from evil.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.071
Hey, wai--

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:13.116
I understand how that came about,

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:17.454
but why are you bringing up
an evildoer from so long ago now?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:21.458
He can steal Quirks, you know.
Anything goes.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.919
<i>A Quirk to stop aging…</i>

00:17:24.086 --> 00:17:26.463
<i>He probably stole something like that.</i>

00:17:26.964 --> 00:17:30.759
<i>The Symbol of Evil</i>
<i>was pretty much immortal…</i>

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.095
<i>With the huge difference</i>
<i>in their combat abilities</i>

00:17:33.262 --> 00:17:35.264
<i>and the state of society at the time,</i>

00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:37.391
<i>the defeated younger brother decided</i>

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:39.810
<i>to entrust his Quirk</i>
<i>to future generations.</i>

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:42.312
<i>He believed</i>

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:45.065
<i>that even if he couldn't win then,</i>
<i>if he slowly cultivated the power,</i>

00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:48.360
<i>then one day, it would become</i>
<i>strong enough to stop his older brother.</i>

00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:54.241
<i>And then, when it was my turn,</i>
<i>I was finally able to defeat him!</i>

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:59.037
<i>At least, that's what I thought,</i>
<i>but he survived</i>

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:02.958
<i>and has started moving again as</i>
<i>the brain behind the League of Villains.</i>

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:11.592
One For All is power inherited
to defeat All For One, so to speak.

00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:18.473
You may one day have
to fight against this great evil…

00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:22.477
This is harsh on you, but--

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.062
I'll do my best!

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:28.567
I'll do whatever you ask of me,
no matter what it is!

00:18:28.734 --> 00:18:31.570
As long as you're with me,
I can do anything!

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:33.947
That's what it feels like!

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:40.662
<i>Tell him, All Might.</i>

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.457
<i>You must…</i>

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:52.090
That's not it, Young Midoriya…

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.512
I…

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:03.852
Thank you…

00:19:08.357 --> 00:19:10.567
<i>That's not it, Young Midoriya.</i>

00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:16.073
<i>Probably, by that time…</i>

00:19:17.533 --> 00:19:20.494
<i>I won't be able</i>
<i>to be by your side anymore…</i>

00:20:53.045 --> 00:20:55.964
Well, it's almost time
for summer vacation,

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:59.718
but of course, it wouldn't make sense
for you to rest for the whole month.

00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:01.178
Don't tell me…

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:04.431
During summer vacation,
we'll have a training camp in the woods!

00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:06.934
I knew it! Yes!

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.936
-Let's test our courage!
-Baths!

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:10.479
-Fireworks!
-Open-air baths!

00:21:10.646 --> 00:21:12.356
-Curry.
-Hot springs!

00:21:12.523 --> 00:21:16.610
If we're out in nature, we will have
to work under different conditions, right?

00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:21.323
No matter what the environment,
we must choose wisely…

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.366
Interesting.

00:21:22.783 --> 00:21:24.243
Eating and sleeping with everyone!

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:25.410
I'm getting excited!

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:26.620
However.

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:30.916
Those who do not pass
the final exam before that

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:32.751
will be in summer school hell.

00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:34.503
Everyone, let's do our best!

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.004
This is damn stupid.

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:37.756
Girls, do your best!

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:42.386
<i>It's true that what All Might</i>
<i>said was mind-blowing,</i>

00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:45.138
<i>but our daily lives continued like this,</i>

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:48.350
<i>and in the end,</i>
<i>what I need to do hasn't changed.</i>

00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:52.020
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:55.774
<i>All Might didn't say anything</i>
<i>about himself.</i>

00:21:58.277 --> 00:21:59.695
Hero Killer…

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:02.865
I didn't think he'd get caught,

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.950
but everything else
pretty much went as expected.

00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:10.497
With this, those who want to go wild
or who sympathize with him

00:22:10.664 --> 00:22:15.043
will seek out the League of Villains
as a place to release their urges.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.462
Tomura Shigaraki
will be put in a position

00:22:17.629 --> 00:22:20.465
where he must unify all of them.

00:22:21.175 --> 00:22:25.470
I believe things will move faster
if you go out before them, though, Master.

00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:29.975
Then hurry up and fix my body, Doctor…

00:22:30.142 --> 00:22:34.479
If only we'd gotten our hands on
super regeneration five years earlier…

00:22:35.147 --> 00:22:39.484
After your wounds healed,
it was just a useless Quirk.

00:22:40.736 --> 00:22:43.530
The leader of the League of Villains, huh?

00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:47.993
I wonder if that child can really do it…

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:52.080
It's fine. I'll have him work hard

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:55.250
in order to have him become the next "me."

00:22:56.043 --> 00:23:00.506
That child was born with
the twisted sense needed for that.

00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:06.178
Celebrate while you can, All Might--

00:23:06.887 --> 00:23:10.599
<i>Celebrate this farce of a temporary peace.</i>

00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:14.353
<i>Here's the preview!</i>

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.896
<i>The final exam is about to begin.</i>

00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:18.732
<i>Setting aside the written exam, what's</i>
<i>the practical exam going to be like?</i>

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:22.486
<i>Midoriya, it looks like we'll be fighting</i>
<i>against robots in the practical exam.</i>

00:23:22.653 --> 00:23:23.862
<i>It'll be easy!</i>

00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:26.782
<i>Ashido, I think the content</i>
<i>of the test changed…</i>

00:23:26.949 --> 00:23:29.660
<i>Let's see… Students form pairs…</i>

00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:32.663
<i>…and fight against one teacher?</i>
<i>Against pro heroes?</i>

00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:34.039
