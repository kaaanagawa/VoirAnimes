WEBVTT

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.547
Endeavor's my old man.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.383
<i>He's been stuck as the number two hero</i>
<i>for forever.</i>

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:13.263
It is my Shoto's duty
to surpass All Might.

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:19.937
If you have something from
the number one hero, then I…

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.981
have even more reason to beat you.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.612
<i>In my memories,</i>
<i>my mother is always crying.</i>

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.949
<i>"Your left side is unsightly,"</i>

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.536
<i>my mother said</i>
<i>as she poured boiling water on me.</i>

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.666
<i>Without using my damn old man's Quirk…</i>

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:41.708
<i>No.</i>

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:47.172
<i>I'll reject him completely</i>
<i>by winning first place without using it.</i>

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:51.051
<i>No matter what you are to All Might,</i>

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.388
<i>I will rise above you</i>
<i>with just my right side.</i>

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:59.852
But I can't lose, either.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.272
I have to live up to the hopes
of those who supported me.

00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:06.149
I will beat you, too!

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:46.667
But you want to be a hero, don't you?

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.215
It's okay for <i>you</i> to be one.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:59.596
<i>Before I knew it, I had forgotten</i>
<i>what happened after this.</i>

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.197
SHOTO TODOROKI - IZUKU MIDORIYA

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.200
<i>The first match of the second round!</i>

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:24.288
At this year's sports festival,
both have shown top class performances!

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:27.291
<i>Midoriya!</i>

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.544
<i>First, he'll come at me with ice.</i>

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.337
Versus…

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.257
<i>Todoroki!</i>

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.511
<i>It'll be dangerous to let him use</i>
<i>that power as he likes.</i>

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:42.472
<i>It's like two great rivals</i>
<i>fighting against each other!</i>

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.515
<i>Now…</i>

00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:45.392
<i>The instant we start…</i>

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.102
<i>Start!</i>

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.145
<i>Go!</i>

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.315
Smash!

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.243
-So cold!
-Just the wind is already this cold?

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.418
<i>Just as I expected.</i>

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.297
<i>He was prepared to injure himself</i>
<i>to negate the attack.</i>

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:20.886
<i>Wow! Midoriya stopped Todoroki's attack!</i>

00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:25.098
<i>He didn't know what scale</i>
<i>of attack Young Todoroki would use,</i>

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.644
<i>so he abandoned control</i>
<i>and fired off a shot at 100%!</i>

00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:33.941
<i>It's true that that was the only thing</i>
<i>he could do against the ice attack…</i>

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:35.692
<i>However!</i>

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:40.072
Smash!

00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:42.824
<i>He stopped it again!</i>

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.537
<i>Damn…</i>

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.540
<i>From what I know of Todoroki's fighting,</i>

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.334
<i>he always attacks in an instant,</i>
<i>so I don't have much data on him.</i>

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:53.377
<i>Data…</i>

00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:57.130
<i>During this fight,</i>
<i>I need to find an opening.</i>

00:04:57.923 --> 00:04:59.842
<i>The ice he's stuck behind him</i>

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:03.053
<i>is probably how he plans</i>
<i>to keep from being blown away.</i>

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.390
<i>Which means,</i>
<i>I was right to use my fingers.</i>

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:08.976
<i>It's likely that it could even work</i>

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.395
<i>against a 100% smash</i>
<i>where I sacrifice my arm.</i>

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:15.148
<i>I've got to look carefully…</i>

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:16.900
<i>Think…</i>

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.318
<i>Find it…</i>

00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:22.322
<i>I've got six more chances!</i>

00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:24.533
You're…

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.628
<i>Five more chances!</i>

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.633
It started?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.261
Kirishima, good job making it
to the second round.

00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:48.182
Yeah, I'll be up against you next, Bakugo.
Let's have a good fight!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.266
I'll kill you.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.144
I'd like to see you try!

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:53.312
But man,

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.898
you and Todoroki can both shoot off
powerful attacks

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.357
that cover a lot of ground.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.483
Like "Bam!"

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.861
And you can do it with no time lag.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.280
I'm not just shooting them off.
Don't underestimate 'em.

00:06:03.447 --> 00:06:04.406
Huh?

00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:07.701
If you overuse your muscles,
the muscle fibers tear,

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.078
and if you keep running,
you'll run out of breath.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.249
<i>There's a limit to how much</i>
<i>power I can produce, too.</i>

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.378
<i>That's why I designed my costume</i>
<i>so that I could fire blasts</i>

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.048
<i>in excess of what my body</i>
<i>allows without any risk.</i>

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:24.551
Quirks are physical abilities, too.

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:28.555
They must also have some kind of limit.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.475
If I think about it like that,
I guess that makes sense.

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:34.186
Then, against the instant-killer
Todoroki, Midoriya wants…

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.647
…an endurance match, huh?

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:39.066
I'll end this quickly.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.277
Smash!

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.324
<i>I've used up</i>
<i>all the fingers on my right hand!</i>

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:52.079
<i>Todoroki doesn't recoil from</i>
<i>Midoriya's power and gets in close!</i>

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.122
Damn it!

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.593
<i>Oh no, he's so close!</i>

00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:33.203
That's a lot more powerful than before.

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:37.958
Are you trying to tell me… to stay away?

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:44.006
<i>It's not just his Quirk.</i>

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.927
<i>His judgment,</i>
<i>application skills, mobility…</i>

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.972
<i>All of his abilities… are strong!</i>

00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:57.811
He's already better than the average pro…

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:01.231
It's like that's what you get
from the son of the number two hero.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:06.153
What, you're that beat up just
from defending and running away?

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:11.825
<i>He's trembling?</i>

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.162
<i>Is that how it is?</i>

00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:17.831
<i>Damn it…</i>

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.875
Sorry.

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:21.502
Thanks, Midoriya.

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:25.589
That guy's face
is clouded over thanks to you.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.844
<i>Without using my damn old man's Quirk…</i>

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:33.304
No.

00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:39.520
I'll reject him completely
by winning first place without using it.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.941
With your arms like that,
you can't fight anymore, can you?

00:08:44.483 --> 00:08:45.692
Let's finish this.

00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:50.364
<i>Todoroki keeps attacking</i>
<i>with overwhelming power!</i>

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:52.699
<i>Here comes the finishing ice attack!</i>

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.329
Where are you looking?

00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:15.180
Bastard…

00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:18.100
With your broken finger?

00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:21.645
Why are you going so far?

00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:25.607
You're trembling, Todoroki.

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.279
Quirks are physical abilities, too.

00:09:30.654 --> 00:09:34.575
There's a limit to how much
cold your body can take, isn't there?

00:09:35.534 --> 00:09:42.165
And isn't that something you could solve
by using the heat from your left side?

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:48.547
Everyone's fighting
with everything they've got.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.468
To win and get closer to their dream.

00:09:54.303 --> 00:09:56.096
To become number one.

00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:01.226
You want to
win with just half your strength?

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:07.316
You haven't put a single
scratch on me yet, you know!

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.197
Come at me
with everything you've got!

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.535
You want to win
with just half your strength?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:23.498
You haven't put a single
scratch on me yet, you know!

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.419
Come at me with everything you've got!

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.339
<i>Young Midoriya…</i>

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:36.720
Todoroki isn't you, either.

00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:39.264
That boy…

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:45.312
Midoriya…

00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:47.773
What are you planning?

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.441
Everything I've got?

00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:53.237
Did my damn old man
buy you off or something?

00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.572
Now I'm angry!

00:10:58.492 --> 00:10:59.576
<i>His movements are…</i>

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:00.869
<i>…slow!</i>

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:03.789
<i>It's because frost fell on his body…</i>

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:08.794
<i>Unlike the limit to my power,</i>
<i>it's probably like the MP in a game.</i>

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.464
<i>Was the scale during his fight</i>
<i>with Flat Face the upper limit?</i>

00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:18.178
<i>In close quarters, you won't be</i>
<i>able to do anything about it!</i>

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.225
<i>The instant I lifted my right foot…</i>
<i>This guy…</i>

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.853
Imagine the microwave…

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.480
It won't explode…

00:11:28.647 --> 00:11:31.859
It won't…

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:34.069
<i>A solid hit!</i>

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.365
<i>We've got some action!</i>

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:44.621
He got a hit on Todoroki!

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:47.916
Even though Midoriya
looks way more beat up…

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.502
I can't believe he went
on the offensive here!

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.924
<i>Why?</i>

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.014
<i>The ice isn't coming as fast…</i>

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.691
Should I stop it, Midnight?

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:16.945
That Midoriya's probably thinking,
"Recovery Girl

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.739
<i>will heal me anyway,"</i>

00:12:18.906 --> 00:12:20.157
<i>and is being reckless.</i>

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:24.953
He's full of adrenaline right now,
so he probably isn't feeling much pain…

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.873
But, those injuries…

00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:32.169
They probably
can't be fully healed in one go.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.630
Even if he wins,

00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:37.382
<i>he might not be able</i>
<i>to fight his next match.</i>

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.385
<i>You can't keep saying</i>

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:44.640
you can't help it
because you can't control your Quirk.

00:12:46.642 --> 00:12:49.061
<i>His power's gone down,</i>
<i>but he's gained some control.</i>

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.022
<i>He's not just fighting recklessly.</i>

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:56.860
<i>This is the best he can do</i>
<i>to win at this point in time.</i>

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:00.447
<i>But man…</i>

00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:03.283
<i>Even if it can be healed,</i>

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:07.955
<i>to be able to jump into intense pain</i>
<i>like that requires a lot of resolve.</i>

00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:12.042
<i>What is stirring him up?</i>

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.379
<i>All Might.</i>

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.965
<i>I want to be like him.</i>

00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:22.469
<i>In order to do that, I have to be</i>
<i>strong enough to become number one.</i>

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.223
<i>My motivation might seem trivial</i>
<i>compared to yours…</i>

00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:29.977
<i>I can't make a fist!</i>

00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:33.438
Smash!

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.572
Why are you going so far?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.241
Because I want to live up
to everyone's expectations.

00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:49.496
I want to be able to smile
and respond to them…

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:53.166
<i>To be a cool hero…</i>

00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:56.837
That's what I want to be!

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:58.881
Shoto…

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:01.967
That's why…

00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:07.973
Everyone's giving it their all!

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:16.607
There's no way I can know all of
your circumstances, or your resolve.

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:20.569
But for you to become number one
without giving it your all,

00:14:20.736 --> 00:14:22.029
to completely reject your father…

00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:24.990
Right now, I think you
should stop screwing around!

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:33.290
Stand up!

00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:36.877
If you're downed by something
like this, forget beating All Might,

00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:38.504
you won't even be able
to take the small fry villains--

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.756
Please, stop! He's only five!

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:43.383
He's <i>already</i> five! Get out of my way!

00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:46.762
Mom!

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.974
Shut up.

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:56.688
I don't wanna, Mom.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.400
I…

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:03.654
I don't want to be like Dad.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.699
I don't want to become
someone who bullies you, Mom!

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:12.412
But you want to be a hero, don't you?

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:20.337
<i>It's okay for </i>you<i> to be one.</i>

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.341
<i>As long as you have</i>
<i>a future you feel strongly about.</i>

00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:27.511
That's why… I will win!

00:15:28.804 --> 00:15:30.472
I'll surpass you!

00:15:41.817 --> 00:15:43.068
Don't look at that, Shoto.

00:15:43.694 --> 00:15:46.363
They're from a different world than you.

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.200
<i>Mom,</i>

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:52.703
I'm going crazy…

00:15:53.287 --> 00:15:54.580
I can't take it anymore.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.833
Every day, the children seem
to become more and more like him…

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.043
Shoto's…

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:05.674
That child's left side
sometimes looks very unsightly to me.

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:09.970
I can't raise him anymore.
I feel like I shouldn't…

00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:12.472
Mom?

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.482
<i>I…</i>

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:29.656
Good grief,
this is an important time, too…

00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:31.491
Where's Mom?

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:37.873
Oh, she injured you,
so I put her in a hospital.

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:41.919
It's your fault.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.798
You're the one who made Mom…

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.928
<i>I will reject…</i>

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:55.641
my old man's power…

00:16:56.892 --> 00:16:59.728
It's <i>your</i> power, isn't it?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.482
<i>Yes, that's right!</i>

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:07.528
<i>Children inherit Quirks</i>
<i>from their parents.</i>

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:13.116
<i>But the really important thing</i>
<i>is not that connection,</i>

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:14.617
<i>but recognizing your own flesh and blood…</i>

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:18.329
<i>recognizing yourself.</i>

00:17:18.914 --> 00:17:21.875
<i>That's what I mean when I say:</i>

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:24.877
<i>"I am here!"</i>

00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:26.547
<i>You see?</i>

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:27.631
LOOKING BACK AT THAT TIME

00:17:27.798 --> 00:17:31.134
But you want to be a hero, don't you?

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.388
It's okay for <i>you</i> to be one.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.350
<i>Before I knew it, I had forgotten…</i>

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.937
<i>You don't have to be a prisoner</i>
<i>of your blood.</i>

00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:45.607
<i>It's okay for you to become</i>

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.860
<i>who you want to be.</i>

00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:52.364
<i>This is…</i>

00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:54.366
The fire's here…

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.285
<i>In battle…</i>

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.829
<i>I will never use my left.</i>

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.206
He used it!

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.585
<i>You made him use his left side.</i>

00:18:05.127 --> 00:18:10.507
<i>Young Midoriya, don't tell me</i>
<i>you're trying to save Young Todoroki?</i>

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.886
Even though you want to win…

00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:16.680
Damn it…

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.601
To help your enemy…

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.605
Which one of us is screwing around now?

00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:31.695
I want to be a hero, too!

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.290
Shoto!

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.666
Huh?

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.294
Have you finally accepted yourself?

00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:49.171
That's it! Good!

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.798
It all starts from here for you!

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:55.093
With my blood, you will surpass me…

00:18:55.594 --> 00:18:58.639
You will fulfill my desire!

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:07.981
<i>Endeavor suddenly</i>
<i>shouts encouragement?</i>

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:09.358
<i>Such a doting father.</i>

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.403
Wow…

00:19:13.946 --> 00:19:15.739
Why are you smiling?

00:19:16.615 --> 00:19:18.325
With those injuries…

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:20.244
In this situation…

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.579
You're crazy.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:26.375
Don't blame me for what happens next.

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:38.428
Midnight!

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:40.430
If they keep going, it'll be bad.

00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:42.391
His body won't hold up!

00:19:47.646 --> 00:19:48.814
<i>Try to get close…</i>

00:19:49.815 --> 00:19:51.191
<i>and give him everything I've got!</i>

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.694
Come at me with your full power!

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.034
Midoriya…

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.998
Thanks.

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:14.715
Hey!

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:17.217
What the heck?

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.344
Man, seriously?

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.388
What happened?

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:44.745
Just because something is powerful
doesn't mean it's good,

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:46.955
but this is amazing…

00:20:47.456 --> 00:20:49.208
<i>What was that just now?</i>

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.543
<i>What the heck is up with your class?</i>

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:56.340
<i>The air that had been cooled thoroughly</i>
<i>was suddenly heated up and expanded.</i>

00:20:56.507 --> 00:20:58.717
<i>That's what created this explosion?</i>

00:20:58.884 --> 00:21:00.594
<i>Just how hot was that?</i>

00:21:01.178 --> 00:21:02.721
<i>Jeez, I can't see a thing!</i>

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.516
<i>Hey, who won the match?</i>

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:28.330
<i>Midoriya is out of bounds…</i>

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.963
<i>Todoroki advances to the third round!</i>

00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:42.761
SHOTO TODOROKI: ORIGIN

00:23:12.935 --> 00:23:14.770
PREVIEW

00:23:14.937 --> 00:23:18.232
<i>I am Tenya Iida,</i>
<i>the class representative of Class A,</i>

00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:19.733
<i>and I am responsible for the preview.</i>

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.902
<i>This is the same way</i>
<i>you started the preview before!</i>

00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:26.114
<i>Midoriya, I swear that I will win</i>
<i>and advance for you, too!</i>

00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:27.658
<i>Yeah, I'm sure you can do it, Iida!</i>

00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:32.371
<i>Yes, now that I have come this far,</i>
<i>I must become number one and tell Tensei.</i>

00:23:32.538 --> 00:23:34.248
<i>Next time, "Fight on, Iida"!</i>

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.625
<i>Hello, Mother? What happened to Tensei?</i>

00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:38.752
<i>What in the world happened</i>
<i>to my brother, Tensei?</i>

00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:40.337
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.504 --> 00:23:42.047
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
