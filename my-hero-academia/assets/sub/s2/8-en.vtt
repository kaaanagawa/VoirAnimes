00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.296
<i>The world has become a superhuman society,</i>

00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:08.132
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>In this world swirling with chaos,</i>

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.180
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.182
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:19.478
<i>Heroes of justice fighting villains</i>
<i>and saving people from distress.</i>

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:26.777
<i>Yes, this is the story of how I became</i>
<i>the greatest hero.</i>

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.874
<i>Everybody, sorry for the long wait!</i>

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.752
<i>The stage</i>
<i>that was frozen in the second match</i>

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.378
<i>is finally dry, so on to the next match!</i>

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.925
<i>The assassin from Class B!</i>

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.219
<i>Pretty things have thorns, you know!</i>

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.180
<i>From the hero course, it's Ibara Shiozaki!</i>

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:19.765
<i>Versus…</i>

00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:21.558
<i>Sparking Killing Boy!</i>

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.853
<i>From the hero course, it's Denki Kaminari!</i>

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.107
BATTLE ON, CHALLENGERS!

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:35.697
Now, we'll have a super
flashy battle this time too--

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:36.823
Um…

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.825
Please excuse the interruption.

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.787
What do you mean by "assassin"?

00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:45.832
I have only come to find victory,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.127
not to take my opponent's life.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:50.337
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:56.760
In the first place, I wished to enter
U.A. High School not for wicked reasons,

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:00.180
but for the salvation of others…

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.682
<i>I said, I'm sorry!</i>

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.767
<i>My bad, okay?</i>

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.271
I thank you for your understanding.

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.191
Class B has people like this in it,
too, huh?

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.987
<i>She's got big eyes and a pretty face,</i>

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.031
<i>but it looks like she's really strong.</i>

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.410
<i>I've gotta discharge</i>
<i>all my electricity here, huh?</i>

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:22.828
<i>Actually,</i>

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:27.082
<i>she's pretty,</i>
<i>but she's also kinda cute…</i>

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:30.377
<i>I've gotta ask her out sometime, huh?</i>

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:32.546
<i>All right!</i>

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.465
<i>Anyway, start!</i>

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:38.135
When this is over,
wanna grab a bite to eat?

00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:39.887
I'll comfort you if you'll have me.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.890
'Cause this match

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.809
will probably be over in a second!

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.274
Indiscriminate Shock…

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.860
1.3 Million Volts!

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.755
<i>It was decided in an instant!</i>
<i>I'll say it once more! An instant!</i>

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:18.091
<i>Shiozaki advances to the second round!</i>

00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:26.475
Oh, I was able to make the most
of the opportunity I was given.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:31.146
<i>Ibara Shiozaki. Quirk: Vines!</i>

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:33.357
<i>The vines on her head are extendable!</i>

00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:35.192
<i>They're detachable, too!</i>

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.611
<i>As long as she makes sure</i>
<i>to get plenty of water and sunlight,</i>

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:38.904
<i>they'll grow in almost immediately.</i>

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:40.864
<i>In other words, she can't go bald!</i>

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.324
All right!

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:44.409
Good job, Shiozaki!

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.161
Man…

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.871
What's that?

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.165
Didn't he say he'd settle this
in a second?

00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:53.377
That's strange, he was
<i>defeated</i> in a second, wasn't he?

00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:56.922
Class A is supposed to be better
than Class B, so isn't that weird?

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:02.636
Sorry!

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.305
<i>What was that just now?</i>

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.724
Kamui!

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:12.312
Wouldn't she be good as a sidekick?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.315
Yeah.
I wish I could've gotten a better look.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.360
She seems straight-laced, but she's cute!

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.070
Hey, get back to work.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.992
<i>It was hard to deal with Shiozaki's</i>
<i>ability to detach her vines, huh?</i>

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.995
The vines were able not only to defend
but also to act as an electrical ground.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.080
There was no way he'd shock her with that.

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:33.000
And then she extended her vines
to bind him.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.294
Kaminari's Quirk was completely blocked.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.045
Some Quirks
don't work well against others,

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.507
but it would've been better
if he'd been able to deal with it…

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:45.262
Kaminari's Quirk is supposed to be strong,

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:47.764
but Shiozaki is a strong opponent
who placed fourth in the entrance exam.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.767
Vines, huh? I wonder
if it's like Kamui Woods's Quirk.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:54.646
Binding types really are strong.
I hardly ever see anyone break out.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.192
It'd be impossible to get close
while avoiding all those vines,

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.445
so you'd either have to tear them off
or get through with brute force…

00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:03.780
Oh, but in order to keep you
from doing that,

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.449
she'd go after your hands first…

00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:06.533
Umm…

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.329
You just finished, but you're already
thinking about countermeasures, huh?

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.333
Oh, no! It's just, I mean,
this is pretty much my hobby…

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.001
It's not every day

00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:18.504
I get a chance to see amazing Quirks
outside of those in our class…

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:24.551
Oh, right! I've been putting these
together for everyone in Class A, too.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.595
For your Zero Gravity, too!

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:31.642
Deku, you've been amazing since I met you,

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:36.355
but the sports festival is making me
think that you're amazing all over again.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.609
<i>Now, it's time for the fourth match!</i>

00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:42.528
<i>We're just gonna keep rolling along!</i>

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:45.197
Rush headlong toward the top!

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.618
<i>It's like he's the epitome</i>
<i>of the middle of the pack!</i>

00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:52.454
<i>From the hero course, it's Tenya Iida!</i>
<i>Versus…</i>

00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:54.915
<i>Fully-equipped with support items!</i>

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.459
<i>From the support course, it's Mei Hatsume!</i>

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.628
He's up against the support course, huh?

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.047
I wonder what kind of fight it'll be?

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.466
I mean, what <i>is</i> that?

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.346
Iida's also fully-equipped
with support items!

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.850
<i>That's generally against the rules</i>
<i>for those in the hero course.</i>

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:16.228
<i>Those who must use equipment</i>
<i>needed to petition beforehand.</i>

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.564
I forgot about that!

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.441
Aoyama also wore a belt,
so I thought it was fine!

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.944
<i>He submitted a petition.</i>

00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:25.571
I humbly apologize!

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:31.285
However, my heart was moved
by my opponent's sportsmanship.

00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:34.121
<i>Even though</i>
<i>she is from the support course,</i>

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:36.415
<i>she said she wanted an even</i>
<i>match since she made it this far.</i>

00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:38.041
<i>She said she wanted to fight fairly.</i>

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.003
So, she gave me this equipment!

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:43.922
I did not think

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:47.301
I could ignore her fighting spirit!

00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:48.802
Oh, youth!

00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:52.306
<i>I'll allow it!</i>

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.348
<i>So it's fine?</i>

00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:58.854
Well, if they both agree on it,
then it's within regulations… I guess?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.065
<i>Is Hatsume someone who'd say that?</i>

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:04.067
<i>Could it be…</i>

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:10.782
<i>Well, since permission's been granted,</i>
<i>let's start the fourth match!</i>

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:20.584
<i>Isn't that acceleration wonderful, Iida?</i>

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.128
A mic?

00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:25.881
-Why?
-She's wearing speakers?

00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:28.717
<i>Don't your legs feel lighter than usual?</i>

00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:30.511
<i>That's only to be expected!</i>

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:34.306
<i>Those leg parts are helping</i>
<i>the wearer's movements along!</i>

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:36.475
<i>And I…</i>

00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:40.479
<i>can evade easily</i>
<i>with my hydraulic attachments!</i>

00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:45.025
The support companies are sitting…

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:49.196
Oh, they're biting! I've got 'em!

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.699
<i>Mei Hatsume. Quirk: Zoom.</i>

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.494
<i>If she gets serious, she can see</i>
<i>clearly up to five kilometer's away!</i>

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.831
<i>Since I've got sensors in every direction,</i>

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:02.251
<i>I can even deal with attacks from behind!</i>

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.218
What are you planning?

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:14.054
<i>Iida changed course adeptly!</i>

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.850
<i>It's thanks</i>
<i>to the auto-balancer that I made!</i>

00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:19.977
What is this?

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.604
She's very good at hard selling…

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.315
<i>…so there's no need</i>
<i>to worry about time lag!</i>

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:30.028
<i>The auto-balancer is equipped</i>
<i>with a 32-axis gyro sensor!</i>

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:35.075
<i>It will be sure to keep the wearer</i>
<i>from falling unless the wearer wants to!</i>

00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:39.162
Weren't you going to fight fairly?

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:48.505
<i>What do you think of this lightness?</i>

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:51.717
<i>These electro shoes use</i>
<i>electromagnetic induction on both feet</i>

00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:55.262
<i>to allow for instant evasive action!</i>

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.183
I'll get her when she lands!

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.315
What's this?

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.734
<i>A capture gun to use against villains.</i>

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:13.363
<i>The capture nets are in cartridges, and</i>
<i>you can fire up to five before reloading!</i>

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:17.117
Who developed all of these items?

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:20.120
<i>It was me, Mei Hatsume!</i>

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:22.289
<i>Everyone from the support companies,</i>

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:29.004
<i>the choice is clear:</i>
<i>Mei Hatsume, Mei Hatsume, Mei Hatsume!</i>

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:30.839
What is she, a politician?

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.884
<i>And now, I will talk</i>
<i>about the next support item!</i>

00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:35.677
There's still more?

00:10:36.178 --> 00:10:38.013
TEN MINUTES LATER

00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:45.979
I've presented each
and every last one of them.

00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:48.815
I have nothing left to say!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.693
THE END

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.238
<i>Hatsume is out of bounds.</i>

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.406
<i>Iida advances to the second round!</i>

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.159
You tricked me!

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.957
I'm sorry. I used you.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.750
I hate you!

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:09.169
Iida's earnest,
so she probably said some things

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.797
that sounded good to get him on board.

00:11:11.964 --> 00:11:14.258
Hatsume's not just honest,

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.094
she will also use any means
to reach her goal.

00:11:17.553 --> 00:11:18.887
Amazing…

00:11:25.227 --> 00:11:28.021
<i>We're gonna keep right on going</i>
<i>with the fifth match!</i>

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.983
<i>Even though he's wearing a belt,</i>
<i>he won't transform!</i>

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.819
<i>From the hero course, it's Yuga Aoyama!</i>

00:11:33.986 --> 00:11:34.987
Bonjour.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.238
<i>Versus…</i>

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:39.074
<i>Is something going to come out</i>
<i>of those horns? Well?</i>

00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:41.577
<i>From the hero course, it's Mina Ashido!</i>

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.122
My first match is a piece of cake!

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:48.292
I'll return those words right back at you.

00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:50.460
Mina, you can do it!

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.671
Aoyama, get her!

00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:56.550
Beat her like in those fighting games
where their clothes get ripped off!

00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:57.676
What are you, scum?

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.679
A match between Aoyama and Ashido.

00:12:00.846 --> 00:12:02.806
Considering their Quirks…

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.810
Aoyama will probably attack
from a distance with his laser.

00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:10.355
So the match will be decided
by how well Ashido can slip

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:13.483
through Aoyama's attacks
and turn it into a close combat match.

00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.945
But there's nothing
to use as cover on the stage,

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.822
so Ashido might be
at a slight disadvantage.

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.283
Now, why don't we get moving?

00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:24.036
<i>Fifth match, start!</i>

00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:25.871
The early bird gets the worm!

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.456
Whoops!

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.877
Since we were on the same team
for combat training,

00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:34.046
I know all about your Quirk!

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.423
Same goes for me!

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.884
There's just one thing that's different.

00:12:39.051 --> 00:12:40.677
At the fitness test…

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:45.432
If I shoot for more than a second,
I get a stomachache.

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:46.934
That's what you said!

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:55.943
You're…

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:56.985
persistent!

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.325
My stomach…

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:04.743
Now!

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.165
Oh no, my precious belt!

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.000
And my pants!

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.712
I'll finish it…

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.589
with this!

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.517
<i>Aoyama has fainted!</i>

00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:31.270
<i>Ashido advances to the second round!</i>

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.191
Aoyama's knocked out!

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:40.445
<i>Ashido's easy victory is indisputable!</i>

00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:42.906
Mina's amazing!

00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:48.787
If only Aoyama and
Ashido's Quirks were switched…

00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:50.038
You're too much of a scumbag.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.500
Such a cruel world…

00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:56.712
The match unfolded as I expected,

00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:59.006
but I misjudged
Ashido's physical strength.

00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:02.718
Even during the Quirk assessment test,
she placed ninth out of everyone,

00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:03.927
including the boys.

00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:07.931
It wasn't because of her Quirk.
She's got excellent physical abilities.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:11.685
<i>Now, we've got no time to lose!</i>
<i>Let's move on to the sixth match!</i>

00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:14.188
Hey, I said get back to work!

00:14:14.605 --> 00:14:15.772
<i>Offense and defense in one body!</i>

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:18.734
<i>The dark samurai</i>
<i>accompanied by Dark Shadow!</i>

00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:21.403
<i>From the hero course,</i>
<i>it's Fumikage Tokoyami!</i>

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.487
<i>Versus…</i>

00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:24.698
<i>All-purpose Creation!</i>

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:28.076
<i>She was admitted through recommendations,</i>
<i>so her abilities are certified!</i>

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:31.163
<i>From the hero course, it's Momo Yaoyorozu!</i>

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.458
Midoriya, what do you think of this match?

00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:36.627
I think time will be the key.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:37.669
Time?

00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:40.923
<i>It's just as Mr. Present Mic says,</i>

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:44.176
<i>I'm up against Tokoyami with Dark Shadow,</i>
<i>offense and defense in one body.</i>

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.556
<i>In addition, Tokoyami can bring out</i>
<i>Dark Shadow with no time lag,</i>

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:52.434
<i>so there is no doubt he will start</i>
<i>with a preemptive strike.</i>

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.271
<i>If I create a simple shield</i>
<i>that doesn't take much time</i>

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.607
<i>and block Tokoyami's attack…</i>

00:14:58.774 --> 00:15:00.859
<i>If I just give myself enough</i>
<i>time to make a weapon--</i>

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:02.486
<i>Sixth match, start!</i>

00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:04.655
Go, Dark Shadow!

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:05.948
Got it!

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.324
<i>Quickly create a shield…</i>

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.161
Next, a weapon…

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:15.832
<i>I can't collect my thoughts!</i>

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.514
<i>His attacks have stopped?</i>

00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:31.849
<i>Now!</i>

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:33.934
<i>Yaoyorozu!</i>

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:34.977
<i>Out of bounds!</i>

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.401
<i>Tokoyami advances to the second round!</i>

00:15:45.988 --> 00:15:47.239
<i>An overwhelming victory!</i>

00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:48.740
<i>A completely overwhelming victory!</i>

00:15:49.241 --> 00:15:53.745
<i>Tokoyami's Dark Shadow!</i>
<i>Could it be the greatest Quirk ever?</i>

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.498
No…

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:59.251
I couldn't do anything…

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:01.628
Nothing…

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.048
Tokoyami's too amazing.

00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:07.301
I can't believe
he forced her out of bounds

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:11.263
just by focusing his attacks
on the shield Yaoyozoru made.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.099
He was trying not to hurt her?

00:16:15.184 --> 00:16:17.477
That's how easy it was for him, huh?

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.522
She must feel really frustrated.

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:26.695
<i>Okay, let's move on!</i>

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:28.447
<i>Next up…</i>

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.744
<i>The seventh match is a match-up</i>
<i>between redundant Quirks!</i>

00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:37.289
<i>Manly and passionate steel!</i>

00:16:37.456 --> 00:16:39.625
<i>From the hero course,</i>
<i>it's Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu!</i>

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.210
All right!

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.419
<i>Versus…</i>

00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:45.255
<i>Manly and passionate hardening!</i>

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:47.591
<i>From the hero course,</i>
<i>it's Eijiro Kirishima!</i>

00:16:47.758 --> 00:16:49.885
Even our intros are the same?

00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:52.095
Go, Tetsutetsu!

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.722
Win like Ibara did!

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.684
Get a hold of yourself.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.397
<i>Let's start this passionate seventh match!</i>

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:16.078
PLAYER WAITING ROOM 2

00:17:17.663 --> 00:17:19.498
Good work, Iida.

00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:20.958
Oh, Urarak--

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:24.086
You're not like yourself at all!
Your brow's all wrinkled!

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.127
My brow?

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:30.050
Oh, it's just my nerves…
Must've reached my brow.

00:17:30.926 --> 00:17:32.135
I see…

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:35.347
<i>You're up against that Bakugo, after all.</i>

00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:38.225
Yeah, I'm really scared.

00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:42.437
But you know, after seeing
a match like yours, Iida…

00:17:42.813 --> 00:17:44.022
Like mine?

00:17:45.524 --> 00:17:46.400
Uraraka!

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:48.443
Deku!

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.613
Huh? You don't want
to watch the others' matches?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:57.828
Most ended quickly, and now Kirishima
is up against someone from Class B.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.420
That didn't hurt at all!

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:13.427
That didn't hurt, either!

00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:17.890
Then, next…

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.184
Soon…

00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:22.019
But, well,

00:18:22.186 --> 00:18:25.772
I don't think even Bakugo would use
a full-strength explosion on a girl.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:26.940
He would.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:31.987
Everyone's trying to become number one
to make their dreams come true.

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:36.575
<i>Even if it's not Kacchan,</i>
<i>no one would think about holding back.</i>

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.038
You've helped me so much, Uraraka.

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:44.666
That's why I thought maybe
I could help you a little.

00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:48.754
A plan to use your Quirk against Kacchan…

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:51.507
It's rough, but I came up with something.

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:55.135
Oh, isn't that great, Uraraka?

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:57.262
Thanks, Deku.

00:18:59.348 --> 00:19:00.891
But, it's fine.

00:19:02.935 --> 00:19:04.728
You're amazing, Deku.

00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:06.980
I keep seeing more
and more amazing sides to you.

00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:08.565
<i>During the cavalry battle,</i>

00:19:09.066 --> 00:19:12.069
<i>I thought it'd be easier</i>
<i>to team up with friends,</i>

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:16.657
<i>but now that I think about it,</i>
<i>I might've been trying to rely on you.</i>

00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:21.119
That's why,
when Iida said he'd challenge you,

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:24.039
it actually made me feel
a little embarrassed.

00:19:25.082 --> 00:19:26.333
Uraraka…

00:19:28.544 --> 00:19:31.296
That's why it's fine.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.760
Everyone's facing the future
and trying their hardest.

00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:41.265
That means we're all rivals, right?

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:43.183
That's why…

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:47.938
Let's meet in the finals!

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:09.793
<i>The two guys with the same Quirks!</i>
<i>Tetsutetsu versus Kirishima!</i>

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:12.212
<i>A head-to-head fistfight!</i>

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.089
<i>The winner is…</i>

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.429
<i>Both contestants down! It's a draw!</i>

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:24.099
<i>In the case of a draw, after they recover,</i>

00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:26.935
<i>the winner will be determined by</i>
<i>a simple contest, like arm wrestling.</i>

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.771
Their ability was the same, too?

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:32.482
I like passionate guys like that.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:35.485
They're inspiring.
I'd like a sidekick like that.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.655
<i>While we wait for Tetsutetsu</i>
<i>and Kirishima to recover,</i>

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:40.949
<i>we'll start the next match!</i>

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.535
KATSUKI BAKUGO - OCHACO URARAKA

00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:52.211
Next might be
the most disturbing match-up.

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:54.880
I almost don't want to watch…

00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:01.094
<i>Uraraka…</i>

00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:03.764
<i>Do your best!</i>

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:09.394
<i>The eighth</i>
<i>and last match of the first round!</i>

00:21:10.062 --> 00:21:12.564
<i>He was kind of famous in middle school!</i>

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.399
<i>This isn't the face of a regular person!</i>

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:17.402
<i>From the hero course, it's Katsuki Bakugo!</i>

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.196
<i>Versus…</i>

00:21:19.363 --> 00:21:21.073
<i>She's the one I'm rooting for!</i>

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.743
<i>From the hero course, it's Ochaco Uraraka!</i>

00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:40.509
<i>Eighth match, start!</i>

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:17.481
<i>Oh, this is, you know, the preview…</i>

00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:20.275
<i>Uraraka, there's no spirit in your words.</i>

00:23:20.442 --> 00:23:22.361
<i>But I guess that makes sense,</i>
<i>since your first match is against Kacchan.</i>

00:23:22.528 --> 00:23:24.154
<i>But I'll do it.</i>

00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:27.783
<i>In order to become a hero</i>
<i>and let my parents take it easy!</i>

00:23:28.325 --> 00:23:30.285
<i>Deku, let's meet in the finals!</i>

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:32.371
<i>Yeah, good luck, Uraraka!</i>

00:23:32.538 --> 00:23:35.165
<i>Next time, "Bakugo vs. Uraraka"!</i>

00:23:35.332 --> 00:23:38.418
<i>The meteor shower falling from</i>
<i>the sky will be the path to victory!</i>

00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:40.128
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:42.506
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
