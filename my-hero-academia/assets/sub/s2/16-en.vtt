00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.295
<i>We'll pass Hosu City…</i>

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:06.965
<i>I wonder how Iida's doing…</i>

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:19.102
-Nomu!
-Kid, sit down!

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.983
Grand Torino!

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.506
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:50.008
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.679
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:55.347
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.452
Everyone, please calm down!

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.370
Please return to your seats for now!

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:01.872
The villain is not here anymore.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.082
Please wait calmly for the heroes.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.125
Excuse me!

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.376
I'm getting out!

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:09.338
Hey, you! Wait, it's dangerous!

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.048
<i>They look different,</i>

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:13.217
<i>but there can't be that many</i>
<i>with their brains spilling out like that.</i>

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.554
<i>Could it be Nomu's brother? Why here?</i>

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.640
<i>I don't have time for any detours.</i>

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.558
<i>I need to show the fruits of my training…</i>

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.478
<i>One For All…</i>

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:25.896
<i>Full Cowling!</i>

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.151
<i>It's okay, I can do it!</i>

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.780
<i>Gran Torino,</i>

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:37.574
<i>please be okay!</i>

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:42.120
HERO KILLER: STAIN VS U.A. STUDENTS

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:46.250
It's a villain!

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.379
Where are the heroes?

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:57.803
How many years has it been
since I've fought in earnest?

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.097
I've gotten mixed up in something crazy!

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:01.932
I won't let you do whatever you want!

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:04.852
<i>He's fast! But…</i>

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.104
<i>Not faster than I can handle!</i>

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.314
Hey…

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.692
<i>He's attacking indiscriminately, huh?</i>

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.151
Stop it, you little…

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.994
I was looking for the hero killer,

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:23.996
but this guy's timing was bad…

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.749
I do not know who you are, honored elder…

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.336
but leave the rest to me.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.172
You're…

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:34.631
Seriously?

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:35.841
Why are you here?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.178
Isn't it obvious?

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.555
It's because I am a hero.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.520
<i>The center of the commotion</i>
<i>is where it started.</i>

00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:51.857
<i>But what's with this guy</i>
<i>that looks like Nomu?</i>

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.528
<i>If he's got crazy power</i>
<i>like the one at USJ…</i>

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.450
<i>It won't just be Gran Torino that'll</i>
<i>be in trouble… The whole city will be!</i>

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.204
<i>Iida, who's doing his internship here,</i>
<i>will be, too!</i>

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.998
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.833
<i>Think!</i>

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.543
<i>What would be the best thing to do?</i>

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.669
Tenya!

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:15.881
Tenya!

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:34.274
<i>Oh man…</i>

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:36.777
<i>What is this?</i>

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:44.701
Manual! Put out the fire!

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:45.869
Right!

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.539
<i>The voice from earlier! Normal Hero?</i>

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.207
<i>Where Iida went for his internship!</i>

00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:53.961
Why did you choose a time like
this to go off somewhere, Tenya!

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.506
<i>He went off somewhere?</i>

00:04:57.673 --> 00:04:58.924
<i>At a time like this?</i>

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.843
<i>That diligent Iida did?</i>

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.219
Hey, you're in the way!

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:03.262
Get back!

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.763
I'm sorry!

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:06.932
We'll hold him back here!

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.809
Follow the police's evacuation
instructions!

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.271
Where's Tenya?

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:17.067
<i>It's weird for Iida to go off with</i>
<i>such a major incident in front of him.</i>

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:19.653
<i>Hosu City…</i>

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:21.780
<i>Guys that look like Nomu…</i>

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.324
<i>Iida…</i>

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:25.742
<i>Hosu…</i>

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.953
<i>Hero Killer…</i>

00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:30.038
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.833
Damn it, what's with these guys?

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:35.252
What's with that power?

00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:38.672
The Fly!

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.094
Hey, what's the situation?

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:48.599
What are these monsters after?

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.395
Nomus really are great…

00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:56.440
You will not participate in the combat?

00:05:56.607 --> 00:05:58.901
Are you stupid? I'm injured.

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:01.987
That's why I brought those guys.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.825
Master, how many Nomus have you finished?

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.495
<i>They're not as strong</i>
<i>as the one from the USJ attack,</i>

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:13.332
<i>but I've finished verifying</i>
<i>the behavior of six.</i>

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.125
Give them to me.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:16.835
<i>Why?</i>

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:20.631
Because I don't like the hero killer.

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:24.843
I can destroy the things
I don't like, right,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.637
Master?

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.430
<i>Very well.</i>

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:30.807
<i>However, you may only have three.</i>

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.354
<i>You should use this</i>
<i>as a learning experience.</i>

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:42.361
Once the night is over,
the world will have forgotten about you,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.696
Hero Killer.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.367
A child wearing a suit…

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.370
Who are you?

00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:56.041
I am the younger brother
of the hero you attacked.

00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:59.795
The younger brother
of a most excellent older brother!

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.549
I have come to stop you in his place!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.345
<i>Will you take this name for me?</i>

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.641
Remember my name for as long as you live!

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:19.147
Ingenium. It is the name
of the hero who will defeat you!

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.525
I see.

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.026
Die.

00:07:24.403 --> 00:07:25.946
Like I would!

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.909
Ingenium. You're brothers, huh?

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:34.329
In order to let news of me spread…

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.664
I let him live.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.089
You're weak.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:51.013
You and your brother are both weak.

00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:52.973
Because you're fakes.

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.142
Shut up, villain!

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:59.646
He's paralyzed from the waist down
due to spinal cord damage!

00:08:00.898 --> 00:08:03.692
He can't work as a hero anymore!

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.946
<i>Tensei is an excellent hero</i>

00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:09.781
<i>who saved many people…</i>

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.576
<i>and led them until now…</i>

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.872
There's no reason for you to crush him.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.752
<i>Tensei, I am very proud of you.</i>

00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:26.048
You have become independent at a young
age, with many sidekicks who follow you.

00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:28.967
That is not an easy feat.

00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:33.013
It's not that they follow me, Dad.
It's the opposite.

00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:37.351
I can't do anything by myself,
yet, so they're supporting me.

00:08:37.643 --> 00:08:41.188
I need to work hard to return the favor,
too.

00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:45.400
I'm not that talented or anything,

00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:48.779
but I have to live up to the name of hero.

00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:54.201
I'm glad that my work helps many people.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.205
<i>He's my hero.</i>

00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:04.127
He was an excellent hero
who gave me a dream!

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.130
I won't forgive you.

00:09:07.631 --> 00:09:09.383
I'll kill you!

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.094
Save that guy first.

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:18.851
Reflect on yourself and save others.

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.603
Don't use your power for yourself.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:26.024
Being taken in by the hatred before you
and trying to fulfill your own desires…

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:29.528
That is the furthest
from what a hero should be.

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:35.576
That's why you'll die.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.124
<i>My body won't move…</i>

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:49.256
Goodbye. You're an offering
to a more just world.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.508
Shut up…

00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:56.805
If you admire me, Tenya,
then I might become an amazing hero.

00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:00.767
No matter what you say,

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.812
you are the criminal
who hurt my brother!

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.611
Smash!

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:15.490
Mi…

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.161
Midoriya?

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:24.082
I came to save you, Iida!

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:28.337
<i>I might be overthinking it.</i>

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.506
<i>I have absolutely no proof, either.</i>

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:34.635
<i>But that doesn't mean I can do nothing.</i>

00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:37.095
<i>In the city</i>
<i>where the hero killer appeared,</i>

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.681
<i>guys like Nomu are running wild.</i>

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.102
<i>In this city, there's probably</i>
<i>an unease that only I can imagine…</i>

00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:48.106
<i>That the League of Villains and</i>
<i>the hero killer are connected somehow!</i>

00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:50.317
<i>Does this mean</i>

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:54.404
<i>the hero killer</i>
<i>is also in this city right now?</i>

00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:57.491
<i>Since Iida wasn't at the fight earlier,</i>

00:10:57.658 --> 00:11:00.577
<i>that means</i>
<i>he probably found the hero killer!</i>

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:12.381
Bingo!

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.136
<i>That kid…</i>

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.098
<i>He's the one from Shigaraki's picture.</i>

00:11:22.224 --> 00:11:24.309
Midoriya, why?

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.061
They talked about it on TV.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:31.692
That 60% of the hero killer's victims
were found in places without many people.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.528
That's why I searched away
from the center of the commotion

00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:36.947
in the alleyways near Normal Hero Agency.

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:38.991
I searched them all one by one!

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.826
Can you move?

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.411
Let's get to a bigger street.

00:11:42.578 --> 00:11:44.288
We need help from the pros.

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:46.790
I can't… move my body…

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:49.459
Ever since he cut me…

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.920
I think it's his Quirk…

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:56.008
It's just as the commentators on TV
guessed!

00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:59.386
So cutting is how he activates his Quirk?

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.681
There's someone else here!

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:07.394
<i>If it'd just been Iida, I could've</i>
<i>carried him away on my shoulder…</i>

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:11.023
Midoriya… Don't get involved!

00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:14.234
This has nothing to do with you!

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.654
What are you saying?

00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:20.282
Your friend came to save you.

00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:23.202
That's a great line, isn't it?

00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:26.788
But I have a duty to kill him.

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.041
If we clash, of course,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.878
the weaker will be culled.

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:36.048
Now, what will you do?

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.927
The eyes of white-collar
criminals like you burn silently.

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:43.263
<i>He's different from the guys at USJ.</i>

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:46.016
<i>His eyes are those… of a killer.</i>

00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:52.231
YOUR LOCATION HAS BEEN SENT!

00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:57.402
<i>Even without any proof,</i>
<i>even if it was just a guess,</i>

00:12:57.653 --> 00:13:00.322
<i>I should've done whatever</i>
<i>I could to get a pro to come with me.</i>

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.116
<i>I'll protect the two who can't move</i>

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.410
<i>and stall for time by myself.</i>

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.163
<i>I'll try to drive the hero killer away</i>
<i>if I can!</i>

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.289
Stop it!

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.457
Run away!

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:13.877
I told you, didn't I?
It has nothing to do with you!

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:17.923
If you say that,
then heroes can't do anything!

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.969
There are a lot of things
I'd like to say,

00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:24.054
but I'll say them later.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.807
It's like what All Might said:

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.434
Meddling when you don't need to

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.520
is the essence of being a hero.

00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:43.031
Good.

00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:45.409
<i>Get close to him in one movement.</i>

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:48.537
<i>To shorten the distance between him</i>
<i>and an opponent with a long reach…</i>

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.664
<i>It was a good decision.</i>

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.541
No! If you get cut…

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:53.917
<i>Now then…</i>

00:13:57.129 --> 00:13:58.046
<i>He disappeared?</i>

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.673
<i>No…</i>

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.800
Five percent Detroit…

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.136
Smash!

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:08.932
<i>What's with that movement?</i>

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.269
<i>He's moving like Bakugo…</i>

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:13.896
<i>Did it work?</i>

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.522
<i>Full Cowling worked!</i>

00:14:16.565 --> 00:14:18.901
<i>I can fight!</i>

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:22.321
<i>Wh…</i>

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:23.947
<i>My body…</i>

00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:26.283
<i>Did he graze me?</i>

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.370
<i>Such a small graze</i>
<i>made me unable to move?</i>

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.335
<i>No…</i>

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:38.504
<i>I see… It's blood!</i>

00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:40.964
It wasn't powerful enough.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.842
It's not
that you saw through my movements.

00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:45.761
You left my field of vision

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:48.972
and maneuvered so that you would
definitely be able to bring me down…

00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:50.933
That was what your movements were like.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:55.062
People who are all talk
are a dime a dozen,

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:57.105
but you are worth letting live.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.608
You're different from these guys.

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:01.568
Damn it…

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:02.819
Stop it!

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.492
Stop it!

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:13.288
One after another…

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:16.291
There are a lot of people
getting in my way today.

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:21.171
Midoriya. You need to give
more details in times like this.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.632
You made me late.

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:26.009
Todoroki, you too?

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:27.970
Why are you here?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:31.014
And you're using your left side…

00:15:31.557 --> 00:15:33.976
Why? That's <i>my</i> line.

00:15:34.643 --> 00:15:36.728
It took me a few seconds
to figure out what you meant

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:40.899
since you sent just your location info.

00:15:41.233 --> 00:15:44.736
You're not really one
to send that for no reason.

00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:49.825
You meant that you were
in trouble and to call for help, right?

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:53.453
Don't worry. The pros
will also get here in a few minutes.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:55.664
That's hot!

00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:59.835
<i>Someone's time will be up soon, huh?</i>

00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:02.296
This is just like the information
about him implies.

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:07.509
I won't let you kill these guys,
Hero Killer.

00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:11.889
Todoroki, you can't let this guy
see your blood!

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:15.809
I think he controls his opponents'
actions by ingesting their blood orally.

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.352
That's how he got all of us!

00:16:17.603 --> 00:16:20.022
He sucks blood to keep people from moving.

00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:21.899
That's why he uses blades, huh?

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:24.193
I can keep my distance and…

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.235
<i>Shoot!</i>

00:16:26.195 --> 00:16:28.155
You have good friends,

00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:29.615
Ingenium!

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:33.911
<i>A sword?</i>

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.246
<i>He threw it at the same time as the knife…</i>

00:16:38.207 --> 00:16:39.082
<i>That was close!</i>

00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:43.045
<i>He's strong…</i>

00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:48.091
Why are you two…

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:49.676
Why…

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.386
Please, stop!

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:54.431
I've inherited my brother's name.

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:56.475
I have to do it…

00:16:57.059 --> 00:16:58.894
That guy's mine!

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:01.230
You inherited it? That's strange.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:06.944
The Ingenium I saw before
didn't have that look on his face, though.

00:17:08.237 --> 00:17:11.656
You've got a lot going on behind
the scenes in your family, too, huh?

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.076
Todoroki…

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:16.828
Huh?

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:23.877
To block your own view against
an opponent faster than you…

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.420
What a foolish plan.

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.047
I wonder about that.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.425
You're pretty good, too.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:31.927
Above you!

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.808
-Midoriya!
-I can move normally for some reason now!

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:39.935
A time limit?

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:43.188
No, that kid should've been
the last one he got.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:45.232
I can't move yet.

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:47.109
<i>Is this guy's blood type O?</i>

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.696
Get back, Midoriya!

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:56.368
He takes in a person's blood
to keep them from moving.

00:17:56.535 --> 00:17:58.412
Since I got free first…

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:00.122
I can think of three possible reasons.

00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:03.500
It could be less effective
with more people,

00:18:03.876 --> 00:18:06.545
the amount ingested could
affect how long it works,

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.589
or there could be a difference
in effectiveness

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.007
based on a person's blood type!

00:18:10.716 --> 00:18:13.844
Blood type? Mine is B…

00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.429
I'm type A…

00:18:15.888 --> 00:18:17.347
Blood type?

00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:20.434
That's correct.

00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:24.229
<i>Hero Killer: Stain.</i>
<i>Quirk: Bloodcurdle.</i>

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:25.814
<i>Just by tasting someone's blood,</i>

00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.525
<i>he can stop their movements</i>
<i>for up to eight minutes.</i>

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:30.569
<i>Type O, A, AB, and B.</i>

00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:32.946
<i>The amount of time he can stop them</i>
<i>goes in that order from least to most.</i>

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:36.325
I can't really do anything just
by knowing his Quirk, though.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.703
I wanted to hurry up
and carry those two out of here,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.165
but he can react so fast,
he can avoid ice and fire.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.958
I can't leave myself that open.

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.835
I think our best option

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:49.588
is to hold on by avoiding
close combat until the pros get here.

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:53.634
Todoroki,
you've already shed too much blood.

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:56.929
I'll distract him,
so you support me from behind!

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.641
That's a pretty big risk,

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:02.768
but yeah…

00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:05.812
The two of us will protect them!

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:08.774
Two against one, huh?

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.526
It won't be easy.

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:13.403
<i>Iida,</i>

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.782
<i>I've been worried about you</i>
<i>since your older brother was attacked,</i>

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:22.454
<i>because I know well the face of someone</i>
<i>who would act on pent-up resentment.</i>

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:29.169
<i>I also know just how narrow the field</i>
<i>of vision can get for someone like that.</i>

00:19:30.921 --> 00:19:36.009
<i>That day, I told her everything about</i>
<i>what had happened and about who I am now.</i>

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:42.516
<i>Mother cried and apologized, forgiving me</i>
<i>with a smile surprisingly quickly.</i>

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.396
<i>She said that for me to move forward</i>
<i>without anything holding me back</i>

00:19:47.646 --> 00:19:50.274
<i>would make her happy and be her salvation.</i>

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:53.569
<i>The old me would definitely</i>
<i>not have been able</i>

00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:58.782
<i>to choose my old man's agency</i>
<i>for the internship.</i>

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:03.036
<i>It's not that I've forgiven him,</i>
<i>and I have no intention of doing so.</i>

00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:07.499
<i>It was just so I could experience</i>
<i>the fact that he is the number two hero</i>

00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:09.084
<i>with my own eyes and body</i>

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.253
<i>and accept that.</i>

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.796
<i>Get ready.</i>

00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:14.339
We're going out.

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:16.466
Where? To do what?

00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:18.635
If this incident follows precedent,

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:21.138
then the hero killer
will appear in Hosu City again.

00:20:21.305 --> 00:20:23.807
We will go to Hosu for a time
on a business trip and work there.

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.602
Contact Hosu City immediately!

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:27.769
Yes, sir!

00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:31.148
<i>No matter what a scumbag he is,</i>

00:20:31.315 --> 00:20:34.568
<i>I had to appreciate</i>
<i>the judgment and instincts</i>

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:36.528
<i>of the man called the number two hero.</i>

00:20:37.613 --> 00:20:39.907
<i>Everything was so simple!</i>

00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:42.868
<i>But even though it was simple,</i>
<i>I didn't see it.</i>

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:46.580
It's <i>your</i> power, isn't it?

00:20:47.581 --> 00:20:48.874
<i>Just a few words…</i>

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.293
<i>Those few words…</i>

00:20:52.586 --> 00:20:54.713
Save that guy first.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.132
I came to save you, Iida!

00:20:57.883 --> 00:20:59.593
The two of us will protect them!

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.512
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.353
<i>This guy's movements are</i>
<i>completely different from before!</i>

00:21:10.354 --> 00:21:11.355
Midoriya!

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:13.732
Please stop…

00:21:15.192 --> 00:21:17.236
I'm… already…

00:21:18.612 --> 00:21:20.364
If you want us to stop, then stand up!

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.037
<i>The only words I can say to you are:</i>

00:21:30.082 --> 00:21:32.459
Look properly at what you want to be!

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:40.300
<i>Ingenium. It is the name</i>
<i>of the hero who will defeat you!</i>

00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:14.436
<i>Here's the preview!</i>

00:23:14.603 --> 00:23:15.687
<i>Run away, Midoriya!</i>

00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:17.147
<i>This has nothing to do with you!</i>

00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:20.234
<i>If you say that,</i>
<i>then heroes can't do anything!</i>

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.320
<i>Iida, I've been worried about you</i>
<i>since your older brother was attacked.</i>

00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:24.696
<i>It's like what All Might said…</i>

00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:29.159
<i>I also know just how narrow the field</i>
<i>of vision can get for someone like that.</i>

00:23:29.326 --> 00:23:30.827
<i>Meddling when you don't need to</i>

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.538
<i>is the essence of being a hero.</i>

00:23:32.704 --> 00:23:34.915
<i>I'm not qualified to be called a hero.</i>

00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:36.792
<i>But that doesn't mean I can give in.</i>

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:40.379
<i>If I give in, then Ingenium will die!</i>

00:23:40.963 --> 00:23:42.464
<i>Next time, "Climax."</i>
