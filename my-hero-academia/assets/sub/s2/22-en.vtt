WEBVTT

00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:06.423
<i>Team Asui and Tokoyami, practical exam.</i>

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.132
<i>Ready, go!</i>

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.554
I forgot to tell you…

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:17.935
We teachers are also trying
to crush you with everything we have.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.709
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.254
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.924
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:50.425
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.948
YAOYOROZU: RISING

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.994
Prepare your determination and resolve!

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.872
Go, Dark Shadow!

00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:05.042
Asui, I'm throwing you!

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.878
Tokoyami!

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.843
Good thing we figured this out beforehand.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.886
Yeah.

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:17.095
They're good!

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.640
An escape only those two could pull off!

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.100
Communication skills.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:26.355
In this society, it's a simple but
important skill for heroes to have.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.149
More than being able to pull off
the perfect team play

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.151
with a specific sidekick,

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:34.363
it's better to be able to achieve
a certain standard with anyone.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.991
Um, even though this is an exam,

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.827
each student is being made to deal
with their weakness on purpose, right?

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:41.870
That's right.

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.582
I wonder what Tokoyami
and Asui have to work on.

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:50.254
I can't imagine Mr. Ectoplasm's Quirk
being a bad match-up for theirs…

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.383
No, it is bad for Fumikage Tokoyami.

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.135
Why is that?

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.096
You'll see.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.100
You're avoiding a fight after all, huh?

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:04.309
However…

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.522
<i>Ectoplasm. Quirk: Clones!</i>

00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:10.691
<i>He produces ectoplasm from his mouth,</i>

00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:12.860
<i>which he turns into clones of himself</i>
<i>that he can put anywhere.</i>

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.738
<i>He can produce about 30 at once.</i>

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.533
<i>But apparently, after singing</i>
<i>two or three songs at karaoke,</i>

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.202
<i>he can produce about 36!</i>

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.370
Go!

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:34.798
Ribbit!

00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.466
Thanks!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.096
Dark Shadow!

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.479
They just keep coming.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:50.647
Indeed.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.567
<i>Fumikage Tokoyami's strength</i>
<i>is his quick attack</i>

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:57.404
<i>and range that lets him keep his distance.</i>

00:03:58.197 --> 00:04:02.159
But looking at it another way, he won't
hold up if something does get in close.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.536
Tokoyami had a weakness like that?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.787
So that's why he's up against

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.415
Ectoplasm with his many clones
that can appear unexpectedly.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.667
On the other hand, Tsuyu Asui…

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.754
<i>An excellent student</i>
<i>with no clear weaknesses.</i>

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.341
<i>Therefore, she must provide support</i>
<i>to her ally, who, as you said,</i>

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.928
<i>is powerful and has few weaknesses.</i>

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.433
Her ability to keep calm can provide
emotional support to others in a crisis.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.394
Emotional support…

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:35.609
<i>Now that I think about it, having Asui</i>
<i>there at USJ really helped a lot.</i>

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.238
<i>Do your best, Asui, Tokoyami.</i>

00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:44.201
That was the 28th one.

00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:47.120
Tokoyami, I can see the goal

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.457
and what is probably his real body.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.752
Good job getting past all the others.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.381
But what'll you do against <i>this</i>?

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.349
Giant Bite Detention!

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.476
Ribbit?

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:11.270
I can't put out clones now,

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:15.107
but as long as I can see you,
this one will be enough.

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.276
Dodge, Asui!

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:27.995
Only I can release my clones.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.372
Now, what will you do?

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.166
What an all-powerful Quirk.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.543
<i>I'm the same!</i>

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.462
Dark Shadow, you at least need
to get through the gate!

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.423
<i>Got it!</i>

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.054
<i>Bastard!</i>

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.810
He can't get through against
a pro head on, huh?

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:54.605
But if he can reach,
then we have a chance.

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.775
Have Dark Shadow take this, Tokoyami.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.819
"This"? What?

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.198
Don't look too closely.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.533
The teacher will notice.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.246
Besides, it's really gross…

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:16.752
Can you keep this up until time runs out?

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.423
What I want is the shine of heroes
who can do away with adversity.

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.133
Dark Shadow!

00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:27.971
Calm down. It's fine.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.850
Because Tokoyami and Dark Shadow

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:34.353
are strong!

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:51.286
If we became unable to move,
then this would be the only way to win,

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.497
so I swallowed them right away.

00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:56.583
I can take things in and out
of my stomach.

00:06:57.793 --> 00:06:59.044
I see.

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:01.547
He's been handcuffed!

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:02.965
They passed!

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:07.094
Dark Shadow and Frog! They were able
to use both Quirks well together!

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:08.762
Yeah, as expected!

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.892
<i>Team Asui and Tokoyami have passed!</i>

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.645
That was wonderfully clever.

00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:18.272
You deserve to be commended.

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:20.858
I am delighted.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.776
Ribbit, ribbit.

00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:24.903
It was all thanks to me, right?

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:29.116
Tokoyami and Asui have passed…

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.785
<i>Of course.</i>

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:39.418
THIRD MATCH
TEAM IIDA AND OJIRO VS POWER LOADER

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.003
We're running out of places to stand…

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.380
Did Mr. Power Loader do this?

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.465
What should we do, Class Rep?

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:48.385
The current topography gives
our opponent an advantage.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.513
In order to keep damage down
to a minimum and defeat him,

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.726
I think going to find a hero with a Quirk
advantageous against the opponent

00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:57.394
is the best choice.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.688
In other words, we should run, right?

00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:00.772
But…

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:04.860
there are pitfalls
all the way to the gate.

00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:08.614
And we don't know where
Mr. Power Loader will attack us from.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.532
Even so, we can do it.

00:08:10.908 --> 00:08:12.367
As long as we work together…

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.369
All right!

00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:15.871
Fusion!

00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:19.750
This is really embarrassing…

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:21.919
Here we go, Ojiro!

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.296
Reciproburst!

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.384
We're going faster than
the holes are forming.

00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:31.303
If we keep going like this--

00:08:32.596 --> 00:08:34.890
I wonder.

00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:36.475
Oh, no!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.188
We're gonna fall!

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:43.732
Find the best solution, Tenya!

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.945
Wrap your tail around my leg!

00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:55.953
Recipro Extend!

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.123
What the…

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.671
GOOD JOB!

00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:08.340
<i>Team Iida and Ojiro have passed!</i>

00:09:09.842 --> 00:09:11.218
Class Rep!

00:09:11.969 --> 00:09:16.306
It was kind of forceful,
but it didn't take long,

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:19.268
and you were quick-witted
enough to get your friend out

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.478
without getting injured yourself…

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:23.355
Not bad. You pass.

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:25.482
Thank you very much!

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.734
They're both amazing!

00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:31.613
I will once again walk on
the path to becoming a hero!

00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:34.366
<i>You're so cool, Iida!</i>

00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:36.827
<i>Also, I can't get out!</i>

00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:39.705
That's kind of uncool, though.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:41.874
FOURTH MATCH PRACTICAL EXAM AREA

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.125
It's our turn.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.626
Let's go.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:46.837
Yaoyorozu!

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:48.714
Are you nervous?

00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:50.215
No…

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:52.843
Well, considering who we're up against…

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.679
But I have an idea.

00:09:58.724 --> 00:10:02.186
<i>Team Todoroki and Yaoyorozu,</i>
<i>practical exam.</i>

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.604
<i>Ready, go!</i>

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.064
Yaoyorozu!

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:09.568
It doesn't matter what you make.
Just keep creating some small objects.

00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:13.071
When you can't make them anymore,
that means Mr. Aizawa is close.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.657
Here I go again!

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.869
<i>U.A. High Class 1-A</i>
<i>homeroom teacher, Shota Aizawa!</i>

00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:20.913
<i>He can erase the Quirks</i>
<i>of those he sees.</i>

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.414
<i>That effect is removed</i>
<i>when he blinks!</i>

00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:26.043
This exam will depend
on who finds the other first.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.128
Once we can see him, I'll draw him to me.

00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:31.423
Then, you should run to the escape gate.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.008
Stay with me until then.

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.888
What's wrong? Hurry up
and make something.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.433
Right… Okay.

00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:48.649
Yaoyorozu, I said to make
something, but what're those?

00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:50.859
Russian matryoshka dolls.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:52.694
I see.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:56.281
Well, let me know if you notice
anything strange with your Quirk.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.411
I expect nothing less from you, Todoroki.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:02.454
About what?

00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:06.416
You were able to come up with a plan
to use against Mr. Aizawa so quickly,

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.545
and you were able to determine
what would be best at once.

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:10.754
It's nothing special.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.508
Nothing special?

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:18.512
As students who got into U.A.
through recommendations,

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:21.139
we started from the same place,

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.517
but in terms of the practical skills
a hero needs,

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:26.937
I haven't done anything that stands out.

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:30.607
<i>During the cavalry battle,</i>
<i>I just did what you said.</i>

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.987
In my own fight, I lost before
I could do anything against Tokoyami.

00:11:37.823 --> 00:11:39.908
Yaoyorozu, your matryoshkas…

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.494
-He's coming!
-Sorry--

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.163
If you realize that, then you
should immediately start acting!

00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:48.166
In this case,
you should prioritize evasion

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.419
since I stole a march on you.

00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:52.296
Yaoyorozu, go!

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.300
Is that what your plan was?

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.970
Then, this is perfect.

00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:03.974
Either way, I'd been planning to catch
you first since you're the offense.

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.685
You think you've caught me?

00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:09.188
I can burn or freeze
these restraints in an instant…

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.982
I don't care which you do.
Just be careful of where you fall.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.234
Caltrops?

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:16.028
What are you, a ninja?

00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:18.238
Coming up with such
an unpleasant countermeasure…

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:21.283
It's different from
the time with the hero killer.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.744
I know the Quirks
and numbers of the heroes.

00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:26.580
I'm perfectly prepared to intercept you.

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.667
Your plan places the burden
pretty heavily on yourself.

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:34.004
It's nice to try
and be considerate to the girl,

00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:36.757
but maybe
you should've talked it over more.

00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:41.428
<i>Talked it over?</i>

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.975
<i>How much farther until the escape gate?</i>

00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:48.560
<i>Is there a shorter route?</i>

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.479
<i>Is Todoroki all right?</i>

00:12:50.646 --> 00:12:51.647
<i>Is this okay?</i>

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.650
<i>Should I make something to help me</i>
<i>go faster at the expense of time?</i>

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:55.901
<i>Is this okay?</i>

00:12:56.068 --> 00:12:57.736
<i>Will I be able to get out like this?</i>

00:12:57.903 --> 00:13:00.030
<i>Where am I running?</i>

00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:01.281
<i>No…. Why?</i>

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:03.492
<i>Is this plan… really okay?</i>

00:13:06.537 --> 00:13:09.665
<i>Ever since the sports festival,</i>
<i>she'd obviously lost confidence.</i>

00:13:10.374 --> 00:13:11.500
<i>Mr. Aizawa!</i>

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:13.001
<i>Then, does that mean Todoroki's…</i>

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.589
-Shoo--
-I'm gonna hit you where it hurts.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.049
Let's see who can get in more hits.

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:22.386
<i>Against a teacher,</i>
<i>I don't have a chance…</i>

00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:24.847
<i>What? My Quirk's not erased?</i>

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:26.682
Creation!

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.226
<i>I'm sorry, Todoroki!</i>

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.103
<i>Going in the opposite direction?</i>

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:33.480
<i>She's left all the decision-making to him.</i>

00:13:34.523 --> 00:13:39.152
<i>Comparing herself to Todoroki,</i>
<i>she's decided that he's better than her.</i>

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:42.906
<i>Watching Todoroki, who for better</i>
<i>or for worse doesn't hesitate much,</i>

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:47.494
<i>she's become unable to have confidence</i>
<i>in her own thinking, huh?</i>

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.998
<i>Emotionally, she's still a child of 15.</i>

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.833
<i>I'd like to help her</i>
<i>regain her confidence,</i>

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.878
<i>but that's not my job right now.</i>

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.717
<i>…maybe</i>
<i>you should've talked it over more.</i>

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:05.762
<i>Now that I think about it, it looked</i>
<i>like she wanted to say something.</i>

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:10.350
Todoroki!

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:11.435
Yaoyorozu!

00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:13.854
I'm sorry, I couldn't--

00:14:14.605 --> 00:14:16.899
Hey, Mr. Aizawa's coming!

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:21.528
<i>Should I save Todoroki?</i>
<i>Or run?</i>

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:22.905
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:24.781
<i>What should I…</i>

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:25.949
Yaoyorozu!

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.159
You've got a plan, right?

00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:29.953
Sorry, I should've asked earlier

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.705
if the plan was okay.

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:33.373
You have an idea, right?

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:38.545
But your plan didn't work,
so how could my idea…

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.255
It's fine, just spit it out!

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:43.050
I'm saying that you're the one
more suited to this stuff!

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:47.137
When we were voting for class rep,
you had two votes, right?

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:49.848
<i>One of those votes was mine!</i>

00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:53.268
Because I thought you'd be good at it!

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.402
<i>Disgraceful… So disgraceful!</i>

00:15:03.362 --> 00:15:04.446
Are you done?

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:06.323
But…

00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:08.784
Todoroki, close your eyes!

00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:10.494
What are these?

00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:15.082
<i>Flash grenades?</i>

00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:17.084
I do have an idea, Todoroki!

00:15:17.793 --> 00:15:19.086
I have a plan!

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:24.842
A special operation
just to beat Mr. Aizawa!

00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.179
A special operation?

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:33.141
Yes. I was actually thinking
about this from the beginning!

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:35.435
Just tell me already.

00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:39.606
<i>The aftereffects of USJ…</i>

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:43.151
<i>A decrease in time I can use my Quirk,</i>
<i>and an increased interval between uses.</i>

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:46.530
Well, if she's attacking because
she noticed that, then she's pretty good.

00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:47.573
Yaoyorozu!

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.032
Fire…

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.201
It's been erased, huh?

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:54.288
Todoroki, let's hide! Together!

00:15:54.872 --> 00:15:57.958
Mr. Aizawa's eyes
have become a bit unstable.

00:15:58.584 --> 00:16:00.210
Because of his injuries at USJ?

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:01.795
So, we're going to exploit that?

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:05.132
No, for now, we must get
out of his field of vision.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.886
It's just a matter of time… We can win!

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:10.637
Time…

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.764
Get out of his field of vision?

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.559
Can we do it?
We can't use our Quirks, you know.

00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:17.728
Do as I tell you!

00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:20.898
Keep checking if you can use your ice!

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.733
I'm gonna catch you!

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.529
Thinking that we can't use our Quirks
is a bad assumption to make.

00:16:28.197 --> 00:16:30.699
There will definitely be
a single moment…

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:35.370
an interval of time when Mr. Aizawa
blinks before he can look at us again!

00:16:36.455 --> 00:16:37.331
Here it is!

00:16:37.873 --> 00:16:40.417
You can pull it off in that moment, right?

00:16:40.584 --> 00:16:43.003
That giant ice wall you showed
us at the sports festival!

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.671
Todoroki's biggest move!

00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:49.426
<i>They were waiting for this.</i>

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:53.555
<i>Yeah, you've got to get</i>
<i>your opponent where it hurts!</i>

00:16:54.932 --> 00:16:58.018
I blocked him with the wall
the moment my Quirk came back.

00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.561
Now we can use our Quirks.

00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:02.397
Tell me the rest of the plan while we…

00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:07.236
Mr. Aizawa's weapon?

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:08.278
Yes.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.781
I don't know what it's made of
or the details of how it's made,

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:14.117
so it's not exactly the same,

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:17.788
but I made my own version with
a certain material woven into it.

00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:20.290
Since this is a residential area,

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:22.291
we must keep the damage to a minimum.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.837
And he moves quickly with those
restraining bonds,

00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:27.005
making him hard to catch…

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.050
This is my plan.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.846
Why isn't Mr. Aizawa going after them?

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:36.098
He might've overused his eyes.

00:17:38.642 --> 00:17:40.060
What do you think, Todoroki?

00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:43.146
I believe this has a higher chance
of succeeding

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.065
than trying to escape from Mr. Aizawa.

00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:49.278
It will be decided in an instant.

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:51.864
Is this all right?

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:55.492
Yeah. No complaints here.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.454
The escape gate is behind me.

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:03.500
So it'll be better to watch their approach
carefully than to try and chase them.

00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:05.502
<i>I have a plan!</i>

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.629
<i>A special operation!</i>

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.339
Jeez…

00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:13.427
Cloth, huh?

00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:15.470
It's true that if I can't see them,
I can't erase their Quirks.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.015
But there are a lot
of disadvantages to that, too!

00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:22.603
Their upper bodies were mannequins?

00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:24.730
<i>There's just one thing to do!</i>

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.774
<i>A catapult!</i>

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:31.486
<i>A diversion?</i>

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:32.571
Todoroki!

00:18:32.738 --> 00:18:33.947
Blast your flames low!

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:39.119
<i>He's not aiming for me?</i>
<i>What are they…</i>

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:45.417
<i>I don't know if we can beat</i>
<i>Mr. Aizawa in a battle of Quirks…</i>

00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:46.710
<i>That's why…</i>

00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:50.881
Have you heard of nitinol alloy?

00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:54.801
When heated, it returns
to its original shape in an instant.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.388
It's a shape memory alloy!

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:04.436
That's impressive.

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:11.860
It went exactly according to your plan,
but didn't it go a little too smoothly?

00:19:13.237 --> 00:19:15.155
Honestly, it is inexplicable.

00:19:15.906 --> 00:19:18.283
When I was about to launch the catapult,

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.077
I made a mistake…

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:23.664
<i>Mr. Aizawa noticed but still jumped away,</i>

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.875
even though he could have
stopped it in that opening.

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:32.089
It looked like he was allowing himself
to be taken in by my plan on purpose.

00:19:32.256 --> 00:19:34.716
I was just being careful
of Todoroki next to you.

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:39.179
I could see you, but Todoroki
had a cloth over him.

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:40.973
I thought he'd freeze me.

00:19:41.974 --> 00:19:44.643
So I backed off, thinking that
was the best course of action,

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.688
and then played right into your hands.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:52.442
It really was only a matter of time,
like you said…

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.403
Thanks.

00:19:59.825 --> 00:20:01.577
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.246
It's nothing!

00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:06.290
If you feel nauseous, there's a pressure
point on the instep of your foot…

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.125
I said, it's nothing!

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.587
Oh my…

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:14.298
When all's said and done,
that man's a softie.

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:20.596
<i>Team Todoroki and Yaoyorozu have passed!</i>

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.231
<i>The fifth match,</i>

00:21:54.857 --> 00:21:58.861
<i>the exam with Team Uraraka</i>
<i>and Aoyama against Thirteen,</i>

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:00.529
<i>is in its final stages…</i>

00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:04.241
We were so close!

00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:07.077
Oh, no, I won't let you get away!

00:22:07.244 --> 00:22:09.872
Thirteen's getting closer
while sucking us up!

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:13.959
I'm not good at combat, but I have
distinct views about captures!

00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:18.797
Escaping from Thirteen's
Black Hole is next to impossible.

00:22:18.964 --> 00:22:19.840
Yeah.

00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:22.217
<i>They need a plan to break out…</i>

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.305
This Quirk just never stops sucking, huh?

00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:27.848
Are you trying to be funny?

00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:29.766
We're in trouble here!

00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:32.144
-You know, my costume…
-Huh?

00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:34.313
It transmits from my navel…

00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:35.355
Which means…

00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:38.942
we're not in trouble or anything!

00:22:39.109 --> 00:22:41.195
I'll suck up light, too!

00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:44.281
I'll break it down at a molecular level!

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.408
This isn't a joke!

00:22:46.575 --> 00:22:48.243
What is up with you, Aoyama?

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.286
I'm just me.

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.497
<i>This isn't good. We'll get caught!</i>
<i>Think!</i>

00:22:52.664 --> 00:22:54.124
<i>Think about how to get out of this!</i>

00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:55.751
<i>Think!</i>

00:22:55.918 --> 00:22:58.295
<i>What would Deku do in a time like this?</i>

00:22:58.462 --> 00:22:59.379
Hey.

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:01.673
Hold on! Right now, I'm--

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.219
You were thinking about what
Izuku Midoriya would do, weren't you?

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.471
Do you…

00:23:08.222 --> 00:23:12.935
like him?

00:23:13.477 --> 00:23:14.937
<i>Here's the preview!</i>

00:23:15.103 --> 00:23:16.104
<i>The second half of the practical exams:</i>

00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:17.898
<i>Uraraka and Aoyama against Thirteen,</i>

00:23:18.065 --> 00:23:19.775
<i>Kaminari and Ashido against the principal,</i>

00:23:19.942 --> 00:23:21.777
<i>Koda and Jiro against Present Mic,</i>

00:23:21.944 --> 00:23:23.487
<i>and Shoji and Hagakure against Snipe!</i>

00:23:23.654 --> 00:23:26.365
<i>Everyone's fighting with everything</i>
<i>they've got to become heroes!</i>

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.784
<i>I'm really moved right now!</i>

00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:29.826
<i>Deku!</i>

00:23:29.993 --> 00:23:30.953
<i>What's up, Uraraka?</i>

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:33.288
<i>It's hard to say when you're so moved,</i>

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:34.790
<i>but Mineta's running away!</i>

00:23:34.957 --> 00:23:36.708
<i>Next time, "Stripping the Varnish"!</i>

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:38.877
<i>Sero's sleeping peacefully</i>
<i>on someone's lap!</i>

00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:40.379
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.546 --> 00:23:42.381
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
