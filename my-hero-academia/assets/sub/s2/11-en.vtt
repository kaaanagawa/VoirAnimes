WEBVTT

00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:04.796
<i>Without using my damn old man's Quirk…</i>

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.340
<i>No.</i>

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:11.553
<i>I'll reject him completely</i>
<i>by winning first place without using it.</i>

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.098
You want to win
with just half your strength?

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:20.229
You haven't put a single scratch
on me yet, you know!

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:23.565
Come at me
with everything you've got!

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.360
Why are you going so far?

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.154
Because I want to live up
to everyone's expectations…

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.159
I want to be able to smile…
And respond to them…

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.788
<i>To be a cool hero…</i>

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:41.875
That's what I want to be!

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.961
<i>I will reject…</i>

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.423
My old man's power…

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:51.552
It's <i>your</i> power, isn't it?

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.264
I want to be a hero, too!

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:57.933
<i>Try to get close…</i>

00:00:58.267 --> 00:00:59.935
<i>And give him everything I've got!</i>

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.271
<i>Midoriya…</i>

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:06.775
<i>Thanks.</i>

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:14.658
<i>Midoriya is out of bounds…</i>

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.871
<i>Todoroki advances to the third round!</i>

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.339
Midoriya was eliminated
in the quarterfinals, huh?

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.467
He egged the other guy
on only to be defeated…

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:58.679
You mean he didn't have a plan?
He was just provoking him?

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:02.266
Did he want to beat Todoroki,
or lose to him?

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:04.685
Either way, that was some crazy power…

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:09.481
But he can't be a pro hero
if he's injured every time he attacks.

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.608
He attacked despite that, though.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:12.693
He's got spirit.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:17.114
I thought he was an interesting kid
until the cavalry battle, though…

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.289
"You're in my way."

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.708
You're not going to say that?

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.335
You need to control your left side.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.046
You're just letting it all out,
and it's dangerous.

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.259
But you have abandoned
your childish tantrum

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:41.096
and finally become
a perfect upgrade of me.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.559
After you graduate, come work for me.

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:49.021
I'll lead you down the path of the mighty.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.733
There's no way I can abandon anything.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.822
It's not something
that can be so easily reversed.

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.202
It's just… Back then…

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.287
For that one moment…

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.707
I forgot about you.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.128
Whether that is a good thing
or a bad thing…

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.005
Whether it is correct or not…

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:19.051
I need to think about it.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:24.515
FIGHT ON, IIDA

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.058
RECOVERY GIRL'S TEMPORARY NURSE'S OFFICE

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:28.310
The bones in your right arm
were shattered.

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:32.731
It'll never be the same as it was before.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.943
I need to remove the pieces of bone

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.778
to make sure
they don't stay in your joints.

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:39.363
I'll heal you after that.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.826
To push and light a fire under a child

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.496
who would destroy his body
this much for what he yearns for…

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:49.623
I don't like it.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:54.169
You're going too far. You, and this boy.

00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:57.673
You can't praise him for this.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:01.927
-Midoriya!
-Deku!

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.596
-You scared me…
-Are you okay?

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:07.724
Oh, nice to meet you…

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:08.767
Yeah…

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.144
You're all so noisy.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.897
Everyone… What about the next match?

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.275
Since there was a lot of damage
to the stage,

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.026
they're taking a break to repair it.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.697
That match earlier was scary, Midoriya…

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.533
What pro's gonna want that?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.911
I don't like your style of rubbing salt
into his wound.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.371
But it's true!

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:31.039
Be quiet, now!

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:34.084
I know you're worried,
but I've got to do surgery now.

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:35.669
Surgery?

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.212
Go on now, get out of here.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.715
-But--
-Surgery's a big deal, isn't it?

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:42.301
-Will his injuries be completely healed?
-Don't worry about that.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.343
Ribbit…

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:46.346
I'm sorry.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.684
I couldn't do what you asked.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:55.522
I want you to tell the world "I am here!"

00:05:57.316 --> 00:05:59.067
If only I hadn't said anything…

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:02.196
It's because I said that to Todoroki…

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.323
That I…

00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:10.996
You were trying to get him
to realize something.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.624
It's true.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.710
Todoroki looked so sad…

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:20.297
<i>That I meddled when I didn't need to…</i>

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:24.968
But that's not it.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:29.681
More importantly, back then, I was just…

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.518
Frustrated.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.564
I couldn't see in front or around me…

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:39.525
I'm sorry…

00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:45.531
It's true that it is a regrettable result.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.243
Saying what you did was foolish
won't change that.

00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:55.582
<i>But you know,</i>
<i>meddling when you don't need to…</i>

00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:00.045
Is the essence of being a hero.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:20.232
Recipro…

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.817
Burst!

00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:35.455
<i>Shiozaki, out of bounds!</i>

00:07:36.248 --> 00:07:37.666
<i>Iida wins!</i>

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:41.420
Dark Shadow!

00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:42.462
Got it!

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.474
<i>Ashido is out of bounds!</i>

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.268
<i>Tokoyami wins!</i>

00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.939
He won in an instant, too?

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.942
Tokoyami's Dark Shadow is amazing.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:04.985
Ribbit?

00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:08.071
Are you worried about Midoriya?

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.657
She said she had to do surgery…

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.744
Recovery Girl's taking care of it,
so you've got nothing to worry about!

00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:14.828
He's right.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.496
Yeah.

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.917
Kiss!

00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:25.672
I've healed you enough
to allow you to walk for now.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.549
Thank you very much.

00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:32.554
That's what you get for overusing it
so much in a short period of time.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:36.433
You should think of that
crooked right hand as a warning.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:40.854
In addition, I will not heal injuries
like this anymore.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.400
You must find a way for him
to use his power

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:49.321
in a way that is not so self-destructive.

00:08:57.663 --> 00:08:59.748
A different way, huh?

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.584
All Might.

00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:06.213
You originally became a teacher at U.A.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.341
to find a successor, right?

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.051
Yeah.

00:09:11.927 --> 00:09:15.472
<i>Putting everything I had</i>
<i>into the U.A. sports festival,</i>

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:22.020
I could physically feel everyone's
strong emotions of not wanting to give in.

00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:25.023
So I…

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.694
Think that someone else
should be my successor?

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.906
Yes.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.786
It's true that this place is filled
with wonderful potential heroes.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.165
One For All
is the crystallization of power.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.585
For those who have Quirks…

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.880
<i>For example,</i>
<i>if Young Todoroki were to inherit it,</i>

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.673
<i>then with the super strength</i>
<i>on top of his Half-Cold, Half-Hot,</i>

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.593
<i>he would probably become a superhero.</i>

00:09:54.887 --> 00:09:55.846
-Then--
-But you know,

00:09:57.014 --> 00:09:58.807
I was Quirkless, too.

00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:06.690
Quirkless? You were?

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:11.528
It wasn't as rare as for your generation,
but it was still uncommon.

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:15.115
<i>My master had a Quirk,</i>

00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:19.536
<i>but even so, my master believed</i>
<i>in me and gave One For All to me,</i>

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.788
<i>and raised me to become a hero.</i>

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:24.041
You never told me that.

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:26.084
Because you never asked.

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.836
Even though I thought you would.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:31.507
All Might… you were Quirkless, too?

00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:32.799
Yeah!

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:37.095
At first, I saw the old me in you.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:42.518
But you have gone beyond
what I imagined, time and time again.

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:46.522
There is something
that only you can draw out.

00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:48.649
I believe that.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.078
I'm sorry…

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:06.124
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>the sports festival isn't over yet, kid!</i>

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.252
<i>Make sure you watch until the end!</i>

00:11:08.627 --> 00:11:09.586
<i>Okay!</i>

00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:16.260
PLAYER WAITING ROOM 1

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.304
Hello, Tensei? It's me, Tenya…

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:23.141
<i>I am currently on a mission</i>
<i>and cannot answer the phone.</i>

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:26.645
Tensei…

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.981
<i>Do your best.</i>

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.650
Squad A, go north!

00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:33.610
Squad B, check the west side!

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.612
<i>-Squad A, roger!</i>
<i>-Squad B, roger!</i>

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.120
What's that?

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.375
There's no doubt about it.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.043
It's him!

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:53.964
I've found him!

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:55.966
The Hero Killer!

00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:02.639
Take this!

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.061
<i>A counter!</i>

00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:11.565
That won't work on me, Explosion Boy!

00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:14.860
<i>He's not budging…</i>

00:12:15.027 --> 00:12:17.029
<i>There's more to him than Hardening.</i>

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.240
Kirishima, get his chin! His chin!

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.909
Yesterday's enemy is today's friend.

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:27.623
Kirishima and Kacchan…

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:28.999
Which means…

00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:32.461
Iida and Tokoyami have
advanced to the next round.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:36.215
<i>Aw, I knew it… I wish I could've seen it.</i>

00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:42.137
<i>Bakugo's having a hard time fighting</i>
<i>back against Kirishima's fierce attack!</i>

00:12:42.304 --> 00:12:44.431
<i>Kacchan's on the defensive?</i>

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:48.894
Kirishima's Quirk is simple,
but that's what makes it strong.

00:12:49.228 --> 00:12:50.270
Midoriya!

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.107
I see your surgery went well.
I'm glad!

00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:55.859
Yeah, thanks.

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.528
And congrats, Iida.

00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:00.822
I made it to the semifinals.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:05.577
I'm going to use your fight
against Todoroki and learn from it.

00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:08.455
Okay.

00:13:09.081 --> 00:13:13.627
Is your big brother, Ingenium,
watching your progress, too?

00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:17.422
I called him earlier, but he was working.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:19.174
Oh, so you called him.

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:23.595
But I think that was for the best.
Now that I've made it this far,

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:25.514
I need to be able to tell him
I'm number one.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.645
<i>He is a likable hero who honors</i>
<i>the rules and leads people.</i>

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.941
I set my sights on being a hero
because I want to be like my brother.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.945
<i>Bakugo counters again!</i>

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.238
<i>What's this?</i>

00:13:42.114 --> 00:13:43.740
<i>Unlike before, it's working?</i>

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:47.244
You've been straining to keep your whole
body rock-hard this whole time, right?

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.372
If you attack quickly in that state,

00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:52.749
sooner or later, it'll start coming apart!

00:14:06.597 --> 00:14:07.472
You little…

00:14:08.307 --> 00:14:09.808
The finishing blow!

00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:12.436
Die!

00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:15.022
Well,

00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:18.859
I understand why you wouldn't want
a drawn-out match with me, though.

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:22.654
<i>Kirishima is immobilized!</i>

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:24.823
<i>Bakugo wins!</i>

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.743
You idiot!

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.828
You didn't have enough guts, Kirishima!

00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:33.874
<i>With that vicious carpet-bombing,</i>
<i>Bakugo advances to the third round!</i>

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.752
<i>And that completes the final four!</i>

00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:39.171
All right. I'm off!

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:44.927
Deku!

00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:48.847
-Midoriya, your surgery went well?
-Yeah.

00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:51.391
She healed me enough to walk.

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.228
Shouldn't you be resting?

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.104
I want to properly watch

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:59.399
the efforts of everyone
who wants to become a hero.

00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:02.819
<i>The first match of the semifinals!</i>

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:06.114
<i>With both of them from hero families,</i>
<i>it's a battle of the elites!</i>

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.451
<i>From the hero course, it's Tenya Iida!</i>

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.078
<i>Versus…</i>

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.455
<i>Also from the hero course, Shoto Todoroki!</i>

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.750
<i>I can't negate the attacks</i>
<i>like Midoriya did!</i>

00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:21.046
<i>If he can use his flames now,</i>
<i>then he has more options.</i>

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:23.882
<i>In that case…</i>

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.760
<i>Start!</i>

00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:31.181
<i>He's not planning on</i>
<i>giving me any time, huh?</i>

00:15:36.687 --> 00:15:38.397
<i>Oh, Iida's been surrounded!</i>

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.319
<i>Todoroki's going in</i>
<i>for the win right away!</i>

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.865
Wow, a standing long jump!

00:15:49.825 --> 00:15:50.868
Recipro…

00:15:51.577 --> 00:15:52.536
Burst!

00:15:55.831 --> 00:15:57.583
<i>I have about ten seconds</i>
<i>before my engines stall!</i>

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.587
<i>I have to win it in that time!</i>

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.214
<i>A direct hit!</i>

00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:07.718
He got a pretty heavy hit in!

00:16:07.885 --> 00:16:09.219
That kick was way too fast!

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.519
<i>Eight seconds left! I can do it!</i>

00:16:17.895 --> 00:16:19.563
<i>I'll throw him out of bounds like this.</i>

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:25.694
My muffler's plugged?

00:16:25.861 --> 00:16:27.487
When did that happen?

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.073
<i>During the kick…</i>

00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:33.785
Since I was only showing attacks
with range,

00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:37.748
you forgot that I could do
little tricks like this, too, didn't you?

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:41.376
I was trying to be careful
of your Recipro, though.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.587
But I still couldn't dodge it.

00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:46.340
<i>Iida is immobilized!</i>

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.008
<i>Todoroki wins!</i>

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.721
<i>Todoroki advances to the final</i>
<i>without showing his flames!</i>

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.642
<i>I need to think about it.</i>

00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:59.937
<i>Are you hesitating? Fool.</i>

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:02.439
Iida…

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.361
Tensei…

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:12.657
<i>Fame… Money…</i>

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:16.662
<i>They're all calling themselves heroes…</i>

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:21.791
TENYA
MISSED CALL

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:24.294
<i>But you bastards aren't heroes…</i>

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.673
<i>Just him…</i>

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.967
<i>The only one I'll let kill me…</i>

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.722
<i>is All Might.</i>

00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:43.230
<i>Match two of the semifinals!</i>
<i>Bakugo versus Tokoyami!</i>

00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:46.149
Bakugo's rush is unstoppable!

00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:50.237
That thing is so annoying!

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.033
That viciousness…

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.829
<i>Tokoyami has advanced this far</i>
<i>with his almost invincible Quirk,</i>

00:17:58.996 --> 00:18:00.914
<i>but this time</i>
<i>he's completely focused on defense!</i>

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.499
Tokoyami, what's going on?

00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:05.419
You attacked so much
when you were up against us!

00:18:05.586 --> 00:18:06.879
There must be a reason…

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:10.799
Dark Shadow can't switch to the offensive
with the light from the explosions.

00:18:10.966 --> 00:18:12.593
It's the worst match-up.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.928
The weakness he shared with us…

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:17.389
If Kacchan doesn't know about it yet,
then he still has a chance.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.142
<i>I underestimated him.</i>

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:22.936
<i>I don't have any time to recharge</i>
<i>Dark Shadow's darkness.</i>

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:25.355
<i>If I run out of darkness, it'll be over!</i>

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.568
<i>Is he trying to wear me down?</i>

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.987
<i>He's getting faster and faster!</i>

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.534
Grab him, Dark Shadow!

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:41.914
<i>Wow, Bakugo gets behind Tokoyami!</i>

00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:48.921
Stun Grenade!

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.219
Hey, everything's covered in smoke!

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:57.596
<i>What happened?</i>

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:00.766
Did you know…

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:02.476
Dark Shadow's weakness?

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:05.646
I figured it out after
attacking over and over, moron.

00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:10.108
Well, it was a bad match-up.
I feel bad for you.

00:19:10.609 --> 00:19:11.652
Checkmate.

00:19:13.612 --> 00:19:14.655
I give up.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:16.865
<i>Tokoyami gives up!</i>

00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:19.284
<i>Bakugo wins!</i>

00:19:20.536 --> 00:19:24.581
<i>With this, the final match will be</i>
<i>between Todoroki and Bakugo!</i>

00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:33.382
It's too bad about Tokoyami…

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.134
I thought Tokoyami would win.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.512
I guess this means he isn't invincible.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:41.682
So light is his weakness, huh? I see…

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:44.226
Bakugo likes to go after stuff like that…

00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:47.020
You picked a fight
with someone outrageous, huh?

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:50.440
Naw, he was just lucky his Quirk
was so good against his opponent.

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:53.485
It ended up being a Class A paradise, huh?

00:19:53.652 --> 00:19:54.820
Damn it.

00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:58.073
It doesn't matter who won or lost.
This year's first years are all amazing!

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.076
Looks like the draft
will be exciting this year!

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:04.830
I wonder what'll happen in a match
between those two…

00:20:04.997 --> 00:20:07.457
We'll have to watch carefully
and get our revenge next time.

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.042
Iida!

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:17.259
Whoa, what is it?

00:20:17.426 --> 00:20:18.343
My phone.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.887
His phone, huh?

00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:21.847
<i>Mother?</i>

00:20:24.183 --> 00:20:28.312
Hello? Regretfully,
I lost, Mother. I was weak…

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.647
<i>No, it's not about that.</i>

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.232
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.444
<i>Tenya, please listen calmly.</i>

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.865
<i>Tensei… Your brother… A villain got him!</i>

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:52.544
You guys haven't even noticed

00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:59.343
this warped society covered
with hypocrisy and vanity.

00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:04.014
To all who are called heroes…

00:21:05.182 --> 00:21:07.559
I will make you notice.

00:21:12.773 --> 00:21:14.316
Please stay calm.

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.735
We are of the same mind.

00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:21.698
I have been looking for you,
Hero Killer Stain.

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:26.745
I have heard of your notoriety
and wanted to meet you.

00:21:28.664 --> 00:21:31.792
May I have a moment of your time?

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:38.590
<i>Hero Killer…</i>

00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:40.843
<i>Stain.</i>

00:23:13.352 --> 00:23:15.729
<i>The preview is here!</i>

00:23:15.896 --> 00:23:17.856
<i>The U.A. sports festival</i>
<i>is finally at its climax!</i>

00:23:18.315 --> 00:23:21.443
<i>The final will be a match between</i>
<i>Young Todoroki and Young Bakugo, huh?</i>

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.654
<i>Who do you think will win, Young Midoriya?</i>

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.865
<i>Well, Kacchan has an all-purpose Quirk</i>
<i>that can be used for attacking and moving,</i>

00:23:27.032 --> 00:23:29.493
<i>and he's clever enough</i>
<i>to come up with tactics and strategy…</i>

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.203
<i>-However--</i>
<i>-Sorry! It's my fault for asking!</i>

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.788
<i>Okay, tell us the title!</i>

00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:34.998
<i>Oh, next time, it's "Todoroki vs. Bakugo"!</i>

00:23:35.165 --> 00:23:38.836
<i>Young Bakugo is seduced by female charms</i>
<i>and goes beddy-bye!</i>

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:40.212
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:42.256
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
