00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:06.673
<i>Two days since the Hosu incident,</i>

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:10.594
<i>and five days since</i>
<i>we started our internships.</i>

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:16.975
<i>Since my injuries from Stain were not</i>
<i>fully healed yet, I was in a hospital bed.</i>

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:21.313
<i>On the news, the Hero Killer</i>
<i>was the talk of the town.</i>

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.649
<i>When seven pro heroes</i>

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:27.152
<i>and three high school students</i>
<i>came across the hero killer,</i>

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:31.198
<i>Endeavor rushed over</i>
<i>and took care of the situation.</i>

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:36.453
<i>That was the official story</i>
<i>released by the police.</i>

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.164
<i>Just as the person from the police said,</i>

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.127
<i>Iida, Todoroki,</i>
<i>and my names were not made public,</i>

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.546
<i>and our injuries were explained away</i>

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.590
<i>as accidents that happened</i>
<i>during our internships.</i>

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.971
<i>The night Iida got the results</i>
<i>of the examination of his injured arms,</i>

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:57.891
<i>he went back with his mom</i>
<i>to his parents' house.</i>

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.604
<i>As for Todoroki,</i>
<i>who had relatively light injuries…</i>

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:05.315
I will return to my internship.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.609
To Endeavor's place?

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.320
I want to learn what I can from him.

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:11.822
Besides,

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:16.660
they said he defeated the Hero Killer
even though he didn't actually do it.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.371
I want to see his expression.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:25.252
<i>You become kind of mean when</i>
<i>it comes to Endeavor, huh, Todoroki?</i>

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:30.716
<i>I'm sure everyone else</i>
<i>is working hard right now.</i>

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.488
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:56.033
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.578
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.371
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:05.853
EVERYONE'S INTERNSHIPS

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.231
It is possible

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:11.275
that the villains who were inspired
by the Hosu incident the other day

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.569
will become more active.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.864
Even though this is just a patrol,
don't let your guard down.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.906
Right.

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:21.034
This is sudden, but here's a question.

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:25.747
Patrols are meant to deter
villains from committing crimes,

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:28.000
but they also have a secondary effect.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.168
What is it?

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:32.254
If we see villains,
we beat them up right away!

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:33.755
No.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.424
It's Best Jeanist!

00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.384
Please do your best at work!

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.598
The answer is: to show people who we are.

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:45.142
To give the public peace of mind.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:50.230
It builds trust between those who protect
and those who are being protected.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.524
What is this, a courtesy visit?

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.819
Oh, I've seen him on TV before!

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.530
<i>The sports festival again?</i>

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:02.034
He was caught by a villain and
looked like he was about to cry, right?

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.286
What did you say?

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.833
Did you already forget what I taught you?

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.085
Deal with them properly.

00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:13.712
All right already!

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:19.091
You know, I wasn't caught
by the villain back then,

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.095
I was thinking about how to defeat him.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.097
It wasn't that I'd lost.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.601
I'm the man who'll become
the number one hero!

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.979
There's no reason for kids
like you to worry about me--

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.443
<i>He's too proud.</i>

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:41.907
<i>It's fine for those strong feelings</i>
<i>to be aimed at becoming a hero,</i>

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.117
<i>but if that is no longer the case…</i>

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.579
<i>Now, what shall I do with you?</i>

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.792
How would you fight against
an opponent with a knife?

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.711
Uravity, can you try attacking me?

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.088
You sure?

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.673
You don't have to hold back.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.842
Then, here I come!

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:05.138
When someone's waving a knife at you,
deal with it by keeping your distance.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:09.685
If they attack directly,
use one leg as an axis to turn and dodge,

00:05:09.852 --> 00:05:11.645
then grab their wrist
and neck and the same time,

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.313
and then hold them down

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.024
as you pull their wrist.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.528
If you can twist their wrist
to make them drop the knife

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:22.739
and kick the knife far away,
it'll be even more perfect.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.494
<i>He moved so smoothly, without hesitation.</i>

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:29.746
<i>Gunhead Martial Arts…</i>

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.748
<i>So amazing!</i>

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:34.543
<i>Even though he acts cute…</i>

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.795
This time, I'll hold the knife, 'kay?

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:39.464
We'll keep repeating this
until you can do it!

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.842
-All right?
-Yes, sir!

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:45.179
-Uwabami, can I have your autograph?
-Can I take your picture?

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.263
Look this way, please!

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.432
Um…

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.559
When you work diligently like this,

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.853
you can eventually
make big blossoms bloom.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.106
It's like when an <i>enka</i> singer
goes on provincial tours.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.692
Doesn't "work diligently"…

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:01.111
…mean something different?

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:05.115
Contributing to the community is
also an essential part of being a hero.

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.783
Don't drag your feet doing it!

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.035
Do you understand?

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.079
Yes, Mr. Fourth Kind…

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.331
I can't hear you!

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.917
Yes, Mr. Fourth Kind!

00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:17.419
How many hostages are there?

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.546
From what I can hear, there are two.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.049
All right. We're breaking in.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:25.302
Earphone Jack, please tell
the escaping hostages what to do.

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:27.471
Right, Death Arms.

00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:28.680
Let's go!

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.558
This is a pro hero! Do as I say!

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:34.394
I will escort you! Come below with me!

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.021
We're saved!

00:06:36.188 --> 00:06:37.898
Thank you, hero!

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.786
OKI MARINER

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.913
Ribbit.

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:54.748
-Froppy!
-Ribbit?

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.208
How are things on your end?

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:59.378
I've finished cleaning the deck, Sirius.

00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:04.925
It's boring just training and
cleaning the deck every day, isn't it?

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.010
Yes, a little.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.264
It was the same when I did my internship.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.017
I was confused by the difference
between the image I had of what a hero

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.645
was when I was a kid
and what the reality was.

00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:19.398
I imagined something a lot showier,

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:23.402
but in reality, it's a daily grind
of training and patrols and cleaning.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.072
On top of that, I even had
to wash the captain's underwear!

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:30.158
What part of this is being a hero?
I thought.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.660
Did you get tired of it?

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.121
At first, I did.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.207
But after becoming the captain's sidekick,
I realized

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.044
what was really important for a hero.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:44.756
What's really important? What is it?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.759
You have to find the answer to that
yourself.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.261
Right?

00:07:49.428 --> 00:07:50.304
Ribbit.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.055
Hey, Froppy!

00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:54.391
What're you playing around for?

00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:57.561
Just because frogs have big mouths doesn't
mean you can spend all your time gabbing.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.939
And Sirius,
I ordered you to supervise her.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.357
Make sure you're doing your job properly!

00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:05.235
I've finished cleaning, Captain.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.196
And I'm supervising her properly!

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.238
Ribbit.

00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:10.073
Oh, is that right?

00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:12.117
I guess I jumped to conclusions.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.078
I see, I see! My bad!

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.497
I'm sorry!

00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:23.795
Was I too cute for words, Froppy?

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.422
She's dumbfounded.

00:08:26.048 --> 00:08:29.593
I always say this, but you
can't just make your face cute.

00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:32.011
Below the neck, you're too macho…

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.351
Your face is also too rugged, though…

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:38.477
What did you say?

00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:41.188
When I do this for kids, they love it!

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:44.399
Yeah! They love making fun of it!

00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:46.360
Because it's not cute <i>at all</i>.

00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:50.531
<i>How cute.</i>

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:55.661
Captain Selkie, there's a message
from the Japan Coast Guard!

00:08:56.078 --> 00:08:57.371
All right, I'll be there right away!

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.374
Froppy, help me unfasten the ropes.

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:02.000
We'll probably be sailing out.

00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:04.294
Ribbit!

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:07.464
It's me.

00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:09.758
That's right. You're good at this.

00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:14.930
One, two!

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.307
I see. Got it!

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.684
The ropes are unfastened!

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:21.395
Sailors!
We're making an emergency departure!

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:23.063
Aye aye, sir!

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.316
Full speed ahead!

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:32.948
All right, the Oki Mariner is sailing out!

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:44.918
Stowaways?

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:51.592
The Coast Guard got a tip that there
were stowaways on the trade ship, Nysan.

00:09:52.134 --> 00:09:54.720
The Coast Guard inspected the Nysan,

00:09:54.887 --> 00:09:57.097
but the stowaways
were nowhere to be found.

00:09:57.598 --> 00:09:59.349
However, after more careful investigation,

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:03.437
they found cargo missing
from the ship's freight list.

00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:07.191
Do you know what this means, Froppy?

00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:08.525
Ribbit.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.862
I think it means that
before the Coast Guard arrived,

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:16.575
the stowaways moved the cargo
to another ship and ran away.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.829
The stowaways may have been
smuggling brokers.

00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:23.790
That's correct!

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:25.709
<i>That's not cute…</i>

00:10:26.585 --> 00:10:27.920
<i>How cute.</i>

00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:31.089
The job we've taken on this time

00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:35.052
is to secure the stowaways
thought to have escaped on a small boat

00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:37.095
and deliver them to the Coast Guard!

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.015
Based on the Nysan's position,

00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:43.560
this is the area of the ocean where
the smaller boat is predicted to land.

00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:48.106
The Coast Guard and other sea rescue
heroes are also searching for the boat.

00:10:48.774 --> 00:10:50.692
We will be responsible for…

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.361
this area!

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.113
The sun will set soon.

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.617
You guys
search for the boat with the radar!

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.411
I will look for them in the ocean.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:02.454
That is all!

00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:05.040
Now, get to work, sailors!

00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:06.625
Aye aye, sir!

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:14.550
<i>Sea Rescue Hero: Selkie!</i>

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.009
<i>Quirk: Spotted Seal.</i>

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.513
<i>He can do pretty much anything</i>
<i>a spotted seal can.</i>

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.390
<i>He can even make a sonar-like sound</i>

00:11:21.557 --> 00:11:25.352
<i>and use the echo to determine</i>
<i>the position of his opponent.</i>

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.062
<i>He's also very strong!</i>

00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:30.816
<i>They aren't around here.</i>

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.401
<i>Guess I'll widen my search a little!</i>

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:43.120
As expected, I can't see anything
in this darkness.

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:46.665
It doesn't look like we've been able to
catch anything on the radar yet, either.

00:11:46.832 --> 00:11:48.625
-It's fine!
-Ribbit?

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:51.587
We've got the captain on our side!

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.589
<i>We have a message from the Coast Guard!</i>

00:11:54.173 --> 00:11:56.091
A fishing boat thought to belong

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:57.968
to the stowaways shook off

00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.720
<i>a hero agency patrol boat</i>

00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:03.557
<i>and escaped into the direction</i>
<i>of the area we're in charge of!</i>

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:04.683
Ribbit…

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.229
Captain!

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.775
I've confirmed the location of the fishing
boat thought to belong to the stowaways!

00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:14.902
Sailors!

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:18.530
Turn off all the lights and get close
without letting them know where we are!

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:19.948
Aye aye, sir!

00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:27.664
Captain, I can see a fishing boat
with my naked eye.

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:30.334
All right,
block their course with a patrol boat

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:33.754
and board their boat while
setting off a flare.

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:34.922
Aye aye, sir!

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.257
-What should I do?
-Stay here.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.593
-Ribbit!
-Sirius, stay with her.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.636
Yes, sir!

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.763
Then I won't be able
to experience the internship.

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.224
Just be quiet and do as I say!

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:46.475
Let's go!

00:12:46.642 --> 00:12:47.726
Aye aye, sir!

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:50.729
Ribbit…

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:55.943
I know that you want to go with them,
Froppy.

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.236
But you know,

00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:01.406
even if we're up against stowaways,
we have to be very careful, right?

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.243
So follow the captain's orders.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.245
Let's give them support together.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.038
Ribbit.

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:11.708
Captain, we've arrived
at the fishing boat's course!

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:12.751
<i>All right,</i>

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.671
leave the rest to me.

00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:23.679
<i>Stop the ship! This is a pro hero!</i>

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:28.392
<i>We are here on a job for the Japan</i>
<i>Coast Guard to inspect your ship!</i>

00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:33.021
Captain!

00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:36.692
I didn't find
any of the cargo in question.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:37.901
There wasn't any here, either.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:39.695
That's what I told you!

00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:42.406
We were just fishing…

00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:47.411
Then, you can show us
what's under here, too, right?

00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:49.788
There's nothing but fish down there.

00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:51.415
Just open it up!

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:54.042
-What a pain.
-There's nothing but fish…

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.299
It's too dark to see clearly.

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:02.259
Can't you turn on any lights--

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.514
I did as you said.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:08.724
So

00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:10.851
please spare my life…

00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:12.519
We won't kill ya.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:13.896
Don't worry!

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.819
If we can buy this much time…

00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:24.531
…then it'll be easier for Boss Innsmouth
to do what he needs to do.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.201
Our job's done!

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.827
See ya!

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.331
Captain! Captain, please respond!

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:35.375
It's no good.
The radio's not getting through.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:36.793
-I'll go take a look!
-Wait!

00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:41.632
<i>Sirius!</i>
<i>Quirk: Good Ear.</i>

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.177
<i>She can hear high frequencies</i>
<i>that humans cannot hear.</i>

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:52.518
"Stowaways"…

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:54.436
"Different boat"!

00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:57.814
"We're fine. Find them."

00:14:58.148 --> 00:14:59.483
Mick, start the ship!

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.567
Yes, ma'am!

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:03.779
If that boat is a decoy,
then the stowaways

00:15:03.946 --> 00:15:05.822
should be heading toward the shore.

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.783
-Hurry!
-Got it!

00:15:08.367 --> 00:15:10.410
We don't have to rescue
the captain and the others?

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:13.664
We're going to follow
the captain's orders.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.751
Because we believe what the captain
decided is the best course of action!

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.337
Froppy, you believe, too.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:21.839
In the captain,

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:23.590
and in us.

00:15:25.217 --> 00:15:26.343
Ribbit!

00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:35.394
I see them!

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:37.479
They're hiding
in the shadow of Double Rock!

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.482
<i>Damn it, in a place like that!</i>

00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:43.277
Cut the engine and go to one
of the cruiser's blind spots!

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:44.444
<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:45.779
Froppy, you help, too!

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.281
Ribbit!

00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:51.368
There's someone keeping watch.

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.621
Froppy,
can you bring the guard over here?

00:15:54.872 --> 00:15:55.873
Leave it to me.

00:15:57.833 --> 00:15:58.834
What?

00:15:59.001 --> 00:15:59.877
You guys--

00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:04.214
If you answer our questions,
then we won't get rough with you.

00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:08.135
-Here I go.
-Thanks.

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.892
There's only one person on the cruiser.

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.518
He's hiding in a cabin.

00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:18.562
I'll drag him out!

00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:21.315
-What? I can't see!
-Mick!

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:25.986
Froppy!

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.280
Sirius!

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:34.661
Gotcha.

00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:36.872
A villain!

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.875
I thought I'd gotten clean away,

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:43.462
but you guys are too persistent!

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:44.796
Ribbit…

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:49.801
Huh? What, you've only got
a woman and a kid left?

00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:58.435
Oops, don't move!

00:16:59.645 --> 00:17:03.357
I'll give her back once
I'm free of the Coast Guard.

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:07.109
I'll have you help me move the cargo, too.

00:17:07.653 --> 00:17:08.569
<i>Sorry.</i>

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.365
<i>We're locked up in the fishing boat</i>

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.157
<i>and our transmission's been blocked.</i>

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:15.077
<i>The captain went ahead.</i>

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.411
-Ribbit…
-<i>How are things on your end?</i>

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:19.330
<i>Tell me your situation. Please respond!</i>

00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:22.209
So it's a radio, huh?

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.378
Hey, kid!

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:30.050
If you care about this woman's life,
then tell them this:

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:34.471
"We couldn't find the stowaways."

00:17:34.638 --> 00:17:35.514
Ribbit!

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.015
Don't do it, Fro--

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:38.809
Sirius!

00:17:38.976 --> 00:17:40.185
Hurry up!

00:17:43.522 --> 00:17:46.650
You don't care
what'll happen to this woman?

00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.570
Huh? How about it?

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:50.654
Ribbit…

00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:52.155
Well?

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.659
<i>…what was really important for a hero.</i>

00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:59.454
<i>We're going to follow</i>
<i>the captain's orders.</i>

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:04.168
<i>Because we believe what the captain</i>
<i>decided is the best course of action!</i>

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.045
<i>Froppy, you believe, too.</i>

00:18:10.132 --> 00:18:11.175
I know.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.308
The stowaways are at Double Rock!

00:18:20.017 --> 00:18:21.101
Tsu…

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:24.646
You little brat!

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.900
I'll kill you!

00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:31.570
Stop moving around so much!
It's so annoying!

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.240
Ribbit!

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.327
-Oops! I've got you.
-Ribbit…

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:39.828
Ribbit…

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.081
Ribbit…

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.834
The end!

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.839
You're just a brat.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.342
Since you came here uninvited,

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:56.178
you'll have to die!

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:04.520
Boss!

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.271
My brothers!

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:10.859
Ribbit!

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:15.864
Captain!

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:17.616
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:19.618
Leave the rest to me!

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:21.870
No way!

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.335
Even if I can't see…

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:30.504
I know…

00:19:30.963 --> 00:19:32.798
where you are!

00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:36.468
Damn bastard!

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.098
Captain!

00:19:42.808 --> 00:19:44.726
All right!

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.696
The captain's amazing.

00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:58.365
-Froppy!
-Ribbit…

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.077
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:04.621
I'm fine. What about you, Sirius?

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.332
My body's the only thing strong about me.

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:13.046
Good job, you two.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.175
Thanks to you,
we were able to catch the stowaways.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.595
Captain…

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.472
Thanks!

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.643
You're doing that <i>now</i>?

00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:32.941
Sirius, I'm glad I was able
to come to this internship.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:34.109
Huh?

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:38.530
What's really important for a hero…

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:41.617
I think I understand a little better now!

00:20:45.204 --> 00:20:46.705
I see.

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.129
Arrest all the stowaways.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.177
We were able to recover all the illegal
drugs they were trying to bring in, too.

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:04.681
By the way, Selkie,
when did you get a new sidekick?

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:07.100
-Ribbit?
-She's a U.A. student

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.477
here for an internship.

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:13.232
Is that right? We made you
go through something scary, huh?

00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:14.525
Sorry.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.110
Hey, don't treat her like a kid.

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:21.490
Froppy doesn't have her license yet,
but she's already an excellent hero.

00:21:21.657 --> 00:21:23.116
I guarantee it.

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:24.451
Yup.

00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:30.290
Then, I'm looking forward to
when we can work together,

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.334
Froppy.

00:21:35.212 --> 00:21:36.338
Ribbit.

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:13.977
PREVIEW

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.939
<i>All Might!</i>
<i>I have returned from my internship!</i>

00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:19.066
<i>You went through a lot</i>
<i>with the Hosu incident, huh?</i>

00:23:19.233 --> 00:23:20.859
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't be nearby!</i>

00:23:21.026 --> 00:23:23.403
<i>Well, what were you trying to tell me?</i>

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.531
<i>The time has come when I must tell you</i>

00:23:26.532 --> 00:23:30.744
