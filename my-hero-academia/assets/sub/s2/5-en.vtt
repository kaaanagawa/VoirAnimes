00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.254
<i>The world has become a superhuman society,</i>

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:08.175
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>In this world swirling with chaos,</i>

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.429
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:14.431
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.517
<i>Heroes of justice</i>

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.478
<i>fighting villains</i>
<i>and saving people from distress.</i>

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.314
<i>Yes,</i>

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:26.693
<i>this is the story</i>
<i>of how I became the greatest hero.</i>

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.622
<i>The second round of the U.A.</i>
<i>sports festival first-year stage is…</i>

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.750
<i>A cavalry battle</i>
<i>with the top 42 from the qualifier!</i>

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.169
<i>Izuku Midoriya,</i>
<i>who placed first in the qualifier,</i>

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.839
<i>is worth ten million points!</i>

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.219
<i>It's survival of the fittest,</i>

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.804
<i>with a chance for those</i>
<i>at the bottom to overthrow the top!</i>

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:23.769
Bakugo and Todoroki aren't
the only ones who see you as a rival.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:27.481
I will challenge you.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.151
-Uraraka.
-Yes!

00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:32.903
Hatsume.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.947
-Tokoyami.
-Yeah.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.074
I'm counting on you!

00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:38.116
I know!

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:41.870
Tokoyami!

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.914
Call me Tsu!

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:50.546
Kacchan!

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.550
Don't get carried away!

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.718
Damn it!

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:57.761
Tokoyami!

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.690
I'll be taking that now.

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:16.822
CAVALRY BATTLE FINALE

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.495
It was a good plan, so I joined
the team even though it was you.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:25.455
When did you lose your headband?

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:26.790
I don't know!

00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:29.501
But now, there's nothing left to lose!

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.172
Shoji, full attack mode!

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.802
We're gonna steal the points from
those two teams with everything we've got!

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.555
I thought we would not have

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.640
a confrontation
until later in this contest.

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:47.352
He seems to think highly of you, Midoriya.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.937
Only half the time is left!

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:50.564
Don't stop moving.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.524
Iida, forward!

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:53.817
Right!

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.946
Yaoyorozu, prepare to guard us
and conduct electricity.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.031
Right.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.825
-Kaminari, you…
-I know what I have to do!

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.578
Watch our surroundings.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:07.664
It's not just one group coming for us!

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.584
Make sure you guard well…

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:13.295
Indiscriminate Shock…

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.964
1.3 Million Volts!

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.766
Kaminari!

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.895
Less than six minutes left.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.022
We can't back down now.

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:35.526
Sorry, but you'll just have to bear it.

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.236
<i>What? What'd he do?</i>

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.155
<i>Todoroki took care</i>
<i>of that crowd of teams in an instant!</i>

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:44.535
He froze them
after Kaminari's shock stopped them.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.954
<i>I guess it should be expected,</i>

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.121
<i>but he took into account</i>

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.916
<i>how a lot of people avoided it</i>
<i>in the obstacle course.</i>

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:52.376
Nice commentary!

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.630
I might as well take these.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.426
-Damn it!
-What? Mine, too?

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:05.806
The backpack's acting up?

00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:08.600
Baby! There's room for improvement!

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.102
Oh no, it's too strong!

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.562
We can't get away!

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.230
I'll restrain them!

00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:15.941
Yaoyorozu!

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:24.825
Yaoyoruzu's Creation
is too hard to deal with!

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:25.951
No.

00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:27.911
Kaminari is worse.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.997
With that level of armor,

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.041
if it had been sunlight,
Dark Shadow would've been ripped apart.

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.170
<i>Right!</i>

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.589
In any case, I want you
to devote yourself to defense.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.716
You don't have to attack.

00:05:40.883 --> 00:05:41.884
So…

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.969
Interesting.

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:48.765
<i>My Quirk's offensive ability</i>
<i>increases the darker it is,</i>

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.351
<i>but it becomes fierce</i>
<i>and difficult to control.</i>

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.813
<i>On the other hand, under sunlight,</i>
<i>it becomes possible to control,</i>

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.733
<i>but its offense becomes below average.</i>

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:02.571
To tell me I didn't have to attack
with my Quirk without knowing that…

00:06:02.738 --> 00:06:05.616
It's a very unique choice,
under the circumstances.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.703
Very well. Try using me.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.331
<i>I leave it to you, Midoriya.</i>

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:16.043
I see… Kaminari's lightning…

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.253
As long as he keeps
discharging electricity,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.963
attacking will be difficult.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.591
Dark Shadow will become timid.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.344
I'm against violence.

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.640
<i>Team Midoriya has nowhere left to go!</i>

00:06:33.477 --> 00:06:34.895
Decreased offense…

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.397
They don't know that, do they?

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:38.857
I don't believe so.

00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:43.111
<i>The only person I've told</i>
<i>about this weakness is Koda, at USJ,</i>

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.863
<i>and he is a man of few words.</i>

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.117
If they don't know about it,
then we can use it to hold them back.

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:51.828
<i>It's fine.</i>

00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:56.083
No matter what,
we will hang on to the ten million!

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.589
Class A is too simple-minded.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.800
-He got us!
-What'd you say, bastard?

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:06.385
Give that back! I'll kill you!

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:08.595
You're famous, aren't you?

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.348
<i>As the victim of the sludge incident!</i>

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.809
Tell me about it sometime.

00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:17.354
About how it feels to be attacked
by villains once a year.

00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:22.401
Kirishima, change of plan…

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.320
Monoma,

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.864
don't provoke him!

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.532
You'll be the same as him.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.869
That's right. It wouldn't become a hero.

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:33.787
Besides, don't you often hear

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:38.959
about heroes who get done in
by villains who want revenge?

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.170
Bakugo, calm down!

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.797
If you don't calm down,
we won't be able to get the points back!

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:51.054
Forward, Kirishima!

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.389
Right now,

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.184
I'm totally calm!

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.602
We're seriously counting on you!

00:07:57.853 --> 00:07:58.812
Go!

00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:02.441
Die!

00:08:11.742 --> 00:08:12.910
Wow,

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.953
what a nice Quirk!

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:17.748
That's my…

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:20.083
Bakugo,
someone has the same Quirk as you, too?

00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:22.669
Damn it!

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.092
Really, such nice Quirks.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.261
Mine's better, though.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.347
What? Mine?

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:35.557
-The same again?
-No.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.561
This guy copied them.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.022
That's right!

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.651
<i>Neito Monoma. Quirk: Copy!</i>

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.402
<i>He can use the Quirks</i>

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.239
<i>of anyone he touches</i>
<i>as much as he wants for five minutes.</i>

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.407
<i>He can't use two at the same time, though!</i>

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.160
Well,
even an idiot can figure it out, huh?

00:08:56.787 --> 00:08:57.663
NOW!

00:08:58.747 --> 00:08:59.706
Okay!

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.001
Bondo! Picking a fight, huh?

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.337
Monoma, we just have
to keep from getting caught now.

00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:06.421
With this many points,

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:08.131
we'll definitely make it
into the top four!

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.133
-After them!
-It's solidifying!

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.011
-Wow! I can't move!
-Wait a sec!

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:15.639
-I'll melt it with my Quirk!
-Hurry!

00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:17.599
We've got zero points right now! Hurry!

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.310
Oh, don't get mad at me.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:24.815
You're the one who provoked us, right?
What did you say for the pledge again?

00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:27.234
That embarrassing thing… Let me think…

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.237
Oh well, you've done enough for today!

00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:32.531
I'll be number one.

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:37.160
Number one. Not just first place.

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:41.206
I'll take an indisputable first place!

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.084
<i>One minute left!</i>

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.671
<i>Todoroki made it so he'd have</i>
<i>the ten million to himself</i>

00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:49.339
<i>to seize in an instant!</i>

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.926
At least,
that's what I thought five minutes ago!

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:57.306
<i>But unbelievably, Midoriya's been able</i>
<i>to keep away in that cramped space</i>

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:58.724
<i>for five minutes!</i>

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:00.184
Hold!

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:03.353
<i>You're doing good.</i>

00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:06.273
He can see right through you.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.482
Fool.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.486
<i>He's keeping his distance,</i>
<i>staying on the left side.</i>

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.155
<i>He's paying attention.</i>

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:15.365
<i>At this rate,</i>
<i>if I want to freeze them</i>

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.326
<i>over the shortest distance</i>
<i>possible, I'll get Iida.</i>

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.661
<i>And if he keeps moving like this,</i>

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.456
<i>I'll do myself in</i>
<i>if I freeze indiscriminately.</i>

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.668
<i>And Tokoyami can defend</i>
<i>against Kaminari's electricity.</i>

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.463
<i>One more minute.</i>

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:33.842
<i>The bastard!</i>

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.261
Everyone,

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:41.016
there's less than a minute left.
You won't be able to use me after this.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.769
-I'm counting on you!
-Iida?

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.272
Hang on tight.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.234
Make sure you get it, Todoroki.

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.697
Torque Over!

00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:00.869
Reciproburst!

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.294
<i>Wha!</i>

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:12.464
<i>What happened? So fast! So fast!</i>

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.219
<i>Iida, if you could accelerate that fast,</i>
<i>then show us in the prelims!</i>

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:19.888
What was that?

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.393
By forcing the torque
and rotations to increase,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.727
I created an explosive power.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.231
With the recoil,
my engine stalls after a while, though.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:34.236
It's a secret move
I hadn't told anyone in class yet.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.240
I told you, didn't I, Midoriya?

00:11:39.283 --> 00:11:40.993
That I'd challenge you.

00:11:42.703 --> 00:11:43.912
<i>The tables are turned!</i>

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.790
<i>Offense and defense right at the edge!</i>

00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:49.042
<i>Reining that in,</i>
<i>Todoroki gets the ten million!</i>

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.254
<i>And Midoriya</i>
<i>is suddenly left with zero points!</i>

00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:53.505
Get back in there!

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.257
As long as they have Kaminari,
we'll be at a disadvantage if we attack!

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:58.218
Won't it be safer
to try for other points right now?

00:11:58.385 --> 00:11:59.511
No!

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.138
I don't know
how the other points got split up!

00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:02.890
This is our only chance!

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.349
All right!

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.643
We'll get it back, Deku!
We definitely will!

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:08.896
Uraraka…

00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:12.983
I'll definitely become a hero
and make money

00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:15.652
and let my parents take it easy.

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:17.571
<i>That's right…</i>

00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:20.032
Let me use your position!

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:22.034
<i>It's not just me.</i>

00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:24.244
I leave it to you, Midoriya.

00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:28.624
<i>The feelings of the three</i>

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.751
<i>who trust in me…</i>

00:12:32.878 --> 00:12:37.633
<i>I'm carrying all that right now!</i>

00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:47.100
<i>With less than a minute left,</i>

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.187
<i>Todoroki currently has four headbands!</i>

00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:52.022
<i>He's wrested away</i>
<i>the top spot from Midoriya,</i>

00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:54.233
<i>who was running away like crazy!</i>

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:58.445
<i>Will these be the top four teams</i>
<i>to move on to the next round?</i>

00:12:58.612 --> 00:12:59.488
<i>Second, huh?</i>

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.115
We might've done
a little too well for ourselves.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.575
Anyway, focus on keeping that spot.

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:04.660
Wait!

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:05.827
I said, wait!

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:07.955
Jeez, so persistent.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.250
As a hero, not to mention as a person,
that persistence will…

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:13.377
Don't act on your own, Bakugo!

00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:15.003
-Tsuburaba!
-Guard!

00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:18.799
-Hey!
-Yes!

00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:22.469
<i>Kosei Tsuburaba.</i>
<i>Quirk: Solid Air</i>

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:24.555
<i>He can solidify air</i>
<i>to form walls or footholds.</i>

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.932
<i>The size depends on lung capacity!</i>

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.977
You can't see this wall!
Serves you right!

00:13:37.401 --> 00:13:38.569
He took two!

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:45.284
<i>Team Bakugo seizes</i>
<i>two headbands to move to third place!</i>

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.245
<i>The rankings keep changing</i>
<i>in the final stages!</i>

00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:49.788
<i>It's the passion of youth!</i>

00:13:51.582 --> 00:13:52.624
Tsunotori!

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:55.252
Damn it!

00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:56.712
It's fine. We're in fourth!

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.381
Kendo's been frozen and can't move.

00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:02.718
Yeah… As long as we defend
this one to the death,

00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:03.886
we'll definitely…

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.804
I told you to say something
if you're gonna jump!

00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:08.807
But this means we'll definitely
get through to the next round.

00:14:08.974 --> 00:14:10.809
-Not yet!
-What?

00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:13.645
We're gonna get
an indisputable first place!

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.106
<i>Monoma…</i>

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.860
<i>Class B's strategy</i>
<i>was certainly reasonable and good.</i>

00:14:20.319 --> 00:14:22.613
<i>But there's just one thing</i>
<i>that is unfortunate.</i>

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:25.616
I couldn't brace myself
enough earlier on my own!

00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:27.326
Go!

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:32.456
We'll get our points back, too,
and then go for the ten million!

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:37.336
Jeez…

00:14:37.503 --> 00:14:39.213
Flat Face! Tape!

00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:40.839
It's Sero!

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:43.717
-You missed!
-Raccoon Eyes!

00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:45.928
Lay down a weak dissolving solution
in the direction we're going!

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:47.513
My name's Mina Ashido!

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:54.978
Young Bakugo, you understand
very well without being told, don't you?

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.525
<i>Those who are always aiming for the top,</i>

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.027
<i>and those who aren't.</i>

00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:05.405
<i>Their difference…</i>

00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:08.408
<i>You didn't take the difference</i>

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.869
<i>in tenacity into consideration, did you?</i>

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.457
<i>Bakugo is merciless!</i>

00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.709
<i>If he's gonna do it,</i>
<i>he's gonna be thorough!</i>

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:20.170
<i>He's, you know, a perfectionist!</i>

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.172
<i>Now, there are only seconds left!</i>

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.300
Next! We're going
to where Deku and Todoroki are!

00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:29.805
It was the first time… I tried
to use this power on a person…

00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:34.017
<i>It's fine.</i>
<i>Either way, I'm not gonna hit him.</i>

00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:35.853
<i>Like cutting through air…</i>

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.814
<i>break down the opponent's defenses!</i>

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:46.697
<i>My left… What am I…</i>

00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:50.200
<i>It hurts, but it's not broken!</i>

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:54.204
<i>He's turned them inside out</i>
<i>to hide the point values,</i>

00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:56.915
<i>but he took the ten million last</i>
<i>and put it on,</i>

00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:58.959
<i>so it must be the one on top.</i>

00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:01.211
This one!

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.048
I got it…

00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:07.217
I got it!

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:13.098
<i>With just eleven seconds left,</i>
<i>there's an angry retrieval here, too!</i>

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.727
Wait a minute.
Isn't this the wrong headband?

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:21.648
They got us!

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:25.569
Just in case,
we changed the position of the headbands!

00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:27.696
You were naive, Midoriya!

00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:32.075
Todoroki, get a hold of yourself!
That was close!

00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:36.788
<i>Oh no! Team Midoriya</i>
<i>didn't retrieve the ten million points!</i>

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.791
<i>Seventy points…</i>

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.126
<i>Isn't good enough!</i>

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.504
Time's just about up!

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:45.506
<i>Start the countdown!</i>

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.966
Tokoyami!

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.134
Kaminari!

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:54.640
Damn Deku!

00:16:55.182 --> 00:16:56.058
Bakugo!

00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:58.018
-Huh…
-Uraraka!

00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:00.020
Got it!

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:04.066
Yaoyorozu!

00:17:04.942 --> 00:17:06.276
The ten million points are…

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.074
Half-and-Half Bastard!

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.501
<i>Time's up!</i>

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:27.256
<i>That's the end of the second round,</i>
<i>the cavalry battle!</i>

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.094
Bakugo!

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:33.762
You okay?

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:37.474
Damn it.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.978
Now, let's take a look
at the top four teams right away!

00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:44.314
<i>In first place, Team Todoroki!</i>

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:49.278
Even though we won,
it felt like we were skating on thin ice.

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:50.362
Sorry.

00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:52.573
I caused everyone trouble.

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:53.949
That's not true.

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:58.078
Without you, we would not have won.

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:00.956
<i>In second place, Team Bakugo!</i>

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:04.084
Ah, we were so close!

00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:08.088
Well, second place isn't bad.
All's well that ends well.

00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:11.383
Do you really think that's how he feels?

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:17.389
<i>In third place, Tetsu--</i>
<i>Huh? What, it's Team Shinso?</i>

00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:19.725
<i>When did you come from behind?</i>

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.476
Thanks for your hard work.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:26.690
Deku?

00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:31.153
Um… I'm really sorry.

00:18:36.742 --> 00:18:41.413
Todoroki was clearly
shaken by your first attack.

00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:45.501
I had hoped to get the ten million points,

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.170
but things don't always go as you wish.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.131
Even so, I got one.

00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:55.886
I took the one on his head
where his guard was the weakest.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.889
Midoriya, this was thanks to the opening

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.141
you created with your last spurt.

00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:04.645
<i>In fourth place, Team Midoriya!</i>

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:10.526
<i>These four teams will advance…</i>

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.695
<i>to the final round!</i>

00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:22.120
<i>I won't use this to attack.</i>

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:26.583
<i>That's what I had decided,</i>
<i>but I was overwhelmed…</i>

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.211
I can't…

00:19:29.628 --> 00:19:33.423
At this rate, I'll be doing
what my old man wants.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.057
<i>Now, we'll take an hour's break for lunch</i>

00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:44.768
<i>before we start the afternoon festivities!</i>
<i>See ya!</i>

00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:48.355
<i>Hey, Eraser Head, let's go grab food.</i>

00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:49.731
<i>I'm going to sleep.</i>

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:53.777
What happened?

00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:56.738
Before I knew it,
we had zero points, and it was over…

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.907
Could it be punishment

00:19:59.283 --> 00:20:02.870
for taking the small one's points
in such an indecent way?

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:05.038
My headband's gone!

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.624
I can't accept this!

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.294
How disappointing…

00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:12.671
Mina, congratulations.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:17.759
Well, Bakugo just let me join
to use against Todoroki's ice,

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:20.596
so I don't know
if it reflects my abilities.

00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:24.183
Iida, I didn't know you had
a special move like that! No fair!

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:27.853
It has nothing to do with fairness!
I just wasn't using it as intended.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.229
THAT WAS FUN.

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:32.274
I wanted to do something
that could compete with Midoriya.

00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:34.234
It's that manly thing, huh?

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.486
Speaking of which, where <i>is</i> that Midoriya?

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.031
Where's Deku?

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:41.491
FACULTY AND STUDENT ENTRANCE

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:54.213
What did you want to talk about?

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:01.303
Hey!

00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:04.223
Long time no see!

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:06.558
Let's have tea, Endeavor!

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:10.062
All Might…

00:22:44.865 --> 00:22:46.825
<i>U.A. High School's sports festival!</i>

00:22:46.992 --> 00:22:49.536
<i>The first years</i>
<i>have finished their second game.</i>

00:22:50.204 --> 00:22:52.039
<i>The sixteen next-generation heroes</i>

00:22:52.206 --> 00:22:55.542
<i>moving on to the final round</i>
<i>have been decided!</i>

00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:58.212
IZUKU MIDORIYA

00:22:58.378 --> 00:23:00.464
Izuku!

00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:05.052
I'm so glad! You really worked hard!

00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:12.017
But just don't get injured!

00:23:13.477 --> 00:23:14.478
<i>It's the preview!</i>

00:23:14.645 --> 00:23:17.564
<i>Midoriya, All Might</i>
<i>has his eye on you, doesn't he?</i>

00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:20.484
<i>I'm not trying to pry about that.</i>

00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:21.735
<i>But I'm going to beat you.</i>

00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:24.196
<i>Todoroki, why are you going so far?</i>

00:23:24.363 --> 00:23:26.323
<i>I don't care what you are to All Might…</i>

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.033
<i>Your eyes are like ice!</i>

00:23:28.492 --> 00:23:29.535
<i>I will go higher than you.</i>

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.411
<i>Even if you say that,</i>

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:32.996
<i>there's a reason why I cannot lose!</i>

00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:36.416
<i>Next time, "The Boy Born with Everything."</i>

00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:39.044
<i>The Class A girls will cheer</i>
<i>with cheers of cheerleading!</i>

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:40.712
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:43.048
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
