00:00:01.585 --> 00:00:06.590
No matter what you say,
you are the criminal who hurt my brother!

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.178
That's why you'll die.

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:17.267
<i>My body won't move…</i>

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:22.314
Goodbye. You're an offering
to a more just world.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.483
I won't forgive you.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:26.944
I'll kill you!

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.696
Smash!

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.950
I came to save you, Iida!

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.702
You made me late.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.538
Midoriya?

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.956
Todoroki…

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.875
The two of us will protect them!

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.545
<i>Why are you two…</i>

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:45.671
<i>Why…</i>

00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:46.797
<i>Please, stop!</i>

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.759
<i>I've inherited my brother's name.</i>

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.094
<i>I have to do it…</i>

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.472
<i>That guy's mine!</i>

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:58.642
Sorry, Todoroki.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.019
Please stop…

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.480
I'm… already…

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:07.609
If you want us to stop, then stand up!

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.550
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.052
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.681
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.349
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:43.872
CLIMAX

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.709
<i>Do you know the Turbo Hero, Ingenium?</i>

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:48.961
Of course!

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:54.216
He's a really popular hero who has
65 sidekicks working at his Tokyo agency!

00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:56.468
He is my elder brother!

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.970
<i>He is a likable hero</i>

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.806
<i>who honors the rules</i>
<i>and leads people.</i>

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:05.394
I set my sights on being a hero
because I want to be like my brother.

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:09.439
<i>Iida…</i>

00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:12.150
<i>The only words I can say to you are:</i>

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.115
Look properly at what you want to be!

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.329
<i>Ingenium. It is the name</i>
<i>of the hero who will defeat you!</i>

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.875
<i>What kind of hero am I?</i>

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.086
<i>Protected by my friends…</i>

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.839
<i>Having them bleed for me!</i>

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.218
<i>Save that guy first.</i>

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.056
<i>Hero Killer: Stain.</i>

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:49.438
<i>In order to teach him a lesson,</i>
<i>I used my brother's name.</i>

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.065
<i>I only saw what was in front of me.</i>

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.569
<i>I couldn't see anything except myself!</i>

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.489
<i>Tenya, you want to be a hero, too?</i>

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:02.618
Yes. You're cool.

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:03.702
What are you, a robot?

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.496
Will you tell me something
for my future reference?

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.667
Why do you continue working as a hero?

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.838
Well, our grandfather
and parents were all heroes,

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:19.676
so I was expected to be a hero
by those around me.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.139
Anyway, it's simple, really.

00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:26.266
If someone sees a lost child,

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.769
they take the child to the service counter
for lost children.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.939
I think people like that are the coolest.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.651
Then why didn't you decide to work
at the service counter for lost children?

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.195
Think about what I'm saying!
What are you, a robot?

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.574
You really take everything literally, huh?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.955
You're way smarter and
more athletic than I was at your age, so…

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.665
Wait a sec.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.917
Then that means…

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:56.797
If you admire me, Tenya,
then I might be an amazing hero.

00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:00.509
<i>Because you're fakes.</i>

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.724
<i>It's just as you say, Hero Killer.</i>

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.059
From the right!

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.894
<i>I'm different from them.</i>

00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:16.149
<i>I'm immature.</i>
<i>I can't hold a candle to them!</i>

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:19.152
<i>Even so…</i>

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.448
Ice and flame.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.159
<i>I'd like to see you dodge </i>this<i>!</i>

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:28.078
No one's ever told you?

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:32.165
You're too focused on your Quirk.
You're being careless!

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.127
<i>He's a monster!</i>

00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:36.461
Todoroki!

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.465
<i>If I don't stand right now…</i>

00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:45.470
<i>I'll never, ever be able…</i>

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:51.143
<i>to catch up to them, or Tensei!</i>

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.644
<i>Damn it.</i>

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.271
<i>It stopped working, huh?</i>

00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:56.273
Recipro…

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.275
burst!

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:05.991
<i>He's fast!</i>

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:09.870
Iida!

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.413
You got free?

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.166
That Quirk isn't as great as I thought.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.880
Todoroki, Midoriya, this has nothing
to do with you two, and I apologize.

00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:22.716
You're saying that again?

00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:28.597
That's why I can't allow
you two to bleed more than this!

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:34.561
It's no use trying to be reformed
for appearance's sake.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.773
A person's essence
does not change so easily.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:42.486
You will never be anything but a fake
who prioritizes his own selfish desires.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:46.281
You are a cancer to society
that warps the idea of "heroes."

00:06:46.782 --> 00:06:49.535
Someone must set you straight.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.995
You're an anachronistic fundamentalist.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:55.374
Iida,
don't listen to the logic of a murderer.

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:58.418
No, he's right.

00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:02.047
I have no right to call myself a hero.

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:05.551
Even so,

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.720
I cannot give in.

00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:13.600
If I give in, then Ingenium will die.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.727
Out of the question.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.650
Idiot! The hero killer is after me
and that kid in white armor, right?

00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:24.069
Don't fight back.
It'd be better if you ran away!

00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:26.405
It doesn't look like he'll
give me an opening to do that.

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.408
Something clearly changed just now.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.201
He's flustered.

00:07:33.412 --> 00:07:35.163
<i>There's the uncertain element</i>
<i>of blood type,</i>

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.707
<i>and he needs</i>
<i>to get in close for it to work.</i>

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:39.626
<i>On top of that, it doesn't last very long…</i>

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.713
<i>Looking at just his Quirk,</i>
<i>he's not especially powerful.</i>

00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:46.258
<i>Taking on multiple opponents</i>
<i>alone must be hard for him to deal with.</i>

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:52.973
<i>He's gotten desperate trying to kill Iida</i>
<i>and this person before the pros come.</i>

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.392
<i>He's got crazy tenacity.</i>

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.732
<i>Oh no, Recipro's done.</i>

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.693
<i>Did I break the radiator</i>
<i>during my kick earlier?</i>

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:09.031
Todoroki, can you regulate temperature?

00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:11.325
I'm not used to it with my left yet. Why?

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.910
Freeze my legs!

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:15.287
Without plugging up the exhausts!

00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:16.747
You're in the way!

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.250
Iida!

00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:22.628
You stop, too!

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.215
-Iida…
-Just do it! Hurry!

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.176
I can move.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.678
Can I do it?

00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:35.265
No, right now…

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.312
Damn it!

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.316
<i>Thanks, Todoroki.</i>

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.652
<i>I will fight.</i>

00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:49.863
<i>I'll throw away my arm!</i>

00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:53.158
<i>Recipro…</i>

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.286
<i>Extend!</i>

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.874
<i>One For All…</i>

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.293
<i>Full Cowling!</i>

00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:05.504
<i>If I just…</i>

00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:08.632
<i>If I just…</i>

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:15.389
Go!

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.225
<i>…have my leg…</i>

00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:21.019
<i>…have my fist…</i>

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:26.233
<i>…that's all I need right now!</i>

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.405
MINUTES EARLIER

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:34.908
<i>He's fast! But…</i>

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.743
<i>Not faster than I can handle!</i>

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.912
Hey…

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.081
Stop it, you little…

00:09:48.172 --> 00:09:50.841
I do not know who you are, honored elder,

00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:53.510
but leave the rest to me.

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:55.304
Seriously?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.388
Why are you here?

00:09:57.014 --> 00:09:58.223
Isn't it obvious?

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.559
It's because I am a hero.

00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:05.772
Even though I used a lower temperature
as a warning,

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:06.982
this is the first time

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:08.567
anyone's been able to stay conscious
after being on the receiving end.

00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:10.819
Be careful!

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:12.321
This guy's…

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:20.579
Absorption and release, huh? But since
the damage from the absorption remains…

00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:22.831
It's just a small fry's Quirk!

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.708
That's strange…

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.085
No, Todoroki!

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:29.505
This guy's got multiple Quirks!

00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:33.425
I see, so that's how it is.

00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:36.178
<i>Those two bystanders ran away, right?</i>

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:37.971
In that case…

00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.109
I cracked the road…

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.028
It's been a while,
so my control's not great.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:56.823
Huh, you're not bad, honored elder.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.496
There should be a lot of heroes
gathered over there.

00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:05.499
It's been at least two or three minutes.

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:07.876
Even though they're all
gathered there… Good grief!

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:12.172
Let's restrain this guy quickly and turn
him over to the police so we can go help!

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.927
<i>Shoto, there's trouble! Follow me!</i>

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.847
I'll show you what it means to be a hero!

00:11:21.807 --> 00:11:22.850
<i>Midoriya…</i>

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.184
Shoto!

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.062
-It's just his location…
-Don't look at your phone, look at me!

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.064
Where are you going, Shoto?

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:31.984
An alleyway at 4-2-10 Ekou Street.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:35.320
If you finish what you're doing or
find any free pros, send them there.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.823
I'm leaving you
to take care of the trouble.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.158
I'm sure
you'll be able to resolve it quickly.

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.954
My friend might be in trouble.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.040
Shoto…

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:51.753
Leave that villain to my sidekicks.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.799
Honored elder, go now
to the address I'll give you.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:12:01.346
I, Endeavor, will be sufficient support
for those over there by myself.

00:12:03.015 --> 00:12:03.932
Go!

00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:09.980
<i>Did I release a little too much power?</i>

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:11.732
<i>It's not broken… is it?</i>

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.651
<i>They stopped him!</i>

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:15.903
<i>Here's my chance!</i>

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.783
I will defeat you!

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.410
This time, you, as a criminal…

00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:25.037
Keep after him!

00:12:28.165 --> 00:12:29.833
And I, as a hero!

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.518
Stand up! He's still…

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:02.199
He's probably knocked out
after all that… right?

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.286
Then, let's restrain him
and get out to the street.

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:08.372
Is there anything to tie him up with?

00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:10.541
Just in case, let's take
all his weapons off him.

00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:12.251
Good idea.

00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:17.506
He's too strong!

00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:21.844
-Damn it!
-Let's all attack him at once!

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:23.220
Right!

00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:29.017
Damn it, I can't see!

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:30.185
Where is he?

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.354
Run away!

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:41.780
Endeavor!

00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:50.789
He can regenerate, huh?

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.332
Then…

00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:55.544
How about this?

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.640
Carbonized cells cannot regenerate.

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:09.766
Look out!

00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:14.146
Those heroes with Quirks that
are not effective against the villain,

00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:16.732
go to Ekou Street,
District four to help there!

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:18.192
There's a villain there, too?

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.818
I don't know, but I'm counting on you!

00:14:26.325 --> 00:14:27.910
He's fast! Then…

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:47.888
I won't let you get away!

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:51.475
Native, can you move?

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:54.353
Yeah, I'm okay now.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.230
Um…

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.398
You hurt your legs, right?

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.317
Let me do this, at least.

00:15:00.484 --> 00:15:02.569
Thank you very much.

00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:04.238
That's my line.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.366
You can find anything
at a trash collection site.

00:15:07.783 --> 00:15:10.202
Todoroki, I'll pull it!

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.621
Your arms are all messed up, right?

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:16.083
Sorry…

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.545
Even though I'm a pro,
I was just in the way.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:23.549
No,
I don't think you could've done anything

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.551
one-on-one with the hero killer's Quirk.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:26.969
He's too strong.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:31.807
Fighting three-on-one with the guy making
mistakes himself, we still barely won.

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:36.478
He was probably flustered and
forgot about Midoriya's recovery time.

00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:39.231
And he wasn't able to deal with
Iida's last Reciproburst

00:15:39.398 --> 00:15:41.650
or Midoriya's movements.

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:46.697
Now, let's quickly get him to the police…

00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:48.991
Wha… Why are you here?

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:51.326
Gran Torino!

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:52.661
Gran Tor--

00:15:52.828 --> 00:15:54.580
I thought I told you to stay
seated on the bullet train!

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:56.206
Who's that?

00:15:56.373 --> 00:16:00.878
The hero I'm interning with,
Gran Torino. But why?

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:04.006
I was told to come here all of a sudden.

00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:07.843
Well, I don't really know what's
going on, but I'm glad you're okay.

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.637
Gran Torino, I'm sorry…

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.181
Jeez…

00:16:12.598 --> 00:16:15.642
<i>This part of him is also</i>
<i>exactly like Toshinori.</i>

00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:17.019
It's around here!

00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:18.145
Huh?

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:22.191
Endeavor told us there was
a request for help here, but…

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.358
Children?

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:24.860
Those injuries look serious!

00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:26.528
I'll call an ambulance right away!

00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:29.239
Hey, this is…

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.410
Don't tell me it's the hero killer?

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.121
-What?
-Call the police, too!

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:39.166
Can you walk?

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.877
If you prop me up, I can…

00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:43.045
And you?

00:16:43.212 --> 00:16:44.671
I only received minor injuries.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.089
But Iida is…

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:47.966
He's bleeding badly…

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.219
The ambulance will be here soon!
Until then…

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:51.345
You two…

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.724
You were injured because of me.

00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:58.810
I am truly sorry.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:03.023
I couldn't… see anything…

00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:05.858
through my anger…

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:10.113
I'm sorry, too.

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:15.410
Even though you were feeling
so cornered, I didn't notice at all.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.247
Even though we're friends…

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:24.670
Pull yourself together.
You're the class rep, right?

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:27.297
Yeah.

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:35.889
<i>The fight against the Hero Killer</i>
<i>probably only took about ten minutes.</i>

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:41.770
<i>But to us, it felt like a very long fight.</i>

00:17:43.272 --> 00:17:44.439
Get down!

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:47.860
A villain?

00:17:51.947 --> 00:17:53.156
-Hey!
-Midoriya!

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:56.118
There's blood! Did he escape
here after being beaten?

00:17:56.702 --> 00:18:01.415
<i>Oh no, if he gets too high, then I won't</i>
<i>be able to reach him with my Quirk!</i>

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:12.426
This society overgrown with fake heroes…

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:16.930
and the criminals who wave
their power around idly…

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.857
should all be purged.

00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:32.946
So noisy…

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.616
The idiots have come out, huh?

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:38.243
I'll dispose of them later.

00:18:43.207 --> 00:18:44.875
This is all…

00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:50.672
to create a more just society.

00:18:55.886 --> 00:18:58.138
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.390
What the hell?

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.143
Why'd that Nomu have to go and get killed?

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:05.896
Why is that kid there?

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:08.982
There's so much I want
to say that I can't keep up!

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.609
This is a mess!

00:19:11.777 --> 00:19:12.861
Why…

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:15.322
Why won't things go the way I want?

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.283
He saved the boy?

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.202
Idiot, he took a hostage!

00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:22.412
He killed someone with no hesitation.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.499
Anyway, get ready to fight for now!

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:27.793
Why are you all standing around
in a group?

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.546
The villain should've escaped this way.

00:19:30.963 --> 00:19:32.422
How are things on your end?

00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:34.925
Things got a little rough.

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:40.264
-But don't tell me that man is…
-Let go!

00:19:44.977 --> 00:19:46.520
Endeavor.

00:19:48.105 --> 00:19:49.523
Hero Killer!

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:52.693
Wait, Todoroki!

00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:05.205
You fake…

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:09.668
I must make things right.

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:16.675
Someone must be dyed in blood.

00:20:19.178 --> 00:20:22.764
I must take back
what it means to be a hero!

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:29.897
Come! Try and get me, you fakes!

00:20:32.608 --> 00:20:37.279
The only one I'll let kill me
is the true hero…

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:41.575
All Might!

00:21:05.641 --> 00:21:06.683
He's…

00:21:08.477 --> 00:21:10.687
He's unconscious.

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:19.863
<i>I heard later</i>

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:26.453
<i>that a broken rib had pierced</i>
<i>the Hero Killer's lung at that moment.</i>

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:30.082
<i>He hadn't licked anyone's blood,</i>

00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:33.669
<i>but at that place, for that one moment,</i>

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:39.508
<i>the hero killer was the only one who</i>
<i>stood up to fight against his opponent.</i>

00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:15.979
<i>The preview is here!</i>

00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:17.481
<i>And I am here, too.</i>

00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:19.983
<i>Why is it you, sir,</i>
<i>and not Young Midoriya?</i>

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.193
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:23:21.652 --> 00:23:23.111
<i>-I'm All Might.</i>
<i>-Who are you?</i>

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:25.656
<i>-I said, I am All Might…</i>
<i>-Toshinori?</i>

00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:26.782
<i>That's me…</i>

00:23:26.949 --> 00:23:28.033
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.702
<i>This is endless! But let's stop that…</i>

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:34.164
<i>Next time, "The Aftermath</i>
<i>of Hero Killer: Stain."</i>

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.001
<i>That young man called Todoroki</i>
<i>will become "The Hand Crusher"!</i>

00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:39.670
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.005
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
