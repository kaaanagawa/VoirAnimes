WEBVTT

00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:06.006
Kurogiri, get rid of these guys.

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:08.926
Everything I hate
came together in one set.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.011
A brat,

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.679
and a rude guy.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:13.972
Now, now.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.391
They came all this way to visit,

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:19.353
so let's at least hear them out,
Tomura Shigaraki.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.148
Besides,
that big shot broker brought them.

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.484
They're bound to be valuable assets.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.612
I don't care what you do with them,
but make sure I get my commission,

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:29.696
Kurogiri.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.575
At least let me introduce them.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.578
First, this cute high school girl.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:40.415
Her name and face were kept
tightly under wraps by the media,

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:44.127
but she's on the run as the suspect
in a series of deaths by blood loss.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.421
I'm Toga! Himiko Toga!

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:47.798
It's hard to live!

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.425
I want the world to become
an easier place to live!

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.219
I want to become Mr. Stainy!

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:53.971
I want to kill Mr. Stainy!

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.391
So let me join
the League of Villains, Tomura!

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.519
I don't get her. Is she crazy?

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.896
She can hold a conversation
for the most part.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.690
I'm sure she'll be of use.

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:06.400
Next, this guy over here.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.902
He hasn't committed any flashy crimes,

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.406
but he holds fast
to the hero killer's ideology.

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:13.782
I'm uneasy about this.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:17.578
Does this organization
really have a just cause?

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.081
Don't tell me you're going
to let this crazy woman in?

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:22.499
Hey, you.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:26.086
You can't even do what that crazy
high school girl was able to do.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.964
Give your name first.
You're an adult, right?

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:30.966
I currently go by Dabi.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.843
That's not what I want to know.
What's your real name?

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.554
I'll tell you when it's time.

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.933
Anyway, I will carry out
the will of the hero killer.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.896
You don't have to say
what you haven't been asked.

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:48.859
Jeez, everyone's so hung up
about Stain, Stain…

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:50.611
-I don't like it.
-You mustn't, Shigaraki!

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.905
I don't feel good.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.200
You're all no good!

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.917
Please calm down, Tomura Shigaraki.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.628
If what you wish is to come to pass,

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.880
then we must increase
the organization's numbers.

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:13.759
Strangely enough, we're in the spotlight
right now, so now is our chance.

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:16.053
We should not be rejecting them,
we should be receiving them.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:19.640
You must use it, all of it…

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.434
And all the ideology he left behind…

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:25.437
Shut up.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.564
Where are you going?

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.649
Shut up!

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:36.865
I don't want to complain about
a client, but… he's young. Too young.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.451
I thought he was going to kill us.

00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:41.828
He makes me sick…

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.207
Would it be all right to give
you an answer at a later date?

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.335
I believe he knows what he should do.

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:52.840
It's because he knows that
he left without saying anything.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.343
<i>All Might… Hero Killer…</i>

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.221
<i>He's been humbled twice already.</i>

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.224
<i>I'm sure he will reach an answer…</i>

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:06.270
<i>that both you and he himself</i>
<i>will be satisfied with.</i>

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:28.458
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.128
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:34.882
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.383
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.073
Everyone…

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.994
I'm looking forward to hearing
your stories about training camp…

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:49.957
We don't know for sure yet!
There might be a last minute twist!

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:53.377
Stop, Midoriya. If you say it out loud,
it'll probably jinx it.

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.671
If we failed the exams,

00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:58.131
then we'd have to skip training camp
and be in summer school hell.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.884
And since we didn't pass
the practical exam…

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.222
If you guys still don't get it,
then you're dumber than monkeys!

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.515
Calm down. That's too long.

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:08.851
I don't know, either.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.979
Our team passed thanks to Mineta,
but I was just sleeping the whole time.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.648
Anyway, since we don't know
how they're scoring it…

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.192
If you feel bad for us, then I don't know,
just bring me back lots of stuff!

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.028
Once the bell rings, get in your seats.

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.154
SILENCE!

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.447
Morning.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:26.410
Unfortunately, there are those
who did not pass the final exams.

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:29.496
Accordingly,
for the training camp in the woods…

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.290
everyone's going!

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.166
A last minute twist!

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:34.918
We can go, too?

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.920
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.090
Some failed,
but no one failed the written exam.

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:45.512
In the practical, Kirishima,
Kaminari, Ashido, Sato, and Sero failed.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.472
I knew it…

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.809
Just because my team passed didn't
mean I scored high enough not to fail…

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.396
For this time's exam,
we on the villain side

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.398
<i>made sure to leave a way</i>
<i>for the students to win</i>

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:58.734
<i>while watching to see how you all</i>
<i>would take on the task at hand.</i>

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:04.156
<i>If we hadn't, most of you would've</i>
<i>gotten stuck before you started.</i>

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.367
So when you said
you were really out to crush us…

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.994
That was to make you feel cornered.

00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:11.538
In the first place, the training camp
in the woods is one to increase strength.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:15.542
So those who failed need it the most.
They have to get stronger.

00:06:16.752 --> 00:06:18.795
It was a rational falsehood.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.048
"A rational falsehood"?

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.425
I was tricked again!

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.052
As expected of U.A.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:29.556
However, since you lied to us twice,
our faith in you will waver!

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.142
Wow, you're being a wet blanket, Iida.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.895
That's true. I'll consider that.

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:36.897
But I wasn't lying about everything.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.233
Failure is failure.

00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:43.028
We have prepared a separate
time for extra lessons for you all.

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.740
Frankly, it'll be tougher than the extra
lessons you'd get if you stayed at school.

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:52.621
Well, in any case,
I'm glad we can all go together.

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:55.082
A week of training camp, huh?

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:57.376
We'll have to bring a lot with us.

00:06:57.543 --> 00:06:59.461
I don't have a bathing suit or anything.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.004
I'll have to buy a bunch of stuff.

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.256
Night vision goggles--

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:06.301
Oh, then since we're off tomorrow,
and we just finished our exams,

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.137
why doesn't Class A
all go shopping together?

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.973
Oh, good idea!

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.516
Wouldn't that be the first time
we all hung out together?

00:07:12.683 --> 00:07:14.726
Hey, Bakugo, you're coming, too!

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.687
Like I'd do something so irritating.

00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:18.397
Will you come, too, Todoroki?

00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:20.065
I go visit my mom on our days off.

00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:21.316
You guys are such party poopers!

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.862
Get a clue, you clueless guys!

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.243
And so, here we are!

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.163
With the most stores in the prefecture,
the newest and coolest, most advanced

00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:37.374
Kiyashi Ward Shopping Mall!

00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.793
They don't just try to cover the various
body types due to Quirks by numbers,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.379
but they have designs that fit a wide
range of ages, from teens to seniors.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.132
You're scaring the children. Stop that.

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:47.134
Oh, aren't those U.A. students?

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.177
First years?

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.428
I saw them on TV!

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:51.930
Sports festival, yay!

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:55.184
Oh, there are still people
who remember that…

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.604
Anyway, I need to buy a big carry-on bag.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.190
Oh my,
then why don't we go around together?

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:04.568
Where can I get lock-picking
tools and small drills?

00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:07.571
I don't have any outdoorsy shoes,
so I want to go buy some.

00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:09.239
Oh, me too, me too!

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.325
The guide said to bring shoes
that are already broken in--

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:16.079
Oh, but I see, perhaps
we should choose based on utility?

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.332
Everyone has different things
they want to do,

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.125
so why don't we decide
on a time to meet back up?

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:21.335
I agree!

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:23.670
Then let's meet back here
at three o'clock!

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.339
Okay!

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.760
Everyone's really fast.

00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:30.886
Yeah.

00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:33.388
What about you, Uraraka?

00:08:33.554 --> 00:08:36.350
I want to get some heavier wrist weights.

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:37.976
I need bug spray…

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.188
<i>Do you…</i>

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.190
Bu…

00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:46.026
-Bug spray!
-I'm a bug?

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:48.195
<i>Dang it, Aoyama!</i>

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:50.864
<i>He's wrong, anyway!</i>

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.032
<i>I think.</i>

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:56.703
Even though
we all came together, I'm by myself…

00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:00.207
Oh, it's someone from U.A. Cool!

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:02.668
Let me have your autograph!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.338
You were the one who got all beat up
at the sports festival, right?

00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:07.756
Yeah…

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.050
<i>Wow, U.A.'s amazing.</i>

00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:13.095
<i>So many people watched</i>
<i>and remembered us…</i>

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.681
And weren't you also one of the guys

00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:18.350
who ran into the hero killer
in the Hosu incident?

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:19.685
That's so cool!

00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:21.228
You sure know a lot…

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.565
Man, I seriously can't believe it.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.650
I can't believe I'd see you again
in a place like this.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.321
It makes me feel
like there's something to it…

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:35.909
Something like fate, or destiny.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.538
But well,

00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:43.333
from your perspective, I guess we haven't
met since the attack on U.A., huh?

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.425
Why don't we have tea
or something, Izuku Midoriya?

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.929
Tomura… Shigaraki!

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:59.933
ENCOUNTER

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.273
<i>What meaning is there</i>
<i>in killing without conviction?</i>

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.152
<i>Just you watch, Hero Killer.</i>

00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:13.614
<i>Almost everyone is thinking,</i>
<i>"It's no skin off my back."</i>

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.158
<i>No, they're not even thinking that.</i>

00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:20.871
<i>No matter where someone tries</i>
<i>to kill someone else for whatever reason,</i>

00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:23.749
<i>these guys will just keep smiling</i>
<i>thoughtlessly and going on living.</i>

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.377
It's the hero killer!

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.962
Is this really okay?

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.881
You'll definitely get in trouble!

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.674
It's such a bad idea!

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.635
That's cool!

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.846
<i>But on the other hand,</i>

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:44.228
<i>you've got some sympathizers</i>
<i>who are far from your ideals.</i>

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.729
<i>What's up with that?</i>

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.317
<i>Aren't we doing the same thing,</i>
<i>you and me?</i>

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.737
<i>In the end, you just destroyed</i>
<i>the things you didn't like, right?</i>

00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:56.949
<i>What's up with that?</i>

00:10:57.783 --> 00:10:59.368
<i>What's the difference?</i>

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:07.000
Act natural, like I'm an old friend.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.794
Don't make a fuss, okay?

00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:11.213
Calm down and catch your breath.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.174
I want to talk to you.

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:16.385
That's all.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:20.264
Just try and do something funny.

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:21.890
It's simple.

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:25.769
The instant all five of my fingers
touch your neck,

00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:29.147
you'll start crumbling
from the skin of your throat.

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:33.026
You'll turn to dust in less than a minute.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.154
If you do that in a place
with this many people,

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:39.283
a hero will come
and catch you in no time…

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:41.034
I'm sure.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.871
But look at these guys.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.541
Even though anyone could wield
their Quirk at any time,

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.544
how can they smile and gather like that?

00:11:51.003 --> 00:11:55.799
When it comes down to it, laws and rules
assume that individuals have morals.

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:59.553
They're convinced
that there's no way anyone would do it.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:06.810
Before I'm caught I could
crumble twenty, no, thirty people…

00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:11.982
What do you want to talk about?

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.401
This is nice.

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:19.239
Since we've got this chance,
why don't we sit down and have a chat?

00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:24.119
Anyway, I hate everything,

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.123
but what pisses me off
the most right now is the hero killer.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.709
He's not with you?

00:12:30.876 --> 00:12:34.129
I didn't acknowledge it,
but that's how it ended up in the news.

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:36.673
That's the problem.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.010
Almost everyone is looking
at the hero killer.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:44.765
<i>The attack on U.A. and the Nomus</i>
<i>I released on Hosu City…</i>

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:46.892
<i>Everything was upstaged by him.</i>

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.354
No one's looking at me.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:51.855
Why is that?

00:12:52.523 --> 00:12:54.566
No matter how much he boasts,

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:58.612
in the end, he just destroyed
what he didn't like, right?

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:04.952
What do you think the difference
is between me and him, Midoriya?

00:13:08.664 --> 00:13:11.959
I got flustered and ended up
running at full speed.

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.423
<i>I bet Deku was really confused…</i>

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.425
<i>I feel bad leaving him like that.</i>

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.637
<i>Yeah, so I need to go back and apologize.</i>

00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:25.472
<i>Yeah, I need to go back…</i>

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:28.600
<i>No, that's not it. I'm just gonna</i>
<i>apologize when I go back…</i>

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.562
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.356
<i>It's not like I want</i>
<i>to go shopping with him or anything.</i>

00:13:34.523 --> 00:13:35.399
<i>In the first place,</i>

00:13:35.566 --> 00:13:38.277
<i>I just thought he was amazing for someone</i>
<i>who wanted to be a hero, like me.</i>

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.029
<i>Yeah, I'll go back.</i>
<i>No, it's not like that at all.</i>

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.657
<i>What Aoyama said was really ridiculous.</i>

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.953
What is the difference?

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:54.042
I can't understand
or agree with who you are.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.295
For the hero killer,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.299
<i>I don't agree with him,</i>
<i>but I can understand him.</i>

00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:04.219
Because for me and the hero killer,
it all started…

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.805
with All Might.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.308
This is all

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.603
to create a more just society.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.898
<i>At that time, I was saved…</i>

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:20.527
At the very least, he wasn't
destroying just because he wanted to.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.489
It's game over now.

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:25.532
Shall we go home?

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:30.662
<i>He didn't just abandon it in vain,</i>
<i>like you did.</i>

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:33.540
Even if the way he did it was wrong,

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.627
he was trying to live up
to his ideals, I think.

00:14:41.507 --> 00:14:42.966
It's like a weight off my chest.

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.178
I feel like I've connected the dots.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:49.431
Why the hero killer pisses me off,

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:52.017
and why you irritate me…

00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:54.561
I feel like I understand now.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:59.816
Everything's because of All Might.

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:02.319
<i>Yeah, that's it…</i>

00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:06.448
<i>When all's said and done,</i>
<i>that's where I ended up.</i>

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.994
What was I worrying so much about?

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:14.248
These guys are able to smile thoughtlessly

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.251
because All Might
is smiling thoughtlessly.

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:23.340
<i>It's because that trash</i>
<i>is smiling thoughtlessly,</i>

00:15:23.507 --> 00:15:26.343
as if there was no one he couldn't save!

00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:29.263
Oh, I'm so glad we could talk.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:32.099
It's great. Thanks, Midoriya!

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:35.185
I don't have to do anything different.

00:15:35.561 --> 00:15:36.937
Whoops, don't struggle.

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:38.730
Do you want to die?

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:41.692
You think it's okay for the masses to die?

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.905
It's so ironic, Hero Killer.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:51.869
I'm your opposite, but you let me live,
and now your ideals and convictions

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:55.289
will all become a stepping stone for me.

00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:58.750
Deku?

00:16:03.255 --> 00:16:06.508
A friend? No…

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.513
Get your hands off him…

00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:17.352
It's nothing! I'm fine!
So don't come close!

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:20.397
Oh, you had a friend with you?
Sorry 'bout that.

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:21.690
I'm off, then.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:24.568
If you try following me, I'll get angry.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.157
Deku!

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:32.826
Wait, Tomura Shigaraki!

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:34.870
Shigaraki?

00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:40.584
What is All For One after?

00:16:42.461 --> 00:16:43.837
Who knows?

00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:46.965
More importantly, you should be careful.

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:51.470
The next time we meet will likely be
when I have decided to kill you.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.189
<i>What meaning is there</i>
<i>in killing without conviction?</i>

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:07.986
<i>I had convictions and ideals</i>
<i>from the beginning, Hero Killer.</i>

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.780
<i>Nothing's changed.</i>

00:17:10.781 --> 00:17:15.618
<i>But everything I do from now on</i>
<i>will connect to that…</i>

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.414
<i>To make a world without All Might,</i>

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.710
<i>and expose just how fragile</i>
<i>that justice stuff is.</i>

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:29.216
<i>And from today,</i>
<i>I'll call that my "conviction."</i>

00:17:29.925 --> 00:17:34.638
The only one I'll let kill me
is the true hero…

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.850
All Might!

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:42.104
<i>Everything is because of All Might…</i>

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.025
<i>Uraraka reported the incident,</i>

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:49.862
<i>and the shopping mall</i>
<i>was temporarily closed.</i>

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:52.948
<i>The heroes and police in the ward</i>
<i>undertook an emergency investigation,</i>

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:55.951
<i>but in the end, they could not find</i>
<i>Tomura Shigaraki.</i>

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.079
<i>I was taken to the police station that day</i>

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.457
<i>and told Mr. Tsukauchi, who is</i>
<i>investigating the League of Villains,</i>

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:05.127
<i>about the principal offender,</i>
<i>Tomura Shigaraki's appearance</i>

00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:07.254
<i>and our conversation.</i>

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.218
From what I'm hearing, it sounds like
they aren't a monolithic organization.

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:17.389
But the part where he wants
to defeat All Might hasn't changed…

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.977
Anyway, thank you, Midoriya.

00:18:22.144 --> 00:18:23.937
Oh, welcome…

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.857
I wish I could've detained him, though.

00:18:27.024 --> 00:18:28.025
Don't worry about it.

00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:29.735
In fact, you did well holding up

00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:31.987
when your life
and the lives of others were at stake.

00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:34.948
Most people would get scared and panic.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:38.619
The fact that there were no victims
is thanks to you staying calm.

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.291
Young Midoriya! Tsukauchi!

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.961
All Might! Why…

00:18:48.504 --> 00:18:50.464
I had some personal business
to talk with him about.

00:18:50.923 --> 00:18:54.092
Oh good, I'm glad you're okay.

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:57.095
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.

00:18:57.888 --> 00:18:58.972
It's okay.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.940
Um, All Might…

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:08.982
What is it?

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:13.779
Do you also have times
when you can't save everyone?

00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:19.243
I do. A lot.

00:19:22.371 --> 00:19:27.334
Someone could be injured and passing
out somewhere in this world right now.

00:19:28.544 --> 00:19:30.504
It's frustrating, but I'm human, too.

00:19:31.255 --> 00:19:34.174
I can't save the people I can't reach.

00:19:35.634 --> 00:19:38.595
That's all the more reason
to stand and smile.

00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:44.977
So that the "Symbol of Justice"
can always be lit inside the hearts

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:48.856
of the people,
the heroes, and the villains.

00:19:51.275 --> 00:19:53.527
He's worried about what Shigaraki said.

00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:55.988
It's probably unjustified
resentment or something.

00:19:56.864 --> 00:20:01.034
He's never failed to save someone
after he arrived at the scene.

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.580
Now, it's getting late.

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:05.914
Someone's here for you.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:07.249
Izuku!

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.126
Mom?

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:10.627
Izuku!

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:13.672
Izuku, I can't take this anymore.

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.884
My heart can't take it…

00:20:18.969 --> 00:20:23.432
Sorry. It's fine. I'm fine. Don't cry.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:27.186
The heroes and the police
were taking good care of me.

00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:29.897
Sansa, make arrangements
to take them home.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:30.939
Yes, sir.

00:20:37.154 --> 00:20:39.781
This time it appears to have been
a coincidental meeting…

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:42.201
<i>But the possibility that he,</i>
<i>or another student,</i>

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:45.162
<i>will be targeted is pretty high.</i>

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:48.790
Of course,
we will continue to be on alert,

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:51.877
but the school should also be ready
to take some drastic measures.

00:20:52.044 --> 00:20:54.796
The stronger the light,
the greater the darkness.

00:20:56.173 --> 00:20:59.551
You should also consider leaving U.A.

00:21:00.344 --> 00:21:03.805
I've only been teaching
for a little more than three months.

00:21:05.349 --> 00:21:08.018
That's why I told you
before that you weren't cut out for it.

00:21:11.188 --> 00:21:14.900
Let's capture
All For One properly this time.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.443
Yeah.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.488
This time…

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.659
I'm counting on you again, Tsukauchi.

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:24.701
Yeah.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:34.127
<i>From the entrance exam</i>
<i>to the fitness test, combat training,</i>

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.631
<i>the League of Villains' attack,</i>
<i>the sports festival,</i>

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:41.885
<i>internships, the Hosu incident,</i>
<i>and the final exams…</i>

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:45.889
<i>A lot happened,</i>
<i>but my first semester at U.A. is over,</i>

00:21:46.849 --> 00:21:48.642
<i>and summer vacation</i>
<i>is about to begin.</i>

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:52.646
<i>But that doesn't mean we can</i>
<i>just think about having fun.</i>

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.898
<i>We need to be prepared</i>

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:57.401
<i>for the impending evil</i>

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.028
<i>in order to become true heroes.</i>

00:22:02.573 --> 00:22:06.785
<i>We do not have time</i>
<i>to just stand around.</i>

00:22:36.023 --> 00:22:38.734
You seem strangely happy, Master.

00:22:39.902 --> 00:22:43.906
Is it because the League of Villains
is growing steadily?

00:22:44.948 --> 00:22:46.491
That's not it, Doctor.

00:22:47.284 --> 00:22:50.746
It's because Tomura Shigaraki
has conviction now.

00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:57.920
The League of Villains needs people
who approve of his convictions.
