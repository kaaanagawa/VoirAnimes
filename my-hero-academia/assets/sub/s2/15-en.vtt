WEBVTT

00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:06.089
Up until now, I've insisted
on "using" One For All.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>I should've turned the switch</i>
<i>on throughout from the beginning!</i>

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.972
<i>Imagining the heat that used</i>
<i>to only be in one place…</i>

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:17.351
<i>spreading throughout my whole body!</i>

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.483
Wanna give it a try?

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:26.068
Yes.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:27.694
Please!

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.466
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.010
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:55.597
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.349
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:03.165
To keep One For All going
throughout your whole body.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:06.460
If you can move while maintaining that,

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.922
then you'll be completely different
from how you were at the sports festival.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.426
Now, what will you do?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.680
We'll start with three minutes.

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:21.475
Three… minutes?

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.145
Try getting a hit on me in that time!

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.402
<i>Crap, he dodged!</i>

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:34.780
Pathetic.

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:37.241
If you can't even react to this,

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.118
then you won't be able to save
those that could be saved.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.750
Someone extolled as the Symbol of Peace

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.503
would be able
to get over this wall in a jiffy!

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:52.589
One For A--

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.553
<i>It'll take time to get it going</i>
<i>through my whole body again…</i>

00:02:58.262 --> 00:02:59.888
<i>A single hit doesn't pack much punch,</i>

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.850
<i>but he's too fast to follow with my eyes!</i>

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.104
<i>Then, I just need a little time!</i>

00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:08.480
Come on!

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:09.815
Don't be stupid!

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.400
I can see you!

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:14.069
You won't be able to buy time like that!

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.157
<i>Now!</i>

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:21.785
You were trying to get me to stop moving,
huh?

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.328
You got me…

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:27.040
One For All…

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.709
Full Cowling!

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.296
Almost.

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:33.839
From behind!

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:37.509
That's the same as last time, kid!

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.853
Smash!

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.023
<i>He can dodge this?</i>

00:03:57.613 --> 00:03:58.739
Three minutes.

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.490
Damn it…

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:02.951
It's hard just to keep it going.

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.870
I've still got a long way to go.

00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:05.913
No,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.708
you were able to attack me when I was
unguarded through analysis and prediction.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.504
You think about a lot of stuff
normally, don't you, kid?

00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:19.760
<i>Just since yesterday you've already</i>
<i>changed a lot with just one attempt.</i>

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:25.182
<i>You made me dodge seriously</i>
<i>for the first time in a while.</i>

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.310
<i>This kid might become a monster.</i>

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:30.979
All right,
now you've gotta get used to it!

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.105
Let's keep right on going!

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.815
Yes, sir! Please!

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:35.317
But before that,

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.611
now that I think about it,
we haven't had breakfast yet.

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:39.863
We… haven't!

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.324
So go heat up the <i>taiyaki again…</i>

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:46.828
They fell!

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.456
I'll go buy more!

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.877
<i>I've still got a long way to go,</i>
<i>but I could see the light.</i>

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.755
<i>One For All: Full Cowling…</i>

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.675
<i>I'll definitely make it my own!</i>

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.096
MIDORIYA AND SHIGARAKI

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:09.142
Hi-yah!

00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:13.480
Don't do it aimlessly.
Make sure you focus on each action, see?

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.943
Because what counts the most in the end
is your basic physical strength.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.528
Yes, sir!

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.488
<i>He acts cute, too!</i>

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:23.574
It's lukewarm!

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.202
You two
can't even make a decent cup of tea?

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:30.247
Clients come to the office, you know!

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.918
What're you gonna do if you
can't even attend to them properly?

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.962
Sorry, Mr. Fourth Kind!

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:41.550
Jeez,
it's really satisfying to hit your Quirks.

00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:42.593
Yes, sir!

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.011
Thank you, sir!

00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:49.558
A hero must give the people
who need rescuing peace of mind.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.644
You must be capable, of course,

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.189
but your physical appearance,
speech, and actions

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.150
must be elegant if you're a hero.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.735
Do you understand?

00:05:59.902 --> 00:06:00.903
In other words…

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.280
Like this.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.699
Sure, Best Jeanist!

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.077
<i>I came to the wrong place…</i>

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:19.505
After this photoshoot,
she'll be a guest on a radio show

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.590
and a magazine interview, right?

00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:24.510
We're basically just her entourage.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:28.972
I think this is a necessary
part of being a hero, as well.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.350
I'm sure there is something to learn here.

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:34.353
I'm sure…

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.437
Probably…

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:37.397
<i>She doesn't want to accept it…</i>

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:45.739
Sorry to intrude so suddenly,

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.115
All Might.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.576
It's all right, Tsukauchi.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.870
Well, what did you find out?

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:55.249
Among those who attacked USJ,

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.627
there was the villain Nomu
that you drove back, right?

00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:01.755
<i>That strong guy, huh?</i>

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.592
We did some tests on Nomu's DNA.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.427
DNA tests?

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.470
Yeah.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.139
We're not asking for your help
in this investigation,

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.016
so I'd be leaking information,

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.853
but I felt like I just had to tell you.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.939
It's a clue to lead us to the mastermind.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.610
<i>After investigating Nomu</i>
<i>at a specialized institution,</i>

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.988
<i>we realized that it wasn't that Nomu</i>
<i>can't talk.</i>

00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:28.407
<i>There's no reaction no matter what we do.</i>

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.868
<i>He is literally</i>
<i>unable to think for himself.</i>

00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:32.953
And regarding his identity…

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.205
We found out that he was just a thug

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.624
with a criminal record
of assault and extortion.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.794
And you're saying
that's a lead to the mastermind?

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.172
Listen carefully.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.007
According to the report,

00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:48.927
there's DNA from at least
four completely different people

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.430
intermingled inside this thug's body.

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:55.809
DNA from at least four people
intermingled…

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.394
Is he even human?

00:07:57.853 --> 00:07:58.854
His whole body

00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:01.440
appears to have been tampered
with using drugs and other methods.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:07.654
To oversimplify a bit, he's been modified
so his body can hold multiple Quirks.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.240
The huge drop
in his brain's processing power

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.492
probably comes from
the burden that causes,

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.454
but well, what we're more
concerned about is his DNA…

00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.040
and how he has multiple Quirks.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.792
Even if different DNA is introduced,

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.337
unless there is some way
it can be completely integrated,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.632
the bearer would not have multiple Quirks.

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.927
You must understand,
since you have One For All.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:35.349
It's very likely that there is someone
with a Quirk that can give others Quirks.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.392
Don't tell me…

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:41.020
Looking at the circumstances,
it would be reasonable to assume such.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.691
That's why I thought
I had to let you know.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.156
Has that man…

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.202
started to move again?

00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:59.331
KARAOKE

00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:03.210
So, you want to add me to your numbers?

00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:06.213
No matter what you want to accomplish,

00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:07.965
it is necessary to have conviction
and desire.

00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:11.593
Those without it and those
who are weak will be weeded out.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.970
It's only natural.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.098
That's why it turns out like this.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.561
Oww… That's too hard.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.272
Kurogiri, take this guy back.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.275
I can't move my body.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.570
It must be the hero killer's Quirk.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.865
This society overgrown with fake heroes,

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.617
where the word itself
has lost its true meaning,

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.704
and the criminals who
wave their power around idly

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.874
should all be purged.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.418
Hey, wait a sec…

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:46.837
Not this palm…

00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:49.214
I'll kill you.

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:52.467
You sure talk a lot.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.219
Conviction?

00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:56.972
I don't have anything grand like that.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.266
If I had to say…

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:02.227
Yeah, it'd be All Might.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.398
I feel like I really want
to completely crush this society,

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:09.735
where trash like that gets worshipped.

00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:18.702
My last injury was finally
about to finish healing…

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:22.539
We don't have a healer in our party,
you know.

00:10:22.748 --> 00:10:25.584
Will you take responsibility for this?

00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:27.544
So that's who you are…

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:28.837
Huh?

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:32.049
It seems our goals oppose each other.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:35.219
However, we do agree on one thing.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.472
To destroy the present.

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:41.517
Stop messing around. Go home. Die.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.061
I'm the kind of person you hate the most,
right?

00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:46.188
I was testing your true motives.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.942
People show their true colors
when they're on the verge of death.

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:52.402
It's different,

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:56.698
but there is "desire," a warped
sprout of conviction living inside you.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.118
How will you bud?

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:05.749
It might not be too late to wait until
after I've seen that to dispose of you…

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.918
You're gonna dispose of me?

00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:09.378
He's moving.

00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:15.008
Kurogiri, I don't want someone
this crazy as a party member.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:19.680
Tomura Shigaraki, he will be
a great asset if he joins us.

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:22.599
The negotiations were successful.

00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:24.643
My business is done.

00:11:24.977 --> 00:11:27.729
Now, return me to Hosu.

00:11:29.106 --> 00:11:32.818
There are still things
I must attend to there.

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:44.371
Well, with the whole city on alert,
villains can't come out, huh?

00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:45.747
I wonder.

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.710
<i>Hero Killer: Stain.</i>

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:53.213
<i>I knew immediately</i>
<i>after I collected the information.</i>

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:56.842
<i>In the seven places</i>
<i>he has appeared so far,</i>

00:11:57.009 --> 00:12:00.137
<i>he always injured at least four heroes.</i>

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.890
<i>I don't know if there is a purpose behind</i>
<i>that, or if it's just a superstition,</i>

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.516
<i>but that's what always happens.</i>

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:07.811
<i>In Hosu, Tensei's still</i>
<i>the only one who was attacked.</i>

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:12.107
<i>Tenya… I'm sorry…</i>

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:19.489
<i>It's very likely that he will appear</i>
<i>in this city again.</i>

00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:24.953
<i>Come!</i>
<i>I will dispose of you with these hands.</i>

00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:28.457
INTERNSHIPS - DAY THREE

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:32.544
<i>Keeping the five percent</i>

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.213
<i>and attacking.</i>

00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:40.594
Let's stop now.

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:45.599
If you fight against my tactics more than
this, you might fall into weird habits.

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.268
I can't even think about tactics
right now. I'm still not used to this!

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.686
Please let me fight more!

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.355
No, that's enough.

00:12:52.648 --> 00:12:55.776
Change into your costume.
Let's move on to Phase Two!

00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:58.278
Huh?

00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:00.572
In other words…

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.033
Let's go fight some villains!

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.494
What? All of a sudden?

00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:07.162
If you only fight against me,

00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:10.165
then you'll have trouble when you
come across a completely different type!

00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:14.545
The next phase is to let you
experience different types and situations!

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.964
In the first place, this is an internship.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.341
Of course you'll be fighting villains.

00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:21.844
What you are saying is quite right,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.513
but I need more time to prepare myself…

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.141
You've already experienced
combat against villains, right?

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.228
Besides, we're not gonna touch
anything that big.

00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:34.606
We'll go on a little excursion.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.695
Because of the decreasing population
in this area, the crime rate is also low.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.531
The reason there are
a lot of hero agencies in urban areas

00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:44.575
is that there is a lot of crime.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:48.203
And the higher the population density,
the more trouble you'll find.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.457
Around Shibuya, you'll find lots of small
fights that break out on a daily basis.

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:55.377
By Shibuya, you mean the one in Tokyo?

00:13:55.544 --> 00:13:58.338
I didn't think I'd be wearing my
hero costume in such a fashionable town!

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.049
You wouldn't get to wear it
if you weren't with a hero, right?

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:04.219
Be happy that you'll get to display
it on such a wonderful stage!

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.013
Which means,

00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:08.682
we'll take the bullet train
from Kofu heading toward Shinjuku?

00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:09.725
Yeah.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.312
<i>We'll pass Hosu City…</i>

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:15.731
<i>I wonder how Iida's doing…</i>

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.192
<i>I'll try to get in touch with him later.</i>

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.234
SAME TIME - HOSU CITY

00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:21.737
We'll be patrolling Kyoto today, too.

00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:23.405
Sorry it's so monotonous.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:26.158
It's fine. It is actually better this way.

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:29.203
Hey.

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:31.538
This is kind of hard to ask,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.166
but you're chasing after
the hero killer, aren't you?

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.251
That's…

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.713
I couldn't think of any other reason
why you'd come to my agency.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.799
Oh, but I'm really glad you came!

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.009
It's just,

00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:46.887
you shouldn't act on a personal grudge.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.975
We heroes do not have
the authority to arrest or punish.

00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:56.730
The use of Quirks has been
allowed through their regulation.

00:14:57.064 --> 00:15:00.108
That is why, no matter what the reason,

00:15:00.526 --> 00:15:03.362
heroes must not use their Quirks
for themselves.

00:15:04.363 --> 00:15:06.990
If anyone used their Quirk
for their own selfish desires,

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.618
it would be a very serious crime.

00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:15.249
Oh, it's not that I'm saying
the hero killer isn't guilty.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.917
It's just because you seem so earnest,

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.877
like you'd focus on one thing
and ignore everything else,

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.128
so I was worried.

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:22.047
Thank you for the warning.

00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:24.800
Oh, it's fine as long as you understand.

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:26.802
Now, shall we go?

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:29.221
<i>But…</i>

00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:35.269
<i>But then… what am I supposed</i>
<i>to do… about these feelings?!</i>

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:48.448
Hosu City looks nicer than I expected.

00:15:48.824 --> 00:15:50.826
So, what are you gonna do?

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.245
I will reform this city.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.582
In order to do so, I require more victims.

00:15:56.999 --> 00:16:00.878
Is this what you meant the other day when
you said you had business to take care of?

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:03.213
I see you're someone who understands.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:06.258
Hey, what're you trying to say about me?

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:12.431
"Hero" is a title given only to those
who have accomplished great deeds!

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.516
There are too many…

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:16.935
Too many who act like heroes
but are really money-worshippers.

00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:20.564
Until this world realizes its mistake,

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.650
I will continue to appear.

00:16:26.612 --> 00:16:28.780
He talks all high and mighty like that,

00:16:29.323 --> 00:16:31.950
but basically he's trying to start
a grassroots movement, huh?

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.161
He's so noble I could cry.

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:36.496
You can't make fun of him too much.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.875
The reality is that in all the cities
where Stain has appeared,

00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:42.377
the crime rate has fallen.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.841
Some critics attribute this
to a rise in heroes' consciousness

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:50.219
and shoot him down, though.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:52.596
That's wonderful!

00:16:52.763 --> 00:16:55.641
Heroes are working hard to bring down
the cost of food, huh?

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:59.353
So the "hero killer"
is also a "hero breeder"!

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.481
It's too roundabout.

00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:06.652
We just can't agree at a basic level.

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:08.319
And he annoys me…

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:10.739
Kurogiri, bring out the Nomus.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:16.828
You think you can get away
with stabbing me?

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:20.207
If I want to kill you, I just will.
That's all.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.837
It'll be a wild contest.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:31.301
I'll crush your honor and your pride, sir.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.055
NEAR HOSU CITY

00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:39.935
Um, this train won't arrive
until night. Is that okay?

00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:41.311
That's why it's good!

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:44.356
There'll be more skirmishes then,
so it'll be more fun!

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:48.360
It doesn't sound fun,
but I guess I understand.

00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:53.240
Using his smartphone with
someone next to him! Kids these days!

00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:55.242
SEE YOU TOMORROW! (READ)
YEAH! SEE YOU TOMORROW, THEN! (READ)

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:57.327
TODAY I'LL BE PASSING NEAR HOSU!! HOW
ARE THINGS GOING WITH YOU, IIDA? (READ)

00:17:57.953 --> 00:17:59.955
<i>He read the message but didn't reply…</i>

00:18:01.123 --> 00:18:05.544
<i>Iida usually responds within</i>
<i>three minutes of reading the message…</i>

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.672
<i>We're almost at Hosu Station, huh?</i>

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.342
If you ever feel hopeless,
make sure you let us know.

00:18:12.843 --> 00:18:13.719
We're friends, right?

00:18:14.845 --> 00:18:15.929
Yeah.

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:20.726
Hey, look at that!

00:18:20.893 --> 00:18:22.269
That building just exploded!

00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:23.604
Where? Where?

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.938
What's going on?

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:26.148
Could it be a fire?

00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:28.817
<i>Passengers, please hold onto your seats.</i>

00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:36.200
What's with that--

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:37.993
A hero?

00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:45.792
-Nomu!
-Kid, sit down!

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:46.877
Grand Torino?

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:54.092
Grand Torino!

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:02.476
What is it?

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.853
What's going on?

00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:14.488
This is good. Let's make this flashy!

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:18.408
What did you say? A villain appeared?

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.911
All right. We'll head over right away!

00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:23.163
Tenya!
We're gonna run!

00:19:24.623 --> 00:19:25.499
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:26.750
<i>No, this is different.</i>

00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:29.127
<i>That guy wouldn't be so flashy…</i>

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.183
So noisy…

00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:45.519
The idiots have come out, huh?

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.896
I'll dispose of them later.

00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:50.023
Right now…

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:53.068
I will do what I should be doing.

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:57.406
My body… won't move…

00:19:57.948 --> 00:19:59.408
You bastard!

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.034
Die!

00:20:01.577 --> 00:20:03.662
If you call yourself a hero,

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:06.331
you should choose your last words
carefully.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.385
A child wearing a suit…

00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:21.096
Who is he?

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:27.603
Go away. This is not a place for children.

00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:33.525
A scarf as red as blood,
carrying blades all over your body…

00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:36.820
You must be the Hero Killer: Stain!

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:38.655
You are, aren't you?

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.116
I have been chasing you!

00:20:41.617 --> 00:20:44.203
I did not think I would find you so soon!

00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:46.705
I am…

00:20:47.206 --> 00:20:49.791
Your eyes… Are you here for vengeance?

00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:52.336
Be careful of what you say.

00:20:52.586 --> 00:20:56.048
Depending on the situation,
even children may become my targets.

00:20:57.257 --> 00:21:00.928
Are you saying that I am not
even a target?

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.431
Then listen, criminal!

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:10.229
I am the younger brother
of a hero you attacked.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.776
The younger brother
of a most excellent older brother!

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:21.281
I have come to stop you in his place!

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:25.869
<i>Will you take this name for me?</i>

00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:30.082
Remember my name for as long as you live!

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:36.964
Ingenium. It is the name
of the hero who will defeat you!

00:21:38.674 --> 00:21:39.842
I see.

00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:42.761
Die.

00:23:13.727 --> 00:23:14.978
<i>Here's the preview!</i>

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:17.564
<i>Hosu City</i>
<i>is under attack by villains, where…</i>

00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:19.691
<i>I have found you, Hero Killer: Stain!</i>

00:23:20.108 --> 00:23:22.152
<i>I am the younger brother</i>
<i>of a hero you attacked!</i>

00:23:22.694 --> 00:23:24.738
<i>So this is the reason</i>
<i>why Iida chose this internship…</i>

00:23:24.905 --> 00:23:26.907
<i>My older brother was an upstanding hero!</i>

00:23:27.616 --> 00:23:30.661
<i>I will not forgive you.</i>
<i>I'll… I'll kill you!</i>

00:23:31.328 --> 00:23:34.331
<i>Next time, "Hero Killer:</i>
<i>Stain vs U.A. Students."</i>

00:23:34.998 --> 00:23:38.961
<i>Ingenium. It is the name</i>
<i>of the hero who will defeat you!</i>

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:40.254
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:42.172
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
