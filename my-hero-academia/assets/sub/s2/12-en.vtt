00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.546
<i>As I watched the ice guy,</i>

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.132
I thought, "I can't beat him!"

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:11.637
Damn it!

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:15.849
Hey, you too, Deku!

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.101
I'm just…

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.270
I'm just getting started!

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:21.730
You hear?

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:24.858
Here, I will become number one!

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:26.401
Midoriya.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:28.779
I'm going to beat you.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.366
<i>I pledge…</i>

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:34.451
<i>That I'll be number one.</i>

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:37.746
Bastard, don't declare war

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.290
to the wrong person!

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.167
-Not yet!
-What?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.045
We're gonna get
an indisputable first place!

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.965
Die!

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.510
Stun Grenade!

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:56.014
<i>Bakugo wins!</i>

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:01.687
<i>With this, the final match will be</i>
<i>between Todoroki and Bakugo!</i>

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.862
PLAYER WAITING ROOM 2

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:41.912
<i>Shoto's…</i>

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.167
That child's left side
sometimes looks very unsightly to me.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.003
Come at me with your full power!

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.048
It's your power, isn't it?

00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:58.178
<i>I wonder when it started.</i>

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.473
<i>Until I fought with Midoriya,</i>

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:05.185
<i>I didn't even think</i>
<i>about thinking about it.</i>

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.565
<i>Mom, I…</i>

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.278
Huh?

00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:17.698
Hey, why are you here?

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:19.283
It's waiting room…

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.535
Oh, this is room two? Damn it!

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.038
IRRITATED

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.916
I may have gotten the room wrong,

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.378
but what's with that attitude
against your opponent in the final?

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.963
Hey, hey, hey…

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.258
Where are you looking,
Half-and-Half Bastard?

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.137
That's…

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:41.388
Huh?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.432
What Midoriya said to me, too.

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.227
That guy

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:51.398
acted recklessly and came to destroy
all the problems I'd been carrying.

00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:54.568
You guys are childhood friends, right?

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.946
Was Midoriya like that
when you were young, too?

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:03.619
You looked like you were asking for help…

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.830
Are you all right? Can you stand?

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.542
That damn nerd…

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.420
Who cares about him?

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:14.922
Seriously,

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.423
who the hell cares?

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:21.220
Your family circumstances,
and your feelings…

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.096
I don't care about that stuff!

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.517
Just use the flames
on your left on me, too!

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.103
I will hold them down from above.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.031
<i>I'll crush that half-and-half</i>
<i>bastard indisputably,</i>

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.575
<i>and then I'll be at the top!</i>

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:48.455
TODOROKI VS. BAKUGO

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.807
<i>It's finally the last battle</i>
<i>of the U.A. High School sports festival!</i>

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:10.394
The top of the first years will be decided
with this one match!

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:12.020
FINAL
SHOTO TODOROKI VS KATSUKI BAKUGO

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:15.232
<i>The final, so to speak!</i>

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.360
<i>From the hero course, Shoto Todoroki!</i>

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:19.820
<i>Versus…</i>

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.364
<i>Also from the hero course, Katsuki Bakugo!</i>

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.870
<i>Now… Start!</i>

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:35.419
Damn it!

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.757
<i>Todoroki gets a blow in right away!</i>

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:43.093
<i>Is he trying</i>
<i>to avoid close combat with Bakugo?</i>

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.762
Has the winner been decided already?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.639
It's not on the same scale
as in his match with Sero.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.476
He aimed his attack
while being careful of what'll come next.

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:00.360
What's that sound?

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.112
It's Bakugo's doing.

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.456
Did he dig his way out through the ice
like a mole with his explosions?

00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:14.082
That's so weird!

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.838
The stronger the Quirk…

00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:26.094
The more imprecise the attacks!

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.599
He avoided his right side
and grabbed him?

00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:31.642
Wow!

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.352
Are you underestimating me?

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:35.562
Idiot!

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.819
<i>He avoids going out</i>
<i>of bounds with a wall of ice!</i>

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.905
<i>Looks like fun!</i>

00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:52.454
Use your left!

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.541
Use it, Shoto!

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.132
Stop screwing around.

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:09.137
Am I not strong enough to make you use it?

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.057
<i>With the way he grabbed</i>
<i>Todoroki's left side on purpose</i>

00:07:12.224 --> 00:07:13.976
<i>and timed his explosions…</i>

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.310
<i>He's been doing his research.</i>

00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:18.939
That kid's abilities shine
every time he fights.

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:20.107
I see.

00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:23.944
<i>Todoroki's moving well, too,</i>
<i>but his attacks are too simple.</i>

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.407
<i>Ever since the match</i>
<i>with Midoriya, he's lost his touch.</i>

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.285
Bastard…

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.996
I'll show you what'll happen
if you make a fool of me!

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.789
I'll kill you!

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:39.793
I want an indisputable first place!

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.172
I can't get that even if I beat scum
that underestimates me!

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.466
There's no point if I can't
get higher up than Deku.

00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:49.970
If you have no intention of winning,
then don't stand in front of me!

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:54.308
Why are you standing here, damn it!

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:59.563
I want… to be a hero, too!

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.066
<i>Sorry, Bakugo.</i>

00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:09.948
<i>Ever since I fought Midoriya,</i>
<i>I became unsure of what I should do.</i>

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:13.744
<i>Of whether or not I was correct…</i>

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:17.456
Todoroki!

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.042
Don't lose! Do your best!

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:22.961
<i>Midoriya!</i>

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:24.671
That damn nerd!

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.600
<i>That's it!</i>

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:38.352
<i>That's it!</i>

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.440
<i>If you're gonna stand in front of me,</i>

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.360
<i>then you should just concentrate</i>

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:47.611
<i>on winning!</i>

00:08:55.494 --> 00:08:56.912
Howitzer…

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.914
Impact!

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.010
<i>He added momentum</i>
<i>and rotation to the huge blast</i>

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.012
<i>he showed us in his fight with Uraraka!</i>

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.640
He was like a human projectile!

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:19.476
<i>It looks like Todoroki</i>
<i>didn't fire off the huge blast</i>

00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:21.603
<i>he used in his match with Midoriya,</i>

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.440
<i>but the winner is…</i>

00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:30.988
Huh?

00:09:31.947 --> 00:09:34.491
You put out your flames!

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.040
Huh?

00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:48.881
Hey…

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.302
Hey!

00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:56.722
Stop screwing around!

00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:00.726
Didn't I tell you
that there was no point, damn it?

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:04.021
To get first place like this! Like this?

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:05.939
Like…

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.458
<i>Todoroki is out of bounds!</i>

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:27.044
<i>Which means, Bakugo wins!</i>

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.381
KATSUKI BAKUGO

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:34.426
<i>And now,</i>
<i>all of the events have been completed!</i>

00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:37.888
<i>The winner of this year's first-year</i>
<i>U.A. sports festival is…</i>

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:42.518
<i>From Class A, Katsuki Bakugo!</i>

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.024
<i>All of the first-year events</i>

00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:51.902
<i>for this year's U.A. sports festival</i>
<i>have been completed.</i>

00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:55.614
<i>And now, we will begin the award ceremony!</i>

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:08.752
Wow…

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:09.920
What the heck?

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.923
He's been struggling ever since waking up.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.424
But man…

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.886
That first place is all over the place.

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:20.389
He is like a man-eating fiend.

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:29.940
<i>In addition to Tokoyami,</i>
<i>there is also Iida in third place,</i>

00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:35.237
<i>but he left early for family reasons.</i>
<i>Thank you for your understanding!</i>

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:36.697
Was that for the media?

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:40.158
That's too bad. Iida was really into it.

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:42.536
Yeah.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.038
<i>Uraraka, Midoriya.</i>

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.791
This is sudden, but I must leave early.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.960
A villain got my older brother.

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:53.172
-Your brother? You mean Ingenium?
-Yeah.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.798
How's he doing?

00:11:55.132 --> 00:11:57.009
I don't know the details.

00:11:57.176 --> 00:11:59.595
So I'm going to go visit him directly
to see.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:06.226
<i>He is a likable hero who honors</i>
<i>the rules and leads people.</i>

00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:10.355
<i>I set my sights on being a hero</i>
<i>because I want to be like my brother.</i>

00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:12.733
<i>Ingenium…</i>

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:14.985
<i>For Iida's sake too,</i>

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:18.405
<i>I hope that you're okay.</i>

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.163
<i>Now, we will award the medals!</i>

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.000
<i>The presentation of the medals will,</i>
<i>of course, be by this man!</i>

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.588
It's All Might!

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:40.219
-<i>Our very own hero, All Might!</i>
-I have brought the medals here!

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:44.765
I talked over you…

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.976
This year's first years are so lucky.

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:50.938
They've got the number one hero
watching them!

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.900
Now then, All Might, please present
the medals, starting with third place.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.154
Young Tokoyami, congratulations.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.156
You sure are strong.

00:13:01.323 --> 00:13:02.824
You are too kind.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.076
However,

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:06.453
in order to fight well
against different types,

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.455
you must not rely only on your Quirk.

00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:10.082
If you train your own strength more,

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:11.792
then you'll have more options
when you fight.

00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:15.212
Yes, sir.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.048
Young Todoroki,

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.175
congratulations.

00:13:21.677 --> 00:13:25.848
I assume there is a reason you did not use
your left side in the final?

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:29.268
I had an opportunity during
my match with Midoriya,

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.812
but then I became unsure of myself.

00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:36.692
I think I understand a little
of why you are interested in him.

00:13:37.943 --> 00:13:40.237
I wanted to become a hero like you.

00:13:40.863 --> 00:13:45.909
But I didn't think it would be right
for me to be the only one to break away.

00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:50.998
There is still something I must settle.

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:55.544
The look on your face
is completely different from before.

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:58.297
I won't ask about the details.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.258
I'm sure that you will be able
to do what you need to do.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.093
Yes.

00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:05.929
Now then, Young Bakugo!

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.265
This is too much.

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:13.395
Good job doing what you said
you would during the player pledge!

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.814
All Might…

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.400
First place like this…

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:21.987
is not worth anything!
Even if the world recognizes it,

00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:25.324
if I don't recognize it myself,
then it's trash!

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.034
<i>His face is amazing…</i>

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:28.827
Right.

00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:31.830
In this world where people
are constantly being compared publicly,

00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:36.376
there are not many who can keep aiming
for the top of an unchanging scale.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.379
<i>His face is amazing…</i>

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.759
Take this medal, okay?

00:14:43.926 --> 00:14:46.887
Think of it as a "wound,"
so you never forget!

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:49.139
I said I didn't want it!

00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:50.390
Now, now.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.643
I told you, I don't want it!

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:53.685
Here.

00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:58.565
<i>Well, they were the winners this time!</i>

00:14:58.899 --> 00:14:59.900
<i>But listen here!</i>

00:15:00.526 --> 00:15:04.530
<i>Anyone here could have ended up</i>
<i>on these podiums.</i>

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.032
<i>It's just as you saw.</i>

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:13.163
<i>Competing! Improving each other!</i>
<i>And climbing even further!</i>

00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:15.457
<i>The next generation of heroes</i>

00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:17.876
<i>is definitely sprouting!</i>

00:15:18.544 --> 00:15:20.254
<i>So, I have just one more thing to say!</i>

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:22.840
<i>Everyone, please say it with me!</i>

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.008
<i>Ready, go!</i>

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:28.679
-<i>Thanks for your hard work!</i>
-Plus Ultra!

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.600
What? It should've been
"Plus Ultra!" there, All Might!

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:37.187
Well, I thought everyone worked hard…

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:43.902
<i>The phrase "worthy opponent"</i>
<i>can also mean "friend."</i>

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.530
<i>It might set my teeth on edge,</i>

00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:49.491
<i>but it was a day</i>
<i>where we had no choice but to feel it.</i>

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.618
Good work.

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:55.038
So there will be no school tomorrow
or the day after.

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.791
I'm sure the pro heroes
who watched the sports festival

00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.376
will want to recruit you,

00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:02.880
but we'll consolidate everything
and announce it when you get back.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.383
-So rest well, and look forward to that.
-Yes, sir!

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:08.552
<i>And then,</i>

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:14.600
<i>the environment we were in started</i>
<i>to change gradually.</i>

00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:18.228
HOSU GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.399
Please do not run in the halls!

00:16:25.861 --> 00:16:26.778
Mother!

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:28.739
Tenya!

00:16:28.906 --> 00:16:29.990
How is Tensei doing?

00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:31.783
Tensei!

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.453
Tenya, keep your voice down
and put on a mask…

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:37.372
The anesthetic wore off earlier,
and he regained consciousness.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.208
He is still in a haze.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.877
If he had come into surgery two minutes
later, it would have been too late.

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:47.424
Tenya… Mother…

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.888
Tensei! Big brother Tensei!

00:16:54.306 --> 00:16:55.599
Even though…

00:16:56.099 --> 00:17:01.355
Such an accomplished younger brother…
like you…

00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:03.023
looks up to me…

00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:10.030
<i>I'm sorry… Tenya…</i>

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:15.536
Your big brother… lost…

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.873
<i>Tensei!</i>

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.132
-Shoto, where are you going?
-The hospital.

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.134
What? All of a sudden? Why?

00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:34.596
Wait, Shoto, is it okay not to tell Dad?

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:35.639
Yeah.

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:39.935
Why do you want to see Mom now,
after all this time?

00:17:41.562 --> 00:17:42.604
I'll be back.

00:17:47.276 --> 00:17:48.902
It went "bam!" and blew him away!

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.363
-It was amazing! So cool!
-That's amazing.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.156
"Bam!" and "Crash!"

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.325
-Oh, that's so cool.
-Yeah!

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.330
<i>Mom, I'm going crazy…</i>

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:02.332
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.836
<i>Every day, the children seem</i>
<i>to become more and more like him.</i>

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:07.963
<i>Shoto's…</i>

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:13.802
<i>That child's left side</i>
<i>sometimes looks very unsightly to me.</i>

00:18:14.178 --> 00:18:17.723
<i>I can't raise him anymore.</i>
<i>I feel like I shouldn't…</i>

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:26.023
<i>Ever since that day, I thought</i>
<i>my presence would put pressure on Mom,</i>

00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:28.233
<i>so I never went to see her.</i>

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.905
<i>I'm sure she continues</i>
<i>to be bound by me…</i>

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:35.157
<i>By Dad…</i>

00:18:35.324 --> 00:18:36.783
MRS. TODOROKI

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.328
<i>That's why,</i>
<i>in order to aim to become a hero</i>

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:42.623
<i>again with this body,</i>
<i>with everything I have…</i>

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:54.343
<i>It's okay for you</i>
<i>to become who you want to be.</i>

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:59.431
<i>In order to become my ideal hero,</i>

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.600
<i>I need to see her and talk to her…</i>

00:19:02.768 --> 00:19:04.895
<i>There's so much we need to talk about…</i>

00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:13.362
Mom…

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:30.254
<i>Even if she doesn't want it,</i>
<i>I will rescue her from here.</i>

00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:35.050
<i>That is my starting line.</i>

00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:37.970
<i>That is how I feel.</i>

00:21:11.897 --> 00:21:13.815
For lunch today, I'll have…

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:17.361
Something cheap. Hmm…

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:19.905
Mochi!

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:23.825
Huh?

00:21:27.246 --> 00:21:29.414
The door's unlocked?

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.124
Ochaco!

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:35.671
-We're here!
-Dad, Mom?

00:21:35.838 --> 00:21:37.714
Why are you guys here?

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:39.424
We came to throw you an after-party.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.136
Seeing our daughter trying so hard,
we couldn't not come running.

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:44.972
What? What about work?

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:46.265
Did you come on the bullet train?

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.976
What?

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:52.354
At least say something first!

00:21:52.813 --> 00:21:54.898
Seven times! Isn't that crazy?

00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:56.650
Yeah…

00:21:56.817 --> 00:21:59.778
Ever since the cavalry battle,
I lost consciousness seven times!

00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:02.656
The last two times were
pretty much from dehydration.

00:22:02.823 --> 00:22:05.576
You were way more heroic than me, huh?

00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:07.327
Of course!

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:09.580
Suddenly hearing that you had a Quirk,

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:12.583
and having that Quirk
be a super risky power.

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:16.879
It was a sudden variation or something
that isn't impossible medically speaking,

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.630
and anyway, now I have a Quirk…

00:22:18.797 --> 00:22:21.967
Anyway, I'm so glad!

00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:27.264
I'll support you,
but that doesn't mean that I don't worry.

00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:29.641
Yeah.

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:34.688
<i>I just keep going</i>
<i>after what I yearned for,</i>

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.566
<i>but that made those watching me worry.</i>

00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:41.278
<i>In order to become</i>
<i>a cool hero who can smile</i>

00:22:41.445 --> 00:22:43.572
<i>and live up to everyone's expectations,</i>

00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:49.036
<i>I need to be able to do things</i>
<i>in a way that won't make others worry.</i>

00:22:49.912 --> 00:22:54.208
<i>That's the starting line where</i>
<i>I can finally say, "I am here!"</i>

00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:57.419
Izuku! Do you want to watch
the recording? It's in HD! HD!

00:22:57.586 --> 00:23:00.214
I'll watch later by myself…

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.885
Die!

00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:07.012
Damn germs!

00:23:07.888 --> 00:23:10.557
Katsuki, don't wake up at noon
and start yelling!

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.353
<i>Here's the preview!</i>

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.814
<i>At the next hero informatics class,</i>
<i>we'll be coming up with code names.</i>

00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:19.983
<i>Hero names</i>
<i>for the upcoming hero internships.</i>

00:23:20.484 --> 00:23:22.152
<i>We're gonna do something exciting!</i>

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:25.822
<i>Show what kind of hero you want</i>
<i>to be in the future in your name.</i>

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.700
<i>It's obvious what mine should be,</i>
<i>but with my current abilities,</i>

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:30.244
<i>I don't have the right</i>
<i>to call myself that.</i>

00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:31.787
<i>Hurry it up.</i>

00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:33.163
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

00:23:33.664 --> 00:23:35.499
<i>Next time, "Time to Pick Some Names."</i>

00:23:35.666 --> 00:23:38.877
<i>With this, most of the hero names</i>
<i>for Class A have been decided.</i>

00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:40.796
<i>-"Most"?</i>
<i>-Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.963 --> 00:23:42.422
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
