00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.213
<i>The world has become a superhuman society,</i>

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.217
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>In this world swirling with chaos,</i>

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.471
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:15.265
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.517
<i>Heroes of justice</i>

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.478
<i>fighting villains</i>
<i>and saving people from distress.</i>

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:22.439
<i>Yes,</i>

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.735
<i>this is the story of how</i>
<i>I became the greatest hero.</i>

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.871
<i>The feelings of the three</i>

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.290
<i>who trust in me…</i>

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:07.878
<i>I'm carrying all that right now!</i>

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.673
I took the one on his head
where his guard was the weakest.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.635
Midoriya, this was thanks to the opening

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.887
you created with your last spurt.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.932
<i>In fourth place, Team Midoriya!</i>

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:24.186
<i>They will advance to the final round!</i>

00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:28.774
THE BOY BORN WITH EVERYTHING

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.569
<i>Now, we'll break for lunch</i>
<i>before we start the afternoon festivities!</i>

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:33.654
<i>See ya!</i>

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.572
I'm hungry!

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.616
-Food!
-Let's hurry up and go eat.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.621
So… What did you want

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.414
to talk about?

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:53.590
If we don't hurry, the cafeteria
will probably be really crowded.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.677
Um…

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:02.975
<i>He gives off a cold intimidation,</i>
<i>different from Kacchan…</i>

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:05.644
I was overpowered.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.898
So much so that I broke my pledge.

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:14.903
<i>He didn't use it</i>
<i>even if it would be to his advantage…</i>

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.822
<i>His left side…</i>

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:24.454
Iida, Kaminari, Yaoyorozu,
Tokoyami, Uraraka…

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.081
None of them felt it.

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:27.749
<i>At that last instant,</i>

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.295
<i>I was the only one who was overpowered.</i>

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.880
<i>Only me,</i>

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.049
<i>who had experienced</i>
<i>All Might's full power up close.</i>

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:41.096
What… does… that mean?

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:46.059
It means I felt something similar
coming from you.

00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:50.397
Midoriya, are you…

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.068
All Might's secret love child
or something?

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.447
Secret love child?

00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:02.576
All Might has his eye on you, doesn't he?

00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:07.039
<i>I see… So that's what he was thinking!</i>

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:08.332
Well? Are you?

00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:10.626
That's not it!

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.586
I mean, even if I was,

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:15.422
I would say I wasn't,
so I don't think you'd believe me,

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.173
but anyway, that's not how it is…

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.469
In the first place,
let me ask <i>you</i> something…

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:22.137
Why do you think that about me?

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:24.431
Since you said, "that's not how it is,"

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.394
that means there's a connection between
you two that you can't talk about, right?

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.942
Endeavor's my old man.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:39.154
I'm sure you know that he's been stuck
as the number two hero for forever.

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:45.160
If you have something
from the number one hero, then I…

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.205
I have even more reason to beat you.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:49.665
<i>Hey!</i>

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.209
Long time no see!

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:54.253
Let's have tea, Endeavor!

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.214
All Might…

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.803
I haven't seen you since that talk
we had with the press ten years ago, huh?

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.348
I saw you, so I thought I'd say hi.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:10.644
I see.
Well, you've already done that. Leave me.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.898
Tea? What a joke.
I'm going to the restroom. Begone!

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.237
Don't be so cold!

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.616
Your son, Young Shoto,

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:28.745
did wonderfully
without even using half of his power.

00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:30.414
Is it because he was taught well?

00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:33.166
What are you trying to say?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.170
Why, I seriously want to know

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.755
how to raise the next generation.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.426
Do you think I'd tell you?

00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:45.345
You look clueless as usual,

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.514
and it's getting on my nerves.

00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:50.309
Sorry…

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:54.563
Just remember this.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:59.401
I will make that into a hero
that will surpass you one day.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.654
That was why I created him.

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.157
What are you?

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:09.077
He's in his rebellious stage right now,

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.121
but he will definitely surpass you.

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:12.831
I will make sure of it!

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:19.296
<i>My old man has a strong</i>
<i>desire to rise in the world.</i>

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:23.133
As a hero, he won a name
for himself with crushing force.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.305
Because of that, the living legend,
All Might, is a great eyesore to him.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.019
Since he couldn't surpass All Might,
he moved onto his next plan.

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:36.063
What are you talking about, Todoroki?

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:39.483
What are you trying to tell me?

00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:42.819
You've heard of Quirk marriages, right?

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:45.906
That thing that became a problem

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:49.576
for the second and third generation
after superpowers appeared.

00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:52.287
<i>Choosing a spouse based only on</i>

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:55.624
<i>strengthening your own Quirk</i>
<i>and passing it onto your children,</i>

00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.459
<i>forcing people into marriage.</i>

00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:01.129
<i>The old-fashioned way of thinking brought</i>
<i>about by a lack of ethics.</i>

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:04.049
<i>He is a man</i>
<i>with both accomplishments and money.</i>

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:09.513
<i>He won over my mother's relatives</i>
<i>and got a hold of my mother's Quirk.</i>

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.851
<i>He is trying to fulfill</i>
<i>his own desire by raising me to be</i>

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:16.687
<i>a hero to surpass All Might.</i>

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.440
It's so annoying…

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:24.069
I won't become the tool of scum like that.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:30.576
In my memories,
my mother is always crying.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:37.749
"Your left side is unsightly,"

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:41.712
my mother said
as she poured boiling water on me.

00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:49.636
<i>Basically, I picked a fight</i>
<i>with you to show him what I can do,</i>

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:52.306
<i>without using my damn old man's Quirk…</i>

00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:54.766
No…

00:07:55.767 --> 00:08:00.689
I'll reject him completely
by winning first place without using it.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:12.492
<i>The world he talked about was so different</i>
<i>that honestly, I was scared.</i>

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:15.621
<i>I thought about how it</i>
<i>could be so different for us</i>

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.497
<i>even if we were aiming for the same thing.</i>

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:22.544
I don't care if you can't tell me
how you're connected to All Might.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.464
No matter what you are to All Might,

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.842
I will rise above you
with just my right side.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.345
Sorry for wasting your time.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.349
<i>If this were a comic,</i>
<i>he'd be the main character.</i>

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.477
<i>That was the kind of backstory he had.</i>

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:43.815
<i>Compared to that, what I could say?</i>

00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:51.698
I…

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.663
I have always been supported by others.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.665
That was the case earlier, too.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:06.046
I am here because of the people
who have supported me.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.509
<i>It's all right now, young man.</i>

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.135
I am here!

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.887
Is it possible for me
to give him some of my points?

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.056
I'll support you openly
with everything I've got from now on!

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:18.392
<i>You can't be a hero with just one trick.</i>

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.893
<i>I guess it's like</i>
<i>we've cleared the first hurdle.</i>

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.603
<i>Move! You're in the way, Deku!</i>

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.230
Team up with me, person in first place!

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:25.440
I took the one on his head
where his guard was the weakest.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.404
<i>You can become a hero.</i>

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:39.329
<i>Saving people with a fearless smile,</i>
<i>the greatest hero.</i>

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.666
<i>All Might.</i>

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.751
<i>I want to be like him.</i>

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:46.879
In order to do that,

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.882
I have to be strong enough
to become number one.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:53.343
My motivation might seem trivial
compared to yours,

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.972
but I can't lose, either.

00:09:57.848 --> 00:10:00.475
I have to live up to the hopes
of those who supported me.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.022
That declaration of war you gave earlier…

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.690
I'll return that.

00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:11.320
I will beat you, too!

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:35.802
<i>Now that lunch is over,</i>
<i>it's finally time to reveal the last game!</i>

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.429
But before that,

00:10:37.596 --> 00:10:40.015
there's good news for all of you
who didn't make it to the finals!

00:10:40.349 --> 00:10:42.059
<i>This is just a sports festival!</i>

00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:45.896
<i>So we've prepared recreational games</i>
<i>that everyone can participate in, too!</i>

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:50.317
<i>We've even brought real cheerleaders.</i>

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:52.319
Huh?

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.863
<i>What are they doing?</i>

00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:01.954
<i>What's the matter, Class A?</i>
<i>What kind of fan service is that?</i>

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.291
Mineta! Kaminari!
You tricked us, didn't you?

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:07.668
U.A. SPORTS FESTIVAL - LUNCHTIME

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.962
Yaoyorozu, Jiro.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.548
Hm? Did you need something?

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.717
Well, I'm sure you already know
since you're a class rep and all,

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.762
but they said
everyone has to wear those clothes

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.347
to do a cheer battle in the afternoon.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:24.810
I didn't hear anything about
an event like that, though…

00:11:24.977 --> 00:11:27.396
You don't have to believe me,

00:11:27.563 --> 00:11:29.940
but we heard from Mr. Aizawa.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:33.861
I thought maybe you'd forgotten,
so I'd tell you just in case.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:38.991
Why am I always caught up
in Mineta's schemes?

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.827
I even used Creation to make the outfits.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.121
Those guys are so dumb!

00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:46.498
Well, there's still time
before the finals,

00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:48.876
and it'd be a pain if things got tense.

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:50.752
It's fine! Let's do it!

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.004
What?

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.464
Toru, you like this, huh?

00:11:55.257 --> 00:11:58.927
<i>All right, everyone! Let's have fun</i>
<i>competing in the recreational games!</i>

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:04.933
<i>When that's over,</i>
<i>the sixteen from the four teams</i>

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.520
<i>that made it to the final round</i>

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:13.025
<i>will duke it out tournament style,</i>
<i>one-on-one!</i>

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.279
The last round is a tournament
where we fight one-on-one, huh?

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.950
I'm gonna stand on the stage
that I watch every year on TV!

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.578
Was it a tournament last year?

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:26.455
It's different every year,

00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:28.624
but there's a one-on-one competition
every year.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.502
Last year, it was a sports chanbara match.

00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:34.421
<i>Now, let's draw lots</i>
<i>to determine the bracket.</i>

00:12:35.214 --> 00:12:36.215
<i>Once the bracket is determined,</i>

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.675
<i>we'll have the recreational games</i>
<i>and then start!</i>

00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:41.678
<i>The sixteen finalists can choose whether</i>

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:44.973
<i>or not they want to participate</i>
<i>in the recreation.</i>

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.185
<i>I'm sure some of you want</i>
<i>to rest or save your strength.</i>

00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:50.521
Now, from the first place team--

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.314
Um… Excuse me.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.942
I'm withdrawing.

00:12:56.527 --> 00:12:58.195
Ojiro, why?

00:12:58.362 --> 00:13:00.447
This is a rare chance for pros to see you!

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:06.703
I barely remember anything from
the cavalry battle until almost the end.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.582
I think it was that guy's Quirk.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.461
If I remember correctly, Ojiro was with…

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:19.174
I know that this is a great chance

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:22.094
and that it's foolish to waste it…

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:23.929
Ojiro…

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:25.305
But…

00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:29.810
Everyone here competed
by giving their all!

00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:33.647
I can't… I can't be up there
with everyone without knowing

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:36.108
what really happened.

00:13:36.275 --> 00:13:37.860
You're worrying too much about it!

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.112
You should just make sure
you produce results in the finals!

00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:44.199
If you're gonna say that,
I didn't do anything either.

00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:45.492
That's not it…

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:50.414
I'm talking about my pride here… I can't…

00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:55.586
Also, why are you guys
wearing cheerleader outfits?

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:56.670
Gulp!

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:59.381
I'm Nirengeki Shoda from Class B.

00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:02.885
I also want to withdraw
for the same reason.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.720
Regardless of ability,

00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:07.556
don't you think it goes
against the goal of this sports festival

00:14:07.723 --> 00:14:10.767
for those who didn't do anything
to move onto the final round?

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:14.646
What's with these guys?
They're so manly!

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.733
This is an unusual turn of events.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.695
We'll have to see what the chief umpire,
Midnight, has to say about this.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.202
<i>Youthful talk like that is something…</i>

00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:30.329
<i>I like!</i>

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:32.080
<i>Shoda! Ojiro!</i>

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.290
<i>I accept your withdrawal!</i>

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.292
She decided based on her tastes!

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.046
I'm going to do it, okay?

00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:42.799
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>we'll have to move up two people</i>

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.928
<i>from the fifth place cavalry battle team…</i>

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.722
If that's what's going to happen,

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:51.517
then rather than us, who barely
did anything during the cavalry battle,

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:52.559
it should be them, right?

00:14:52.893 --> 00:14:53.769
Right?

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.314
The ones who fought
to the end and stayed in the top,

00:14:57.481 --> 00:14:59.066
Team Tetsutetsu, right?

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:00.901
Kendo…

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.238
This isn't collusion or anything.
It just makes sense.

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.865
You guys!

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:16.208
<i>And so, Tetsutetsu and Shiozaki</i>
<i>have moved up to make sixteen!</i>

00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:19.962
<i>This is the bracket</i>
<i>based on the results of the drawing!</i>

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:25.968
Again? This is too redundant!

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:28.470
I'll give it my all.

00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:30.722
That's what I want!

00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:32.891
<i>Merci.</i>

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.310
Too bad you got me as your opponent.

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:37.354
You mean, too lucky!

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.359
<i>The first match of the first round, huh?</i>

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:46.655
<i>If both Todoroki and I win, then…</i>

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.324
<i>Before that,</i>

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:52.035
<i>if I remember correctly, Shinso was…</i>

00:15:52.578 --> 00:15:55.163
It's you, isn't it? Izuku Midoriya.

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:00.002
<i>This person…</i>

00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:02.880
Depending on the results
of the sports festival,

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:05.549
they'll consider our transfer
into the hero course.

00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:07.885
<i>…is from general studies…</i>

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:09.887
Looking forward to the first match.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.014
Me…

00:16:12.181 --> 00:16:13.056
Midoriya!

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.355
Ojiro, what's the matter?

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.733
Don't answer him.

00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:29.781
<i>It'll be sooner than I expected.</i>

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.534
<i>Come, Midoriya.</i>

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.078
<i>I'll defeat you with this hand.</i>

00:16:35.746 --> 00:16:36.663
Huh?

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.956
Uraraka?

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.668
Are you Iida?

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.004
Hm? Indeed, I am Iida.

00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:47.674
Oh good! Actually…

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:50.219
<i>All right!</i>

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:54.598
<i>Let's leave the tournament aside</i>
<i>for a momentary interlude!</i>

00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:59.686
<i>Let's have fun with the recreation!</i>

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.396
All right!

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.815
<i>First is the scavenger hunt!</i>

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:09.195
Will anyone let me borrow a bag?

00:17:09.363 --> 00:17:10.821
CAT
TEXTBOOK

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.492
-A cat! Please give me a cat!
-Does anyone have a textbook?

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:14.576
BACK FAT

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.161
This is impossible…

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:21.415
Ugh, I can't believe they're getting
serious about recreational activities.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:25.378
Those Class A guys really need
to get a clue or something…

00:17:25.546 --> 00:17:26.755
Monoma!

00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:29.508
-If you're unmotivated, then come with me!
-Why?

00:17:29.842 --> 00:17:31.385
PERVERSE PERSON

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:35.222
Kendo,
don't you think you've got it wrong?

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:37.015
It's fine! It fits!

00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:40.853
<i>Even if we were told to have fun,</i>

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:42.938
<i>those of us in the tournament</i>
<i>couldn't relax.</i>

00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:46.316
<i>Some polished their strategy</i>
<i>against their opponent.</i>

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:48.986
<i>Some tried to keep their presence of mind.</i>

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.530
<i>Some prepared for the fight.</i>

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:54.157
<i>Some sharpened their senses.</i>

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:56.243
<i>And</i>

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.246
<i>some tried to relax their nerves.</i>

00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:04.126
<i>As we thought our respective thoughts,</i>

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.296
<i>it was time to start before we knew it.</i>

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.927
Okay. It's pretty much done.

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.762
<i>Thank you, Cementoss!</i>

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:19.057
<i>Hey guys, are you ready?</i>

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:25.772
<i>A lot's happened, but it's now</i>
<i>come to this! A serious battle!</i>

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.274
<i>You can only depend on yourself!</i>

00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:30.527
<i>Even if you're not a hero,</i>
<i>you'll face lots of situations like that!</i>

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:31.778
<i>You get it, right?</i>

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:35.073
<i>Heart, skill, body, wisdom, and knowledge!</i>

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.576
<i>Use all of that to rush up!</i>

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:40.245
Hey!

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.081
Sorry I'm late, but…

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:45.292
You figured out One For All, right?

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.085
All Might…

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:51.173
No, I'm still worried…

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:57.179
<i>I can see it in my head by imagining</i>
<i>the microwave and how I hit the villain,</i>

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:01.934
but it still feels unsteady
if I don't focus, like it'll fall apart…

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:05.270
Besides, as you saw,

00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:09.316
with my current body, even if I succeed,

00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:11.902
I just end up with a little more power…

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:16.865
Yes, if we talk in terms of the zero
or 100% from before,

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:20.077
what your body can release
right now is about a five.

00:19:20.244 --> 00:19:22.204
Five percent of my power?

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:29.002
Hearing that, I really feel like
I've been blessed with friends and luck.

00:19:30.254 --> 00:19:35.300
You should just say, "I'll do my best,
damn it," you prince of nonsense!

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:38.762
Is the image of the hero
you're trying to be that flimsy?

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:43.267
Listen, it's the times
when you're scared or worried

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:46.061
that you should deal with smiling!

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.106
You've made it this far.
It's fine if it's a bluff.

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:50.816
Stand proud!

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.736
Don't forget
that I've got high hopes for you!

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.326
<i>Audience!</i>

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:05.330
<i>The finals that you've all</i>
<i>been waiting for are finally starting!</i>

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.790
<i>Match number one.</i>

00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:09.793
<i>Even though he's done well,</i>
<i>what's with that face?</i>

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.588
<i>From the hero course, it's Izuku Midoriya!</i>

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:13.881
<i>Versus…</i>

00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:16.592
<i>Sorry, he hasn't done anything</i>
<i>to stand out yet!</i>

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:19.386
<i>From general studies, it's Hitoshi Shinso!</i>

00:20:19.553 --> 00:20:21.054
The rules are simple.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.974
Force your opponent out
of bounds, or immobilize them!

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:28.437
<i>You can also win by making</i>
<i>your opponent say, "I give up!"</i>

00:20:28.604 --> 00:20:29.897
<i>Bring on the injuries!</i>

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:33.317
<i>Because we've got our very own</i>
<i>Recovery Girl waiting on standby!</i>

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:36.111
<i>Put your morals and ethics aside</i>
<i>for a moment!</i>

00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:40.073
<i>But of course, anything</i>
<i>life-threatening is crap!</i>

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.158
<i>It's not allowed!</i>

00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:45.370
<i>Heroes should only use</i>
<i>their fists to catch villains!</i>

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.831
I'll stop things if they go too far.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:51.710
"I give up," huh?

00:20:53.504 --> 00:20:56.548
This is a fight to test
the strength of your spirit.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:01.845
If you know what you want for your future,
then you can't worry about appearances.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:03.096
<i>Ready?</i>

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:06.475
That monkey was going on about his pride…

00:21:06.642 --> 00:21:07.643
<i>Start!</i>

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.854
But don't you think he was dumb
for throwing away his chance?

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.069
What did you say?

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.950
I win.

00:21:24.243 --> 00:21:26.703
I went through the trouble
of warning him, too!

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:29.456
<i>Hey, hey, what's the matter?</i>

00:21:29.623 --> 00:21:32.459
<i>It's the important first match!</i>
<i>Liven things up!</i>

00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:40.300
<i>Midoriya! The match just started…</i>

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.803
<i>And he's completely frozen!</i>

00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:15.020
PREVIEW

00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:17.856
<i>It's the finals tournament, Midoriya.</i>

00:23:18.023 --> 00:23:19.608
<i>Ojiro, why'd you want</i>
<i>to talk to me all of a sudden?</i>

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:23.153
<i>I want to tell you what I know about</i>
<i>the Quirk of Shinso from Class B,</i>

00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:25.989
<i>your opponent in the first round.</i>

00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:28.408
<i>Ojiro, you care about me that much?</i>

00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:31.119
<i>That was part of it, but I also</i>
<i>wanted to be in the preview.</i>

00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:33.288
<i>So honest! Wow!</i>

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.082
<i>Next time, "Victory or Defeat"!</i>

00:23:35.249 --> 00:23:37.292
<i>Shouts of "Don't worry about it"</i>
<i>will echo through the</i>

00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:39.002
<i>stadium for the loser</i>
<i>after the quick match.</i>

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:40.504
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.671 --> 00:23:42.172
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
