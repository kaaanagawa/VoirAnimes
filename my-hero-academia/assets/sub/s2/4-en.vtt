00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.254
<i>The world has become a superhuman society,</i>

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:08.217
<i>and about 80% of the world's population</i>
<i>now has some kind of special trait.</i>

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:10.093
<i>In this world swirling with chaos,</i>

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.596
<i>the profession that everyone</i>
<i>once dreamed about and admired</i>

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:15.140
<i>came into the limelight.</i>

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.517
<i>Heroes of justice</i>

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.312
<i>fighting villains</i>
<i>and saving people from distress.</i>

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.648
<i>Yes,</i>

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.777
<i>this is the story</i>
<i>of how I became the greatest hero.</i>

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:01.872
The U.A. sports festival is drawing near.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:07.878
Joining a famous hero agency will get you
more experience and popularity.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.130
The U.A. sports festival
is something pro heroes.

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:13.800
No, the whole country is watching closely.
A big event!

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.554
That is what I brought you
here to talk about!

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:22.434
The next All Might…
The fledgling Symbol of Peace…

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.311
Izuku Midoriya.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:29.566
I want you to tell the world "I am here!"

00:02:30.943 --> 00:02:33.195
<i>The sports festival</i>

00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:36.615
<i>first-year stage qualifier,</i>
<i>an obstacle course race!</i>

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:38.283
<i>Who could've predicted</i>

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.620
<i>the developments</i>
<i>at the beginning or this conclusion?</i>

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:44.665
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>the first person back in the stadium</i>

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.250
<i>is that man…</i>

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:50.337
<i>Izuku Midoriya's made a huge splash!</i>

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:57.094
<i>The second round of the U.A.</i>
<i>sports festival first-year stage is…</i>

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.930
<i>A cavalry battle with the top 42</i>

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.224
<i>from the qualifier!</i>

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.853
<i>Those at the top will suffer more.</i>

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.857
<i>You'll hear this many times</i>
<i>as you attend U.A.</i>

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.317
<i>This is what "Plus Ultra" means!</i>

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.613
<i>Izuku Midoriya,</i>
<i>who placed first in the qualifier,</i>

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.949
<i>is worth ten million points!</i>

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:27.916
What the hell can you do?

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.128
You're Quirkless!

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.048
<i>The eyes around me</i>
<i>are different from junior high…</i>

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.678
<i>The top spot I got</i>
<i>for an instant because of luck…</i>

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:41.513
<i>Even so…</i>

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.142
<i>You're quick to understand,</i>
<i>huh, young man?</i>

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.519
<i>Even so,</i>

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:51.481
<i>is it really this heavy, All Might?</i>

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.903
STRATEGY, STRATEGY, STRATEGY

00:03:56.778 --> 00:04:00.073
<i>Now then, I will explain</i>
<i>the rules of the cavalry battle.</i>

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.034
<i>The time limit is fifteen minutes.</i>

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.871
<i>Each team is worth</i>
<i>the total of its members' points,</i>

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:10.334
<i>and the riders will wear a headband</i>
<i>with that number on their foreheads.</i>

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.669
<i>Teams will try to grab each other's</i>
<i>headbands until time runs out,</i>

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:14.880
<i>and try to keep</i>
<i>as many points as they can.</i>

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:18.216
<i>Stolen headbands must be</i>
<i>worn from the neck up.</i>

00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:21.762
<i>So the more you steal,</i>
<i>the harder it'll be to manage them!</i>

00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:25.015
<i>And the most important thing</i>
<i>is that even if your headband gets stolen,</i>

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:26.517
<i>or if your team falls,</i>

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.019
<i>you're not out!</i>

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:30.729
Which means…

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:33.982
Since there are 42 people,
there will be ten or twelve teams

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.026
on the field the whole time?

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:37.528
That's tough.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.613
One strategy could be to let someone

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.615
take your points first
so you'll be more free.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:46.787
It's hard to say without seeing how all
the points end up getting split up, Mina.

00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:50.582
<i>During the game, it'll be a cruel</i>
<i>fight where you can use your Quirks.</i>

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:53.502
<i>But it is still a cavalry battle.</i>

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.964
<i>You'll get a red card for attacks that</i>
<i>are trying to make people fall on purpose!</i>

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.591
-<i>You'll be removed immediately!</i>
-Damn.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.514
<i>Now, you have fifteen minutes</i>
<i>to build your teams. Start!</i>

00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.557
Fifteen minutes?

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.977
<i>-Points don't really matter in my case.</i>
-Hey, be on my team.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.062
<i>The people I want on my team are…</i>

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.690
<i>That person, and that person!</i>

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.612
The U.A. sports festival

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.907
is more about simulating
the competition they'll face as heroes

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.411
than seeing how prepared
they are to be heroes.

00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:29.830
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.626
In a world crowded with hero agencies,
in order to put food on the table,

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:37.129
there are times
when you have to kick down others

00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:38.672
in order to show your stuff.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.133
That was what the obstacle
course race in the qualifier was, right?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.635
Doesn't that just pain your heart?

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.012
You little…

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.139
<i>You did that quite gleefully, remember?</i>

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:50.642
On the other hand,

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.936
<i>even if you're business rivals,</i>

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:56.064
<i>there are many cases</i>
<i>where you have to work together.</i>

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.232
Oh,

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.610
that's just like the cavalry battle!

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.238
If you win, your teammates also win.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.699
You have to think about compatibility
and other people's Quirks…

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:07.367
It's a give-and-take situation…

00:06:07.743 --> 00:06:09.661
Coordinating with your sidekick,

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:12.623
and joint Quirk training
with other agencies…

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:17.711
The kids are doing stuff now that will be
their way of life after they become pros.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.172
<i>They've got it rough.</i>

00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:27.054
-Team up with me!
-What? Bakugo, team up with me!

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:28.805
Don't you want to team up with me?

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:33.810
I don't know what Quirks you all have!
What?

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.646
I can understand not knowing Class B's.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.314
He doesn't pay attention
to what's around him at all, huh?

00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:39.900
<i>Even though his personality's like that,</i>

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.318
<i>he still came</i>
<i>in third and has two hundred points.</i>

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.404
Considering
the all-purpose use of his Quirk,

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.907
it makes sense that he's popular.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:51.453
Hey! Todoroki chose his team already!

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.455
Bakugo, team up with me!

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.708
-Weird Hair.
-I'm Kirishima! At least try to remember!

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.836
My hair's not that different from yours!

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.172
You're gonna be the rider, right?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:07.135
Then who'll be a front horse
that can take your blasts?

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.764
Someone with guts.

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.976
Not really, but yeah!
Me, with my Hardening!

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.770
I'll be a horse that'll never waver!

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.190
You're gonna get it, right?
The ten million?

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:26.029
Shoji!

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.949
I wanted to team up with
a girl, but it's no good!

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.034
Please team up with me!

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.412
I'm tiny, so I can't be a horse!

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:36.748
But no one'll be my horse
if I'm the rider!

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.834
With your huge body and tentacles,

00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:42.004
you could cover my whole body, can't you?

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.464
Right?

00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:47.050
That's a great idea, Mineta.

00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:49.052
<i>As expected,</i>

00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:52.097
<i>people are teaming up</i>
<i>with their classmates, huh?</i>

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:55.934
<i>Since no one has a good grasp of what</i>
<i>Quirks those in the other classes have.</i>

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.854
<i>I need to do something quick, too…</i>

00:07:59.021 --> 00:07:59.897
ISOLATED

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.649
About the current state
where everyone's totally avoiding me!

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.819
Ojiro?

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:06.862
Sorry…

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:12.159
<i>As I thought, no one wants to try</i>
<i>to keep the points for the whole game.</i>

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:15.245
<i>It'd be a better strategy to try</i>
<i>to steal the points at the end.</i>

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:18.457
<i>And unlike Todoroki or Kacchan,</i>
<i>I didn't use my Quirk,</i>

00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:20.751
<i>so no one has any confidence in me…</i>

00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:21.793
Deku!

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.462
CONFIDENCE

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:24.505
Let's be a team!

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.257
Uraraka! Is it really okay?

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:30.886
Everyone'll probably be after me
because of my ten million points!

00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:33.597
If we run away the whole time,
then you'll win, right?

00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:37.100
I think you're overestimating me,
Uraraka…

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.393
Like I would!

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:43.232
Anyway, it's better to team up
with people you get along with!

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.400
HEART-SQUEEZE

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.194
What's the matter?
You look ugly, you know.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.404
Oh, nothing…

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.698
It's just that you're so bright
that I can't look straight at you…

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:55.452
Actually, I wanted to team up
with you, too. Thanks!

00:08:56.036 --> 00:09:00.374
For teams, it's best to be with people
you can communicate with smoothly, right?

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:01.708
Yup!

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.837
Actually, with your Quirk
and one other person…

00:09:05.254 --> 00:09:07.172
I thought of a plan!

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.718
Iida.

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:17.057
The three of us

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:19.685
would be horses with Iida in the front!

00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:23.230
And then, if we use Uraraka's Quirk
to make Iida and me lighter,

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:24.731
we'd be able to maneuver easily.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:25.899
I see!

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.486
It's better to have someone
physically strong as the rider,

00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:31.321
but I haven't decided who…

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:35.200
Anyway, this is all I could think of
to keep running away until the end…

00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:37.911
I expected no less, Midoriya.

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:41.540
But I am afraid I have to refuse.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.795
Ever since the entrance exam,
I just keep losing to you.

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:48.881
You are a wonderful friend,

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:54.052
but that's why, if I just keep
following you, I will never grow.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:10:00.601
Bakugo and Todoroki aren't the only ones
who see you as a rival.

00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:06.064
I will challenge you.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.150
Iida…

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.403
<i>It's already begun.</i>

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:14.156
<i>Everyone's an enemy.</i>

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:18.035
<i>That's right. I'm at the top right now.</i>

00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:21.788
<i>I can't just play at being friends.</i>

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.209
As I thought, this is great.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.002
You stand out!

00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:29.546
Team up with me, person in first place!

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:30.881
So close! Who're you?

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:36.345
I am Mei Hatsume, from the support course!

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.806
<i>That weird person from back then.</i>

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.435
I don't know you,
but let me use your position!

00:10:43.602 --> 00:10:44.686
She's honest!

00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:46.063
If I team up with you,

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.191
then I'll inevitably become part of
the team everyone's watching most, right?

00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:53.612
If that happens, then my super cute babies
will inevitably be seen

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.572
by the big companies.

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.115
That means, in other words,

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.202
that those big companies
will see my babies!

00:11:00.369 --> 00:11:01.954
Wait a minute.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.498
Babies and big companies?
What are you--

00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:08.418
-And, I think you guys will also benefit.
-<i>She's not interested in me…</i>

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:14.675
The support course develops equipment
that helps heroes deal with their Quirks.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:22.224
I have a ton of babies, so I'm sure
you'll be able to find one that you like!

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.685
Oh, has this one caught your eye?

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.521
I made this
based on a certain hero's backpack,

00:11:27.688 --> 00:11:29.565
adding my own original twist to it.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:30.858
Could you be talking

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.569
<i>about the Buster Hero, Air Jet?</i>

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.029
I like him, too!

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.072
Really?

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:39.449
Yeah, his agency's close,
so I went to tour it before.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:42.077
<i>I see. They're already getting along.</i>

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.874
<i>Not being able to team up</i>
<i>with Iida was a blow,</i>

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.126
<i>but with Hatsume and Uraraka…</i>

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:52.045
<i>I just need one more person.</i>

00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:55.132
<i>It looks like everyone's pretty set</i>
<i>on their teams already, huh?</i>

00:11:55.591 --> 00:11:57.426
<i>No, that's fine.</i>

00:11:57.593 --> 00:12:00.220
<i>The power our team's missing…</i>

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.766
<i>The one who can fill that spot is…</i>

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:08.770
Deku?

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:15.777
You!

00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:22.117
Almost everyone here
has their eyes on Class A.

00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:23.327
Why is that?

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:28.290
And like Tetsutetsu said,
Class A is full of themselves about it…

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.125
It's strange, isn't it?

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:33.962
The only difference between us
and them is that they fought villains.

00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:38.842
Why were those of us in Class B happy
with being in the middle of the pack?

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:44.264
Let's let that arrogant Class A know,
guys.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.187
<i>Now then, it's about time to get started!</i>

00:12:50.938 --> 00:12:52.523
Come on, wake up, Eraser!

00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:57.236
<i>After fifteen minutes</i>
<i>to form teams and talk strategy,</i>

00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:01.114
<i>twelve cavalry teams are lined up</i>
<i>on the field!</i>

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.909
There are some interesting teams
out there.

00:13:04.493 --> 00:13:07.246
<i>Now, raise those battle cries!</i>

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.791
<i>It's time for U.A.'s bloody battle!</i>

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.126
<i>Light the signal fire!</i>

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.169
Yes!

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.046
-Uraraka.
-Yes!

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.548
Hatsume.

00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:20.050
-Tokoyami.
-Yeah.

00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:23.637
I'm counting on you!

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:28.058
I chose you three

00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:31.353
because I thought
it would be the most stable formation.

00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:33.772
Kaminari, you'll be the left wing,

00:13:33.939 --> 00:13:35.357
keeping the enemy away
with your electricity.

00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:37.317
Yaoyorozu, you'll be the right wing.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.862
You are in charge of insulation
and assisting with defense and movement.

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:45.117
Iida, you'll be in front as the main
source of mobility and physical defense.

00:13:46.535 --> 00:13:50.414
So you will attack and create diversions
with ice and fire, then, Todoroki?

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:51.915
No.

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.293
In battle…

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:58.213
I will never use my left.

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.349
<i>All right! You've made your teams, right?</i>

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.977
<i>I'm not gonna ask if you're ready or not!</i>

00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:13.478
Tetsutetsu.

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.023
No hard feelings, okay?

00:14:16.565 --> 00:14:17.441
Yeah!

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.276
Now, let's go!

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.404
<i>Counting down to the brutal battle royal!</i>

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.323
<i>-Three!</i>
<i>-</i>We're aiming for…

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.200
<i>-Two!</i>
-One thing.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.242
<i>One!</i>

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.828
Start!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.002
It's basically a battle
for the ten million points!

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.756
Midoriya, I'll take that!

00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:43.217
An attack without delay, huh…

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:45.093
The fate of the pursued…

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:46.512
<i>Fate…</i>

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.263
Make your choice, Midoriya!

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.348
<i>Choice…</i>

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:50.766
Of course,

00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:52.434
our move is to run away!

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:54.144
I won't let you!

00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.608
-What is this?
-We're sinking?

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.736
-That person's Quirk, huh?
-All right!

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.155
It's no good… I can't get out!

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.866
Uraraka! Hatsume! Turn your faces away!

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.042
He flew?

00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:19.545
Thanks to the support course, huh?
Follow them!

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.005
-Jiro!
-I know!

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:25.843
Tokoyami!

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:28.303
Good!

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.098
Dark Shadow,
keep watch over our blind spots!

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.307
Got it!

00:15:32.808 --> 00:15:34.643
Wow, that's so cool!

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.728
The defense that we were lacking…

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:40.065
You're more than making up for it with
your omnidirectional mid-range defense!

00:15:40.232 --> 00:15:42.401
That's amazing, Tokoyami!

00:15:42.568 --> 00:15:44.403
You're the one who chose me.

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.154
We're landing.

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:50.492
<i>Making everyone other</i>
<i>than Uraraka weightless,</i>

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:54.246
<i>so our weight is just Uraraka</i>
<i>plus the equipment and clothes.</i>

00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:00.544
What do you think of my babies?
Aren't they cute?

00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.421
Cuteness can be made, you know.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.049
Excellent mobility!
The babies are amazing, Hatsume!

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:07.384
Right?

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.053
It's because I'm making them float…

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.515
We're going after them, too!
Come on, Jiro, time to get revenge!

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:16.685
Hey, wait, Hagakure! Your headband's gone!

00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:20.022
When did that happen?

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.482
Profiting while others fight.

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:23.734
<i>Now then,</i>

00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:26.278
<i>even though barely two minutes</i>
<i>have passed since we've started,</i>

00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:28.697
<i>It's already turned into a free-for-all!</i>

00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:30.699
Fights over the headbands
breaking out all over!

00:16:30.866 --> 00:16:32.492
Ignoring the ten million points

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.037
and going for second
to fourth places isn't bad, either!

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:39.958
Fighting?

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:41.210
No, this is…

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:44.338
A one-sided pillage!

00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:46.340
Shoji? What? By himself?

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:47.966
But it's a <i>team</i> battle!

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.218
Let's put some space between us for now.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:52.346
We can't be caught standing
still against multiple opponents!

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:54.723
What?

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.308
What's wrong, Uraraka?

00:16:56.475 --> 00:16:57.559
I'm stuck!

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:00.312
That's Mineta's…

00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:02.314
Where'd it come from?

00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:05.692
From here… Midoriya…

00:17:06.652 --> 00:17:08.069
What? Is that allowed?

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:09.863
<i>It is!</i>

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:15.827
I didn't expect any less from you,
Midoriya.

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.287
Asui, too?

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:18.789
That's amazing, Shoji!

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.624
Call me Tsu!

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.459
<i>Team Mineta</i>

00:17:22.626 --> 00:17:26.296
<i>makes use of the overwhelming difference</i>
<i>in their sizes! They're like a tank!</i>

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:27.756
Midoriya, get away!

00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:37.808
My baby was torn apart!

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.269
Sorry! But we got away!

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:46.191
Kacchan!

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:50.153
Don't get carried away!

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:53.782
Damn it!

00:17:53.949 --> 00:17:54.825
Tokoyami!

00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:04.710
<i>-He's gotten separated from his horses!</i>
-What's with this guy?

00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:05.961
<i>Is that okay?</i>

00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:08.589
-Nice catch!
<i>-It's a technicality, so it's okay!</i>

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:11.592
<i>It wouldn't have been</i>
<i>if he'd touched the ground, though!</i>

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.180
Thanks, Uraraka!

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.849
It's hard to control with just one foot.

00:18:19.016 --> 00:18:20.309
Yeah, I know.

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:23.312
<i>Landing like this is inefficient…</i>

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:25.689
<i>We can't run to the air anymore.</i>

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.525
<i>We'll have to survive this</i>
<i>with our increased mobility</i>

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:33.155
<i>from Uraraka's Zero Gravity</i>
<i>and with Tokoyami's Dark Shadow.</i>

00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:35.824
<i>As expected, everyone's</i>
<i>after the first place team,</i>

00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:38.243
<i>and Class A is in hot pursuit!</i>

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.661
<i>Everyone's got skills!</i>

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:42.873
Those Class A guys are good.

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:46.585
With all those flashy moves,
even just watching's fun!

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:50.797
There's this much difference just
from their experience fighting villains!

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:54.551
<i>Now, let's take a look</i>
<i>at each team's points…</i>

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.887
<i>It's been seven minutes!</i>

00:18:57.054 --> 00:18:59.056
<i>Here are the current rankings</i>
<i>up on the screen!</i>

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.810
Huh? It's kinda…

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:06.855
What? Wait a minute!

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.985
<i>Other than Midoriya,</i>
<i>Class A isn't doing so well…</i>

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.822
<i>Bakugo? What?</i>

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:22.538
Class A is too simple-minded.

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:23.622
He got us!

00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:26.583
What'd you say, bastard?
Give that back! I'll kill you!

00:19:27.918 --> 00:19:31.338
Since Midnight said it was the <i>first</i> game,

00:19:31.505 --> 00:19:36.426
it wouldn't make sense for them to cut
a ton of people in the qualifier, right?

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:41.932
Assuming they'd keep
about forty people for the next stage,

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:45.102
we just made sure we stayed
within that number as we ran,

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:47.437
<i>observing</i>

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.940
<i>from the back the Quirks</i>

00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:52.067
<i>and personalities of those</i>
<i>who would be our rivals.</i>

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:56.738
There's no point in being obsessive
over winning in the prelims, right?

00:19:57.406 --> 00:19:59.032
You did this as a class?

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:02.202
Well, it wasn't a consensus,
but it was a good idea, right?

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.245
Hey, they're coming.

00:20:03.579 --> 00:20:05.747
It's better than going
after a temporary "top"

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:09.042
like a horse with a carrot
waving in front of its face.

00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:13.463
Oh, while I'm at it,
you're famous, aren't you?

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.425
<i>As the victim of the sludge incident!</i>

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.261
Tell me about it sometime.

00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:23.265
About how it feels
to be attacked by villains once a year.

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:28.312
Kirishima, change of plan…

00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:35.652
Before we get Deku,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.698
let's kill all these guys!

00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:46.205
<i>Class B had a long-term strategy</i>
<i>that involved throwing the qualifier, huh?</i>

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:50.709
<i>It's true that they could leave a stronger</i>
<i>impression by overturning the mood</i>

00:20:50.876 --> 00:20:52.711
<i>that favored Class A</i>
<i>before the sports festival started.</i>

00:20:53.504 --> 00:20:55.881
<i>But based on their way of thinking,</i>

00:20:56.048 --> 00:20:58.967
<i>it means</i>
<i>they won't necessarily come after me.</i>

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.304
Everyone, it'll be easier to run.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:13.690
<i>Less than half the time is left now!</i>

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:22.407
It won't be that easy, huh?

00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:26.286
<i>The cavalry battle is about</i>
<i>to enter the second half!</i>

00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:29.498
<i>In this unexpected rise of Class B,</i>

00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:32.125
<i>who will wear</i>

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:36.129
<i>the ten million points in the end?</i>

00:21:40.551 --> 00:21:42.344
I'll be taking that now.

00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:15.062
PREVIEW

00:23:15.229 --> 00:23:17.940
<i>I am Tenya Iida,</i>
<i>the class representative of Class A,</i>

00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:20.359
<i>and I am responsible for the preview.</i>

00:23:20.526 --> 00:23:22.903
<i>Let's talk about the next episode, Iida.</i>

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.447
<i>-I will challenge you!</i>
<i>-That's the other extreme!</i>

00:23:25.614 --> 00:23:27.282
<i>I will defeat your team</i>
<i>in the cavalry battle</i>

00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:29.952
<i>with a result that will not bring shame</i>
<i>to the Tenya hero family</i>

00:23:30.202 --> 00:23:31.411
<i>and like my older brother, Tensei,</i>
<i>I will become an upstanding.</i>

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:33.080
<i>He's talking about himself after all, huh?</i>

00:23:33.247 --> 00:23:34.957
<i>Next time, "Cavalry Battle Finale"!</i>

00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:36.500
<i>"Vroom, vroom" sounds</i>

00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:38.669
<i>are coming from Iida's calves!</i>

00:23:39.211 --> 00:23:40.170
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:42.005
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
