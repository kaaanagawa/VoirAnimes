00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:05.923
<i>My moves!</i>

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.719
<i>While I was spending my time</i>
<i>uselessly at my internship…</i>

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:12.721
<i>Again…</i>

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:14.890
<i>I don't know</i>

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.061
<i>if you've figured out</i>
<i>how to use your Quirk a little or what,</i>

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.899
<i>but you seriously keep</i>
<i>rubbing me the wrong way.</i>

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.445
<i>I don't need another half-assed result</i>
<i>like at the sports festival.</i>

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.615
<i>At the upcoming finals,</i>
<i>we'll get individual scores,</i>

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.034
<i>so we'll see who's better</i>
<i>whether you like it or not.</i>

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.121
<i>I'll beat you</i>
<i>with an indisputable difference!</i>

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.874
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:03.605
<i>I am Izuku Midoriya, born Quirkless</i>

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:06.191
<i>and a student at U.A. High.</i>

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:09.903
<i>With the help of my friends, I will become</i>
<i>the greatest hero of all time!</i>

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.446
<i>In </i>My Hero Academia<i>!</i>

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.928
KATSUKI BAKUGO: ORIGIN

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.682
<i>Team Midoriya and Bakugo, practical exam.</i>

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.142
<i>Ready, go!</i>

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:24.895
<i>I have to tell him…</i>

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.523
<i>Because Kacchan and I are a team…</i>

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.942
<i>We have to talk properly…</i>

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:36.448
Kacchan, for this exam, the teacher
is the villain, and we're the heroes,

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:39.117
so we need to keep in mind
the villain's combat ability

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.662
and choose to either fight or run,

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:46.375
but in our case, the villain is All Might,
and fighting against him is dangerous--

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.502
I think it's a really bad idea, anyway--

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:50.003
Wait, Kacchan!

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.630
Stop following me!

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:55.300
If we keep going straight,
All Might will probably be waiting for us.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:56.426
We should take a detour--

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.554
Why should we run away?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.181
It'd definitely be better
if we beat him up!

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.809
We should avoid combat
if we can no matter what!

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:05.853
We'll toy with him until it's almost over,

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.063
and then once he's tired out,
I'll beat him up!

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:14.027
<i>It really is hard for me</i>
<i>to deal with Kacchan…</i>

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.488
<i>But I can't think about that right now.</i>

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.825
Who do you think All Might is?

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:23.078
Even with the handicap,
you can't win against him!

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.170
Don't say another word…

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.173
Just because things are going better
for you doesn't mean you should talk.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.300
It's pissing me off.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.221
Oh, dear, their teamwork is nonexistent…

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.017
<i>Do they realize who they're up against?</i>

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.104
Now…

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.859
I am going!

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:55.569
Wait, Kacchan!

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.655
I'm saying this so we can pass the test!

00:03:58.822 --> 00:03:59.698
Listen, Kacchan!

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:03.702
I told you,
your power isn't needed to pass--

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.120
Stop yelling!

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.873
That's why we can never
have a real conversation!

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.850
Who gives a damn about damaging the city?

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:29.811
<i>What… What is this…</i>

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.648
<i>What… is this…</i>

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:34.691
<i>This sense of intimidation?</i>

00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:41.990
If you think of this as an exam,
you'll be sorry.

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:47.037
I am a villain, heroes.

00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:50.999
Come at me with everything you've got!

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:54.253
We can't take him head on. Let's run!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.629
Don't tell me what to do!

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.384
-Kacchan!
-Stun Grenade!

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.763
"Come at me" you said, All Might?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.225
Even if you didn't say anything,
I was gonna do that…

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:18.610
<i>Normally, if you grab someone's face,</i>
<i>they reflexively try to move your hand.</i>

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:23.240
<i>This kid is seriously only thinking</i>
<i>about defeating me, huh?</i>

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:30.622
With such weak consecutive hits,
it just stings, though.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:32.708
And…

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.213
You're not off the hook either,
Young Midoriya.

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:41.133
Are you leaving your teammate
and running away?

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:46.889
<i>Why am I reminded of the hero killer?</i>

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.349
Whoops! That's no good.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:50.684
Move!

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.227
Kaccha--

00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:57.399
<i>One wants to defeat All Might.</i>

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.776
<i>The other only thinks of running.</i>

00:06:00.444 --> 00:06:03.280
<i>The latter probably admires him too much.</i>

00:06:03.447 --> 00:06:07.784
<i>To Izuku Midoriya,</i>
<i>All Might is like a god.</i>

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.787
<i>On the other hand, I don't</i>
<i>know much about this boy,</i>

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.457
<i>but from the sports festival</i>
<i>and his grades,</i>

00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:16.043
<i>he appears</i>
<i>to have amazing combat sense.</i>

00:06:16.752 --> 00:06:19.421
<i>I wonder why he's in such a hurry…</i>

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:21.048
-Kacchan!
-Move.

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:23.967
I told you, there's no way
you can win facing him head on!

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.803
Shut up. I'll win.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:31.600
That's what it means to be a hero!

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.394
<i>Wow!</i>

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.481
All Might really is cool!

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.568
Then it's even more important to avoid--

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.070
Let go! Don't touch me!

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:47.950
For now, here's a present for
the one who wants to run away!

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:58.627
Kacchan!

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.513
<i>Look! Did you see that just now?</i>

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:12.516
<i>All Might really is cool, isn't he?</i>

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.270
You think he'd totally lose
four-on-one, right?

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.604
But look!

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:19.356
See? Right here!

00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:20.691
He dodges like this, and then a punch!

00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:22.651
Or so he wants you to think, and then--

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.196
See? He won!

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:31.577
No matter how much trouble he's in,
he always wins in the end!

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:35.455
<i>You're a jerk…</i>

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.667
<i>But… yeah…</i>

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:42.588
<i>No matter what, you always…</i>

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.966
<i>make sure you are the winner.</i>

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:49.219
<i>I admired you for that!</i>

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:52.639
I know why you're so angry.

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:55.809
It's because of Young Midoriya's
sudden improvement, right?

00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:57.978
But you know,

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:01.231
there's no way Level one power
and Level 50 power

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.609
can improve at the same rate.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.320
There's so much wasted potential in you.

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.030
Do you understand?

00:08:08.197 --> 00:08:09.072
You do, right?

00:08:10.282 --> 00:08:12.701
You still have so much room to grow!

00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:14.203
But I'm not talking about power--

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.580
Shut up, All Might…

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:21.043
If I have to get help from that scum,

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:26.715
then I'd rather lose…

00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:35.057
I see…

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.059
Don't regret this.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:42.523
Damn it!

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:50.489
Don't <i>you</i> say that you'd rather lose!

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:01.166
I didn't think
Young Midoriya would come…

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.293
I let my guard down.

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.548
But man, these are heavy…

00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.009
-Bastard, put me down!
-It's fine.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.554
I said, put me down!

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:22.771
Kacchan, I really can't think
of a way to beat All Might,

00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:25.899
or a way to make a clean escape.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:26.942
Huh?

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.487
Before you give up, at least try using me!

00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:32.823
Don't say that you're okay losing!

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:37.870
You're you because you never
give up on winning, right?

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.998
Hey, you're just a first grader!

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.292
You better apologize if you bump
into someone older than you!

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:44.918
We're gonna tell Yocchan!

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.879
Yocchan's super strong, you know!

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.507
You better remember this tomorrow!

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:53.552
I didn't bump into you guys.

00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:55.929
You guys bumped into me.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.347
Wow, Kacchan!

00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:00.517
You fought against two fourth graders
and won!

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:07.983
The most amazing hero
always wins in the end!

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.987
<i>"…always wins in the end."</i>

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.407
<i>You've been saying that</i>
<i>since we were kids.</i>

00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:17.201
<i>How can you give up?</i>

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:23.582
Kacchan?

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:27.252
I won't say it again, damn nerd…

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.799
Against that crazy speed,
no matter how you run and hide,

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.426
you won't be able to avoid fighting.

00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:38.055
But we don't have a chance
in a fight. Not against All Might--

00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:40.641
Shut up, bastard! I'll kill you!

00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:44.353
He won't even budge
with half-assed power.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.897
I figured that out earlier
with those consecutive hits.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:49.316
<i>So…</i>

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.986
<i>Where is Young Midoriya?</i>

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:57.741
<i>Since he hid, could it mean</i>
<i>he's heading for the escape gate?</i>

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:00.869
Where are you looking?

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.454
They were behind me, huh?

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:05.499
<i>You're pissing me off!</i>

00:11:07.543 --> 00:11:10.796
<i>Who'd work… with someone like you?</i>

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.257
<i>…like </i>you<i>!</i>

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:15.717
Deku!

00:11:16.552 --> 00:11:20.222
<i>So, we give him everything</i>
<i>we've got at point-blank range.</i>

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:23.892
<i>Our only option is to inflict damage</i>
<i>and then put some distance between us.</i>

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.143
I see!

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:26.645
Shoot!

00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:30.065
I'm sorry, All Might!

00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.029
My shoulder!

00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:39.491
Kacchan,
you were using something like this?

00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:40.951
Run, idiot!

00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:42.160
Oh, right!

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:47.124
<i>Don't you say that you'd rather lose!</i>

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.838
Ow… They got me.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.508
A compromise between
running away and fighting.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.261
That's pretty good for an impromptu plan.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:06.351
They also limited damage to the city
by hitting places I'd already demolished.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.272
I think I taught that to them
at the first combat training.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:17.112
I see.
Both of them are actually pretty clever.

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:20.490
But they fall apart in a second
when it comes to each other.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:24.244
Envy, hate, pursuit.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.664
Awe, rejection, pride.

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.167
From what I've heard,

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:31.793
they both have
so many different feelings about

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.587
each other piled up
one on top of the other

00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:37.174
that they don't know
how to interact anymore.

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:43.847
It's not something
that can be resolved anytime soon,

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:47.267
but I'm sure
their cooperation here will one day

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.562
be a big step for them in the future.

00:12:52.648 --> 00:12:54.107
Now…

00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:58.153
Your teacher's gonna do his best!

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:02.574
Almost there…

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.619
Almost at the escape gate!

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:07.329
It seems cuter than it needs to be,

00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:10.040
but as long as one of us
gets through, then we pass!

00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:13.210
<i>Damn, he sent that blast</i>
<i>from where we were</i>

00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:16.046
<i>in the middle all the way to the gate?</i>

00:13:16.547 --> 00:13:18.173
<i>What the hell?</i>

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.676
It doesn't look like
All Might's chasing us.

00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:22.761
Don't tell me we knocked him out?

00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:27.307
Bastard, didn't you keep saying there
was no way we'd beat him, you idiot?

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.685
There's no way
he was knocked out by that, scum!

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:33.438
The next time he catches up, it'll be
my turn to blow him away with my gauntlet!

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:36.066
Yes, yes. And then?

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:39.820
What're you surprised about?

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:42.614
<i>He's too fast…</i>

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:46.994
Even like this, because of these weights,
I'm nowhere near my top speed.

00:13:48.579 --> 00:13:51.915
Now, die, heroes!

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.503
Kacchan!

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.132
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.142
That's wonderful, boys!

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:14.938
You cooperated,
however reluctantly, and faced me!

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:18.150
However, you two…

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:22.821
That was a prerequisite for this exam!

00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:27.659
<i>Overwhelming speed…</i>

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.662
<i>His stamina and power</i>
<i>are also overwhelming…</i>

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.832
<i>It's simply… simply power.</i>

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.211
<i>Facing off against him,</i>
<i>I'm reminded of that again.</i>

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.587
<i>That's right.</i>

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.841
<i>This man is the highest wall in the world.</i>

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.845
<i>The greatest hero!</i>

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.306
Damn it…

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:54.102
What kind of face is that, Young Midoriya?

00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:59.900
Getting away from me
with your maximum firepower

00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:01.985
and then getting through the escape gate.

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.988
That appears
to have been you boys' answer,

00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:08.116
but now that I've destroyed
Young Bakugo's gauntlets,

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:10.744
you've lost that maximum firepower.

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:13.288
It's over.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.542
Shut up…

00:15:24.675 --> 00:15:25.717
Oww…

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:31.849
I'm gonna send you flying!

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.939
I don't like it, but with what we've got
right now, this is the only way to win!

00:15:39.815 --> 00:15:42.818
-Die!
<i>-Die?</i>

00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:47.406
Are you serious, Kacchan?

00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:54.204
But right now, while All Might
is in the air, the goal is…

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:00.127
New Hampshire Smash!

00:16:00.294 --> 00:16:01.712
Damn it!

00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:05.090
Come now, you're being naive, heroes!

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:11.680
The gauntlets were so I could use
maximum firepower with no risk!

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:14.808
I was so stupid…

00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:20.689
There's no way I could beat you
without taking any risks!

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.862
<i>That huge blast</i>
<i>he used at the sports festival!</i>

00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:28.780
<i>Twice!</i>

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:32.951
Go! Deku, hurry!

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:34.703
<i>Earlier, my back was…</i>

00:16:35.287 --> 00:16:39.708
I can still move more than you,
with your cobbled-together power!

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:43.670
Make yourself useful, damn scum!

00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:51.595
<i>I'll move forward even if it hurts…</i>

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:57.226
<i>If I head toward the gate, then All Might</i>
<i>will probably try to block me…</i>

00:16:58.227 --> 00:17:02.272
<i>Kacchan should be able</i>
<i>to take advantage of that…</i>

00:17:13.784 --> 00:17:16.662
Go to sleep, Young Bakugo.

00:17:17.246 --> 00:17:20.040
Sorry, but as a teacher,

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:25.002
<i>I'm a little traumatized</i>
<i>when you destroy your own body to fight.</i>

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.884
Hurry up… go… damn nerd!

00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:33.595
I break…

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.139
and break myself…

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:41.687
Even if it means twisting myself,
I'll win the way I choose…

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:45.899
I won't accept that I can't
even beat you like that…

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:48.986
No way!

00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:51.989
<i>Kacchan!</i>

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.490
Whoops, I won't let you!

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.538
<i>It's the times</i>
<i>when you're scared or worried</i>

00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:01.874
<i>that you should deal with smiling!</i>

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:06.837
Please move, All Might!

00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:12.426
Smash!

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:16.930
I won't--

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.435
<i>He's unconscious…</i>

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.562
<i>Sorry, Kacchan.</i>

00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:25.689
<i>This is who I am…</i>

00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:31.945
Jeez, he could've passed by
going through the gate by himself.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.576
He hit me with everything he had, huh?

00:18:40.037 --> 00:18:43.665
That's right. That's how you
were from the beginning.

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:49.171
<i>You can't help but save</i>
<i>those who need rescuing.</i>

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.924
<i>And at times like that,</i>

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:56.512
there isn't a wall that can stop you.

00:18:58.305 --> 00:19:03.143
That's right. That's the kind
of person you've always been.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.145
GOOD JOB!

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:09.441
<i>Team Midoriya and Bakugo have passed!</i>

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:15.405
<i>All matches for Class 1-A's</i>
<i>practical exams have been completed!</i>

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.412
Kiss!

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:27.876
Thank you very much, Recovery Girl…

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.588
All Might, you really don't know
how to hold back, do you?

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:35.509
If you'd hit any harder, you would've
done permanent damage!

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:39.388
Especially Midoriya's back.
I was barely able to heal it!

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:44.142
Bakugo probably won't
wake up for a while.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:46.895
For now, the two of you should rest here.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.231
Yes, ma'am.

00:19:51.817 --> 00:19:53.610
You've gotten so strong
since I first met you

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:57.489
that I can hardly recognize you,
Young Midoriya.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.325
And this young man, too…

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:02.244
Young Bakugo!

00:20:02.578 --> 00:20:07.541
Because you were able
to smile in the face of a wall!

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:13.672
That's right. You two can
still become much stronger!

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.011
<i>A lot of things happened.</i>

00:20:20.304 --> 00:20:23.348
<i>Some learned their own weakness</i>
<i>and moved a step forward…</i>

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:27.227
<i>Some were taught</i>
<i>what is necessary for a hero…</i>

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.564
<i>Some were thwarted by high walls…</i>

00:20:31.273 --> 00:20:33.525
<i>Some learned of their own powerlessness…</i>

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.154
<i>Some moved forward toward a new goal…</i>

00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:42.701
<i>With these bittersweet feelings,</i>
<i>our final exams ended.</i>

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.214
Are you curious, Tomura Shigaraki

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.300
about that boy, Izuku Midoriya?

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.345
Shigaraki…

00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:05.224
You all have been the talk
of the town for the past few days.

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.393
I hear you're starting something big--

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.188
And? Who are they?

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.239
So it's you, huh?

00:21:20.948 --> 00:21:25.452
I saw a picture of you,
but you look gross in person…

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:27.454
Wow, the hand guy!

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:29.957
You're friends with the great Stain,
right? Right?

00:21:30.624 --> 00:21:33.544
Let me join, too! The League of Villains!

00:21:34.378 --> 00:21:36.463
<i>They start moving a third time.</i>

00:21:37.673 --> 00:21:38.882
<i>Every time we drive them back,</i>

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:41.426
<i>they come back stronger.</i>

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:14.061
<i>Here's the preview!</i>

00:23:14.228 --> 00:23:17.189
<i>Someone appeared before me</i>
<i>when I went to the mall with everyone…</i>

00:23:17.356 --> 00:23:18.857
<i>Tell me…</i>

00:23:19.024 --> 00:23:20.984
<i>It was Tomura Shigaraki!</i>

00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:23.237
<i>What's the difference</i>
<i>between me and the hero killer?</i>

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:25.155
<i>Aren't we doing the same thing?</i>

00:23:25.614 --> 00:23:28.784
<i>But almost everyone is looking</i>
<i>at him rather than me.</i>

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:30.661
<i>Why is that, Midoriya?</i>

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:32.871
<i>Next time, "Encounter."</i>

00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:35.749
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:38.877
<i>Everything's All Might's fault.</i>

00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:40.671
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:42.381
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
