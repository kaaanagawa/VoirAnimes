00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.230
"Hero Work Study"

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.350
Hero work studies...

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.730
They are experience-oriented
off-campus activities

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.860
that students in the hero course who
have their provisional licenses participate in

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.240
"Experience-oriented off-campus activities"

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.780
by going to the agencies
of pro heroes to work.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.080
During the internship I did before,
when I fought against Hero Killer: Stain,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.870
I didn't have my provisional license,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.750
but this time, it's different.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.750
The use of my Quirk under
the guidance of pros is allowed,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.050
and I can be dispatched to disaster areas
and join in the fights against villains.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.500
"Provisional License
Authorizing Hero Activities"

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.340
And if I do well at my work study,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.840
then I could be invited by the pros
I work with to be their sidekick--or partner--

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.590
"Sidekick"

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.310
and famous pro heroes
could also scout me directly.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.640
"Scout"         "Early Recruitment"
"Headhunting"        "Contract"

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.440
I, Izuku Midoriya,
chose for my hero work study

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.440
the agency of All Might's
former sidekick, Sir Nighteye.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.990
But I had a challenge to overcome first--

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.030
If you don't want to be turned away,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.700
then before you finish talking to Sir today,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.370
you need to make him laugh at least once.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.830
Humor?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.460
I can do that.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.090
In order to become the number one hero!

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.920
I'm Izuku Midoriya!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.470
Are you...

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.470
...ridiculing All Might?

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.980
It... It wasn't funny!

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.690
You little...

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.030
What's with that face?

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.410
What are you trying to do?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.910
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.450
Oh, well, um...!

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.210
You committed this outrage knowing
that I was All Might's former sidekick?

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.090
All Might's wrinkles are not like that.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.010
In his normal face, the wrinkles
around his eyes are 0.6 cm long.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.430
From Silver Age on,
they were about 0.8 cm long.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.770
"All Might ~Silver Age~"

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.560
These days, even unlicensed
merchandise specifies which "age" it's from.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.680
"Imitation of Official Merchandise"

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.810
Do you not even know that?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.480
Every corner of the office
is filled with All Might merchandise...!

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.490
That's the 10th anniversary
tapestry that wasn't for sale!

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.910
I want it!

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.950
There's no doubt about it...

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.990
This man's definitely

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.040
a serious All Might fan!

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.790
This is very unpleasant.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.250
Please leave.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.710
The vinegar riverbank incident...

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.250
Are you not aware of that?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.920
H-Help! Help me!

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.760
A middle schooler whose Quirk could
change water quality was drowning in a river,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.640
and All Might saved him.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.020
It's fine now. Why?

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.730
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.850
Because I am here.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.400
The drowning middle schooler
changed the river into vinegar in his panic,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.320
and that got into All Might's eyes
when he jumped in to save him.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.740
This is the face he showed
at the interview right after that...

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.530
It stings...

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.450
His smile with narrowed eyes...

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.580
I chose that face here!

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.790
Of course I know about that.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.500
It happened before I teamed up with him.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.050
They also mentioned it on the
Yomiuri TV program, A Look Back.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.840
Yes, that one!

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.430
There weren't any villains involved,
and it's boring compared to his other work,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.520
so it's not really talked about
on the fan sites, but I like it...

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.690
I especially liked the witty response
he gave after being thanked by the boy...

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.560
Thank you very much! Thank you very much!

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.480
The pleasure's mine! Thanks to you...

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.400
"...my skin feels ten years younger."

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.490
That's it! I loved the "my skin" part!

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.820
You...

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.120
Were you testing me?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.740
Oh, no! It's just that because
All Might is a teacher at our school,

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.700
it's hard to speak much about him,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.080
so I got too excited
and couldn't help myself...

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.460
The crux of that incident was
the family life of that middle schooler.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.090
That's right! Whether you know that or not

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.880
makes a big difference
in the weight of the words!

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.050
Mirio... what's with that kid...?

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.640
"Pro Hero - Bubble Girl"

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.220
He's one of my underclassmen, right?

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.560
Even though you couldn't make Sir laugh,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.270
this is a pretty good
first impression, too, Midoriya!

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.270
"Boy Meets..."

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.400
I see...

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.870
So you want to do a work study
here in order to become stronger?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.780
Yes, sir! Please allow it!

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.330
You have a contract from the school--

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.870
Of course I brought it with me!

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.160
You will not interrupt me when I am speaking.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.500
No, sir!

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.210
"Contract"

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.460
Once my stamp is on that paper,
the work study contract will become official.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.590
Yes, sir!

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.590
A hero work study is not like the
weeklong internships of normal workplaces

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.430
that you can participate in casually.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.100
You must work here for at least a month,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.810
and of course you will be paid.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.350
As a first year who still has a lot of classes,
you will also rack up a lot of absences,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.270
and you will not be able to continue on this
path on the same level as your classmates.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.940
I understand that!

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.070
But...

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.570
...if I match my pace with everyone else,
then I can't be the top!

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.200
"Bam!"

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.210
Um, you missed...

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.000
Because I don't feel like stamping it.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.920
What?!

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.130
I understand the merits
of working here for you.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.180
But what merit is there in my employing you?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.430
With two sidekicks
and one work study student,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.560
this agency runs smoothly, so to add you...

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.730
What benefit is there in that?

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.480
How can you contribute to society?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.530
How can you be useful to others?
In order to be acknowledged,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.280
you must make those things clear.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.070
All Might showed it
with his power and humor.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.330
He gave hope to those
who lived in fear of crime.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.870
That's why the people acknowledged him.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.670
How I can contribute to society...?

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.880
In order to show how
you can benefit my company,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.890
you should show it with
your actions, not your words.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.260
Three minutes.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.810
Try and take this seal from me
in three minutes or less.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.100
If you want to work as a hero under me,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.610
then stamp the seal yourself.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.270
H... Huh...?!

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.900
I'm saying that even though you
don't possess a single funny bone,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.940
I'm giving you a chance.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.070
Well? Don't you think I'm a nice guy?

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.280
Mirio and Bubble Girl, you two go outside.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.080
Oh, right.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.330
That's not very energetic.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.790
Yes, sir!

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.710
Mirio, did you have a
practical interview like that?

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.510
Sir asked for me specifically, right?
So I didn't...

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.380
He really likes you, huh? Man...

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.720
Aw, man!

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.600
I'm jealous, you know!

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.180
Aw, man!

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.270
But man, this doesn't look good for Midoriya.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.270
The future looks full of darkness...

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.360
Up against Sir's Quirk,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.190
accomplishing that task is almost impossible.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.660
I will not attack you at all,

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.870
and you may attack however you wish.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.160
It doesn't matter what happens to this room.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.040
Come and get it.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.870
Nighteye's Quirk is...

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.750
No, I just need to get that seal.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.960
In order to become number one,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.550
you need to clear that path, Izuku Midoriya!

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.260
One For All...

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.930
...Full Cowling!

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.800
An approach from the front...

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.180
...is a feint leading
to an overhead attack...

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.470
...and another attack.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.520
I can see everything.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.100
I knew it...!

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.520
But...

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.020
...if I surpass the number of moves...!

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
Hurry up and show me...

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.580
...the merit in my hiring you...

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.920
...and your usefulness.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.380
He's really being toyed with, huh?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.250
Yeah, right?

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.260
I can tell just by listening, right?

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.090
Sir is serious.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.300
Don't tell me he has no
intention of letting Midoriya in...?

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.060
After one minute has passed,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.850
you back off briefly

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.440
and become uneasy,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.110
coming to terms with the reality
that you can't overcome my Foresight.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.940
Sir Nighteye! Quirk: Foresight!

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.690
"Sir Nighteye"
"Quirk: Foresight"

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.820
After touching someone
and locking eyes with them,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:04.540
for one hour, he can see the
choices that person will make!

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.790
The activation requirements
are a company secret.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.580
The number of moves
isn't making any difference!

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.420
He can see everything!

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.960
Is there any way to
slip through his Foresight?!

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.680
I did have some
high expectations for you, but...

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.470
You have enough power to become a symbol,
but you're completely ordinary.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.480
In this time when villains are getting excited,
and gloom is creeping in...

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.520
In that case, he should have had
let Mirio inherit One For All after all.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.530
One For All...

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.150
Togata...?

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.370
I love and respect All Might even now.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:47.160
But I don't understand
his selection of successor.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.460
"After all." That's what Nighteye said.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.670
Which means Togata was a
candidate for inheriting One For All...?!

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.670
Did Togata know about this?

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.680
How did Nighteye and All Might choose him...?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.390
And anyway, does All Might
know about all of this?

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.890
If he did, why didn't he tell me...?

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.560
Do you have time to think for so long?

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.350
Or are you tired?

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.650
Are you out of ideas?

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:18.190
When Mirio said he wanted to
introduce you to me, I was surprised.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.820
Shall I give it to you straight?

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.660
There is someone more worthy
to inherit One For All.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.370
I cannot acknowledge you.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.920
The words I received on that day...

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.420
You can become a hero.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.130
And next, it is your turn.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.220
My... all...

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.260
Surpass it...! Surpass it!

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.810
Until he can't react even if he can see it!

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.980
I can't just let him reject...

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.650
...everything All Might and I
have been through until now!

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.400
All Might chose me!

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.280
I will stamp that seal!

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.120
I will definitely make you acknowledge me!

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.960
"Mirio Togata"
"Quirk: Permeation"
"His body can pass through anything. When he uses it, even his breaths pass through him."

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.960
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 3rd Year"
"Birthday: 7/15"
"Height: 181 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: Ramen, Comedy"

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.960

"Birthday: 7/15"
"Height: 166 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Pork Cutlet Bowl"

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.000
Nighteye's Quirk, Foresight!

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.420
It lets him see the future.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.590
But I don't know how far into the future.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.970
If I don't know, then I'll need to
use more moves and more speed

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.020
so that I don't give him time to think
between his Foresight and my moves!

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.400
There is someone more worthy
to inherit One For All.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.150
I can't just go home after being told that!

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.780
Those movements...

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.950
...are like a degraded Gran Torino's.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.280
If the conditions are met,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.450
then whether it's one second,
one minute, or one hour in the future,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.250
I can see what you're doing...

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.590
...wherever you're doing it.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.130
By the way, in another two minutes,

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:06.180
you'll be crouched on the floor
without the seal or the contract.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.350
You've looked worried this whole time.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.390
I thought it would've been the
first thing All Might would teach you...

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.150
Those who stand at the top should
not show indecision or worry.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.030
Those who know this always act
with a vision in mind.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.450
You must've been taught this countless times,

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.830
but being tested now,
you can't put it into practice, huh?

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.410
You said you would have me
acknowledge you, right?

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.000
The more I watch you,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.710
the more I can't find a reason
why it has to be you.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.250
He said I could do it!

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.590
Who? One of the riffraff?

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.220
The greatest hero!

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.720
Sorry!

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.680
You said it doesn't matter
what happens to this room, right?

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.520
Nighteye's words earlier--

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.560
If the conditions are met,

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.230
then whether it's one second,
one minute, or one hour in the future,

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.360
I can see what you're doing

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.610
wherever you're doing it.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.620
He can see what I'm doing
wherever I'm doing it.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.910
The way he worded it bugs me.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.330
What is Nighteye seeing?

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.250
All the events in the future?

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.380
Or a specific target,
in other words, my actions?

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.790
I'll test that!

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.840
If it's the latter,
then his Foresight won't reach

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.470
the objects I scatter at random.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.010
Nighteye...

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.430
I can't yield, either!

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.020
I...

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.850
...am All Might's disciple!

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.940
That doesn't change what I see.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.230
I'm not done yet!

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.490
N-Not...

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.320
It's over.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.360
Not yet!

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.570
It's been three minutes.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.370
You're All Might's disciple?

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.080
I'm flabbergasted.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.670
You had one plan that didn't work out,

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.330
and it made you that clumsy and exhausted.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.710
It's not that I'm exhausted...

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.010
Then, was that a mistake?

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:12.340
I was about to step on
the tapestry that wasn't for sale

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.260
celebrating All Might's
tenth anniversary as a hero.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.720
Don't tell me...

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.890
...he avoided all the
All Mights in the office...

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.980
...as he jumped around
like Gran Torino?

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.320
Even as his emotions
were upset by my provocations,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.490
he moved thinking about the situation
around him and how to fight against me?

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.580
Excuse us!

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.700
Are you finished?

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.290
There was a loud bang at the end...

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.870
I'll take him, Mirio.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.380
All right!

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.130
What?! Why?

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.760
I couldn't do anything you asked me to!

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.050
I told you to take the seal
and stamp it yourself,

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.800
but I didn't say that you'd be
rejected if you couldn't do it.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.010
But...

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.600
Midoriya, you did it!

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.390
Sir, you laughed, right?

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.650
I'd already decided to take you on
when I heard you were coming.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.440
I also knew that you
weren't completely useless.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.570
But I hadn't accepted it.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.070
Right now, with the symbol gone,

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.870
the people want not a dim light,
but a dazzling one.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.620
Even if it goes against his will,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.130
I'll make you realize who is the
most worthy of that power right now

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.550
by having you work alongside the pros.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:35.140
One For All is transferred
through the will of the user.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.180
He took me on to make me give up.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.640
Me, the one All Might chose,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.770
Sir Nighteye, who doesn't accept that,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.150
and Togata, chosen by Nighteye--

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.860
Even though I'm disoriented
by our strange relationship,

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:57.030
even so... even so, I...

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.330
I look forward to working with you.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.500
You found a place to do your work study at!

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.040
That's great, Deku!

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040
Wow!

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.210
Congrats, Midoriya.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.710
Thanks.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.460
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.010
I can't be idle, either.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.470
But man, you're really amazing, Midoriya.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.430
Yeah, I mean,
you'll be at Sir Nighteye's agency!

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.510
You were recommended by Togata?

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.350
Good job!

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:30.070
I can't tell them that he just took me
to make me give up One For All...

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.570
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.570
The distance between us has widened again...

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.030
We need to catch up as soon as possible.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.660
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:41.290
The school said Gunhead hasn't had
enough interns, so I can't go there.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.000
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.370
Same here. I wanted to go to Selkie's but...

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.130
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.500
Fourth Kind doesn't
even take work studies...

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.380
I mean, the threshold's
been set pretty high...

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.430
Yeah, we can only ask pros with good track
records who'll take work study students...

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.680
It can't be helped.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.600
Unlike the internships, we'll be directly
involved, so if anything happens...

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.890
It becomes a problem of
who's responsible on the pro side.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.310
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.350
Mr. Aizawa!

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:12.230
Pros who accept students even after
knowing the risks are the real thing.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.480
Tokoyami,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.740
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.700
you've got an invitation for a work
study from one of those real pros.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.990
It's from Hawks, who works in Kyushu.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.490
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.070
Hawks?!

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.950
Ranked third in the hero ranking?!

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.040
Wow!

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.700
Good job!

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.290
What will you do, Tokoyami?

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.000
I respectfully accept.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.420
Very well.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.550
I'll give you the work study paperwork later.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.220
Let me know when you figure out
when you'll be going to Kyushu.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.180
I'll authorize your absences for those days.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.050
Isn't that great, Tokoyami?

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.470
I am most humbly pleased.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.100
We need to catch up as soon as possible.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.770
Stop saying that!

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:50.600
Also, Kirishima, Amajiki from
the Big Three wants to see you.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.940
He wants to see me?

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.940
Also, Hado wants to talk to Uraraka and Asui.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.530
Go see them tomorrow or
something and hear them out.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.660
That's all.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.780
Amajiki... I wonder what he wants...

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.950
You think it's about the work studies?

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.710
No way! If so, I'm getting my hopes up.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.210
I can't wait until tomorrow.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.210
I'm going to the third years' dorm right now!

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.670
Ochaco, let's go, too.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.920
Yeah!

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.930
--We need to catch up as--
--Shut up!

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.100
Uraraka and the others sure are lucky.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.430
Let's do our best, too!

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.180
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.060
Who cares about work studies?

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.770
Even if first years like us go,
we'll just be made to run errands and stuff.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.730
That was what happened
at your internship, right?

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.690
Don't remind me of my dark past!

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.950
Starting tomorrow, I have my work study...

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.500
The next day, the first day
of my work study--

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.500
Today, we will be doing
patrols and surveillance.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.220
We'll split up into two groups with me
and Bubble Girl, and Mirio and Midoriya.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.380
Surveillance?

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.970
Nighteye Agency is currently
working on a secret investigation.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.480
Shie Hassaikai is a
small designated villain group.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.520
Its young head... in other words,
the number two, Chisaki,

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.360
has started showing strange actions.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.280
His plague mask is his trademark.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.200
That mask's scary!

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.450
But designated villain groups are
under the surveillance of the police,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.790
so they usually seem pretty obedient.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.540
It's because there was
a big break up once in the past.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.500
But this Chisaki guy is starting
to gather them again for some reason.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.090
Recently, he's even made contact
with the League of Villains.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.840
The details are unclear, though.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.340
The League of Villains...?!

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.010
But we haven't been able to get any proof
that he's planning anything criminal.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.430
Because of that,
the Hassaikai is a gray close to black,

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.600
and we cannot treat them like villains.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.940
What we're after is their tail.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.940
Be careful not to let them suspect anything.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.400
Yes, sir!

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.800
Someone, anyone...!

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.300
Please, someone!

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.470
No...!

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.260
Someone... Anyone...!

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.430
Sorry, that must've hurt.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.900
Can you stand? Are you okay?

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.730
She's trembling? Why...?

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:09.360
Now, you know you can't go around
causing trouble for the heroes.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.620
My long work study...

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.990
Let's go home, Eri.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.450
...had begun.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960
"Preview"

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.920
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.380
The fact that I let go of Eri's hand...

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.720
The words from Sir Nighteye

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.880
that there is someone more
worthy to inherit One For All...

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.720
With these uncertain
feelings pent-up within me,

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.350
I learn of a shocking truth from All Might...

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.640
His future, as seen by Nighteye, is--

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.940
Next time, "Fighting Fate."

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.980
You're kidding, right?

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.770
That's... Why...?

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.690
I don't want that, All Might!

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:51.540
"Next time: Fighting Fate"

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.070
Go beyond!

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.250
Plus Ultra!
