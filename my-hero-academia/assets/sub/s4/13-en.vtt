"Residence of the head"

"Immediately after the start of the raid"

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.730
Suspect restrained.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.860
"Villain - Rikiya Katsukame
- Quirk: Energy Suction"

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.230
His bark turned out
to be much worse than his bite.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.490
No kidding.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.860
Rikiya Katsukame.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.700
He inhales the life force of those
he touches and uses it to enhance his size.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.160
"Pro Hero - Ryukyu - Quirk: Dragon"

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.120
Isolate him before he regains consciousness.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.290
Yes, ma'am.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.620
"Nejire Hado - Quirk: Surge"

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.040
There's a lot of commotion inside.
We'd better hurry.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.580
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.790
We're off to a late start,
but let's head after Nighteye.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.960
--Okay.
--Yes.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.960
Huh?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.290
Wha--

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.670
He's inhaling their life force?!

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.800
How? He's not even touching them!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.310
The boosting drug I got
from Irinaka finally kicked in.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.400
I feel...

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.940
Oh no!

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.990
...full of energy!

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.990
His Quirk's been boosted!

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.380
They've been robbed of their
life force and can't even stand up.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.840
Nejire!

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.630
Full charge!

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.730
"Nejire Hado - Quirk: Surge"

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.630
Nejire Hado.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.180
Quirk: Surge!

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.760
She converts her life force into energy,
which she shoots out as shock waves!

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.480
But, for some reason they twist,
so they lack speed.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.190
The drug wore off.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.280
Let me feel you up, cutie pie.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.360
Ew!

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.700
No!

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.330
--Uraraka!
--Huh?

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.870
I came to call for backup!

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.500
Our objective is directly
beneath that intersection.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.250
The pro heroes are pinned
and need reinforcements!

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.090
Everyone!

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.300
Nejire, hit us with everything you've got!

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.560
How come these broads can still move?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.520
Because every day...

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.060
...we're told:

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.980
"Go beyond...

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.980
...Plus Ultra!"

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.780
"Infinite 100%"

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.070
Ryukyu!

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.160
You guys!

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
Deku! Huh?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.660
Then who was the Deku we just saw?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.380
"Villain - Himiko Toga - Quirk: Transform"

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.710
Go entropy! Plus Chaos! Am I right?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.920
"Villain - Twice - Quirk: Double"
"Villain - Mr. Compress - Quirk: Compress"

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.470
Put some clothes on!
You're gonna make me flustered.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.010
So you duplicated me so I would dig you out?

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.180
Yes! Use my clear picture
of Mister to make a duplicate.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.980
Use Mister's Quirk to dig
through the underground.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.150
Escape to the surface.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.150
Toga disguises herself and
notifies the heroes. That was the plan.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.780
But that's not all! Listen up, Mister.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.200
Until today the yakuza wouldn't let us near
the kid who forms the crux of their plan.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.910
The crux is a kid?

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.370
That's right.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.620
So get down there and nab the crux.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.540
What?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.090
You're a copy, so you should bear the risk.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.460
What? The "Plus Chaos" thing was
also about revenge for my arm, right?

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.470
But you're a copy!

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.220
Get going!

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.890
Jeez! They really are crazy!

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.310
I was an idiot to think they were nice!

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.230
The League of Villains!

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.600
Uravity!

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.400
Nighteye!

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.150
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.320
Take care of Nighteye!

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.280
"Eri"

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.280
Chisaki!

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.410
"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.120
Everything's messed up.
You pieces of garbage!

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.790
I won't let you!

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.300
Grab her!

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.050
For sure this time!

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.050
So obstinate!

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.470
That got flung up, too? Disgusting.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.810
Th-That's...

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.020
That's enough.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.480
I don't want anyone to die.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.820
I don't want that.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.570
Why do they keep...

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.830
I will become your hero!

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.630
I will never make you sad anymore.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.590
Chisaki, do you remember my daughter?

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.180
That's her daughter.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.890
The stupid girl abandoned her child.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.440
"My husband died. The girl
is cursed," she said.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:29.030
Apparently, one day, when her husband
reached for the child, his whole body vanished.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.990
An ability manifested, one that doesn't
take after either side of the family.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.710
It's called a mutation.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.840
It's no curse. I hear it's
extremely rare, but it happens.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.050
I'm told she doesn't know how
it works or how to use it.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.880
And that she isn't aware of what happened.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.560
But it's similar to your Quirk.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.560
Look after her. And while you're at it,
investigate her Quirk.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.860
I know you're good at that kind of stuff.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.230
Similar to my Quirk?

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.030
Preposterous!

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.570
It's not repair or restoration.
It's on a completely different level

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.620
How astonishing.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.120
This is Eri's Quirk.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.750
The power to rewind!

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.550
These people aren't going to give up.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.760
Not until I'm saved.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.510
Even if it means they'll die.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.100
I have to let them save me.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.770
I have to go back.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.810
I have to go back!

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.560
Into his kind arms!

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.990
"Izuku Midoriya"
"Quirk: One For All"
"Smashes villains with a super power passed down from one generation to the next."

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.380
Eri!

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.000
Save her, Izuku Midoriya!

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.050
You have to!

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.970
Eri!

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.810
You already...

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.270
...let go of her once.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.020
This time, make sure...

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.400
...to keep hanging on to her!

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.620
I'll never...

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.870
...let you go again.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.050
Give her back!

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.640
I can't move well in midair.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.770
I won't let go!

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.890
I'll never, ever let her go.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.940
I'll never...

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.690
...let her go through that again!

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.610
What kind of hero do you want to be?

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.490
I want to be strong enough
that no one will worry about me.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.780
To always win...

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.120
To always save everyone...

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.450
What... just happened?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.330
Where's Deku?

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.920
Chisaki!

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.130
Did I blast off in my attempt to kick?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.050
Like All Might's New Hampshire smash?

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.850
The air pressure propelled me at high speed?

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.350
Did I lose control like
when I fought Kacchan?

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.780
Even though I never told her what
her power was--or how to use it...

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.570
Eri. Naughty girl. You know you belong to me.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.910
In other words...

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.790
...I used One For All at 100%?

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.250
Wait! Wait a minute!

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.250
That would mean my leg is...

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.430
In order to realize the
old man's greatest wish,

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.590
I need you, Eri.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.720
Oh no!

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.100
It's… fine...

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.310
...for you.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:16.030
At least for the time being,
he won't target any of you.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:21.410
He'll head to the surface
in pursuit of Midoriya and Eri.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.200
"Pro Hero - Sir Nighteye - Quirk: Foresight"

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:27.660
Then, he'll kill Midoriya.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.370
We have to--

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.760
I want to move, but I can't!

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.260
Deku!

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.390
I saw it...

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.730
We can't do nothing after hearing that!

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:57.400
With the shape you're all in,
you couldn't beat him if you tried.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.900
So what?

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.410
We can't just do nothing!

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:09.410
You don't know how the future'll turn out!

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.630
I'll twist that future!

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.050
Froppy.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.140
Mirio should be beyond
that hole in the wall. Help him.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.980
Uravity, Ryukyu, take me...

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.980
Head to the surface with me!

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.070
My body's on fire! No wait, it's cold...

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.910
I used 100% of my power.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.410
And yet my bones are intact!

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:54.160
My injuries are even healed.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.630
Is this... your power?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.890
Wh-What's happening?

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.890
It's like my body is being
pulled from the inside.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.430
She has no control.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.980
She may have activated it at a good time,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.360
but she doesn't know how to stop it.
Isn't that right, Eri?

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.120
She rewinds humans. That's who Eri is.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.700
Depending on how you use her,

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.910
it might even be possible to turn
a person back into a monkey.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.420
If you keep carrying her like that,
you'll be annihilated.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.840
Everyone who touches her
will be rewound into nothingness.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.970
That girl's Quirk is cursed.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.550
Hand her over.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.470
There's no way to stop her
other than to disassemble her.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.430
Unless you want to
be annihilated, hand Eri over.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.850
Never.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.780
So that's it. The moment my leg broke,

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.320
you wound it back to before it had
broken--before I could even feel the pain.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.780
Your Quirk is such a blessing!

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.500
Now that I've experienced it,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.670
I understand the speed at
which my body continues to rewind.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:25.920
So, if I constantly sustain major injuries
at an even greater speed...

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.550
One For All...

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.510
...Full Cowling...

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.850
...100%!

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.060
Eri, will you lend me your power?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.530
Neither you nor Eri knows
the value of her power.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.110
Quirks progress markedly
when you develop them.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:54.030
By conducting countless experiments,
I extracted Eri's power

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.410
and succeeded in bringing
it to its end point.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.380
As a result, it doesn't stop
at simply winding back the flesh.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.340
It winds back on a much greater scale.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.880
It rewinds the course of the
species--to its unmutated form.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.300
That's the kind of power Eri possesses.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:21.190
The power to annihilate Quirk factors
and turn humans back to normal!

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:27.480
Enough power to destroy this world built
upon Quirks--to destroy the natural order!

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.650
That's Eri.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:36.370
You don't know Eri's value!
A punk like you can't exploit an asset like her!

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.210
Smash...!

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.430
Dang, Izuku.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.430
Hey, what's Mister doing?

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.900
Don't wait for us, Uravity!

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.480
Take Nighteye to an ambulance!

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.480
Stabilize the fragment in
his stomach. Don't remove it!

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.820
Eri's power has gotten stronger.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.290
Chisaki said she doesn't know how to stop it.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.580
Just like I was when I
first used One For All,

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.090
she doesn't know what she's doing,

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.880
and she's just letting it all out.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.640
Chisaki.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.680
I'm told you started another fight.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.680
You left your opponent in critical condition.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.350
I just laid out a chump
who was moving in on our turf.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.530
Our name recognition has been falling lately.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.280
We have to set an example
so they know who's boss.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.990
You...

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:59.330
I know you started a
new racket without my approval.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.450
I told you not to get involved in drugs.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.750
I appreciate that you're just trying
to repay me for taking you in.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.380
Still, you always go too far.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.850
Stop straying from my path.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:23.520
Ideals won't turn back the tide.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.440
Why don't you get that, old man?

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.360
Well, it does seem divorced from reality...

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.610
...for the yakuza to rule
the underworld again.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.910
I'll make it happen.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:43.910
If my plan succeeds,
there'll be no stopping the Hassaikai.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:52.250
First, as part of the research process,
we'll release some of the unfinished product.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.050
We'll let them catch a whiff.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.890
It can neutralize the
meddlesome hero industry.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.060
It will be irresistible.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.810
And once we've fanned up a hunger for it,

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.520
we'll sell the finished
product at exorbitant prices.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.770
Then, we'll dangle a serum in front
of them that rewinds to restore Quirks.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.110
While we sell the guns
and bullets to the villains,

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.950
we'll sell the serum to the heroes.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.990
Since Eri's flesh is the source,

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.830
we'll have a monopoly on
the market and control it all!

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.330
Then the Hassaikai will once
again rule Japan from the shadows--

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.670
Chisaki.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.540
I told you to stop this.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:36.130
That girl is a person.
Does that mean nothing to you?

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.880
If you want to go against our ideals,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.350
then I'm through with you.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.940
That's not it.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.440
You took me in.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.780
I just want to repay you.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.650
Don't worry.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.410
Just sit back and relax.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.080
I owe you my life.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.330
Those diseased hero pretenders
backed you into a corner.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:16.590
Once my plan is on track
and we make it big, I'll repair you.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:20.970
Look forward to it, old man.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.600
Why won't anyone...

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.560
...look at the big picture?

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:38.400
What I'm going to tear down
is this world--its very framework!

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.360
Your justice is small.
You only see what's in front of you.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.120
It's mere sentimentalism.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.740
You hero pretenders...

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:51.080
Stay out of my way!

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.260
If I can't save...

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.260
...the one small girl in front of me...

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:19.570
...how can I become...

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:43.220
...a hero who saves everyone?

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.150
Deku!

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.650
Nighteye?

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.950
I-I saw it.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:10.490
Chisaki succeeded in his escape,
and Midoriya lost his life.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:17.040
That's... the immutable future I saw.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.840
I... did not see...

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.760
...this future.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.270
Does that mean...

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.310
...it can be changed?

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.610
Even if that was already decided...

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.070
...I'll twist that future!

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.750
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.500
I managed to defeat Chisaki

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.090
thanks to Eri's rewind Quirk.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:33.100
But the sacrifice was much too great.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.470
Amajiki.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.810
Kirishima and Fat Gum.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:37.980
Rock Lock.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.230
Mr. Aizawa.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.060
Uraraka and Asui.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.110
And finally...

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.070
Next time, "Bright Future."

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.620
"Next time: Bright Future"

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.030
Go beyond!

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.460
Plus Ultra!
