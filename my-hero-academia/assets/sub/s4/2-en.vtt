00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.690
About 80% of the world's population

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.440
is born with some kind of special trait,
a Quirk, in this superhuman society.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.150
"Quirk"

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.070
To fight against villains using
their Quirks to commit crimes,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.150
"Villains"              "Enemies"

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.820
the profession of "hero" was created.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.120
I, Izuku Midoriya, dreamed of becoming a hero

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.460
and enrolled in the prestigious
U.A. High School,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.880
where, even as I was
caught up in various incidents,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.130
I was able to pass the provisional
licensing exam to become a hero.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.480
The next thing I'm aiming for is
to participate in the hero work study,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.270
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.150
where we go work with
pro heroes at their agencies.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.110
Huh? Work study?

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.570
Who are you again?

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.820
I was wondering if you
took any students for them...

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.580
Sorry, I'm working on something else
right now, so I can't take care of you.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.460
Oh yeah, you were a useless successor

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.540
with no one but me asking
for you after the sports festival!

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.380
It's because I'm a useless successor

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.260
that I want to do anything I can
to get closer to the number one hero!

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.430
Can't All Might introduce you to some people?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.480
Like to his old sidekick, Nighteye.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.030
"Villain - Twice - Quirk: Double"
"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.360
Give me a break...

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.110
This place is so dusty...

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.870
I feel like I'll get sick.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.780
Don't worry!

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.240
The guys inside are already sick!

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.170
"Villain - Mr. Compress - Quirk: Compress"
"Villain - Himiko Toga - Quirk: Transform"

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.670
"Villain - Magne - Quirk: Magnetism"

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.590
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.630
You brought a crazy big fish, huh, Twice?

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.090
Big fish? That's ironic...

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.100
...League of Villains.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.770
What? Is that guy someone famous?

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.350
Master showed me a picture of him before.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.810
He's what you'd call "yakuza."

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.940
"Shie Hassaikai"

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.150
The young head of the Shie Hassaikai.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.030
"Overhaul"

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.660
The young head of the Shie Hassaikai...

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.040
So he's the number two of organized crime?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.870
Oh my, I've never seen anything like him!

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.410
He smells dangerous!

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.830
"Organized crime"?

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.630
How's he different from us?

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.300
All right, let me tell you.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.930
In the past, there were lots of
scary groups that ran the underworld.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.010
But, after heroes started thriving,
they were unmasked and disbanded,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.270
And once All Might appeared
on the scene, that era was over.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.730
The survivors who hadn't been caught
became designated villain groups...

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.770
In other words, they were
treated like villain reserves

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.990
just scraping by to make a living
under the watch of the police.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.240
Frankly, they're obsolete
and should be a protected species.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.330
Protected species, huh?

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.410
Well, he's not wrong.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.040
So, why is this impoverished yakuza boy here?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.460
Are you also on a high
because of All Might's retirement?

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.000
No, it's less about All Might

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.260
and more about the loss of All For One.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.850
The emperor of darkness who ruled
over all of the underside of society.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.430
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.140
My generation treated him like an urban legend,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.190
but our elders believed
they had reason to fear him.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.650
Even after he was rumored to be dead.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.570
But this time, he showed up in the flesh...

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.150
United States of...

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.700
...Smash!

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.710
All Might retired, and All For One
was thrown into Tartarus.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.000
In other words,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.840
right now, for both those in the sun
and those in the shadows, there is no leader.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.210
So then, who will be the next leader?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.760
If you know who my master is,
and you're still saying that...

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.560
Are you here to challenge me?

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.020
I'm the next leader.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.730
Even now, I'm gathering my troops.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.060
Our numbers will increase soon.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.690
And with that power,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.280
I'll crush hero society starting with its head.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.450
Do you have a plan?

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.870
A plan?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.910
You little...

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.580
You came here to join us, didn't you?

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.920
A goal with no plan is called a delusion.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.000
If you present me with a delusion,
then how am I supposed to react?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.300
What are you going to do
after you increase your forces?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.300
How do you plan to manage
them in the first place?

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.130
What kind of organizational chart
are you trying to create?

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.930
Starting with Hero Killer: Stain,

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.760
there was also Muscular and Moonfish.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.680
They were all first-class game pieces,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.020
but you lost them right away, didn't you?

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.610
Did you not understand how to use them?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.070
You can't even manage ten or so crazy people,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.860
and you're talking about increasing your forces?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.910
What'll you do after gathering
power that you can't control?

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.330
You need a plan in order to achieve your goal.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.910
And I have a plan.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.380
I didn't come here today
because I wanted to join you.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.880
Twice, don't bring people
before checking their intent.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.840
In order to execute my plan,
I need a lot of money.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.760
There isn't really anyone willing to invest
in some obsolete small-time yakuza.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.520
But it'd be different if I had you guys,
with your increasing name recognition.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.560
Put yourselves under me.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.650
I'll show you how well I can use you.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.280
And then, I'll become the next leader.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.860
Go home.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.620
Sorry, yakuza boy, we didn't
come together to be under someone.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.920
I met up with my friend the other day.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.960
She's reserved and shy,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.420
but she's someone who is still
my friend even knowing my past.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.090
She told me,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.090
"Those who are bound
by the chains of common sense

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.100
laugh at those who aren't."

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.390
Kennie, you're not bound by common sense.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.400
I don't have the courage
to break away from it like you.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.570
I'm here because I don't want
to be bound by anything!

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.780
We will decide where we belong!

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.750
B...

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.420
Big Sis Mag...!

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.670
You all made the first move.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.880
Argh, that's filthy.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.180
That's why I hate stuff like this...

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.890
Wait, Compress!

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.180
This guy's trouble!

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.430
I'll use my Compress to seal him away!

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.100
I can't use my Quirk?!

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.850
Don't touch me!

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.570
Shield!

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.040
I see...

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.920
If you'd started with that,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.170
it would've been a lot easier
to understand what you wanted.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.010
That was close, Overhaul.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.180
You're late.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.640
I missed a shot.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.600
But there was enough immediate effectiveness.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.310
Wait, where did you...?

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.180
We weren't being followed!

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.100
It was probably someone's Quirk.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.940
It'll be hard to make
objective decisions like this.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.900
Right. It's unproductive to cut
down each other's forces, anyway.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.030
We're even right now
with one corpse on each side.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.490
It's a good time to stop.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.450
Let's cool our heads and talk again another day.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.370
We'll owe you an arm.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.080
Bastard, I'll kill you!

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.080
Tomura, I can cut him. I'm going to, okay?

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.380
No.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.130
Let me take responsibility!

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.250
No.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.090
A wise decision, Hand Guy.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.300
It doesn't have to be right away,
but the sooner the better.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.760
Think carefully...

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.600
...about your own organization and stuff.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.470
"Shie Hassaikai"

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.020
Give me a call once you've calmed down a bit.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.310
Wait, you bastard!

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.770
Why did you stop me, Shigaraki?

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.610
Jin, more importantly,
take Atsuhiro to the doctor.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.320
Can you stand?

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.990
My Quirk... wouldn't come out...

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.490
Damn, that hurts!

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.240
Tomura, I'll cut those guys.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.120
No.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.290
Tomura?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.120
Not yet.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.250
You failed again, huh, Tomura?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.590
"Special Prison For Villain Criminals -
Tartarus"

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.420
But do not be discouraged.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.430
Just start over.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.220
Start over as many times as you need to.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.220
That's why I'm here.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.140
Everything is for you.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.520
You need a plan in order to achieve your goal.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.110
And I have a plan.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.070
Shie Hassaikai...

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.910
I'll demand a lot in repayment for this...

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.040
"Twice"
"Quirk: Double"
"He can create up to two copies of anything at the same time. He can also duplicate himself."

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.040
"Affiliation: League of Villains"
"Birthday: Unknown"
"Height: Unknown" "Blood Type: Unknown" "Likes: Unknown"

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.040
"Tomura Shigaraki"
"Quirk: Decay"
"He can make anything he touches with his fingers decay."

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.040
"Affiliation: League of Villains"
"Birthday: Unknown"
"Height: Unknown" "Blood Type: Unknown" "Likes: Unknown"

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.960
About the hero work studies that are like
a more serious version of the internships,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.590
where you go to where
pro heroes work and help them...

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.050
We talked about them at
our faculty meeting yesterday,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.600
and almost all the teachers,
including the principal,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.220
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.270
thought you shouldn't do them.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.390
What?!

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.100
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.400
After we had that big meeting about it?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.730
But thinking about why we ended up
in the dorms, I guess that makes sense...

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.480
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.990
Serves you right!

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.110
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.490
Just because you probably
wouldn't be able to participate...

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.150
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:26.160
But some think we won't be able to raise
strong heroes with our current policies,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.580
so we came to the decision that
first years will only be allowed to go

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.960
to agencies with a good track
record of accepting work study students.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.590
I wonder if Gunhead's place will work...

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.680
Maybe I'll try contacting Selkie...

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.390
Damn it!

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.640
An agency with a good track record
of accepting work study students...

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.190
Can't All Might introduce you to some people?

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.810
Like to his old sidekick--

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.520
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.610
You want me to introduce you
to Sir Nighteye for a work study?

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.610
Yes! He's one of the few heroes
who has worked under you!

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.120
So energetic...

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.660
I want to go karaoke.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.950
Sir Nighteye, huh?

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.330
Where did his name come up?

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.130
I see...

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.960
You wanted to get a head start on the
work studies, so you called Gran Torino, huh?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.880
Please!

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.880
I refuse.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.760
"I refuse."

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.050
I'm not saying that to be mean.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.760
There are three reasons:

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.230
1. In the meeting yesterday,
I opposed the work studies.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.310
I think first years don't
necessarily have to start now.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.440
I agree.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.320
Can't the school just support
the kids who want to go?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:45.530
2. I think you should power-up your
Shoot Style before you participate.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.490
I think the kid's working hard, though.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.500
There's still a lot of room for
improvement before it can be used reliably.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.250
3. Sir Nighteye.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.290
There are reasons that make it
hard for me to talk to him.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.460
"Personal feelings"

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.290
Letting personal feelings
get in the way, All Might?

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.920
Personal feelings!

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.300
--Personal feelings, personal feelings...

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.880
--Mic, stop that.
--Personal feelings, personal feelings...

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.800
All Might...

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.390
Kacchan told me not to lose when someone
already laid the groundwork for me.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.020
My Quirk is similar to yours, All Might.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.360
If I'm working for Nighteye,
then I think I'll be compared to you.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.900
I need to get many times stronger

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.070
than everyone else!

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.200
The impatience of a successor...

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.080
No, but...

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.250
I don't dislike that attitude,
but I still can't introduce you.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.630
I can't, anyway.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.760
Third year, Mirio Togata.
All Might is calling for you.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.130
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"
"Tamaki Amajiki"            "Nejire Hado"

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.430
Please go to the counseling office at once.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.430
I repeat...

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.430
All Might's calling me!

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.020
I wonder what he wants!

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.230
Hey, Togata, what did you do?

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.770
--Did you do something
that could get you in trouble? Hey, hey!

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.230
--What could he want with you?
--Did you do something
that could get you in trouble? Hey, hey!

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.650
I don't know,

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.150
but I've "To-GATA" go see!

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.980
"I've 'To-GATA' go see!"

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.690
Just kidding!

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.490
Aw, I was totally not funny again, right?

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.370
Sorry!

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.500
You... are...

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.700
...here!

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.710
Just kidding!

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.040
Sorry, I got a little too excited when
I heard you wanted to talk to me, All Might.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.300
Um, I don't really understand what's going on...

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.220
What a coincidence, right? Me neither.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:32.470
Young Togata is currently doing
his work study under Nighteye.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.600
Is that true, Togata?!

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.810
Yup! I've been with him for a year now!

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.110
Then, when you graduate, you're pretty
much guaranteed to be a sidekick, huh?

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.270
As long as Sir doesn't change his mind, right?

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.440
That's so cool!

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.780
Getting straight to the point,

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:53.700
do you think Young Midoriya can
work under Nighteye, Young Togata?

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.540
I see, so this is what you
called me out to talk about, right?

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.830
You want me to introduce Midoriya to Sir!

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.960
Yeah...

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.840
But why use me as the middleman?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.090
Sir would be really happy
if you talked to him directly.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.130
He's always watching
videos of you when he has time.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.430
Honestly, I can't really face him right now...

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:17.140
Because in the end,
I ended up exactly as he warned...

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.900
So anyway, what do you think
about Young Midoriya?

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.900
Well...

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.820
What kind of hero do you want to be?

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.610
What kind...?

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.950
He saves everyone with a smile,
no matter what trouble they're in...

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.410
He's such a cool hero...

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.170
Can I... be a hero, too?

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.050
I want to save everyone
with a smile, no matter--

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.600
Izuku, I can't take this anymore.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.770
I want to be strong enough
that no one will worry about me.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.690
To always win...

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.110
To always save everyone...

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.280
I want to be... the greatest hero.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.740
It's often said that you can organize
your thoughts when you say them out loud.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.990
I've experienced a lot of things.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:22.160
The more I experience, the more
I understand how hard of a path it really is.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.420
That's why I need to become stronger.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.470
That's a crazy goal...

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.430
There's no reason
for me to refuse, so I'll do it!

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.310
Really?! Thank you so much!

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.190
Yeah! I always thought Sir would like you.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.650
Really?

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.780
I don't know if Sir
will agree to it yet, though.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.700
Even so, thank you so much...

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.660
I have no doubt that someone suitable
to be your successor will be here.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.330
Mirio Togata...?

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.750
His grades aren't that special,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.380
but he's a student who has a lot of presence.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.710
There's almost always
laughter echoing around him.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.180
Even if his grades are low,
his smile never goes away.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.560
Doesn't he fit your view of heroes perfectly?

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:25.940
If I hadn't met Young Midoriya,
he would've been my...

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.610
And then, it was the weekend.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.950
A day off, huh?

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.780
We were rushing around with the special
training and provisional licensing exam,

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.410
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.580
so I'm glad we can take it easy today...

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.410
"rush rush rush"

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.080
Morning!

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.000
Take it easy, man...

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.750
Those two over there

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.580
have their provisional license training
course on the weekend, huh?

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.130
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.380
You should be thankful to the teachers.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.090
Even after you fought with Midoriya at school,

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.550
they didn't take away your chance
to retake the provisional licensing exam.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.470
Shut up...

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.550
We need to catch up
to them as soon as possible.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.470
I said, shut up!

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.390
Walk behind me, damn it!

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.190
We're having a study session with
Yao-momo today. You guys wanna come?

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.150
Sorry, we're busy today, too.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.200
What side dishes should I have today...?

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.780
Everyone's got their own lifestyles...

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.660
An hour by train from U.A....

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.750
This is Sir's agency.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.880
Hey, don't be so stiff! It's not good.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.590
I didn't get to tell you this before,
but Sir's really strict.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.130
I am fully aware!

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.180
A hero famous for being strict
and harsh on himself and others...

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.590
Even just watching him on TV,

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.930
his sharp gaze through
the screen made me shiver.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.180
That's true, too,

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.270
but Sir has a different side to
him than what you see in the press.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.730
If you don't want to be turned away,

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.860
then before you finish talking to Sir today,

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.910
you need to make him laugh at least once.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.990
"Laugh" "laugh" "Laugh?"

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.540
Wh-What do you mean? Make him laugh?

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.080
Despite how he looks, or maybe because of it,

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.920
Sir really holds humor in high regard.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.000
The most I can do is introduce you to him.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.670
Sir's the one who will decide if he'll use you.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.550
I wish I could help you,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.050
but from here on out,

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.890
you need to figure out how to make
Sir acknowledge you on your own.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.140
It's kind of late to ask this,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:27.430
but why are you being so nice
to me even though we've just met?

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.060
I don't feel like I'm being
that nice, though, right?

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.400
You have a crazy goal,
and you're trying to turn it into reality.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.110
Wanting to do what you can
to help those in trouble

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.400
is part of the basics of being a hero, right?

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.160
Now, he's just beyond that door.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.080
If you want to become stronger,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.580
then open it with your own strength!

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.910
Yes, sir!

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.880
Let's see... The site where contact
occurred was already empty,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.800
but there appears to be
evidence of blood being wiped up.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.340
Based on the massive
destruction of the building,

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.640
we can assume that there was
some kind of fighting there.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.350
It is most likely the League of Villains--

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.810
Bubble Girl.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:14.100
I think there is no future for
a society with no energy or humor.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.190
Huh? Uh, wai...

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.360
The report was so long,

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.070
I was trying not to mess up...

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.450
Wait, no... Please stop...!

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.830
I've brought the first year
I told you about yesterday!

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.040
Sir Nighteye Agency!
Just what kind of place is it?

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.630
Just what kind of place is it?!

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.510
Jeez, see how loud your voice can get?

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.260
Stop...! Please, forgive me...!

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.300
What's going on?!

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.430
It looks like his sidekick, Bubble Girl,
couldn't make him laugh.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.440
So that's All Might's
former sidekick, Sir Nighteye,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.070
and his intense gaze in person...!

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.820
If you don't want to be turned away...

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.120
I want to become stronger.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.540
My selfishness led me to be brought here.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.790
From here on out,
I need to open the door myself!

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.420
Humor?

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.960
I can do that.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.960
In order to become the number one hero!

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.880
I'm Izuku Midoriya!

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.800
I admired All Might so much

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.890
that I practiced this in front
of the mirror for many years!

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.190
I'm not very good at making people laugh!

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.980
So, if this doesn't work...!

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.110
Are you...

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.240
...ridiculing All Might?

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.950
It... It wasn't funny!

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
"Preview"

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.380
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.130
Through the introduction of
the upperclassman, Mirio Togata,

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:29.130
I head off to the agency of Sir Nighteye,
All Might's former sidekick.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.220
My first encounter with
Nighteye was the worst...

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.050
But I won't give up.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:38.270
I'll learn a lot of things here
and definitely become a real hero--

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.440
Wait, there's a test?!

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.270
"No one told me about this!"

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.400
Next time, "Boy Meets..."

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.650
Is our meeting fate...?

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:51.660
"Next time: Boy Meets..."

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.900
Go beyond!

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.820
Plus Ultra!
