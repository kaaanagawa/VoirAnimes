WEBVTT

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.230
Midoriya, morning!

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.110
You're going to your work study today, too?

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.150
What a coincidence!

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.110
They haven't called me in for a while,
so it's like I'm finally going in again.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.400
I was told we didn't
need our costumes, though...

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.780
Oh?

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.910
Morning!

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.240
You two going in today?

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.910
Yeah.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.580
What a coincidence. We are, too.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.910
Oh, are you going to the station?

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.290
If you want, we can accompany you.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.750
Oh, if that's all right with you!

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.170
Thank you!

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.250
There are a lot of heroes.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.630
Huh? We're all going the same way?

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.380
Kirishima, aren't you in Kansai...?

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.140
Well, we're meeting in a place
that's different from usual.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.850
We are, too.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.140
Everyone's on the same train...

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.270
Going to the same station?!

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.810
"Tsuyu Asui" "Ochaco Uraraka"
"Eijiro Kirishima" "Izuku Midoriya"

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.230
That is a coincidence.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.900
Going in the same direction, too.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.980
Even turning at the same corner.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.070
"Tamaki Amajiki - Quirk: Manifest"
"Nejire Hado - Quirk: Surge"
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.690
Oh!

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.400
Oh.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.650
The Big Three are all here, too.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.200
This...

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.320
Wh-What is this?

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.080
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.080
Gran Torino?!

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.040
And Mr. Aizawa?!

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.750
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.050
Dragoon Hero: Ryukyu, BMI Hero: Fat Gum,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.670
Rock Lock, Kesagiri Man, and Mr. Brave.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.590
There are so many heroes gathered,
from famous heroes from the charts

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.470
to minor local heroes...

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.560
It's amazing...

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.770
Just what in the world is about to start...?

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.610
Hey, hey, what's this? What're we gonna do?

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.950
Hey, Ryukyu, you said it was a meeting,
I know, but what about?

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.370
You'll find out soon enough.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.740
Mr. Aizawa!

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.830
Mr. Aizawa, why are you here?

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.960
I was called out suddenly.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.580
I also heard roughly what's going on.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.710
Girls, I told you before, didn't I?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.920
Even if you're still students,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.720
now that you're here for a work study,
you're a legitimate part of our forces!

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.100
You two seem like you'll be able
to play an active role in that matter.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.390
"That matter"?

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.520
Nighteye, let's get started.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.440
"Pro Hero - Sir Nighteye - Quirk: Foresight"

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.900
Thanks to the information
we received from you all,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.610
the investigation has
moved forward substantially.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.820
We will now have a conference
to share what information we have acquired

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.620
regarding what the small organization,
Shie Hassaikai, is planning.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.080
I'm completely in the dark about this...

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.830
"Hassai"? What's that?

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.330
They might be thinkin'
of doin' somethin' bad,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.710
so this is a time for us
to discuss it together.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.920
You two are also very much involved.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.220
"An Unpleasant Talk"

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.510
Well then, let us begin.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:18.070
"Nighteye Agency Sidekick: Bubble Girl"

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.310
Those of us from Nighteye Agency have
been conducting an independent investigation

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.480
into the designated villain group known
as the Shie Hassaikai for about two weeks.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.610
What prompted this?

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.200
An accident involving a gang
of thieves called the Reservoir Dogs.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.450
I heard about that.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.200
The police wrote it off as an accident,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.950
but there were a number
of points that didn't make sense,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.950
so we began tailing them.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.460
"Nighteye Agency Sidekick: Centipeder"

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.790
I, Centipeder, conducted
a follow-up investigation.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.210
In my investigation,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.010
I found that, in the past year,
the members of Shie Hassaikai

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.300
have increased contact with
those outside of their organization

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.760
and other groups involved
with shady businesses,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.560
moving with the aim of expanding their
organization and increasing their funds.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.020
And soon after beginning the investigation,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.020
he was in contact with a member
of the League of Villains,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.730
Jin Bubaigawara, villain name: Twice.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.990
They were wary of being tailed,
and I was unable to follow them,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.160
but with the help of the police,
I was able to confirm

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.700
that an altercation had occurred
between the two organizations.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.250
Since the League was involved,
they also reached out to Tsukauchi and me.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.920
Where is Tsukauchi?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.260
There were other eyewitness reports
to look into, so he went to check them out.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.220
Kid, I didn't think it
would end up like this.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.050
I'm afraid I've pulled you
into something troublesome.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.060
I don't think of it as troublesome!

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.430
You know him?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.270
Oh, yes. He took care of me
during my internship...

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.560
It's the old man with All Might in Kamino!

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.900
Midoriya knows some amazing people!

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.940
Please continue.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.410
So after all this happened,
we put out a request for help on the HN--

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.950
You can skip that part.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.780
Right!

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.200
"HN"?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.870
Hero Network.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.920
It's an online service only those
with pro licenses can access.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.500
You can see reports of what all
the heroes in the country are working on

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.210
and request help from
heroes with helpful Quirks!

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.180
Even if they're from U.A.,
why are there kids here?

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.220
We'll never get anywhere with them here.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.220
The sun'll set before we
get to the actual plan.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.430
Don't say that!

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.770
"startled"  "startled"

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.390
These two have super important information!

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.100
Us...?

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.860
I can't take this...

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.030
Anyway, I think I'm meetin' a lot of you
for the first time, so I'm Fat Gum!

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.110
Nice to meet you!

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.780
He's so round and cute...!

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.030
Oh, here's some candy!

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:38.290
We suspect one of the Hassaikai's
main sources of income is unauthorized drugs.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.540
So I requested help from heroes
who are well-versed in those matters.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.670
Oh yeah, Fat did say something like that.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.380
I crushed tons of guys
like that back in the day!

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.010
And then, at Red Riot's
debut fight the other day...!

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.270
A type I'd never seen
before was shot into Tamaki.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.850
A drug that destroys Quirks.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.480
Destroys Quirks?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.190
What?! Tamaki, you're okay, right?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.860
Yeah, I recovered after I slept.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.530
Look at this cow hoof.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.530
So you had beef bowl for breakfast?

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.830
I feel better knowing
that you can recover from it.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.660
So it's not gone for good?

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.370
No. We will hear from
Eraser Head on the matter.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.670
It seems to be a little
different from my Erasure

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.340
since I don't attack the
Quirk itself directly.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.470
"*This is just an illustration."

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.090
The Quirk is an extra part with a special
function added to a basic human body.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.970
Those "extra parts" are
lumped together as Quirk genes.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.930
I only stop those genes temporarily,

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.230
but I cannot directly inflict damage on them.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.810
Right after Tamaki was shot,
we had the hospital take a look at him,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.480
and his Quirk genes were damaged.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.650
Thankfully, they healed on their own,
and he's now back to normal, though.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.110
What about the analysis
on what was shot into him?

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.240
There was nothin' wrong
with the rest of his body.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.910
It was only his Quirk
that received any damage.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.790
The guy who shot him
isn't sayin' anythin' either!

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.420
The gun's in pieces, and the only bullet
we had was the one that'd been shot!

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.090
But thanks to Kirishima's brave actions
that led to one bouncin' off his body,

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.640
we were able to get
one still filled with the drug!

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.720
Me? That surprised me!
It came out of the blue!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.810
This is so hard to follow,
I don't really get it.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.730
Good job, Kirishima!

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.100
So cool!

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.560
Hardening, right? I know about that!
It was the perfect match-up!

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.570
And after analyzin' the contents,
we discovered somethin' that made me sick.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.450
Human blood and cells were inside!

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.700
Human... blood...

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.870
What...?

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.000
It's like we're talking
about a different world...

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.330
In other words,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.090
that effect came from a person...
someone's Quirk?

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.420
A Quirk that destroys Quirks...

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.180
Hmm... I'm not really
sure I'm following this.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.720
How is this related to the Hassaikai?

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.520
The man Kirishima captured,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.390
and the illegal drug that guy used!

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.310
The distribution channels
for things like that are complex.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.570
It's gotten a lot smaller these days,

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.030
but various people and
organizations sell them wholesale

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.490
until they finally reach the end user.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.620
There's no proof that the
Hassaikai handled the goods,

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.160
but they did interact
with one of the intermediaries.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.290
That's it?

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.710
The other day, when Ryukyu's team
broke up a fight between two villain groups,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:36.470
controlling one of the groups was
the intermediary dealer organization.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.220
One of the two that turned giant

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.140
had been given an inferior drug
that didn't last very long.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.220
There have been a rash of
gang-related crimes recently,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.270
and most could be connected to
the Hassaikai if you tried hard enough.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.900
It sounds like you're trying really hard
to make the Hassaikai guilty.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.570
Don't you have something that
implicates them more obviously?

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.160
The young head, Chisaki's Quirk is Overhaul.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.490
His power lets him disassemble
and restore things.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.250
Disassemble... A Quirk that lets him
break things and then fix them.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.830
And a bullet that can break down Quirks.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.600
D... Don't go...

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.230
Chisaki has a daughter named Eri.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.480
There are no records or
details about her birth,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.110
but when Mirio and Midoriya encountered her,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.400
she had a large number of bandages
wrapped around her arms and legs.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.070
Don't tell me something so horrific...

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.780
It's a society of superhumans.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.330
If you can dream it, you can do it.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.330
What?

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.830
What are you talking about?

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.830
Are you sure we need the kids?

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.330
I'll only say this once.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.800
We're wondering if this Chisaki bastard

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.300
is turning his daughter's body
into bullets and selling them.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.510
N...

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.350
No way...

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.060
We don't know if he's
actually selling the bullets.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.560
At their current stage,
their efficacy is still too uncertain.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.610
However, if they're at the test stage,

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:18.280
and he's using them as samples
to gather more to his cause...

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.110
There is no hard evidence.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.780
But he's gathering people
and funds across the nation...

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:29.200
If the completed drug would be able
to completely destroy someone's Quirk...?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.750
I'm sure they'll have many
ideas for crimes using this.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.830
Just imaginin' it makes my blood boil!

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.670
Let's go find him right now!

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.470
Wouldn't this have been resolved already
if those two had just taken the child?

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.550
I take full responsibility for what happened.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.800
Please do not blame them.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.760
Even though they didn't know the full story,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.390
they acted to save the girl.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.150
Midoriya was willing to
bear the risk of taking her then,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.730
but Mirio thought ahead and acted
to try again when the odds were better.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.530
Some "greatest hero" I am...!

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.990
Lemillion to save a million? Ha.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.710
The ones most frustrated here
right now are these two.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.250
We will definitely take Eri next time...

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.040
...and protect her!

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.300
That's right. That is our goal.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.970
"Sir Nighteye"
"Quirk: Foresight"
"He can 'see' what his target will do for one hour."

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.970
"Affiliation: Pro Hero"
"Birthday: 1/2"
"Height: 200 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: All Might"

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.970
"Mirio Togata"
"Quirk: Permeation"
"His body can pass through anything. When he uses it, even his breaths pass through him."

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.970
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Course 3rd Year"
"Birthday: 7/15"
"Height: 181 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: Ramen, Comedy"

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.290
We will definitely take Eri next time...

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.160
...and protect her!

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.040
We will save her!

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.790
We definitely will!

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.710
It's fine for the kids to show off,

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.510
but if it's what we think,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.680
that girl's the crux the
young head will want to hide, right?

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.680
She got out because of some kind of trouble.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.600
On top of that, some kid heroes saw her!

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.480
You think he'll just keep her at home?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.190
I wouldn't if I were him.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.520
Even if we push our way in,
it won't matter if she's not there.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.030
Have you already identified where she is?

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.950
He's right. How about it, Nighteye?

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.990
That is the real issue.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.990
Since we don't know how
far their plans have gotten,

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.790
we have one chance to strike when it counts.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.330
To that end, we have found groups
with connections to the Hassaikai

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.460
or land owned by the Hassaikai

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.710
and made as thorough a list as possible.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.720
I would like you all to
investigate each place

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.050
and narrow the list down
to possible locations.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.430
So that's why you asked minor heroes like us.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.810
What do you mean?

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.100
Look.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.730
The heroes here and the localities
where they work are the same!

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.820
Heroes were chosen who know the areas.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.700
For someone who was All Might's
former sidekick, you sure are careful.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.070
This is too roundabout!

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.280
While we're takin' our time,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.160
that little girl, Eri, is probably cryin'!

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.620
We cannot become All Might.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.000
That's why we must put together
our analysis and predictions

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.290
and try to make the possibility of
saving her as close to 100% as we can.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.420
We can't rush.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.510
If we make a big fuss about this
and then don't get her,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.590
this could be the kindling
for something bigger.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.510
Like how Stain's capture
became like an ad for the League.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:38.100
In fact, that might've been
the intent behind distributing

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.730
Quirk-destroying weapons to those hoodlums.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.060
You're thinkin' too much!

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.900
If you keep sayin' stuff like that,
you won't be able to do anythin'!

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.360
Um...

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.820
Can I ask a question?

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.700
I don't know how your Quirk
works exactly, Sir Nighteye,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.370
but if you can predict the future,

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.200
then why don't you just use
Foresight to see our futures?

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.670
If we continue like this,
it seems a bit illogical.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.380
I... cannot do that.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:11.430
My Foresight requires a
24-hour interval between activations.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.350
In other words, I can only use it
on one person for one hour each day.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.770
In addition, it's played
in my mind like a flashback.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.770
Please think of it as the ability
to watch a film of someone else's life

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.190
for an hour after activation.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.780
However, that film is all from
the perspective of that person.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.240
All I can see is that person's actions
and a little of their surroundings.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.790
Well, that should be enough
to let you find out a lot, though.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.170
What do you mean by saying you can't do that?

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.800
What if in that person's
near future, death...

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.640
...just a merciless death was waiting?

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.180
Nighteye... because of
what happened with All Might...

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.430
If you continue like this,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.140
you'll face off against a villain

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.070
and die an unspeakably gruesome death!

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.030
My Quirk should be used only
after we have already drawn out

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.910
the highest probability of success,
when it can be used to ensure our victory.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.080
It shouldn't be used haphazardly
when there are still so many uncertainties.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.450
What?! But death is information, too!

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.960
We could put together a plan to avoid it!

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.630
It isn't the same as fortunetelling.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.670
I have no conclusive evidence
that it can be avoided.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.170
Nighteye, I don't get it!

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.010
Fine, use it on me!
I'll show you I can avoid it!

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.590
No.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.140
Nighteye...

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.030
Anyway, let's do this.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.870
There's a girl in trouble.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.330
That's the most important thing.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.830
Confirm the girl's whereabouts,
and take her into our protection

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.880
with the most accurate information
we can get as quickly as possible.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.420
I'm counting on all of your help.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.810
If only I had taken her back then,
even if I had to do it by force,

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.600
right now, Eri would be...

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.690
I see, something like that happened...

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.520
I-It's so frustrating.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.190
Deku...

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.320
It's the first time I've
seen Mirio so down...

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.700
We're wondering if this Chisaki bastard

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.200
is turning his daughter's body
into bullets and selling them.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.870
Eri...

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.420
Is this a wake or something?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.050
Ribbit! Mr. Aizawa.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.720
Oh, call me Eraser Head outside of school.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:02.220
But man, I was going to recommend that
your work studies be suspended today...

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.260
What?!

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.970
Why, after all this time?

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.270
You heard them say the League
of Villains could be involved, right?

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.860
That changes things.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.490
We will definitely take Eri next time...

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.530
...and protect her!

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:26.450
But you know, Midoriya,
you still haven't regained my trust.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.500
I would be grateful if you could follow
the proper procedures and act properly

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.840
in order to regain that trust.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.260
Unfortunately,

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:43.510
I'm sure that if I stop you now,
you'll rush out again on your own.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.140
I'll watch you.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.310
If you're going to do this,
do this properly, Midoriya.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.400
Got that, problem child?

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.160
Mirio, please lift your face.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.570
Hey, I know about this.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.160
Hey, Togata, even if you regret something
and get depressed, nothing will change.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.000
Did you know that?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.160
Yeah...

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.130
I'll say this to give you some peace of mind.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.750
The hand you missed grabbing onto

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.590
did not necessarily mean despair for Eri.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.430
Face forward.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.390
Yes, sir!

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.510
Mr. Aizawa...!

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.350
I'm Eraser here.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.770
I will follow you for the
rest of my life, Eraser Head!

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.440
That's too long.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.810
Sorry!

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.070
Kirishima, you're too loud.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.280
Mirio...

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.570
I know.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.160
Midoriya, next time, we'll
definitely save her!

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.450
Yes, definitely!

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.160
Is that how it was?

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:55.080
I see, so you sent Midoriya
to help All Might and me make up...

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.800
Well, I thought it could give you a chance.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.970
When you get old, you think
about a lot of useless stuff.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.350
So, how is he?
What do you think of Izuku Midoriya?

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.810
I think they're very similar...

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:18.230
To the madness living deep inside
All Might that I couldn't understand...

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.860
...he's very similar.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.670
Eri...

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.380
It's okay, I'm just checking
to see if you're here.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.930
You haven't touched your toys at all.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.340
And I bought all these for you, too.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.680
You can let your guard down a little.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.640
If you don't, then I'll be
the one killed next time, brat...

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.060
I'm not scary, see?

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.980
Is there anything you want?

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.030
It's fine, it's fine.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.650
If I'm in the way, then I'll leave. See?

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.830
You're going to be her next caretaker.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.240
Don't let her feel like running away.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.460
Use the carrot, not the stick.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.750
Become someone Eri feels like she can trust.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:46.260
Even if he says that,
I don't understand what kids like.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.050
Maybe Glitter-something-or-other...?

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.850
It was different.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.890
Completely different.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:02.480
Up until now, no one had ever
touched me like that before...

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.150
Sorry, that must've hurt.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.230
Can you stand? Are you okay?

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.110
For such a small child to be trembling
like this without making a sound...

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.950
What are you doing to this girl?

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.620
His hands... were kind...

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.080
So kind...

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960
"Preview"

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.120
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.920
While Sir Nighteye and the other
pro heroes are determining Eri's location,

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.130
us work study students
were ordered to stand by.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.890
There's chaos in my mind.Â

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.930
The future awaiting All Might.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.930
Nighteye's words. Eri's safety.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.390
And then, the day to carry out
the plan finally comes...

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.400
Next time, "GO!!"

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.820
Eri, I'll definitely save you this time!

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:51.540
"Next time"

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.980
Go beyond!

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.670
Plus Ultra!
