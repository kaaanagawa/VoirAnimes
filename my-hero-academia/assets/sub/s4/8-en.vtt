WEBVTT

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.520
The spring of third grade,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.560
I transferred here on the
day of the opening ceremony.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.990
"Tamaki"

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm... Ama... jiki... um...

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.610
I-I... h...

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.490
I couldn't really talk
when I introduced myself.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.040
In a room where everyone
just changed classes,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.960
those who had been in the
same class before gathered together

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.750
and made new groups.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.750
No one had the courage to be the only one

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.510
to talk to the new transfer student
who had an awkward start.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.180
I hadn't been very good at
making friends at that point, anyway.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.890
I thought I was just a
quiet and boring person.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.060
Amajiki!

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.770
The "h" you started during
your introduction--

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.940
Were you trying to say "hero" there?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.700
Oh... well...

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.110
I like heroes, too!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.700
Back then...

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.250
Who do you like, Amajiki?

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.460
...because you talked to me...

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.920
You were so bright... shining...

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.510
Like...

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.970
...the sun...

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.020
I wonder if I can do it, too...

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.570
Shine...

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.660
...like you...

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.880
Shie Hassaikai, we have
a warrant to search your premises

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.090
on suspicion of the manufacture
and sale of illegal drugs!

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.840
Who the hell are you?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.800
Wait, what are you bastards?!

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.350
We said we're here to investigate, didn't we?

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.020
Please calm down!

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.140
Clear a path!

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.980
If you fight without thinking about
the consequences, you'll regret it!

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.900
They sent everyone out just to buy time?!

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.480
That's so self-destructive...

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.360
Leave them to us and go on ahead!

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.650
We're counting on you!

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.740
"Pro Hero - Fat Gum - Quirk: Fat Adsorption"

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.940
It's an emergency!

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.410
Excuse us for not taking off our shoes!

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.120
They haven't done anything suspicious yet!

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.620
"Pro Hero - Rock Lock "

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.580
I'm getting kind of worried, man.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.660
We have no choice but to keep
going now that we've started, though.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.380
"Tamaki Amajiki - Quirk: Manifest"

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.380
I wonder if someone leaked
information to them.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.840
I feel like they're all gathered
in one place for some reason...

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.130
If someone had, I think
they'd be avoiding us more smartly.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.430
They should all be used to working
together with one will already.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
"Pro Hero - Eraser Head - Quirk: Erasure"

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.760
They devote their all to their bond
with their boss and brothers.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.220
They might feel ashamed now,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.520
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.060
but that makes them put more
importance on their old bonds.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.520
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.390
This commotion...

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.310
And Chisaki and the top brass
haven't shown themselves yet.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.150
They're probably underground
getting ready to hide or flee right now.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.150
That's not loyalty!

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.860
Forcing their henchmen to take responsibility
and running away themselves isn't manly!

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.240
Yeah!

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.290
"Pro Hero - Sir Nighteye - Quirk: Foresight"

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.290
It's here.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.920
There's a device here to
open a hidden passage.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.880
By holding down these wooden
floorboards in a specific order...

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.390
...it'll open.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.350
It's like a ninja residence! Right?

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.560
If you hadn't seen it with your Foresight,
we wouldn't have noticed it.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.980
Be careful of Quirks we haven't seen yet.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.980
What the hell, bastards?!

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.110
Bubble Girl!

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.360
Take one of them!

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.910
Damn it!

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.410
My eye!

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.330
Right, sorry.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.410
I'll make them stay here and not follow us.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.870
Please go on ahead.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.670
Let's go!

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.170
I'll join you again soon!

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.170
We're almost there.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.670
Hurry!

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.550
It's a dead end...!

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.050
You sure you're not mistaken?

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.930
Explain yourself, Nighteye!

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.470
I'll go take a look.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.980
Lemillion, wait! Your clothes might--

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.350
It's all right.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.020
Mirio's costume is made of a
special fiber made from his own hair.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.900
It's made so it becomes permeable
when he activates his Quirk.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.700
I knew it!

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.910
The path continues, just like Nighteye said.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.950
It's just been blocked off by a wall.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.870
But it's a pretty thick wall.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.710
With Chisaki's ability to break down
and restore things, even this is possible?

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.380
A cheap trick...

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.880
It's like he's telling us he'll be
in trouble if we go this way.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.260
Yeah.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.630
Good luck to him if he
thinks that'll stop us!

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.180
One For All...

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.430
Full Cowling...

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.970
...Shoot Style!

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.390
Red Gauntlet!

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.520
You guys aren't too bad...

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.520
They beat me to the punch.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.780
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.940
Let's keep going.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.090
What...?

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.670
The path is rolling...!

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.470
It's changing!

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.930
It's not Chisaki!

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.180
It's different...

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.890
The only one it could be...

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.100
...is the director, Irinaka!

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.480
Irinaka's Quirk, Mimic,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.100
lets him go into objects and
control them freely from within!

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.400
"Mimic"

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.020
He's gone into the concrete
that makes up the underground,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.860
and it's turned into a living maze!

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.690
But it's on too big of a scale!

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.410
He shouldn't be able to enter
and control objects bigger than a fridge!

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.830
If he gets a big enough boost,
it's not impossible, huh?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.290
I was bein' careful
about what he'd turn into,

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.000
but I didn't think he'd
turn into the underground.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.090
This has got to be hard on him physically.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.460
Eraser, you can't get rid of it?

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.130
Not if I can't see the main body...

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.680
If the path keeps getting
changed and remade...

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.550
"Eri"

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.890
...then they can prepare as
many escape routes as they want.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.560
"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"
"Villain - Chronostasis"

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.100
To have the judgment to be able
to deal with this so quickly...

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.600
Oh, it's no use anymore...

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.690
Far from being able
to save the girl, we're also...

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.190
Tamaki!

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.990
That's not going to happen.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.780
You're the Suneater!

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.240
Besides, this is just a stopgap!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.200
No matter how much
they try to warp the path,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.830
as long as we know the direction of our goal,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.250
I can get there!

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.420
--Lemillion!
--Lemillion!

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.630
Time is of the essence!

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.010
Those guys know this, too.
That's why they're stalling for time.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.510
I'm going on ahead!

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.680
No...!

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.810
What am I doing?

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.220
Isn't Mirio doing his best?

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.100
Then...

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.190
What I should be doing is...!

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.270
He's slipping through, huh?

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.320
But...

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.570
...even if he reaches them,
he won't be able to do anything by himself.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.370
A hall?

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.920
We're getting further
and further away from our goal!

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.710
It looks like they've got us good!

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.750
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.510
Some government authorities
have fallen from the sky.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.930
Strange things happen, huh?

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.390
It looks like they're
really ready for a fight.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.940
It's about time we showed them
the strength of pro--

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.480
Save the strength of pros for the goal.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.190
It's not like that.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:17.200
I can do my best
because you're here, Tamaki.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.830
For the ones stalling for time...

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.620
...I'll be enough by myself.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.960
"Suneater of the Big Three"

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.960
"Tamaki Amajiki"
"Quirk: Manifest"
"He can manifest characteristics of things he eats in his body."

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.960
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Course 3rd Year"
"Birthday: 3/4"
"Height: 177 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Butterflies"

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.010
--Those in the front have been taken down.
--What should we do?
--We have no choice but to move forward!

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.220
There are more people than I expected.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.390
Let's deal with these first.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:48.980
I'll leave those to you,
Eight Bullets of the Hassai Group.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.320
For the ones stalling for time...

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.360
...I'll be enough by myself.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.490
What are you saying? Let's work together!

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.910
Yeah, work together.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.570
I'll kill all of you.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.700
It's Setsuno!

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.240
We can't use our guns against him!

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.080
Heroes, it's up to you!

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.830
You figured it out, huh?

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.660
Oh, well.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.040
It just makes it easier to go wild!

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.170
We won't let you.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.420
Throw away your sword.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.920
I can't use it.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.720
He erased his Quirk?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.550
An inferior version of Eri's Quirk.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.510
I've heard that a hero like that exists.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.520
But it doesn't matter.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.930
What we should be doing is blocking them.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.520
That's all.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.860
Swords and bullets will
just sink into my body.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.480
It'll be better for you if you give up now.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.320
Threats like that just make
you sound like you fear for your life.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.700
Since Eraser's erasing your Quirk,
we can use our weapons!

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.660
Resign yourselves and surrender!

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.830
Larceny, Toya Setsuno.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.040
Crystallize, Yu Hojo.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.460
Food, Soramitsu Tabe.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.170
I've looked over the
documents with their info!

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.670
I'll take these guys on.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.930
At Fat Agency, we eat tons of takoyaki,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.930
so I'm really good at using octopus.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.760
Since I was shot before,
I'm more alert to things like this.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.470
But Suneater!

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.020
It won't do any good for us
to all fight against them.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.650
With so many pro heroes stopped here,
we're playing right into their hands.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.320
We should save the pros' Quirks,
including Eraser's, for later!

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.820
We should save the power to get
through the wriggling underground, too!

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.990
And the police officers and their guns!

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.830
Fat Gum!

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.870
If it's me, I can completely
shut down all three of them.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.750
Let's go!

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.460
Fat!

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.460
To that door!

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.510
Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait!

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.920
Again...!

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.720
Amajiki, I used my Quirk
on the three of them.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.600
Bind them up before the effect wears off.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.930
Everyone!

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.360
Please take care of Mirio!

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.440
He's definitely going to try too hard,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.280
so please help him.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.740
Fat! You're going to leave him alone like that?
What are you thinking?

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.200
He's from your agency,
so I left that decision to you,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.410
but frankly, isn't he in trouble?

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.210
He's stronger than anyone here.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.050
But he was weak emotionally.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.850
He crushed himself with
pressure to do things perfectly.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.810
He climbed up to become part of
U.A.'s Big Three under those conditions.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.690
Someone like that declared that
he could completely shut them down!

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.610
So... all I can do is leave it to him!

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.990
These guys are here to
eliminate those heading to the target.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.660
Nothing significant is happening
with the one called Irinaka's mimicry, either.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.910
Did he prioritize the
police officers left at the top?

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.830
Either way,

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.170
I'll stop these guys.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.210
I still can't use my Quirk!

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.220
It feels gross.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.880
I talked big,

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.260
but if I can make them all unconscious
before Eraser's Erasure goes away...

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.470
Three at once.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.430
Sorry, but I'm going
to have you all go to sleep.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.150
You were surprised and pulled
back without thinking, huh?

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.200
I know you're in a hurry,
but you can't shrink back.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.580
Since you're fighting
people who're like trash.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.750
You don't know what we have under our masks.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.790
The Quirk of that scruffy man
from earlier's stopped working, too.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.840
It's a handicap for you guys
to not be able to kill us, isn't it?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.880
Lucky you.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.470
Larceny...

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.640
It lets him move anything his opponent
is wearing to his own hand instantly.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.640
Does my shell also count
as something I'm wearing?

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.900
We've thrown away
our possessions and our lives!

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.650
When I was caught by a hero
when I tried to jump to my death,

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.690
I felt so hopeless!

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.780
We're people who couldn't see the
point of living! You can't understand that!

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.660
The young head picked up
that trash and found a new use for it.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.410
Even trash has its pride.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.500
If someone has expectations for us...

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.590
...then we need to meet them!

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.050
What's wrong, Amajiki?

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.770
With your Quirk,
you should be able to do better.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.060
Are you still nervous?

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.150
Oh well, don't force yourself.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.980
Go back.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.820
Quirks can be used in various ways,
not just by heroes.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.620
How we use our Quirks in the future

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.620
was the point of the our
Quirk training class.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.960
What're you doing, Togata?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.080
Your face didn't go through!

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.170
I told you, it's really hard!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.710
You guys should try it!

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.300
It's probably five times
harder than you expect!

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.300
Togata, you're not very good
at controlling your Quirk, huh?

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.310
But next time, I'll get it right!

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.650
Mirio, you're amazing...

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.610
Hm?

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.280
Even if you can't do something,
you're still cheerful and positive,

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.240
so those around you become cheerful, too...

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.030
I'm no good...

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.620
If I think about messing up...

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.210
...my mind goes blank, and I can't move.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.630
You'll become an amazing hero...
one like the sun...

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.460
What are you saying?

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.050
You're making me sound so great,
but it's not like that.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.260
Huh?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.180
I can do my best
because you're here, Tamaki.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.230
It's not like I'm that mentally strong.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.270
It's just that,

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:08.070
seeing you do your best without running
away even though you get super nervous

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.690
makes me feel like I don't
want to lose to you.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.240
Lose?

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.240
I think you're overvaluing me
and undervaluing yourself too much.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.330
That's why you call me things like "the sun."

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:25.630
I know that you really have amazing power.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.630
I know that you're actually...

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.470
...a really cheerful and fun guy.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.350
That's why, if I use your own words,

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.060
then you're someone even
more amazing than the sun.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.060
I'm...

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.560
Have confidence in yourself, Tamaki.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.650
You're...

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.570
I'm...

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.530
...someone who eats even the sun, Suneater!

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.250
He uses the octopus arms that
are pure muscle to absorb the shock

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:06.670
and then makes multiple layers of shells
to protect from the crystal damage.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.500
But that's it!

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.670
All of it...!

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.390
The training I did with my Quirk
at U.A. over the last two years...

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.600
I'll put as much of it together as I can...

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.690
Variable sizes... manifesting
several at once...

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.980
...picking and choosing characteristics...

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.820
Vast Hybrid...

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.780
"Vast Hybrid"

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.120
...Chimera Kraken!

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.540
"Chimera Kraken"

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.500
Hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey!

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.090
I'm enough by myself.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.710
Is this how it is?

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.800
Tabe, wake up! It's time to eat!

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.220
Octopus, yum.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.810
With those teeth and jaws,
he can eat anything in an instant!

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.610
And he's got a stomach that
digests everything he eats in a second!

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.820
Tabe's stomach will never get full.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.320
You two are a great match!

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.830
Eraser took this into consideration
and took him out before he left.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.830
But it's fine. I can move well right now.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.130
I can surpass his movements!

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.420
Yum!

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.470
It went in perfectly!

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.640
Did he just barely react in time?

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.390
However!

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.390
You can't stop my Crystallize with just that!

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:50.060
You're the one that wanted to
fight three-on-one, right, Suneater?

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.480
Did you think you'd get a "complete shutdown"

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.990
--just by waving around
your giant octopus arms?
--Yum, yum, yum!

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.450
I'll Manifest the neurotoxin present
in an octopus's saliva in my arm!

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.990
If you eat it, you won't
be able to move anymore!

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.210
It was too big for me to steal before,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.330
but if it's this small, it's no problem.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.510
Their teamwork flows together...

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:23.050
We're trash, but we have
strong bonds as trash.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.310
Y-You all will be arrested soon...

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.730
Even if you beat me, you have no future!

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.440
What about it?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.570
We haven't had a future for a while.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.320
One was unable to fit into
society and was thrown away.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.990
One was betrayed by his lover
and made to bear various debts.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.160
It's all food.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.120
So is it like you can turn
the things you eat into power?

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.920
One was used as a tool
by someone obsessed with money,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.000
but when it was discovered that the gems
he produced were worthless fakes,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.760
he was called useless and
beaten half to death.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.050
To us, that man said...

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.890
Come join us.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.980
You aren't someone who should
rot away in a place like this.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.610
Who cares about what happens after this?

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.820
For the man who gave us worth...

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.440
...I'll kill anyone who gets in his way.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.740
They're not following him out of fear.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.950
It's almost like they're brainwashed...

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.740
Do you really want
to be used and thrown away?

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.500
A hero can't understand!

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.120
Can you take this with
your back against the wall?!

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.040
My attacks are eaten...

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.460
My defense gets peeled off...

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.970
We're trash, but we have
strong bonds as trash.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.600
Then...

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.350
Ow...!

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.020
...I'll throw off their
teamwork from the start!

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.940
Larceny only works on things he can see.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.980
That's why the police
couldn't point their guns at him.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.610
Die...!

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.490
Crystallize?

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.240
Don't tell me...

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.320
...he ate my crystals?

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.990
That's exactly it!

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.830
Eat!

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.750
Eat! Eat! Eat!

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.590
You had good teamwork
where you trusted each other.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:31.680
I can't understand your circumstances
or anger or sadness...

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.980
But I do understand your strong bonds...

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.940
You're not just using each other...

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.900
Right?

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.070
You can't eat your friends.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.920
"Preview"

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.540
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.630
Kirishima and Fat Gum were split off from us

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.090
and are attacked by the
Hassai Group's Rappa and Tengai.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:32.640
The Hassai Group's overwhelming
offensive and defensive powers

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.470
almost break Kirishima's spirit,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.890
But I believe...

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.850
