00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.480
As November neared its end...

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.730
We're going to take care of her here at U.A.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.650
I didn't think I'd be able to see
her again so soon for so long!

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.280
Hey.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.150
Oh, yay, it's Eri!

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.070
You remind me of my little sister.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.280
Welcome.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.660
Thank you.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.580
How did this come about...?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.670
She couldn't stay at the hospital forever.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.760
It looks like Eri was abandoned by her parents.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.430
And the head of the Shie Hassaikai,
who's related to her by blood,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.180
has been in a coma for a long time,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.180
so she currently has nowhere to go.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.600
And, you might've already heard from Mr. Aizawa,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.810
but the horn that
Eri's Quirk is released from...

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.940
Yes, I heard that it'd gotten
smaller and was fine now...

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.190
It's starting to get bigger again slowly.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.200
Then, in order to keep
that from happening again...?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.910
That's how it is.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.870
So, that's why we're taking care of
her instead of sending her to an orphanage.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.790
We'll watch her in the teachers' dorm.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.670
We'll see how she is and help her find
a way to live with that great power.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.130
There are things we need to check, too...

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.470
Anyway, we'll take things step by step.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.680
That sounds like a lot
of work for you, Mr. Aizawa.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.310
That's where I come in!

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.890
I'm on a temporary absence from school,
and I'm friends with Eri!

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.520
I'm sure you're all busy,
but stop by and visit sometime.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.150
Of course!

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.450
If Eri's body and soul become stable,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.870
then the resurrection of the
invincible man will not be far off.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.030
I hope that's what happens, right?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.580
Sorry to be asking this
of you already, third year,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.080
but can you take care of her for a while?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.250
Roger! Let's play Othello!

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.830
Can we join you?

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.500
Class A, go back to the dorm.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.880
You have guests arriving soon.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.520
Sick? Are you okay?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.140
No, I'm in good health.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.150
My mucus membrane was just doing its job.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.150
What're you talking about?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.690
Maybe someone's talking about you!

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.940
Maybe you've got some fans!

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.650
Like Yaoyorozu at the school festival!

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.200
Will you please not poke fun of it?
I'm very grateful.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.820
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.620
Tokoyami's probably
had fans for a while already.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.080
I mean, you did your work study with Hawks.

"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.580
No, I don't think so.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.040
Everything was too fast there.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.790
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.050

Pussycats!

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.350
Long time no see!

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.740
Sorry I couldn't protect you
to the end back then.

Don't keep digging up the past.

Oh, don't worry about us.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.330
We need to go visit Class B, too.

Thanks for your letter!
I'll treasure it forever!

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.130
Whatever.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.340
Midoriya, look.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.890
He chose them himself.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.520
He said he definitely wanted red.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.390
N-No...!

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.020
We match!

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.980
But why are you back at U.A.?

"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.860
You are?

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.110
Congratulations!

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.240
Ragdoll, you're working again?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.120
I thought your Quirk was stolen,
so you were suspending activities--

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.620
It's not back!

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.000
I'll be doing office work
to support the other three.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.670
Office Lady Cat!

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.500
We received a report from Tartarus, though.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.880
I do feel bad about it, truly.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.300
When I see a good Quirk,
I can't help but want it.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.760
It's a bad habit of mine.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.390
I'd love to return it,
but I'd have to use my Quirk.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.650
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.020
If that's all right with you,
then I can return it right away...

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.110
They're still trying to pin down

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.570
just how many and
what kinds of Quirks he's hiding...

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:54.620
Currently, not letting him do anything
is the only way we can contain him.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.500
Then why are you starting up again at this time?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.880
This will be announced later,
but for the Japanese Hero Billboard Chart,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.170
we were ranked 411
for the second half of the year.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.720
The Japanese Hero Billboard Chart!

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.260
Based on the total from
the number of incidents resolved,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.430
contribution to society,
and citizen approval rating,

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.390
the chart ranks active heroes twice a year!

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:24.150
In other words, the higher the rank,
the more that hero has brought smiles and peace.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.110
Last time, you guys were ranked 32.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.820
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.070
I see! It's because you dropped in the rankings!

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.030
Do your best!

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.990
No, meow!

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.660
How are we still in the three digits
even though we haven't done any hero work?

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.790
The approval rating component gave us a boost.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.040
There are people waiting for us.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.800
We can't just stand still!

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.970
Is that how it is?

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.260
You're so manly, Wild Wild Pussycats!

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.430
You're being too loud.

"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.390
Speaking of which,

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.180
they haven't announced results
for the second half of the year yet, huh?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.020
A lot has happened.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.940
A billboard chart without All Might, huh?

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.900
I can't wait to see how the rankings ended up.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.690
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.700
"Japanese Hero Billboard Chart"

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.280
This is the first billboard chart
since the Kamino incident,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.250
where the Symbol of Peace, All Might,
was driven to an early retirement.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.130
Everyone understands how important this is!

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.460
Until today, heroes did not appear
on stage for the announcement,

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.010
but this time is different!

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.090
Take a look!

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.890
Number ten! Dropping down one
rank from number nine last time,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.640
Dragoon Hero: Ryukyu!

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.980
Honestly, I don't think I deserve it this time.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.940
Number nine! He went down, too!

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.730
But he won't be defeated!

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.110
Equipped Hero: Yoroi Musha!

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.860
Outside of the top three, a ranking like this

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.200
is all erroneous based on the tide of the times.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.870
Number eight! From the "Clean and Shiny"
commercial, Laundry Hero: Wash!

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.540
Wash! Wash-ash-ash!

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.460
Number seven! A huge leap!

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.340
A promising hero whose growth won't stop!

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.000
Kamui Woods!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.420
I'm honored.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.340
"Pro Hero - Mt. Lady - Quirk: Gigantification"

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.470
Kamui Woods is number seven!

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.430
As one of his teammates, it's very encouraging.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.390
What about reports that you two are dating?

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.890
No comment.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.390
Man, I hate this! Why is he the only one there?!

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.940
You ranked pretty high yourself.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.850
"Mt. Lady - 23rd"

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.190
Number six!

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.280
From the orthodox school of manliness,
he reliably keeps his ranking!

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.780
Shield Hero: Crust!

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.030
I wanted to see you
in action more... All Might...!

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.910
Number five! A bunny with a
determined spirit has risen in the rankings!

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.250
Rabbit Hero: Mirko!

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.420
I heard you formed a team? Weakling.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.540
Number four!

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.090
This mysterious ninja's had a huge jump
in cases resolved and approval rating!

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.630
Ninja Hero: Edgeshot!

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.340
Be quiet, we're in public.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.640
This time, those heroes involved
with the Kamino incident

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.060
have all seen their approval ratings go up.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.020
Which brings us to this man...

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.690
Even though he's currently on hiatus,
he's still number three!

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.860
With the number one
approval rating for this round,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.150
Fiber Hero: Best Jeanist!

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.070
We're all waiting for him
to return as soon as possible!

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.280
Number two! He does things
his own way, but he's fierce!

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.490
With great momentum,
he's reached the number two spot!

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.830
Wing Hero: Hawks!

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.620
That's an exaggeration.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.120
And...!

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.630
He's been the temporary number one, but today...

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.670
...he's really, truly in the number one spot.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.920
He's waited a long time!

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.550
Flame Hero: Endeavor!

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.180
We chose to put on this kind of event this time

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.480
because we saw that
this was a critical juncture.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.770
It's been about three months
since All Might's retirement.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.240
There are still rumors that we are lacking an icon,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.610
but the heroes who will
bear the future are right here.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.570
--Let us work toward a peaceful society with them.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.700
--How does it feel to be number one?
--Let us work toward a peaceful society with them.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.790
And now, let's have a comment from each person!

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.670
Thank you very much.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.670
But if I could have refused, I would have.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.800
There were lives that I should have
been able to save but didn't.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.890
I will strive to become a
hero worthy of the rank I received.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.470
"Pro Hero - Fat Gum - Quirk: Fat Adsorption"
"Pro Hero - Rock Lock - Quirk: Lockdown"

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.390
Ryukyu...

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.770
I get you, Ryukyu!

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.560
The anguish in your heart!
The remorse! We must stand tall!

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.650
You can do it, Ryukyu! Let's do our best!

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.110
Crust, it's not your turn.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.110
He's too worked up.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.150
That's what I like about him!

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.030
What we must do now is no different.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.070
Wash!

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.870
I would like to work in a way that does not
shame those who have come before me,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.910
starting with Edgeshot,
who accepted me on his team.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.790
Oh, why was I not at Kamino on that day?!

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.170
For those of you planning evil deeds right now--

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.380
prepare to be sent flying by me!

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.510
You were third in the approval ratings.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.630
I am not concerned with numbers.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.300
I am grateful for all
the support I have received,

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.060
but I am not doing this for the fame.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.230
I believe my job is to bring about peace.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.900
Who's gonna be happy listening to that?

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.520
Stain?

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.280
"Silence"

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.280
I like you! You're cheeky!

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.200
As always, you like to rock the boat.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.280
I'm just bad at controlling myself.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.120
Let's see...

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.500
If we're just talking approval ratings...

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.420
Best Jeanist is number one with
the boost he got from being on hiatus.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.460
Second is me, third is Edgeshot,

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.590
and fourth is Endeavor. I'll skip the rest.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.350
I think approval rating is the most
important number right now, though.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.060
Is this really the time
to be dragging out the past?

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.020
You don't think we need
to change how we do things?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.020
The Symbol is gone.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.440
At this "critical juncture,"

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.820
why are those less accomplished
than me playing it safe?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.030
Say something that sounds more hero-like.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.370
I thought I saw him scowling, and now this...

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.750
Seriously, I can't tell what he's thinkin'.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.710
Hawks, age 22.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.040
He made it to the top three in the last ranking.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.880
He started his own agency at 18,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.760
and by the second half of that year,
he was already in the top ten.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.390
He was the first in history to
make it to the top ten before age 20!

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.010
The fastest and the youngest!

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.350
People say that he's "too fast."

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.100
I don't know if this is just
doing things his own way, or what...

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.230
It's arrogance.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.100
That's all from me.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.900
Now, go ahead, number one hero
with a lower approval rating than me.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.830
A lot of people can understand
what Hawks just said.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.830
This'll be hard for Endeavor to follow.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.380
Former number one hero...

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.170
What is the Symbol of Peace?

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.300
After that young person has fanned the flames,

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.760
I won't say much.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.560
Just watch me.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.990
"Tsuyu Asui"
"Quirk: Frog"
"She can do pretty much everything a frog can, like stretch out her tongue really far."

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.990
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 2/12"
"Height: 150 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Jello"

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.990
"Eijiro Kirishima"
"Quirk: Hardening"
"He can harden his whole body, which can be used for offense or defense."

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.990
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 10/16"
"Height: 170 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Meat"

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.500
"Endeavor"

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.620
Sorry for the trouble I caused.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.870
What were you thinking, boy?!

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.040
Everyone was just saying normal boring stuff,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.420
and I thought there needed
to be more of an impact.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.130
You were testing me, weren't you?

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.220
Of course not!

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.880
In fact, I was helping you!

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.390
It was good, wasn't it?

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.850
I'm not an All Might fan or anything,

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.430
and I've never wanted to become like him.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.600
Even so, his retirement came as a shock.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.770
I'm not saying to be as iconic as him.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.950
But I think we definitely
need a new leader right now.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.740
I'm relieved. You were cool.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.330
Is this what he really thinks,
or is he mocking me?

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.790
You never thought to be the new leader yourself?

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.340
Do I look like someone who'd do that?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.710
I wanna have more
freedom down in the lower ranks.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.130
Around 20th or 30th place.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.930
I hate people like you the most.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.680
This conversation is over.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.430
Go apologize to the others.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.680
Oh, actually, I wanted to talk to you.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.480
I won't hear it! Go away!

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.560
I'd like to team up with you.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.230
In my hometown, there have been
some troubling eyewitness reports.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.480
Do you remember the Nomus?

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.740
"Villain - Dabi"

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.700
The ones before didn't really understand...

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.370
...but I've got high hopes for you, High-End.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.670
"Kyushu District"

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.040
I'll crush it.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.460
I worked at this company for three years.
I'll crush it right now.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.840
Ever since I can remember,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.930
I've always tried to be considerate
of other people's feelings.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.140
It was suffocating...

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.980
"Unprecedented reprinting!!"
"Destro's Life Story"

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.980
"Metahuman Liberation Warfront"

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.310
But I'll say goodbye to that me today.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.400
I'd screamed, "Damn company!" so much...

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.190
Liberate me... Liberate me...

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.400
Hooray for metahuman liberation!

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:34.030
"Teruo Hazukashi - Quirk: Shame"

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.320
Teruo Hazukashi, age 31.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.860
Quirk: Shame.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.240
The more embarrassed he is,
the stronger he gets.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.950
Metahuman... libera--

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.910
Why...?

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.250
--Whoa, what's up with this guy?
He's flashing everyone.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.620
--Endeavor, what kind of food do you like?
--Whoa, what's up with this guy?
He's flashing everyone.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.170
--Endeavor, what kind of food do you like?
--I can't believe he
did that in this cold.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.330
--The hot pot from that place is really good.
--I can't believe he
did that in this cold.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.750
--The hot pot from that place is really good.
--These feathers are...

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.210
You can really taste the flavor of the chicken.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.590
Is that heavy? You hungry?

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.050
No, Schwartz!

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.560
--The yakitori's good, too.
--Oh, Schwartz, I'm so glad you're okay!

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.640
Yoritomi's liver skewers are addicting.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.600
It's Hawks!

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.940
He doesn't usually just walk around like this!

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.270
Hello!

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.900
Whoops.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.570
Granny, I'll carry it to the top for you.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.280
Thanks.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.200
Hawks, congrats on ranking second!

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.610
I saw that yesterday!

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.660
If you don't act more humble,
you'll just get more enemies!

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.660
Enemies, huh?

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.280
Hawks, Hawks!

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.040
Yay.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.620
Excuse me, my son is a big fan.
Can he have your autograph?

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.500
Oh, what a fancy bag!

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.540
You sure I can write on it?

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.630
Of course!

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.540
What's your name?

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.250
Ryosuke!

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.840
Okay, Ryosuke. Thanks for all your support!

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.470
Thanks, Hawks!

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.720
Thank you very much!

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.760
It's Endeavor...

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.180
His face is so scary...

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.140
His presence... the pressure's so strong.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.100
Go get his autograph!

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.100
No way.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.730
Didn't you say you liked him?

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.810
I do, but it's not like that!

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.610
Oh, he's coming! He's coming this way!

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.320
Huh?! What, no way! Oh man, oh man!
His new costume's so cool!

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.160
You don't have to hold back.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.240
This isn't right.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.160
Huh? It isn't?

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.080
Endeavor doesn't do fan service.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.620
Being hard to get is what makes him cool...!

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.250
Oh, you're hardcore, huh?

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.920
Oh, no! You've changed! You've changed!

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.760
It wasn't right?

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.050
I was able to do it naturally
with that kid from Shiketsu, though...

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.470
"Yoritomi Midori"
"Yakitori"

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.600
Of course he'd say that.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.310
It's not like you.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.140
Oh, if you aren't gonna
have anymore, can I have it?

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.020
What a glutton. Eat what you want!

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.440
I just have no self-control
when it comes to the things I want.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.820
After the school festival, too,
I scouted your son.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:42.080
I mean, having the son of the
number two hero would look good, right?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.620
But well, I'm glad I got Tsukuyomi now,

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.380
since Shoto failed the provisional exam
and left a mark on his brand.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.090
You know a lot for someone who didn't go to U.A.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.720
I'm well-informed.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.840
Stop messing around!

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.140
I didn't come all the way
to Kyushu to talk about this!

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.520
Hurry up and get to the point.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.810
About the rumors?

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.730
Remodeled Nomu...

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.940
"Remodeled Nomu"

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.190
Those grotesque puppets
the League of Villains has...

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:19.410
A few dozen stored in Kamino
were captured along with All For One,

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:25.620
and since then, the League has been busy,
but no more Nomu have appeared.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.330
Either that was all of them,

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:33.210
or old A.F.O. was the only one
who knew where the rest were.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.840
Bastard, since you asked me to team up with you,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.510
that means you have
some definitive proof, right?

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.680
No, I don't.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.300
They're seriously just rumors.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.520
Bring the check! I'm going home!

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.020
Come on, wait a minute. Please listen.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.310
This is not the only place
where Nomus have been sighted.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.270
You don't know, do you?

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.360
They've been reported across the country.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.280
Not so much that they've been
gathered into a news article...

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.660
...but among housewives while they gossip,

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.910
or between elementary and middle
school kids as they walk home from school.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.830
What do you mean?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.130
I heard about it first on
a business trip from the locals.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.170
At the time, I worked with
the police and investigated quietly

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.470
to not raise unnecessary panic,
but I got nothing.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.850
So, it made me curious,

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.520
and I flew around the country
investigating on my own.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.730
Investigating...?

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.060
There were some differences,

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:35.070
but similar rumors were popping up in
places that were completely unconnected.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.940
In the end, they were all just rumors, though...

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.990
Now, this is just an unsubstantiated opinion,

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.780
but after U.A., Hosu, and Kamino,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.710
everyone knows how creepy
these remodeled villains are, right?

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.460
So I think some idiot is telling
scary stories to stir up the uneasiness,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.300
and they spread across the country.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.840
That villain earlier shouted,
"Hooray for metahuman liberation!" right?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:09.020
That's similar, too, where an
old villain's biography was republished

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:10.980
"Unprecedented reprinting!!"
"Destro's Life Story"

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:10.980
"Metahuman Liberation Warfront"

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.440
and has been selling pretty well.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.480
He was probably influenced by it.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.070
Those kinds of books sell more
when society's uneasy, like they thrive.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.780
Don't put on airs.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.990
Just what is it you want?

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.830
Get to the point!

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.660
I want you to become a dependable
leader now that you're number one.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.750
I want you to verify
the veracity of those rumors

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.500
and tell everyone proudly to stop worrying.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.550
I'm not gonna do anything special.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.390
I said the same thing yesterday, but basically,

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.760
I'm being the producer
behind the number one hero.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.640
Bastard.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.270
I just want to take it easy. Really.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.520
Just go around on leisurely patrols,

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.060
complain that nothing happened today,
and then go to bed.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.020
The best life!

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.820
I want to make it a world where heroes
have too much time on their hands.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.990
Endeavor.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.620
Here are your drinks--

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.910
Get back, Miss!

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.960
Who's the strongest?

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.010
Hawks, evacuate everyone!

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.550
Roger! What about you?

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.720
They weren't just rumors, huh?

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.260
Must be my lucky day.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.680
Oh, well. Either way, this is what I came for.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.520
Flashfire Fist!

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.770
Jetburn!

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.610
Come.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.490
I'll show you who I am.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.040
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.800
A Nomu from the League of Villains
has attacked Endeavor and Hawks.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.720
Do they have a chance at winning

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.220
against an opponent with
regenerative abilities and multiple Quirks?

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.970
As the nation holds its breath while it watches,

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:43.400
Endeavor, the newly-minted number one,
burns with seriousness and resolve.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.770
Next time, "His Start."

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.820
Go beyond!

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.580
"Next time: His Start"

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.740
Plus Ultra!
