WEBVTT

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.230
The octopus poison
should be in your bodies now.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.360
You won't die, but you probably
won't be able to walk very well for a while.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.240
Also, I took off your masks.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.410
I don't know what's built into them.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.700
"Tamaki Amajiki - Quirk: Manifest"

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.040
That took too long.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.040
Was everyone else able
to keep moving forward?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.540
I need...

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.920
...to go, too...

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.630
Huh...?

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.340
My face...

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.300
At this point...

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.190
Amajiki... I wonder if he's all right...

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.440
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.990
I can't help but worry about him...

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.320
Yeah...

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.660
"Pro Hero - Fat Gum - Quirk: Fat Adsorption"

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.820
His underclassmen
don't believe in him at all...

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.030
Well, even if he says he's okay,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.370
he hasn't shown much to support that,
so it can't be helped.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.410
But! Once you've left him
to guard your back,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.040
you'll trust him to do it if you're a man!

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.880
I'm sure he'll be fine!

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.790
That just makes you seem
like someone who's easily swayed.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.960
I'm worried, but all I can do is trust him!

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.470
We can't waste a second
of the time Suneater got for us!

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.590
All right!

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.970
"Pro Hero - Rock Lock"

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.350
He's too into this.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.970
"Pro Hero - Eraser Head - Quirk: Erasure"

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.510
This is strange.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.060
It's weird that the guy who was moving
the basement hasn't shown any movement...

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.850
Now that you mention it,
nothing's twisting or turning.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.650
If he isn't putting any obstacles
in our way while we're running...

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.650
...then our opponent might not be able
to observe and control the whole basement.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.950
There's the police squad that remained above, too.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.290
Maybe he's focusing his attention on them.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.200
Are you saying that he's limited
in the area he can keep tabs on?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.830
It's just a prediction.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.080
He went into the basement to control it.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.880
If it's not that he has
been assimilated into it,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.800
but that he's moving around inside
the walls to see and hear what's going on,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.840
then when he's manipulating the basement,
it's possible that his body is also close.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.800
"Villain - Joi Irinaka - Quirk: Mimicry"

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.720
I can't believe they only stopped one of them!

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.850
Even if they're trash,
all three of them are strong.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.020
If an eye or ear from his main body
is peeking through to try and block us...

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.520
I see...

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.320
Then I can see him.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.360
It's him!

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.110
I can't believe you all
came out to try and stop us.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.160
It's hard to believe you're sane.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.700
We're sane.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.700
"Pro Hero - Bubble Girl"

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.700
Everyone going out
to fight right now is sane.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.580
If we didn't do anything,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.130
then Overhaul would take our lives.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.960
Over... You're talking about Chisaki, right?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.050
Yeah, it's the name he started
using after the boss took ill,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.970
and he started holding real power.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:12.690
"Shie Hassaikai"

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.510
The boss valued the old ways of chivalry

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.350
and looked for a way for
yakuza to survive in these times.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.350
Unlike villains, the Hassaikai
must act with chivalry.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.360
He resented being called
a designated villain group.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.320
The one we all loved was the boss.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.240
Calling himself by a villain-like name...

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.910
Bringing in villains...

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.490
Making decisions on his own that
go against the will of the members...

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.750
That guy's been doing whatever he wants.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.290
The boss becoming unable
to say anything is also definitely--

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.460
Hey.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.250
Even though you hate him,
you don't seem to think he'll be caught.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.510
Yeah...

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.640
Listen, the ones who don't think about
the future are the ones who aren't sane.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.970
People like that...

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.180
...are incredibly strong.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.600
Eraser!

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.520
His target is me, after all, huh?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.730
He doesn't want to be seen...

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.280
If those three can't do it,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.650
then I'll take them out for sure one by one!

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.900
Fat!

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.450
If we let this guy do what he wants,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.780
then the time Tamaki
got for us'll be wasted.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.250
Eraser, Erase this guy!

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.620
Sorry, thanks!

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.710
Why are you here?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.930
I also jumped out to protect Mr. Aizawa...

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.430
I thought that I wouldn't
take any damage. But then...

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.180
...I sank into you...

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.940
I guess it can't be helped.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.100
More importantly, brace yourself.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.490
That fist...

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.280
Don't blame me if it's smashed to pieces!

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.010
Red...

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.140
M... My arm...!

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.770
You know what I think?

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.900
It's boorish to use guns or blades in a fight.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.860
Anyone who has those can win.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.980
That's not a real fight.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.320
It's better to kill each other
using just the power living inside you.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.860
I wonder if you understand.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.120
"Red Riot"

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.290
What do you think you're doin'?!

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.000
Huh? A barrier? What is this?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.840
Fat Gum, and a boy who can harden his body.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.680
Hm. They both have Quirks
that are good at defense.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.260
Too bad, Rappa.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.940
For this much shock
to get through even my fat...

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.900
It's like a bullet...

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.360
"Good at defense"?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.190
They didn't get away unscathed.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.610
Well, I guess it's good enough
that they didn't turn into mincemeat.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.660
These two weren't on the Quirk list we got...

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.410
Are they outside guys?

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.910
A rush attack of bullets and a barrier?

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.870
This'll be an annoying pair to fight.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.920
We are a spear and a shield.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.250
In contrast, you two
are a shield and a shield.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.420
Huh? Wait, what kind of fight is that?

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.340
Oh, well...

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.640
Although, I do not know if that boy
over there could even be called a shield.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.930
My arm cracked...

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.230
Ouch! I couldn't take all of it.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.480
If another barrage like that comes,
I won't be able to take it...

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.400
I thought I'd gotten stronger...!

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.240
Damn it...!

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.950
Again, I'm...

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.200
Don't let go of your Unbreakable!

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.530
If even your spirit breaks,
then you really have lost!

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.870
When fightin' villains,

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.870
it's a matter of how fast you can
make them lose their will to fight.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.960
You can't lose your will before them!

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.630
Let's blow these small fry away quickly

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.840
and go back to the others!

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.630
They're planning to beat us.
Isn't that great, Rappa?

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.340
You understand? What a great fat guy!

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.640
Tengai, I'm starting to have fun.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.470
Get rid of this. Don't use it.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.690
It's not like I need
a Barrier in the first place.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.520
Don't wallow in your own desires.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.560
Don't forget what Master Overhaul said.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.020
This is an excellent matchup.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.780
We will win for certain with our teamwork.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.540
What are you planning to do, fighting maniac?

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.500
Overjerk decided we were a team without asking.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.080
It's not "Overjerk," it's "Master Overhaul."

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.500
I don't care! As long as I can
fight to the death, I don't care.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.090
Then do what you want, if you think
you can take care of them by yourself.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.970
You understand?

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.800
What a great recluse!

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.020
If I close the distance between us,
it'll be impossible to dodge.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.770
On top of that, it's such a strong shock
that even with my Adsorption, I get hurt.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.650
At this rate, he'll just eat away
at me slowly until I'm done.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.860
They were fightin' earlier,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.360
but I'm sure that if he's in danger,
the other guy'll put up a barrier.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.240
When I punched that,
it felt like an iron wall.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.120
It's so strong that I won't be able
to do anythin' about it with my power.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.460
If I don't do anythin'
about that guy, we can't win!

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.290
And despite what I said,
Kirishima took a lot of damage...

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.790
I guess I have no choice but to do it.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.220
If I don't do it right, I'll die,
but if I don't, I'll just die for sure!

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.510
Fat...

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.390
He called you Rappa, right?

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.970
It's been a while since any
attack's had an effect on me.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.520
I was a hardcore martial arts
guy back in the day, too.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.600
Let's see if you'll stop
being able to raise your arm first,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.810
or if I'll stop being able
to take your hits first--

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.190
Spear and shield--

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.360
Let's have a match to see
which is stronger, Rappa!

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.030
You really are a great fat guy!

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.660
Tengai, what about your Barrier?

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.490
I won't put it up.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.370
Yeah! You guys are all great guys!

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.790
Fat...

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.370
Protecting me...

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.000
Even though he isn't able to
completely withstand the attack...

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.460
What am I doing?

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.550
Feeling like I'd gotten stronger!

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.300
Jumping out with my ultimate move
and having it ripped through so easily!

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.060
Ending up just getting in the way!

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.560
Oh man, this hurts!

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.520
He's getting faster and faster!

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.520
Maybe I won't make it in time?!

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.570
Don't disappoint me, fat guy!

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.070
Don't pass out on me yet!

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.120
My shoulder's finally warmed up!

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.660
What... can I do?

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.960
What can I do right now?!

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.920
Fat Gum's gonna die!

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.710
Because of me!

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.840
Don't you have anything, boring bastard?!

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.880
Don't you have anything left after
they break through your Hardening?!

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.930
Can't you do anything?

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.930
That boy... is already done for.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.810
His eyes are filled with fear.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.980
Nothing's changed... since back then...

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.940
Nothing...

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.030
"Mustafa Private Middle School"

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.200
Hey, I heard...

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.120
...that you have a Quirk that
can change leaves into money.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.580
That's a great Quirk.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.580
Make these leaves into 10,000 yen bills.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.330
We're short on cash this month.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.910
Paper bills aren't allowed!

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.830
Besides, they turn back to leaves right away!

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.340
No one will know if we use them
before they change back, right?

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.090
No... I told you I wouldn't do it...!

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.420
Hey, you trying to scare the underclassman
to make some chump change?

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.970
It's not manly, you know!

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:42.890
Who's that?

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.050
The third year, Kirishima.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.010
Here he comes!

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.560
Don't worry.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.310
He's not that strong.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.230
His Quirk just makes him a little harder.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.770
Bastard!

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.690
Let's go.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.230
Hey, wait a minute!

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.070
Forget it, Ei.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.570
You were watching?!

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.360
You're sticking your neck out
for something annoying again.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.700
It doesn't matter what your Quirk
is if you've got a chivalrous heart!

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.160
That's what the Chivalrous Hero:
Crimson Riot would say!

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.580
We keep telling you, that's too old.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.960
Pros say that your body moves
before you can think!

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.500
In other words...

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.430
It's Mina Ashido, from Class 4.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.300
What're they saying?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.680
Doesn't it look like they've become friends?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.220
They've started break dancing.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.310
They left!

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.190
Peacefully!

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.520
What just happened...?

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.020
Mina, there you are!

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.110
Hey, do you wanna go to that store today?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.440
Yeah!

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.610
I heard Ashido's applying for U.A.

"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.620
She's got great reflexes
and gets along well with people.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.240
Her Quirk's strong,
and she looks super flashy.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.080
How heroes are supposed
to be have changed these days.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.290
They consider things like
entertainment and approval ratings.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:00.130
Ashido's really trendy.
That's why she's cut out to be a hero.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.510
Compared to that...

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.970
My Quirk is Hardening. And it's just a little.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.550
Honestly, I'm boring.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.640
If you have chivalry in your heart,
it doesn't matter what your Quirk is.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.430
You just need to train
your body as hard as you can

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.270
to cover for your Quirk with your spirit.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.230
That's what I thought, but...

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.690
What should we do for high school?

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.900
Maybe I'll apply to the famous U.A., too!

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.570
Idiot. Becoming a hero is impossible
from the start for us normal people.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.700
What about you, Ei?

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.910
Wanna apply to Droid Tech together?

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.580
Oh, right...

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.460
I haven't really decided yet...

"Future Course Survey Form"

Honestly, it's lame,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.920
but seeing someone
like Ashido makes me think,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.130
if only I had a flashier Quirk...

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.510
Would I be able to say
I'm applying for the hero course--

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.720
for U.A.--with confidence?

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.940
What... is that...?

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.730
Where's the Springer Hero Agency?

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.910
You're not going to tell me?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.750
Crap, why aren't there ever any
heroes patrolling at times like these?

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.910
Someone... no...

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.040
You go...!

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.170
Why won't you tell me...?

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.880
Go...!

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.880
I said, go!

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.470
Turn that corner and then
make a left at the big street!

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.430
The agency's about
two kilometers down that street!

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.560
Thanks.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.440
Everything is for my master.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.080
Ahhh, that was so scary!

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.910
Mina, thank you...!

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.370
If you hadn't come,
I'm sure he would've killed us!

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:03.590
I lied and sent him to the police,
so let's hurry up and run away!

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.960
Why... didn't I go...?

In the spring,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.320
a middle schooler the same age as me
became famous for resisting a powerful villain.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.030
That was the part everyone talked about,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.780
but according to witnesses,

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.780
right before All Might appeared,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.580
a middle schooler who looked
like his friend rushed out.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.710
I'm not covering for anything with my spirit.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.540

Facing a life or death situation and
being able to take a step on top of that

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.890
is what makes someone hero material.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.190
I'm not even a man, let alone a hero...

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.400
According to my mom,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.270
the first time my Quirk appeared,

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.820
I accidentally cut my eye.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.820
Apparently, for a while after that,
I sobbed that I hated my Quirk.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.030
It's not that big of a deal,

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:21.040
but thinking about it now, I probably
admired him because I hated my own Quirk.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:24.040
"As long as you have chivalry in your heart,
anyone can be a hero!"

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.500
He had a similar Quirk
and proudly risked his life as a hero.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.510

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.770
Well then, let's start the questions.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.600
Right, hit me!

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.400
Even compared to other heroes,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.360
you give the impression
of rushing headlong into things.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.030
Do you ever feel fear about
throwing yourself into danger?

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.530
Just what do you think I am?!

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.040
Of course I do!

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.330
Anyone who isn't afraid of almost
certain death is just a huge idiot!

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.460
I didn't really get it when
I was in elementary school,

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.300
and his words didn't sink in.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.720
I just thought he was cool for
charging full force into everything.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.850
When I was a sidekick, there was a
time I didn't save someone I could've.

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.100
I know. It can't be helped.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.350

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.270
That's not what I'm talking about!

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.650
I hesitated for a second.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.190
Because my spirit was weak,
I couldn't save someone.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.240
I'm scared of villains and of dying!

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.120
But I know something even scarier.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.540
The last expression of someone dying,
and the pain of being unable to save them.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.460
I know of those things,
so that's why I can jump in.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.960
What does chivalry mean to you?

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.380
It's the state of my heart!

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.470
It's not about having
confidence or not knowing fear.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.220
I'm a hero, and that's why I protect people!

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.430
Once I've decided that in my heart,
then it's something I'd die for.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.680
Just living a life with no regrets--

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.730

trying to look cool for high school!

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.610
Thanks.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.740
I've been through a lot
of scary things up until now.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.330
But even more than that,
I've always been scared...

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.330
You're kidding, right?
You can still keep going, can't you?!

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:57.250
I bet you thought I was a shield,
but that'll be fatal for you.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:01.880
All the attacks you gave me have
been adsorbed and sunken into my body!

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.850
Because I'm usin' so much energy
to sink and suppress them,

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.270
I'm burnin' up so much fat from my shield!

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.310
My defense is gettin' thinner and thinner,
but the stored-up attacks...

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:16.070
...will become a spear that
can punch through any shield!

Rappa! He's up to something!

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.690
Hurry up and finish him!

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.240
That's how it is, but my shield's
been cut down more than I expected...

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.990
I can't make something equal
to what I've stored up...!

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.290
I wanna see it!

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.290

I won't regret anything again!

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.300
I...

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.260
...will become...

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.550
...a hero who can protect!

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.470
He was blown away easily earlier...!

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.060
If it cracks, then harden it again!

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.350
Bear it! Protect!

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.690
Sacrifice yourself!

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.730
You're pretty great, too!

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.190
What about the Barrier?

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.200
Of course I'm putting it up!

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.200
Things done in vain...

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.700
...should just fall in front of my defense.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.410
It wasn't in vain!

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.870
Thanks much!

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.670
I've become a great spear!

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.500
Tengai! Take down your Barrier!

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.750
There's one reason for your defeat!

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.300
You guys underestimated--

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.670
My greatest, hardest defense...!

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.880
It's no use! It's gonna break!

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.050
You guys, and I, as well--

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.720
underestimated the hero named Red Riot...

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.770
...and his chivalrous spirit!

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.820
In this spear-and-shield battle,

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.200
we're the winners.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.750
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.380
We've been moving forward to save Eri,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.380
but the Hassai Group's Irinaka made an
underground maze to block our way.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.510
Uraraka and the others! Kirishima!

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.520
And Amajiki! The path
they've woven together for us--

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.560
I can't let it stop here!

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.060
Next time, "Temp Squad."

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.900
No... Why are these guys here?!

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.400
Go beyond!

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.580
"Next time: Temp Squad"

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.580
Plus Ultra!
