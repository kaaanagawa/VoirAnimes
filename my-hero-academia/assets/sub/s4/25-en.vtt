00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.350
"Fujiya Hospital"

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.850
I'll leave a change of clothes and
something to keep you warm over here.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.900
Thanks, as always.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.190
It looks like it'll get
chilly starting next week.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.110
I'm glad.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.860
I like the cold.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.110
Yeah, we don't like to be too hot, huh?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820
Natsu, you look well.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.830
Ever since going to college,
he never comes home.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.700
Says he met a girl at a seminar.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.500
Sis! I do stay in touch, don't I?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.580
M-Mom, you look good, too!

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.630
Your complexion! Your complexion looks good!

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.750
Did something good happen?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.800
"Shoto"

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.340
Shoto's been writing me letters.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.800
He said the supplementary training
for the provisional license is tough,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.220
but he's working hard
to catch up to his friends.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.850
Huh. Shoto corresponds frequently.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.640
Between living at the dorms
and his supplementary training,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.270
he hasn't been able to come
around as much as before.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.480
Don't you think it'd be okay
for you to have a cell phone now?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.400
Writing letters is tough, isn't it?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.780
You're right. I wonder
what the doctors will say...

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.200
Can I see the letters?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.240
Sure. Don't tell Shoto, though.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.160
Mom.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.410
He officially became number one yesterday.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.870
Natsu.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.170
The world doesn't know what
he did to you and our siblings--

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.210
how he's treated his family.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.340
He doesn't go on talk shows or anything either.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.510
Hey, don't talk about Dad--

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.930
It's fine, Fuyumi.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.100
I don't really have many memories of him,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.560
and he's basically like a stranger to me,
so I don't care what happens to him.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.320
But I can't allow him to act like
nothing he did to you guys ever happened.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.360
It's already been about ten years.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.070
He hasn't even come to apologize to you, right?

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.080
He wants to leave the past
and his blood ties behind.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.200
That's not true.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.250
Why do you protect him, Mom?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.250
Those flowers...

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.960
I told him that I liked them.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.130
Around when we first met, just one time.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.760
Dad's been here?!

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.390
He's come many times, apparently.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.680
I haven't seen him.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.600
I'm still afraid...

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.400
And the doctors also say that's not a good idea.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.980
I don't know what he's thinking deep inside.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.320
There might be an external reason for it.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.660
But, he's not leaving them behind.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.910
He's definitely trying
to face his past and his family.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.760
Endeavor, you can fly?!

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.890
"Pro Hero - Endeavor - Quirk: Hellflame"

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.260
I'm just not falling!

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.470
Stay sharp!

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.560
This thing can still move.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:23.280
Y-You didn't think you...
c-could kill me... w-with this f-fire...

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.660
Regeneration...

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.120
The one at Hosu could do that, too.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.040
A power I didn't see with the white ones...

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.790
Does that mean the black ones are special?

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.340
If that's the case, then this
one's special even among them.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.130
Because... it can talk!

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.510
...did you?

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.350
In that case!

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.720
I'll take it alive to get information!

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.060
Flashfire Fist...

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.060
...Hell Spider!

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.630
Right after being charred...

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.010
Hey, hey... Come on,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.810
"Pro Hero - Hawks"

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.770
Number One...!

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.450
It overcame my propulsion.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.700
It's above me in both speed and power?!

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.620
Are you kidding me?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.290
It's falling!

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.460
Sense them, Fierce Wings.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.880
Screams, breaths, clothes rustling,
the vibrations people produce...

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.560
I can't get everyone in the building out.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.560
I don't have enough feathers...

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.890
I have to limit myself to
the people in the damaged part!

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.820
"Hawks - Quirk: Fierce Wings"

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.020
Hawks. Quirk: Fierce Wings!

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.320
He has tough yet supple feathers!

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.160
He can control each one as he wishes!

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.330
Seventy-six people in the damaged part...

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.120
...all evacuated safely!

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.880
Flashfire Fist...

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.300
...Hell Spider!

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.560
Is that the best you've got?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.100
Of course not!

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.480
I'll cut it into bits and burn them off!

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.950
You've never cooked before, have you, Endeavor?!

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.570
Your "bits" are chopped too roughly!

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.580
You need to cut them into even pieces.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.450
You should stop talking and
save your strength for moving.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.790
Well, when I lose too many feathers,
it makes it harder to fly.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.420
Sorry about that.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.340
Bird...

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.260
Endeavor! Hawks!

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.800
We'll back you up!

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.300
Y-You're in the way!

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.520
It split itself?!

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.980
The colors are different...

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.440
Were they stored inside its body?

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.900
I'm starting to overheat...

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.530
Who strongest?

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.950
If we take those words at face value,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.580
then its goal is to fight against the strong.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.670
A very villain-like train of thought.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.590
So in order to continue its fight with me,
it's splitting off my backup, huh?

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.590
This Nomu... is thinking.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.510
Get away!

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.890
Hawks!

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.980
Okay, get back until
you can't see what's going on.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.780
To be frank, I'm pretty
helpless against power types.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.530
My back won't be enough to let you feel safe.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.620
You... a-aren't firing... anymore?

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.460
Th-Th-The heat rays.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.250
Or you can't fire?

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.380
If that's the case...

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.050
You're perceptive, too, huh?

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.550
Flashfire Fist compresses and
contains flames under super-hot temperatures

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.390
and releases them in
a single-blow ultimate move.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.640
If I use it recklessly,
my body temperature rises,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.940
and my bodily functions deteriorate.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.900
But, on top of having
less speed and power than it,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:14.240
I also don't know how many Quirks it has,
so not using it would be fatal!

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.160
My body continues to fill with heat.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.120
That was the reason...

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.370
That was the reason...

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.540
That was the reason...

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.800
Oh, just now! Can you see it?

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.390
Endeavor! He's so bright, even at this distance!

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.680
He's discharging intense flames!

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:53.730
Let me t-try out my power...
m-my new strength on you!

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.820
Burn up in a purgatory where
you can't run or regenerate fast enough

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.990
and be quelled!

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.870
Prominence Burn!

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.210
Just watch me.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.130
I can't look pathetic...

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.170
...right now!

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.100
Too bad.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.770
Endeavor!

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.440
It tore off its head and threw it?!

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.170
Endeavor...!

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:03.890
Boring. A-Aren't there
any stronger heroes around?

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.430
I'll become a hero that you can be proud of.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.360
Proud that your father is the number one hero...

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.820
...the most powerful man.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.990
"Hawks"
"Quirk: Fierce Wings"
"He can manipulate the feathers on his back at will. He can also shoot or transform them."

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.990
"Affiliation: Pro Hero"
"Birthday: 12/28"
"Height: 172 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Yakitori"

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.990
"Endeavor"
"Quirk: Hellflame"
"He can produce high-temperature flames with his body."

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.990
"Affiliation: Pro Hero"
"Birthday: 8/8"
"Height: 195 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: Kudzu Mochi"

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.460
The villain that appeared suddenly
is trampling the city all by itself!

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.750
I can't confirm this,

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.590
but it seems that many bioengineered
human Nomus have also appeared.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.840
Currently, the heroes are fighting them
and evacuating people.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.680
However,

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.720
Endeavor, who was the first
to respond, has been wounded...

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.640
This scene...

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.480
I can't help but remember the
nightmare at Kamino three months ago...

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.320
Too slow.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:17.000
More... m-more... power...

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.260
What is that guy doing?

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.640
If you can't win, then wait for reinforcements!

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.260
You're the one who knows best

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.680
that you can't be like All Might, right?

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.940
That's why you gave up so early and went crazy.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.900
Neglecting your kids,

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.780
running down Mom until she got sick...

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.530
Give up and run away...

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.080
Natsu...

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.870
Some things,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.290
you know but can't accept, right?

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.960
He never gave up.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.670
No one is more stubborn than he is.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.550
It's all right!

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.760
Calm down!

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.140
Please, don't push!

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.430
Everything's fine!

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.390
Please, give me a ride!

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.350
Stop pushing!

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.890
Move!

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.730
Humans... over there...

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.620
Mommy...!

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.580
There's no Symbol...

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.080
This is what it means to have no Symbol...

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.960
You've got to be kidding me...

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.920
Everyone's panicking! This is bad.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.510
Todoroki... You already saw it?

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.760
Mr. Aizawa!

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.390
Don't just say whatever you want!

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.720
What are you looking at
to come up with that, TV?!

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.680
Stop that! It's not the time for it.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.190
Look at that!

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.230
The flames are still burning, see?

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.860
You can see that, can't you?

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.030
Endeavor's still alive and fighting!

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.240
Stop letting something
that isn't there get you down!

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.450
You're taking this too seriously! Stop it!

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.240
Let's hurry up and get out of here!

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.700
Right now, who's the man...

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.500
...risking his life for our sakes?

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.500
Look!

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:25.710
Can you also... also regenerate?

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.680
Don't lump me with you.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.930
I haven't been able to move my body for a while.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.730
Propel your body onward with heat!

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.230
I'm grateful!

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.690
I can stay conscious thanks to the pain.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.320
Don't let yourself go down!

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.370
Fix your eyes growing dim
on the chance at victory!

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.660
Turn up the heat!

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.080
More!

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.790
Even more!

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.370
Hey, bioengineered human!

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.000
It'll be bad if your head gets injured, right?

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.590
Stop seeking live capture!

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.550
Go beyond!

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.300
Beyond its reaction time!

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.680
I'll go beyond,

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.680
and I won't go down
until I turn its ugly mug to ash!

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.980
That's it, Endeavor!

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.320
With just my feathers,
I don't have enough destructive power.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.700
But I'm equally matched in speed.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.500
You know,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.000
I was watching, so I know.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.760
There wasn't a single person
who was seriously trying to surpass him.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.760
You were the only one.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.050
The only one seriously trying to surpass him.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.680
Really,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.310
just how awkward can you get?

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.700
I sent off a few of my feathers ahead of time.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.540
I'll add my speed to your firepower!

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.880
Let me give you a push, Number One!

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.010
I wanted to become stronger than anyone.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.050
My back isn't enough to let them feel safe.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.930
That's why...

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.150
It's suddenly acting like a wild animal!

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.950
Seriously?!

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.990
Even though it's being
burned from inside its mouth,

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.580
the regeneration's still keeping up?

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.420
Not enough firepower is being released!

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.800
My feathers...

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.670
I've already sent almost all of them!

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.930
They're about to burn up and disappear!

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.180
Hawks!

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.350
Bioengineered human... Nomu!

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:29.980
You, who have been
created to have multiple Quirks--

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.530
who are obsessed with strength--

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.290
E-Endeavor is fighting...

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.920
Even as he suffers... and struggles...

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.710
He's fighting!

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.470
...who's the man risking his life for our sakes?

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.680
Look!

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.510
Old Man...

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.140
I'm watching!

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.020
I'm watching!

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.440
My feathers are basically cinders!

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.990
I can't help you much!

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.320
It's enough!

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.070
Higher! Higher!

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:24.870
Way up high, where I won't have
to worry about people or buildings!

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:30.000
I see. Up there, you can
release everything freely, huh?

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.050
Bioengineered human...

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.760
...you... are me...

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.760
...from the past...

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.430
...or from another future...

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.640
Burn up... and be put to rest.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.740
I've always hated this school motto...

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.160
Plus Ultra...

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.540
Prominence Burn!

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.250
Endeavor is standing!

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.870
He's standing!

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.840
Standing...with his fist raised high!

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.260
A sign of victory--no--

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.010
of his start!

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.270
Even with All Might effectively retired,

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.560
heroes cannot stop moving forward.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.650
And, who will carry on his will...

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.740
...is us!

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.960
"His Start"

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.550
So you're...

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.680
...the ninth...
