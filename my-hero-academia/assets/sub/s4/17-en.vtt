Hey, what's going on?

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.960

I couldn't produce that kind of power.

somewhat fearful that it'll come true...

I can't make complex structures,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.090
so I used the things you guys made as a frame.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.800
I'm glad you all had good Quirks.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.130

they're getting to do it!

At this rate, those kids...

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.370
...will end up causing trouble for others,
like me during the provisional exam.

down the same path as me.

Widening those kids' horizons...

...is something we should be able to do.

to completely dodge the attacks

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.430

them without breaking their spirits...

then you won't notice your own weaknesses.

What is this...? Why...?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.800
I can't tell he's not just saying it...

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.600
They're words from the heart...

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.310

Seriously, the Symbol!

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.950

talking about? Like, life and stuff?

has gone after a school that's not U.A.

Up until now, we have not had any
especially deep interactions with U.A.,

in the future to share more information.

you were targeted, Utsushimi.

"Birthday: 6/10"
"Height: 220 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Yakushima Cedar"

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.450
Before we knew it, September was over,

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.860
and October began...

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.990
Any traces of summer disappeared completely,

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.700
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.580
and the differences in temperature grew larger.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.420
After that, those of us who
were work study students

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.250
went with All Might and Mr. Aizawa

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.300
to attend Nighteye's funeral.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.220
After discussions between the school
and the hero agencies about the work studies,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.810
it was decided that we would wait
and see what to do next.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:37.400
Nighteye's sidekick, Centipeder,
took over Nighteye's agency,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.320
waiting for Togata's return.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.110
As for Eri,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.700
even though she finally regained consciousness,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.370
since she was still unstable emotionally

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.960
and her Quirk could go out of control at
any time, visitors weren't allowed to see her.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.580
But,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.590
the horn on Eri's forehead
that released her rewinding Quirk

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:06.300
shrank as her fever went down

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.100
and is now only about the size of a bump.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.680
It's not that elegant of a question,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.520
but calculate the definite integral.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.900
"Pro Hero - Ectoplasm - Quirk: Clones"

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.150

"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.780
Mr. Ectoplasm sometimes goes
overboard with this kind of stuff...

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.570
S-Start with yay...

"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.330
Even Yaoyorozu, who's at the top
of the class, has stopped short, huh?

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.620
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.790

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.380
107/14!

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.840
Incorrect!

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.840
Yaoyorozu!

107/28!

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.430
Correct!

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.510
Now, onto the next page.

"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.970
You were close.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.810
Did you mess up your calculations?

"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.560
Deku, you seem really into it.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.310
It's good to put effort into your studies!

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.570
Now, in order to do well this afternoon, too,
let's go eat Lunch Rush's food!

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.400
Yeah, I'm starvi--

"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.070
Then, have some cheese.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.540
And, from this day on...

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.330
...strange things started happening to me.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.960
You scared me!

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.630
Cheese?!

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.340
Pont-l'Évêque cheese--it's
a smooth, mild cheese.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.300
Huh?! I'm okay, I still have some in my mouth!

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.390
Thanks...

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.810
Aoyama, would you like
to join us in the cafeteria?

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.930
You usually eat by yourself, right?

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.180
Non!

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:36.810
"Non!"

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.770
The cafeteria food here does not agree with me!

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.770
"tip"

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.770
Everyone has different tastes...

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.400
I won't force you!

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.280
Well, we will see you later, then!

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.860
Strange things...

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.410
His words and actions always have impact,

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.250
but it's hard to tell what he's thinking.
That's Aoyama.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.100
He...

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.810
...has started showing his true colors.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.080
What was that just now?!

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.840
That was Aoyama, right?!

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.090
Huh?! Why is he on the balcony?!

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.170
What's he doing?! Why?!

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.970
Ah, this is scary! What should I do?!

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.390
His room is next door, so why is
he going through the balcony...?

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.640
Should I go see?

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.390
No! This is a little too
weird for me... It's scary...!

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.730
What in the world did he...?

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.610
"I know"

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.900
I know.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.120
Cheese!

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.700
"The next day"

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.910
Don't run!

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.450
--But go as fast as you can!
--Go, go, go!

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.920
--One minute before class!
--Safe!

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.040
You just barely made it.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.880
--It's too early to be that loud.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.540
--You shouldn't stay up too late.
--It's too early to be that loud.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.250
It can disturb your autonomic nervous system!

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.210
Sorry, Class Rep!

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.720
Surprise.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:43.060
Aoyama... I was so scared, I couldn't sleep...

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.480
I've never really talked to Aoyama.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.860
He's also not one who really
tries to interact with others.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.410
He's a free spirit who says
what he wants when he wants.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.910
That's the image I have of him...

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.740
I wonder if something's going on with him...

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:06.710
If there is, I can't talk about it with
everyone around and make it into a big deal.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.840
Hey, Mineta! Did you see this?

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.750
What's the rating?

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.420
All ages.

"Mt. Lady and Edgeshot Team Up!"

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.380
Mt. Lady and Edgeshot have teamed up!

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.380
Kamui Woods is there, too!

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.140
Mt. Lady...?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.720
Team Lurkers, right?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.560
People have been talking about them for a while.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.730
A lot of heroes are teaming up these days, huh?

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.940
Lady's progress is amazing.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.730
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.820
Once we're pros, let's team up, too!

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.820
Uraraka, you can make me float!
And we can make acid rain!

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.070
Isn't that kind of cruel?

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.620
Sero can control me with his tape!

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.620
Huh? What're you talking about?

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.870
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.200
Koda and Shoji and Jiro will be the scouts.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.790
We'll be called "Team Rainy Day"!

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.790
Yeah.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:48.920
What about us?!

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.630
Don't need you!

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.420
When you team up, don't just look at Quirks.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.840
Compatibility of personalities
is also important.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.590
Yao-momo, that's just making it worse.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.760
Everyone, start moving!
You'll run out of time to change!

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:06.180
"Gym Gamma"

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.430
Now, let's work on improving
your ultimate moves today, too!

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.730
If you haven't completed the assignment
to have at least two, work on that.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.440
If you already have two,
then continue developing them.

"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.820

Rappa, I'll become a man who won't flinch
one bit at the sight of someone like you!

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.410
I'll train by taking continuous
hits like the ones he gave.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:26.620
In order to do that--

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.870
Bakugo, Sato, Midoriya!

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.500
Please beat me up to your heart's content!

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.960
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.960
People are going to misunderstand!

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.210
Sorry, I'm working on my own today...

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.590
Okay!

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.340
Have you made some progress?

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.720
Not at all...

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.470
No? I thought you were gonna go higher than me!

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.190
Kirishima! Let me shoot my Howitzer.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.060
Sounds good!

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.100
No, it doesn't!

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.190
--The building's gonna be blown away!

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.610
--One For All...
--The building's gonna be blown away!

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.570
When I forced myself,
I could draw out up to 20% of the power.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.490
But even so, I couldn't beat Chisaki.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.280
I need to be able to use 100% by myself.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.540
Otherwise, I won't be able
to win or save anyone.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.290
Hey.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.960
Watch.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.840
It's my new move, Navel Buffet Laser!

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.300
Right...

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.720
One more.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.400
When I do this, my stomach
always starts hurting right away.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.400
Then why did you do it just now?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.410
Mr. Cementoss, Aoyama isn't feeling well.
Is it okay if he rests a little?

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.780
Sure.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.500
We're alone together...

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.920
If I'm going to ask, now's the time!

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.920
Um... Recently... I mean, on the balcony...

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.050
"I know"

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.220
The "I know"...

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.630
What do you know?

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.140
Your Quirk isn't compatible with your body.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.180
You're like me.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.690
What are you talking about, Aoyama?

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.770
Like you?

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.150
How?

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.530
I've always had to wear this support item belt,

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.320
ever since I was little.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.280
If I don't wear it,

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.950
then sometimes by Navel Laser leaks out.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.500
I was born that way.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.830
My Quirk is incompatible with my body, too.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.750
That's what the doctor said.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.710
When you first started at U.A.,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.640
you couldn't control your Quirk at all, right?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.390
I've always thought we were similar.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.890
Ever since the work study,

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.810
you seem to be even more impatient than before.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.440
Aoyama...

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.560
Surprises make you happy, right?

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.690
Surprises make me happier than anything!

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.320
So I did what I thought would make you happy!

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.280
How was it?

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.320
Was the cheese delicious?

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.910
I didn't have the courage to eat that!

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.500
If you only face painful things,

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.120
then you won't be able to twinkle!

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.460
I was surprised,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.300
but it was all to encourage me...

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.680
Thanks. Your surprise
was a huge success, Aoyama.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.510
Aoyama...?

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.390
It came out.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.400
"Odor Eliminator"

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.020
And so...

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.400
Have a financier!

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.480
Thanks.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.030
Aoyama, you've been cheerful lately.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.370
...Aoyama and I became friends.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.210
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.880
Autumn! It's the season of school festivals.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.470
Those of us in hero course Class 1-A
were attacked by the League of Villains

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.800
and caused trouble for the students in
the other courses, so to let them have fun,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.140
we're planning on putting
on a special performance.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.600
We want everyone to enjoy it.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.940
There's a girl I want to see smile, too.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.190
Next time, "School Festival."

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.150
However, evil stealthily approaches...

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.620
"Next time: School Festival"

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.530
Go beyond!

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.660
Plus Ultra!
