00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.890
My shoulder's finally warmed up!

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.030
You're pretty great, too!

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.070
Things done in vain...

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.580
It wasn't in vain!

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.290
Thanks much!

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.120
I've become a great spear!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.120
What about the Barrier?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.620
There's one reason for your defeat!

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.250
You underestimated--

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.670
You, and I, as well--

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.760
--underestimated the hero named Red Riot...

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.760
...and his chivalrous spirit!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.390
In this spear-and-shield battle,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.850
we're the winners.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.200
It's so noisy...

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.280
Are those guys really doing their jobs?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.370
I don't want to say it...
but it's over for the Hassaikai.

"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.750
As long as the boss and I are here,
the Hassaikai won't die.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.710
"Villain - Chronostasis"

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.710
Most of the underlings follow him
and don't understand my thinking.

"Eri"

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.680
Even though I'm the one who
respects the boss' will the most.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.560
As long as we have this finished
product and the serum,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.680
we can bloom again.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.600
This incident will also become
a good story for the fanatics.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.190
"A drug heroes are afraid of"--

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.030
It sounds like something they'd like.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.190
They'd finance it happily.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.370
And so...

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.580

It's me, Fat!

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.140
I'm committed to the result!
Figure it out from the context!

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.810
I-I...

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.980

Kirishima...

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.240
I can't believe Tamaki would bring someone!

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.200
I saw you at the sports festival!

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.080
I welcome energetic kids like you!

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.170

he comes in last every year.

"Tamaki Amajiki - Quirk: Manifest"

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.340
I did my internship with Fourth Kind,
and he also said

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.970
that the morale of the agency goes up
when there are energetic guys around.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.760
But...

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.060
...that's all I am.
And I want to be more than that.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.820
I want... to become a hero
who can protect, like Crimson Riot...

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.280
That's why I kept pestering Tamaki
to introduce me to you.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.820
I don't want to be pathetic and
not act when someone's in trouble anymore.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.460
...like Crimson...

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.500
You tried so hard you ended up like this...

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.630
You've done enough...

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.250
Not yet.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.380

What should I do...?!

aid in the back room.

Do I look like a man who'd set a trap?

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.200
Rappa! Don't act on your own!

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.120

violence can even be in this place!

What's your duty, Ra--

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.350
You don't even have enough strength
left to put up a Barrier, do you?

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.470
Then, shut up.

too, and can't lift my arm.

use Quirks to the fullest.

There weren't many who could
stand up again after taking my fist.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.540
Those who could always
started begging for their lives.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.210
You understand, right?

able to do what you want?

put into the slammer later, you know.

It's not a draw. Why are you
tryin' to be sportsmanlike now?

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.540

you know he has no ulterior motive.

...with that man.

minutes left of my boost.

They're coming nearer!

How can he be better already?! Let him live!

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.260
Oh, since we're kind of talkin'
frankly with each other now,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.270
this might be weird for a hero to ask,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.360
but Rappa, why are you stuck
in a smalltime gang like this?

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.990
That's 'cause Overjerk was
the only person I ever lost to.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.860
You lost...

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.660
He told me to join, coming out
of nowhere, picking a fight...

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.700
Of course, I left it up to who won.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.580
And then, I died.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.340
But just when I thought that,
I was back to normal.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.010
Even after I joined,
I challenged him five times,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.930
but I lost every time.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.810
I stay here in order to beat that man.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.600
He lost every time...?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.390
Wait a minute...

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:09.570
That means Chisaki can handle
Rappa's power and speed...?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.150
Even though Chisaki's so strong,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.450
he's still left the fightin'
to his underlings.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.610
Why won't he come out?

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.820
He's not here, right?

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.530
Either run away or hide.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.000

I don't know the details,
but I've overheard them talking.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.670
They said they'd distribute large
numbers of something or something.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.510
Stop! Rappa!

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.760
And that they needed money for that.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.810
As long as they clear that, then the day
will soon come to implement their plan.

That usually careful Irinaka...

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.190

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.290
He can make the things
he touches stay in place.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.460
However, his Quirk doesn't
work on living things.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.680
It also doesn't apply to excessively
strong things or large surface areas.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.140
This way!

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.640
This area won't move anymore!

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.140
Don't complain about how cramped it is!

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.020
I can't hold that many spots
with this Security Max Deadbolt.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.440
This is the limit of my powers!

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.070
I-I can't let them through...

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.650
I won't let them through!

Concentrating the wall coming near us
into one spot and digging through.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.790
They're like moles.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.630
If the Fat team were here,
it'd go even more smoothly, huh, Eraser?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
"Pro Hero - Eraser Head - Quirk: Erasure"

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.840
I know!

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.050
He's pinpointing our location
and aiming for it specifically.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.930
Where is he watching from?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.640
Inside the wall?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.520
At this rate, it'll only get worse!

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.690
We'll just keep getting cornered!

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.110
The boost won't last much longer...

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.030
No, even so!

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.990
Smash...!

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.830
This kid's persistent...!

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.380
I'm not making any progress...

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.130
There's a girl in trouble.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.880
That's the most important thing.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.050
Ryukyu and the others...

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.180
The heroes...

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.220
The members of the police...

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.810
Kirishima and Fat Gum...

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.780
I can't let the path they created...

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.780
...be stopped here!

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.620
Smash...!

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.830
It opened up?!

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.670
What are they planning this time?!

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.830
Deku!

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.970
"Twice"
"Quirk: Double"
"He can create up to two copies of anything at the same time. He can also duplicate himself."

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.970
"Affiliation: League of Villains"
"Birthday: Unknown"
"Height: Unknown" "Blood Type: Unknown" "Likes: Unknown"

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.970
"Himiko Toga"
"Quirk: Transform"
"By ingesting someone's blood, she can transform into them."

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.970
"Affiliation: League of Villains"
"Birthday: Unknown"
"Height: Unknown" "Blood Type: Unknown" "Likes: Unknown"

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.100
Sorry.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.430
Don't worry about it.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.430
But why separate us now...?

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.140
Hey, everyone! You okay?

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.650
It's Rock Lock's voice!

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.270
The wall isn't that thick.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.320
Did they change methods because
they weren't able to crush us to death?

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.030
It makes it easier for us to move, but...

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.320
But there will be more than
enough to make up for it, I'm sure.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.740
Be careful!

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.990
It's coming.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.660
The next move!

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.210
Be quiet. Whose fault is that?

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.710
This is...!

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.590
Lockdown!

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.300
Huh?

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.260
The League of Villains!

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.260
Shh! You're wrong.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.430
Right now, I'm Toga from the
organized crime group that's obsolete

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.560
and should be a protected species.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.440
We're the bad guys.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.730
Rock! What's wrong?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.610
Eraser!

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.030
Please move aside!

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.860
Rock Lock!

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.740
A fake suddenly appeared and attacked me!

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.990
Be careful!

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.290
They've got new troops!
They'll appear again soon!

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.750
A knife wound...

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.790
Midoriya, are you okay?

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.000
Yes! We should hurry after Chisaki's--

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.550
A fake... A knife wound...

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.840
We do not believe they have
a good relationship with the League.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.930
I see it all!

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.550
Himiko Toga?!

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.060
Toga! Yeah, it's me, Toga!

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.560
You remember me?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.480
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you again! So happy!

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.650
Izuku, I'm so happy!

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.700
This is bad. No, if we stop her here,
we could turn it around!

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.660
That's it for you, Himiko Toga.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.750
Mr. Aizawa?!

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.380
This teamwork...

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.220
The League and the Hassaikai have
a framework for cooperation set up...

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.260
Was the temporary opening and
change of strategy to put the League in...?

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.050
Mr. Aizawa!

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.220
I'm fine.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.890
More importantly, stop Rock Lock's
bleeding and get the knife.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.310
I've heard that Toga uses blood.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.770
Yes, sir!

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.770
After hearing that people
had died during their fight,

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.190
I'd eliminated the possibility.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.610
Based on Shigaraki's personality, I didn't
think he'd ever put himself under someone.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.370
That body handling...

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.620
That transformation...

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.500
It was the same as that time...

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.540
You've got to be kidding...

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.290
What are you thinking, League of Villains?!

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.300
I'm glad I came.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.350
"A few days earlier"

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.810
Have you ever played shogi?

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.640
"Shie Hassaikai"
"Residence of the head -
Underground reception room"

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.180
No.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.480
Hey, play!

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.940
Put that away. I don't
know the rules, either.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.110
Come on, don't say that.
Use this chance to learn something new.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.570
It'll help you look at the big picture.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.320
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:37.490
Shogi's interesting because you can use
the pieces you take from your opponent.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.670
Give us Kurogiri or Toga,
and maybe Bubaigawara.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.710
If we let you move freely,
it'd be worrying for us, too.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.760
They're all useful guys...

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.630
Trying to reduce our movements, huh?

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.220
They're cornerstones of our operation!

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.050
Like I'd give you so many.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.430
Let's build our trust.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:02.270
"Shie Hassaikai"

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.350
Right now, there's still ill will between us.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.390
I've told you everything about my plan.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.770
Next, it's your turn.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.230
Your members are important to you, right?

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.490
"Present"

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.610
I'm sad, Shigaraki...

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.780
"Shie Hassaikai"
"Residence of the head - Underground passage"

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.700
I'm getting excited!

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.370
Man, I was wondering what kind
of hero we'd get, but this guy?

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.250
He's like a normal businessman.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.040
Don't underestimate the yakuza, bastard!

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.170
Get 'em, Big Bro Rappa!

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.340
You grazed me?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.340
You're pretty strong.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.270
What... just happened...?

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.530
These are battle support items,
high-density personal seals.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.990
They weigh about five kilograms each.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.110
They go with my businessman appearance

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.660
and are quite humorous
items, don't you think?

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.660
"Make a prediction and move first."

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.210
Perhaps because I have
seen the futures of so many,

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.580
I'm able to do that a little faster
than others during close combat.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.050
But I didn't predict this.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:16.140
I didn't think the famous League of Villains
would support mere yakuza.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.390
He melted!

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.600
That yakuza's useless!

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.230
Ouch...!

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.060
Damn it, you bastard!

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.650
The wall's too fast!

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.520
If you were a little later, I would've
been done in, slowpoke yakuza!

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.610
We're helping you,
so you should do your best, too!

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.110
Look...

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.820
Because of you, my mask is...

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.660
This is bad... It's bad...

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.370
I'm gonna split...!

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.370
All right!

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.670
I'm gonna tear apart!

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.380
No, you won't!

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.760
I need to wrap it up... or I'll split in two!

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.350
Once you're wrapped up,
you become one, right?

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.260
Toga...

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.770
We're doing all this to help them, too.
Those organized crime guys are meanies.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:07.730
Date me, Toga.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.520
You're the devil.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.230
What's with these crazy kids...?

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.530
It's sad, isn't it?

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.450
You feel the most responsibility
for Big Sis Mag's death, don't you?

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:25.040
Even so, you're bearing it
and helping them like it was decided.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.830
Wife...

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.500
Oh dear, it's so sad isn't it, Jin?

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.960
If the group you're helping is hopeless...

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.630
...then you won't get rewarded.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.800
"A few days earlier"

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.510
Work with the Hassaikai?

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.090
"A certain place"

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.640
Yeah, don't make me keep saying it.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.930
Their plan has enough potential.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.440
Toga and Twice.
You two are yakuza from today on.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.610
That's an unfunny joke.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.690
Sounds interesting, Shigaraki.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.700
They almost took Kurogiri,
too, but I held out.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.410
Anyway, that guy's got his own
important job to do right now.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.540
You'll be moving through
an underground route--

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.160
What do you mean, "potential"?!

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.330
Can you be the leader
if you just pretend to keep cool?

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.790
"Villain - Spinner"        "Villain - Dabi"

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.330
Are you being influenced
by that masked bastard?

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.840
That guy killed Big Sis Mag!

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.380
"Villain - Mr. Compress - Quirk: Compress"

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.800
He blew away Mr. Compress's arm!

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.850
He's the guy I brought carelessly to us...!

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:29.270
I'm human, too, you know, Shigaraki!

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.810
Toga, you too!

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.360
Say something!

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.650
What are we to you, Tomura?

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.030
To me, the League is
a place that's comfortable.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.950
Mr. Stainy is what brought me to you.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.330
I want to make the world a place

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.750
where I can do what I want and live easily.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.960
I'd like to do that if I can.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.380
Hey, Tomura,

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.340
why do I have to do something
that's hard that I don't want to do?

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.680
Well...

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.980
It's for me, and for you guys.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.940
They probably want to restrict
the League's mobility

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.740
and win you useful guys
over gently at the same time.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.120
I want you to flatter them
from up close and conquer them.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.290
I never thought of them as equals.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.500
Twice, you said you wanted
to take responsibility, right?

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.880
This is one way to do it.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.050
I...

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.220
...trust you guys.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:48.140
Shigaraki, I don't know what
you were thinking back then.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.640
But you said you trusted us.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.440
Then, because I am myself--

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.070
I will act as I wish--

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.150
All I need to do is do what I want.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.240
This is why the yakuza are dying out!

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.780
They really are hopeless.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.370
I'm sure it was because

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.450
that bedridden head guy they have

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.500
is useless!

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:21.960
Wha--?!

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.130
What's this?!

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.180
Big Bro Irinaka sure gets mad easily!

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.220
Wimpy guys are the most short-tempered.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.930
I'll beat up the guys I don't like.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.890
Even if I ask, I'll be refused anyway.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.480
If so...

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.440
Then just for now...

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.990
...we'll have you play with us, heroes.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.570
Crush... and kill... them... all...!

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.870
"Crush and kill them all"

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960
"Preview"

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.840
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.630
A compulsory search of the Shie Hassaikai.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.970
Togata, who goes first,
gets through the underground maze

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.140
and finally catches up to Chisaki and Eri.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:37.470
And then, Togata and Chisaki's
desperate struggle begins.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.810
Next time, "Lemillion."

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.350
Please wait for us, Togata.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.400
We will definitely catch up!

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.400
Go beyond!

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:51.540
"Next time: Lemillion"

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.580
Plus Ultra!
