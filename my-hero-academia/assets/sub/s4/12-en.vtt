WEBVTT

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.840
Did you want to become a hero that badly?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.260
To save Eri that badly, Lemillion?

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.720
"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.380
It's all a filthy disease of our time.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.510
I'll fix guys like you.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.350
"Eri"

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.600
With Eri's power.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.230
Nighteye...

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.890
Tamaki...

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.600
Everyone!

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.610
--Chisaki!

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.230
--I thought I told you I threw that name away!
--Chisaki!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
"A few minutes ago"

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.670
It's nice that the living maze is done,

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.090
but it's hard to tell where we are now.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.550
"Pro Hero - Sir Nighteye - Quirk: Foresight"
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.630
I know what direction Eri's room is in.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.590
Irinaka! Put the walls back in order! Hurry!

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.890
"Villain - Joi Irinaka - Quirk: Mimicry"

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.220
Hey...

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.390
The drugs probably wore off.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.350
He shouldn't be able to enter and
control objects bigger than a fridge!

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.020
If he gets a big enough boost,
it's not impossible, huh?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.730
Fat Gum's guess was right.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.320
Irinaka doesn't have enough
power to do that anymore.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.240
But there's still Toga and Twice...

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.410
"Villain - Himiko Toga - Quirk: Transform"

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.910
The League of Villains
must be hiding somewhere!

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.740
"Villain - Twice - Quirk: Double"

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.410
Toga...

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.080
Toga... Twice...

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.460
I won't forgive you!

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.750
You traitors!

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.000
Where are the other League members?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.050
The hell if I know!

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.130
I'll definitely find them all!

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.760
I break open the skulls
of all the League bastards!

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.850
Which means, those two were
the only ones here, huh?

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.390
There's no sign of the
League coming to attack us...

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.770
But it's hard to believe they're on
our side just because they betrayed Irinaka.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.190
The League of Villains is wanted
by police across the country.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.570
As police officers, we cannot just ignore them.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.400
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.160
Our biggest worry is the
shadow of the League of Villains.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.540
In case they're wrong,
and the League ends up involved,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.700
then you guys are out.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.790
Mr. Aizawa...!

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.130
What're you standing around talking for?

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.170
Rock Lock!

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.840
"Pro Hero - Rock Lock - Quirk: Lockdown"

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.000
Ignore them and move forward!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.510
Leave the League to the police.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.640
What's our top priority?!

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.850
He's right. That would be best...

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.440
Either way, someone has
to stay behind to restrain Irinaka.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.480
Thanks to that girl, it'll be hard
for me to jump around now.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.820
If you get it, then hurry up
and move your legs!

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.030
Ryukyu, and everyone else at the top!

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.450
The police who were
separated from us underground!

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.990
Suneater!

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.540
Red Riot! Fat Gum!

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.160
Lemillion!

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.080
Now that we've gotten this far,
we're almost there!

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.840
Don't waste the time
everyone's worked hard to get!

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.050
Go!

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.220
I'll definitely get her out, Rock Lock!

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.360
I didn't say those words
back then to be disparaging.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.150
I have a wife who's four years younger than me.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.530
And at the end of last year,
the child we'd been wishing for was born.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.910
Genetics went too much in one direction, huh?

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.120
Even if they are from U.A., kids are kids.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.160
I was worried.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.540
But when we let them loose, what happened?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.250
Each and every one of them has
acted more like a hero than us adults.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.670
You said you'd get her out, right?

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.340
Make sure you do it, Deku!

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.550
And you, Nighteye!

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.890
Make sure...

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.520
...you take responsibility!

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.810
There they go.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.520
We should also get out of this space.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.360
Toga, what d'you wanna do now?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.740
Kiss?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.620
A beat-up Izuku... I wanna see it again...

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.410
But right now, I want

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.790
to make Overhaul cry just about as much.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.290
In that case, I've got...

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.290
...no idea!

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.840
Lend me your ear!

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.210
What is it?

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.470
Whisper, whisper.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.550
Jin, that--

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.890
That'll make Tomura happy, too!

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.310
If Izuku's group and Overhaul happen to meet,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.980
no matter what happens...

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.650
The fight between heroes
and the yakuza will be decided.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.860
I hope that at the end of this fight,

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.700
both the heroes and
the yakuza will be all beat up.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.450
I'll definitely...

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.540
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.880
...save her!

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.220
"Unforeseen Hope"

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.220
I erased it!

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.350
Nighteye, secure those who need treatment!

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.190
Two of Chisaki's inner circle!

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.900
There was one more on our way here...

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.820
Chisaki on his last legs...

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.780
This space wrapped in distorted walls.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.820
Mirio!

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.790
Eri is.. behind... me...

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.250
It's fine now...

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.210
You were amazing.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.010
You were amazing, Mirio.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.550
My Quirk was erased!

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.770
Lemillion's cornered him this far!

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.350
Keep pressing him!

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.440
Yes, sir!

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.770
Get up, Chrono!

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.900
Deku!

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.620
Those pierced by the long hand
will have their movements slowed.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.700
"Villain - Chronostasis"

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.410
I meant to skewer both of you at once,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.790
but what else can I expect from heroes?

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.370
It took him a while to wake up.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.710
Back then, it's true that Chrono was taken out.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.720
But I repaired his head to heal the damage!

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.390
I-I can't stop myself from blinking...

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.180
Chisaki!

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.520
It's all...

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.430
It's all...

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.360
It's all for nothing!

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.870
Like I'd let my plan be
ruined by people like this!

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.040
Right, Nemoto? You don't want that, do you?

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.250
I won't let things end here for me...

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.340
Nemoto, you really did a good job...

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.720
You would die for my sake, wouldn't you?!

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.180
I'll acknowledge with dignity

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:48.020
that you were stronger than me, Lemillion.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.070
But in the end, it all comes to nothing.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.820
Now! I'll have you return Eri!

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.950
"Overhaul"
"Quirk: Overhaul"
"He can break apart and restore anything, living or non-living."

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.950
"Affiliation: Shie Hassaikai"
"Birthday: Unknown"
"Height: Unknown" "Blood Type: Unknown" "Likes: Unknown"

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.960
"Sir Nighteye"
"Quirk: Foresight"
"He can 'see' what his target will do for one hour."

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.960
"Affiliation: Pro Hero"
"Birthday: 1/2"
"Height: 200 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: All Might"

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.250
I know much about you,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.050
Erasure Hero: Eraser Head.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.600
We referenced your Quirk a lot
while conducting the research on Eri.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.970
Since I was able to isolate
you without killing you...

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.980
That means it must be worth keeping you alive.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.070
Erasing Quirks...
To him, that's an attractive power.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.940
Oh, you should just give up.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.320
You can't move faster than a snail right now.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.240
I pierced you with the short hand,
so it will last for an hour.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:52.050
"Hari Kurono - Quirk: Chronostasis"

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.000
Eight Bullets of the Hassai Group member
and aide to the young head, Hari Kurono.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.040
Quirk: Chronostasis!

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.830
He attacks by extending hair
with strands like clock hands!

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.670
Those he attacks have their movements slowed!

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.470
Once he's decided something,
you can't stop him.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:05.270
I don't know how much you know,
but Eri is the Hassaikai boss's granddaughter.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.100
If it's for his goal, he'll use anything.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.780
That's the kind of person
the man called Overhaul is.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.820
He destroyed himself and his underling...

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.700
...and then fused them together?!

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.950
That was the worst feeling,
but it's much better than how I felt before.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.700
I've got to take stock of the situation!

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.580
Eri and Togata are
being protected by Nighteye!

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.290
I don't see Mr. Aizawa!

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.340
Or the person in the white hood!

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.380
Chisaki! He fused with his underling.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.550
His injuries from before are gone, too!

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.060
I'm obsessive about cleanliness,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.850
so when someone touches me,
it makes my blood boil.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.110
It's the first time it's gotten to this point.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.900
What a sad life you had, Lemillion.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.570
If you hadn't gotten
involved with Eri--with me--

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.320
then your Quirk wouldn't be lost forever.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.370
His Quirk...

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.370
Lost forever...?!

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.960
If you hadn't gotten involved,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.500
you could've kept holding onto your dream.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.960
You lost your Quirk but persevered,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.260
and as a result,
your friends got caught up in this,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.100
and now you're all just going to die.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.020
What? He's able to use his Quirk
even with his subordinate's hands?

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.900
Togata...

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.330
I can't read his movements...!

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.620
If it weren't for my iron soles,
they would've pierced through!

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.920
Power and speed... That's all you've got.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.880
I will be his opponent!

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.300
Like I'd let you.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.880
Limit the number of his moves and get close!

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.880
Don't let him transform the ground!

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.970
You go to Lemillion and Eri!

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.550
Roger!

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.220
Where did Eraser go?!

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.020
Your aide isn't here, either?

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.190
I'm interested in heroes who can erase Quirks,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.520
so he's been shown to the VIP room!

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.230
Someone who finds joy in
destroying other people's Quirks

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.570
is afraid of getting his own Quirk erased?

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.240
By "forever," do you mean
that you perfected the bullets

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.240
and used one on Lemillion?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.000
I thought you were sneaking away
so that you could hide them,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.750
but you must've been very scared of Lemillion!

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.470
Listen, Mirio...

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.640
Look carefully at your opponent.
Predict his next move.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.760
You mean to see the future?

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.680
But my Quirk isn't Foresight.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.270
Good answer! It was humorous.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.730
Experience different situations
and store up that experience.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.230
Rescue, combat, hardship and suffering...

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.030
That store will become your database.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.150
I understand, Sir.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.200
Mirio...

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.200
You believed in my teaching...

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.250
You believed in me, and became strong...

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.790
And I'm proud of you.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.470
I've seen...

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.640
...the safety of you and
those you want to protect...

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.720
Did you see it?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.180
Didn't I tell you that you didn't have
to use your Foresight on me?

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.940
Why don't you try to
see things in the far future?

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.690
The future I see cannot be changed.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.860
I've tested this many times.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.030
Even if I act completely
differently from the future I saw,

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.450
it ends up returning to what I saw,
as if balancing accounts.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.500
The future has never diverged from that.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.630
By using my Foresight, isn't it as if
I'm dictating the future of that person?

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:09.590
If I hadn't used it on All Might,
maybe his future would've changed...

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.220
His death...

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.260
I...

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.150
You're thinking too much.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.230
That might be true.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.320
But I will no longer...

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.240
...use my Foresight on anyone else's future.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.330
Even without looking at the result,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.880
by repeating my one-second Foresight,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.750
we can reach the best conclusion

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.050
that Mirio and I want!

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.140
Eri! Lemillion!

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.470
Are you all right?

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.890
Can you move?

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.600
Yeah...

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.310
No problem... right?

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.150
I ended up...

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.230
...making you sad...

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.820
Let's get out of here.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.490
This is the path we took to get here.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.910
We should put some
distance between us and Chisaki!

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.870
That's...

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.460
...enough...

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.880
Each and every action you take kills people.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.800
You're cursed.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.930
I'm sorry...

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.690
Sir...

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.490
Sir!

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.080
The future...

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:06.090
...where Eri is saved,
and Mirio and the others are safe...

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.920
That future...!

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.570
His power is nothing like it was before...

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.110
Was he not fighting seriously earlier?!

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.990
Lemillion, please take care of Eri!

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.540
My whole body's screaming!

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.660
But I can move!

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.750
My whole body's creaking,
and I can't keep it up for long!

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.420
But I can move!

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.670
One For All 20%!

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.720
Give it up!

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.430
It'll just end up like I said--you'll all die!

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.260
I won't let that happen!

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.230
Even if that was already decided...

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.100
I'll twist that future!

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.810
Impertinent!

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.280
I can guess the timing
based on his breaking apart,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.030
but I can't dodge it completely!

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.990
Bear it!

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.950
Until you win!

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.290
Chisaki's not going to let up now!!

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.540
He won't give up on Eri even if he dies!

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.130
I can't take too much time!

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.340
If I injure him, he'll just repair himself!

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.430
One blow!

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.800
One blow to the top of head!

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.100
Manchester Smash!

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.570
He dodged?!

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.690
No matter how fast you are,
compared to the last two,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.280
the lines of your movements
are simple and easy to predict.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.210
I need to get Eri to a safer place...

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.840
No problem... Power, right?

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.010
I'm nowhere near my limit!

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.510
Move...

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.930
Move, Lemillion!

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.360
Stand...!

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.280
Stand!

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.070
Move!

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.030
Eri, hide yourself...

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.160
And wait.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:52.840
Dozens of people... are acting...
to try... and save you...!

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:58.760
Eri, you'll be fine...

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.340
Eri!

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.930
Jeez, even if I can repair myself,
it still hurts when I break apart.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.940
If the ground hadn't cracked into small pieces,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.320
I would've been done in by a big spike!

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.940
I'm done.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.910
Not yet... It's not over yet!

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.240
Jeez, Lemillion persisted like that, too.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.210
You can't look down on the hidden
reserves of someone who won't give up.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.960
Someone else is about to die because of you!

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.500
Is that what you want?!

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.300
Eri!

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.590
It looks like she's at her limit.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.010
She's used up all her strength, too.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.720
I see...

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.730
I suppose it's about time for a reset.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.940
Let's go back to square one.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.770
I...

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.320
I...

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.120
...don't...

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.790
...want that!

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.870
No, stay with Lemillion!

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.790
Eri!

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.830
Eri...

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:20.760
Do you really think this guy can do
anything in this situation by himself?

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.340
No, I don't...

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.140
Then, what should you do?

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.930
Go back...

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.600
Eri...

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.600
In exchange...

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.940
...put everyone back the way they were!

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.280
That's right.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.320
It's easier to be hurt yourself than
to have others get hurt for you, huh?

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.700
The faint hope that budded
with Lemillion has been smashed.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.540
Have you realized?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:58.920
That you're acting in the
cruelest way possible to Eri.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.630
She doesn't want you.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.800
Midoriya...

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.140
You can't save Eri anymore...

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:19.860
I saw the future, where you and
I are killed, and Chisaki gets away.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.030
Even if that's the case--

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.070
Even if you don't want my help--

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.700
You're crying, aren't you?

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.750
I won't let anyone die!

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.420
I'll save you!

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.940
"Preview"

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.150
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.650
I will not let go anymore!

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.030
Not now that I've gotten hold of Eri's hand.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.280
I will not give up!

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.450
Even if Nighteye saw the
worst future with his Foresight!

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.370
Here goes, One For All!

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:39.250
The power created by the voices crying
for help and the hearts of the brave...

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.290
I'll release it now!

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.000
Next time, "Infinite 100%."

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.800
Break through your limits, Izuku Midoriya!

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.970
"Next time: Infinite 100%"

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.050
Go beyond!

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.970
Plus Ultra!
