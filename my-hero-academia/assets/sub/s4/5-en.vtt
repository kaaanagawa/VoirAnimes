WEBVTT

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.270
The villain groups are fighting each other!

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.860
There are two with gigantification Quirks!

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.530
Espa Way's caught up in their fight!

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.780
Send heroes immediately!

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.200
Wha--?!

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.740
Full charge, output level 30...

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.580
Spiraling Surge--

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.910
Nejire Wave!

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.090
Hey, why are you fighting?

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.010
Is it because your Quirks are the same?

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.970
That's so weird.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.720
"Nejire Hado"
"Quirk: Surge"

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.640
Do it now, you two!

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.020
Ultimate...

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.350
...Move!

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.310
Meteor...

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.520
...Fafrotskies!

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.110
That was great!

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.110
Yeah, that was really great!

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.280
Were you nervous?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.990
Phew, I was able to do
what I was supposed to!

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.080
Ribbit, I was calmer than I thought I'd be.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.080
As expected of those recommended by Nejire--

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170
You're both great at this.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.880
Nejire, you've also fixed
the timing for your attack.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:23.220
"Dragoon Hero: Ryukyu"

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.380
Hero Billboard Chart, number nine--

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.470
Dragoon Hero: Ryukyu!

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.800
Nejire Hado, a third year and part of the Big Three
at U.A. High School, is her work study student.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.520
Class 1-A's Ochaco Uraraka and
Tsuyu Asui are also working for her!

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.100
Thank you for taking us on.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.350
Of course.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.900
Hey, Ryukyu, these two couldn't
go to the heroes from their internships!

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.150
Did you know that first years can only go

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.360
to agencies with a good track record
of accepting work study students?

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.450
Did I tell you?

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.740
Even if you're still students,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.370
now that you're here for a work study,
you're a legitimate part of our forces!

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.620
You two seem like you'll be able
to play an active role in that matter.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.000
"That matter"...?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.540
Ribbit...?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.420
A request to team up from
All Might's former sidekick, Nighteye.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.210
Nighteye's where Deku went
for his work study...

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.930
Oh, "team up" means for
hero agencies to work together.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.220
You knew that, right?

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.850
What's the request to team up about?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.310
The investigation and siege of
designated the villain group, Shie Hassaikai.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.350
"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.820
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.570
It's a big job that might lead
to the League of Villains.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.500
"Shie Hassaikai"

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.040
I was made to walk in circles
underground for 30 minutes.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.000
I feel like I've become an ant!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.880
What's up with a yakuza's house, anyway?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.290
We don't know who's watching or from where,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.800
nor do we know what our guests are thinking.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.430
A number of underground routes lead here.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.680
This reception room is also one
of our hidden underground rooms.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.640
We've been able to survive until now
because of small details like this.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.350
Anyway!

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.060
What you said the other day on the phone--

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.020
You meant it, right?

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.860
That you'd join us as long
as certain conditions were met.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.530
Don't interpret it in your favor.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.950
You guys want the name
of our League of Villains.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.830
We want to increase our strength.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.580
Our needs coincide.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.670
Put your foot down. It'll get dirty.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.630
"Will you put your foot down, please?"

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.960
That's what you should be saying, young head.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.840
You should really be bowing to me.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.590
First, we won't put ourselves under you.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.470
We'll move however we want.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.520
Half--in other words, a joint partnership.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.270
If that's what this is, then we'll help.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.770
So those are the conditions?

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.350
One more thing.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.770
That plan you said you had.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.030
Tell me what it is.
That's a reasonable condition.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.990
I want to consider whether or not
there's merit in lending you our name.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.120
For that matter--

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.620
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.250
"Chronostasis - Shie Hassaikai Aide"

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.290
You're doing too much of what you want.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.250
"Mimic - Shie Hassaikai Director" "Crab

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.120
Who do you think you are, punk?!

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.420
Who do you think you are?

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.210
One of your disposable
small fry versus our Hikiishi.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.840
Those lives are not worth the same.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.140
Plus, the worth of one of Compress' arms.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.260
If we don't get some concessions from you,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.930
then it won't be worth it for us.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.600
Stay back, Kurono, Mimic.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.940
He came all this way with his offer.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.690
Let's hear him out to the end.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.730
You weren't finished.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.780
Tell me the details of your plan.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.370
Well, I have some idea of what it is, anyway.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.040
It has something to do with this, right?

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.670
"Let's Go, Gutsy Red Riot"

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.010
Heaven - Main Store"

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.710
Those punks and hoodlums keep
gettin' into so many fights these days!

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.010
I'm starvin'!

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.810
Yeah, the hero agencies 'round
here have been wantin' a fightin' type.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.430
Red Riot, you're perfect.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.890
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.190
I look forward to working with you!

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.310
Fourth Kind wasn't taking
work study students,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.900
"Tamaki Amajiki"

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.610
so I'm grateful to you for taking me on!

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.150
If only Mirio'd been free...

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.950
Amajiki, please introduce me to
whoever you do your work study with!

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.200
Please. Please, please!

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.660
Your spit--

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.620
You kept coming at me. It was scary.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.460
If Tamaki could only do somethin'
about his weak mind, he'd be a great talent!

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.040
That pressure leads me to even lower lows...

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.460
It's always like this...!

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.010
This man scouted me in order to torment me!

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.930
It's power harassment! I want to go home!

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.720
Maybe he's trying to encourage you!

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.220
That's how it sounds to me, anyway.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.100
Fat, eat ours!

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.640
I will tomorrow!

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.480
I can't be cheerful and
positive like you or Mirio.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.020
I feel the same sometimes.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.190
There are lots of times I can't do
anything when everyone else is frantic.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.030
The gap in ability and experience between
me and my classmates has gotten bigger...

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.200
So I want to at least close that gap
so I can stand next to them!

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.200
That's called "being positive," first year.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.660
It's a fight! Somebody, help!

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.910
Speak of the devil!

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.830
You're not gonna wait, you moron?!

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.580
They're sellin' on my
turf without permission!

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.080
Damn it! Stop followin' me!

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.460
Just when I thought
I'd start pitchin' in and helpin', too!

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.710
Let's split up for now!

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.960
Right!

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.550
I won't let you!

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.550
I-It's Fat!

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.220
Oh, no! I'm sinkin'!

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.800
I'm Mr. Fat, here to make you sink!

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.430
Damn it!

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.100
What're you doin' anyway?!

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.520
Your Quirk's the same as Edge's!

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.270
What's with this octopus?!

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.860
That's mean...

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.440
No, wait, that's not an insult!
He's talking about how it looks!

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.120
I didn't get... an octopus...

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.910
Clams are handy. They can
be used for offense or defense.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.830
That's why I make sure to eat some every day.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:14.010
"Tamaki Amajiki"
"Quirk: Manifest"

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.670
U.A. High School third year and
part of the Big Three, Tamaki Amajiki.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.920
Quirk: Manifest.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.340
He can manifest characteristics
of things he eats in his body!

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.340
By the way, his right arm was from takoyaki,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.510
"Takoyaki"

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.390
his left arm from clam preserves,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.640
"Takoyaki"
"Clam Preserves"

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.930
and his wings and claws are
manifested from fried chicken!

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.600
"Takoyaki"
"Clam Preserves"
"Fried Chicken"

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.690
I didn't need the wings.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.810
Wow... I mean, I didn't get
to do anything again...

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.320
I wonder... if I did okay...

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.700
It was amazing! You were so fast
and so good at using your Quirk!

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.450
Our Suneater's skills have
long been as good as a pro's!

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.620
He still needs to work on
his mental weakness, though.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.950
Right?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.580
--Good job, Suneater!
--You're so cool!

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.460
I need...

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.470
...to save my big bros...!

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.640
Oh, no! Get down!

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.640
Right after this was shot into Compress,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.890
he couldn't use his Quirk for a while.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.690
What is this?

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.190
What are you planning to do with this?

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.360
Tell me.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.660
I'm going to break the status quo.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.540
I heard All For One ruled by stealing Quirks.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.330
I fine-tuned his method a little.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.210
I already have my roots
spread out across the entire country.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.590
Bro, run away!

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.170
Little by little...

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.300
Suneater!

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.670
Suneater! Red Riot!

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.810
Little by little, preparations
are going according to plan...

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.560
It bounced off?!

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.770
I'll capture him!

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.020
What's with this piece of junk?!

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.650
It hurts less than I thought it would...

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.610
Suneater! Are you all right?!

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.190
So cool!

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.610
G-Get outta the way!

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.320
I'll chase him!

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.860
I'll catch him with my octopus...!

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.530
It won't activate?!

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.330
Wait, you!

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.870
Wait, don't go runnin' into things!

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.960
If you're not careful,
it might come back to bite you!

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.210
Suneater, if you're unhurt,
then I'll leave this place to you!

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.920
Other heroes will be here soon,
so work with them!

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.130
I'm not hurt, but my Quirk won't activate!

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.170
Is Eraser here or somethin'?

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.260
Don't come near me! Stop chasin' me!

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.840
Then don't run away!

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.970
At least finish saving your friends!

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.470
What're you gettin' angry about?!

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.100
Running away scared after shooting someone

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.980
isn't manly!

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.940
It's a dead end!

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.610
Prepare yourself!

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.690
You're too loud!

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.530
Red Counter!

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.370
That wasn't my full power!

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.080
Come quietly, gun maniac!

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.460
Huh? You're crying?

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.380
It's not fair...

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.460
All I've got is a Quirk that lets me
pop out blades less than ten cm long...

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.760
That's about as long as a box cutter...

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.090
It's not fair...

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.220
I wanna save my bros, fool!

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.680
But I'm scared!

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.980
You should be praisin' me
for gettin' the courage to shoot!

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.850
No way!

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.310
Besides, if you're gonna
cry about being scared,

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.440
then don't do bad stuff to begin with!

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.400
Come on, can you stand?

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.690
I wanted... to become strong...

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.700
If I hung out with strong guys,
then I could get stronger, too.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.160
I understand how you feel, but...

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.080
If I followed my bros,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.870
then I could get a hold of power...

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.540
For a guy who can become a hero to say he
understands without thinkin'...

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.250
Don't say that!

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.210
What are you doing?!

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.260
What'd you give yourself?

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.180
Hey! Are you okay?!

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.390
Wh...

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.890
What's this?!

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.270
What's going on...?

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.950
"Eijiro Kirishima"
"Quirk: Hardening"
"He can harden his whole body, which can be used for offense or defe

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.950

"Birthday: 3/4"
"Height: 177 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Butterflies"

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.330
Thanks to you, we were saved!

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.870
These guys are part of a team
selling illegal drugs and items,

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.420
so we'd been waiting for a chance like this.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.050
So my Quirk couldn't activate
because of one of those items?

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.840
Die, stupid scum!

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.350
Anyway, please leave the rest to us.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.930
Kirishima, Fat...

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.060
I have a bad feeling about this...

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.900
He suddenly powered up...!

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.570
I've seen this before on the news...

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.070
A drug that boosts your Quirk...

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.120
If this ends up on a main road,
it won't end with just a tragedy!

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.500
I'll end this here!

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.620
Everyone, get back!

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.000
Get somewhere that this
guy's blades can't reach!

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.750
He cut through!

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.550
His blades are sharper than my Hardening?

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.800
I can't get close, then!

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.300
You got too full of yourself, huh, kid?

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.810
It's 'cause you're playin'
at justice so proudly!

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.850
My bros said the age of
heroes'll crumble soon, you know!

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.520
They said it'll be the age of those
like us that live in the shadows next!

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.400
Man, I feel like I'm on such a high!

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.570
Move, kid!

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.110
I feel like I could save my bros now,
like you told me to earlier!

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.580
With your Hardening,
rather than trying for small tricks,

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.950
you should try to bulldoze your way through.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.880
That's what All Might told me,
but thinking about it, when it comes down to it,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.090
I don't have a move that lets me
hold my own against you guys.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.130
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.500
Huh?

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.130
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.550
You guys have mid- to long-range attacks
and excellent mobility, right?

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.550
Other than Kaminari.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.350
Hey, I'm not gonna charge
your phone for you anymore!

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.260
I don't have anything like that.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.220
Oh.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.230
I'm mostly mediocre even now,

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.730
so once we all become pros...

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.480
How am I supposed to hold my own?

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.650
You're unexpectedly cowardly, huh?

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.900
I'm not complaining!

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.860
I'm deliberating! Deliberating!

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.450
Before thinking about holding your own...

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.540
Didn't you say before that you'd be
a horse that never wavered?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.580
I'll be a horse that'll never waver!

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.670
All Might's last stand at Kamino...

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.470
Not falling must mean you're damn strong.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.560
Get harder...!

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.390
More...!

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.100
And more...!

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.100
My body...

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.310
...and spirit!

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.440
Get harder! Harden!

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.900
And become...

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.700
...a wall that will never fall!

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.950
Oww...!

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.830
After intensive training to improve my Quirk,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.540
this is the highest hardness level
I can achieve right now!

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.340
Red Riot Unbreakable!

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.510
What's this sound?

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.550
Is his whole body creaking?!

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.930
I can only hold this for 30 to 40 seconds!

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.140
But during that time,

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.940
I cannot be brought down!

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.110
Look at me!

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.980
I'll bring everything to one spot...

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.780
...and push you away!

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.660
The people behind me haven't all escaped yet.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.330
I'm sure there are still
people inside the stores, too.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.120
I'll make him point his blades only at me!

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.210
I'm a man of Hardening!

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.500
Instead of small tricks,
I need to bulldoze my way through!

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.920
Overwhelm him!

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.880
Ultimate move--

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.260
Red Gun Turret!

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.940
He's young, but he's got guts...

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.270
Wow...

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.150
Hey!

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.660
Just before my time ran out. That was close!

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.620
Don't come near me...!

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.370
He's back to the crying state
he was in before the drug.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.500
Did its effect wear off?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.710
I just wanted to get stronger...

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.580
Please, let me go...!

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.210
I'm just a pitiful man who wanted some power!

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.130
I can't. You shot Suneater.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.010
I really do understand how you feel.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.180
In the past, I, too...

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.350
Who cares about you, moron!

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.510
Am I stupid?!

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.930
Predictable! So predictable I'm saved!

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.600
I'm gonna escape! I'm escapin'!

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.810
Like I'd let you catch me!

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.020
Sorry I'm late!

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.480
Fat Gum!

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.320
When you're squaring off,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.990
the villain can win by killin',

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.280
runnin' away, beatin' us up so bad
we can't recover, et cetera!

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.710
On the other hand, there's only one way
for us to win--capture without casualties!

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.170
Remember this when you leave, Red Riot!

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.380
The key to fighting villains is--

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.340
How fast can you make
them lose the will to fight!

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:18.890
"BMI Hero: Fat Gum"
"Quirk: Fat Absorption"

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.260
BMI Hero: Fat Gum. Quirk: Fat Absorption.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.550
He can absorb and sink
anything into his body!

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.220
Tottoro!

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.140
I gave it everything I had
and just barely held my own,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.730
but he was done in an instant!

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.850
Thanks for your help!

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.810
Thanks, young 'un.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.150
You were amazin'! I'm head over heels!

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.440
You were tryin' to keep him from pointin'
the blades at us, weren't you?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.570
I can tell after watchin' heroes for so long!

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.700
Most people'd get scared
of a blade guy like that!

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.070
You really saved us!

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.370
What a spectacular debut.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.660
Completely different from my first job.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.500
You really helped us out today!

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.540
You'll be an amazing hero someday.
I'm sure of it!

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.590
Thank you!

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.170
Young man, what's your hero name?

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.510
What're you called?

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.840
I'm Red Riot!

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.430
Red Riot, huh? I won't be forgettin' that!

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.560
Thank you, Red Riot!

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.810
Thank you!

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.700
Why didn't I go...?

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.910
I've also...

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.290
...gotten a little...

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.160
Th...

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.710
Thank you!

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.870
...a little...

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.170
His Quirk powered up...?

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.380
That drug's banned in Japan, right?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.930
Based on how short the effects lasted,

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.800
it must've been an
inferior version made in Asia.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.140
The ones made in the U.S.
last at least an hour or two.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.310
You know a lot about it! Wow!

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:50.020
In the past, I'd work with the coppers
and catch guys like that all day.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.320
Fat! About the gun that guy fired--

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.440
It's been broken into
pieces by someone's Quirk.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.860
Also, this isn't a normal gun.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.320
Anyway, I'll investigate and report back.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.280
Thanks for goin' out of
your way to let me know.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.530
I see...

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.830
Are you all right?

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.040
It sucks.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.910
To make it so you can't use your Quirk...

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.080
What a terrible way to treat a hero!

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.540
More importantly,

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.880
you defended me.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.550
Just like Mirio,

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.050
you're a person who
shines brightly, like the sun.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.430
If you're going to say that,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.260
then you're like the sun, too,
for introducing me to this place!

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.680
Just like that. You're amazing, you know.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.730
Why don't we have them take
a look at you at the hospital?

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.900
There's something
I want to investigate there, too.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.820
Why don't we stop by
the agency first and then go?

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.480
Okay.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.110
Yes, sir!

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.240
I understand drugs
that boost someone's Quirk...

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.240
They were originally proposed
to help those with weak Quirks.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.870
But drugs that completely prevent
someone from usin' their Quirk...?

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.160
I've never heard of them.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.870
I've got a bad feelin' about this...

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.260
A few days after starting my work study...

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.350
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.230
When I come to school,
I can't help but relax my guard...

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.350
Kirishima, hey!

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.100
Hm?

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.360
Your name!

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.900
Your hero name's in the news online! Wow!

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:47.700
"Newcomer Sidekick Red Riot
Bursts onto the Scene!"

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.780
"Newcomer Sidekick Red Riot Bursts
onto the Scene! From his first day,

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.870
he takes responsibility for the citizens and
fights a villain by himself." That's what it says!

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.700
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.870
Tsu and Uraraka, you're amazing!
Your names are here!

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.710
"New Sidekicks at Ryukyu Agency"
"Two there for a work study!"
"And they're cute!"

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.620
Let's see, "New Sidekicks at Ryukyu Agency.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.960
Two there for a work study!"

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.750
Wow, that makes me happy! There it is!

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.670
I wonder where they took the picture from...

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.890
That's amazing! Maybe you
already have some fans like Mt. Lady!

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.260
I'm so jealous!

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.060
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.510
It's true.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.720
"And they're cute.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.520
A great achievement, taking control
of a big incident in an instant...

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.440
Their abilities are real."

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.730
Even if they only have provisional licenses,

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.770
once they start working in town,
they're heroes just the same.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.820
Remarkable service.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.570
However!

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.320
A student's duty is to study!

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.240
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.860
You can't doze off in class!

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.910
Right, Iida! We're prepared!

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:29.490
Right?

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.780
Yeah!

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.910
You said your schoolwork was in trouble,
but are you okay now?

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.830
The teachers said they'd set up
supplementary lessons for me.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.830
Maybe I should've gone, too...

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.750
It seems tough to do both at once...

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.050
Everyone learns at their own pace.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.130
That's absolutely right!

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.640
I've been thinking about
it ever since then...

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.890
The reason All Might and
Nighteye's relationship soured...

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:59.900
How Nighteye wants to make
Togata the successor for One For All...

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.320
I don't know all the details,
but I understand the situation.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.530
But at the same time...

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.950
D... Don't go...

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.700
Every day, that girl's presence
grows bigger inside me...

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960
"Preview"

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.920
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.710
At Sir Nighteye's Agency,
the Big Three, us work study students,

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.260
and pro heroes gathered,

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.880
and a meeting began.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.680
It's a report on the investigation of the
designated villain group, Shie Hassaikai.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.350
The girl whose hand I let go of--

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.310
Eri--I can't believe
she's being used by evil...!

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.860
Next time, "An Unpleasant Talk."

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.780
This time, I will definitely save Eri!

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:51.540
"Next time: An Unpleasant Talk"

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.240
Go beyond!

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.870
Plus Ultra!
