WEBVTT

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.150
We've finally succeeded.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.770
Yeah.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.860
It's not like the incomplete drug that
only took a day or two to recover from.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.700
We started with preserving the effects
of the factors separated from Eri's body,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.990
and it's taken a long time since then.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.660
With this, we can completely
annihilate someone's Quirk.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.830
However, it will take
too much time and money.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.630
It's taking a month to
make enough for five bullets.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.670
It's because we're doing this
ourselves in these awful facilities.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.880
"Waste"

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.470
We will arrange for a
more suitable environment.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.510
Now's our chance, with All For One gone.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.470
We don't have time to dawdle.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.990
"Villain - Himiko Toga - Quirk: Transform"

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.280
I didn't have a choice.
I was ordered to come here.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.320
I'm Toga.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.610
Long time no see, birdman.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240
"Villain - Twice - Quirk: Double"

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.330
I will never forgive you.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.240
I look forward to working with you.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.160
Keep it up.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.580
The League of Villains?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.960
This is great. Let's fight!

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.000
I'll kill you.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
No way.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.590
Sorry about Magne.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.460
I didn't want to kill him, either.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.720
You mean her.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.430
Please don't make that mistake again.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.640
"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.560
Well, I understand why you'd hold a grudge,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.720
but now that we're working together,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.600
I want you to assist us
in carrying out the plan.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.310
Bastard...

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.860
You acted like you were just keeping up
appearances when we first met, too!

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.240
So, what should I do?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.120
Just follow my instructions
like everyone else in the Hassaikai.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.950
In order for me to give you instructions,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.620
first, tell me the details of your Quirks.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.670
If anything happens, I'd like to
make it easier for you to work with us.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.920
I'll tell you when it becomes
necessary if anything happens.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.760
Because I don't like you people yet.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.470
You should just tell us.
Don't underestimate us yakuza!

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.260
"Villain - Mimic - Quirk: Mimicry"

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.220
Aw, man, this is no good. It's no good!

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.600
It's unacceptable! Nasty. I'm not telling!

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.940
What is your Quirk?

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.030
"The explanation"

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.320
I can make doubles of anything.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.200
In order to make it work,
I need a precise image.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.490
For a person, that'd mean their height,
chest measurement, and shoe size--

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.240
a lot of data.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.330
I need to look carefully and measure carefully.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.750
Only then can I make one thing into two.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.830
The only difference between
the doubles and the real thing is durability.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.540
They'll crumble away after receiving
a certain amount of damage.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.710
I can make doubles of up
to two things at a time.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.220
The durability of the
second object will be even lower.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.640
Also, for personal reasons,
I will not make more of myself!

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.060
Huh? Why...? No, this isn't the usual me!

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.730
It's like I'm dumb.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.520
That's not it, Toga! This was--

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.020
What about you?

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.530
If I drink someone's blood,
I can turn into them.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.030
"Transformation Time"

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.360
The amount I have turns into energy,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.240
so the time I can stay transformed
is proportional to the amount I ingest.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.490
One cup lets me transform for about a day.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.330
'1 Day"

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.620
If I drink a lot of different
people's blood at once,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.250
then I can turn into each of them.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.670
My clothes transform with me.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.920
They overlap with whatever clothes
I'm wearing, though,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.670
so I have to get naked first,
and it's embarrassing.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.430
See?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.680
Tell me one more thing.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.730
Did you hear anything
from Shigaraki about a betrayal?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.810
--No!
--Nope.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.360
Okay, then.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.570
We'll accept you as
members of the Hassaikai now.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.820
But we can't let wanted criminals
like you roam about freely.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.450
If you don't have any instructions, please
do not leave these underground facilities.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.410
What, are we under house arrest?

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.960
Aw, I wanna be free!

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.630
Once I can trust you a little more,
I can let you do what you want.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.340
It's up to you guys.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.010
That means you can't
keep up that attitude forever.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.390
If you get it, then do what we say, brats.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.770
We're yakuza. Don't underestimate us!

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.100
"Villain - Hekiji Tengai - Quirk: Barrier"
"Villain - Kendo Rappa - Quirk: Power Shoulder"

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.270
We'll take control of society
once again from the shadows!

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.110
"Villain - Yu Hojo - Quirk: Crystallize"
"Villain - Toya Setsuno - Quirk: Larceny"
"Villain - Soramitsu Tabe - Quirk: Food"

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.850
The restoration of the yakuza!

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.440
Making the longstanding desire of the boss,
who's in his sickbed, come true!

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.240
You can be part of a good thing here!

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.450
Be grateful, you bastards!

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.290
I will not forgive those who make fools of us!

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.540
"Crush them all to death"

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.710
Crush them all to death!

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.510
Wimpy guys are the most short-tempered.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.590
If you get mad,
your warnings become half-hearted.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.220
We don't have the power...

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.470
...so we'll leave it to you heroes
to get rid of them. You're good at that.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.850
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.440
That yell! You heard it, right?

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.810
Something big moved with that strange voice!

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.400
So that voice belongs to Irinaka?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.030
Where's it coming from...?

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.860
The sound's echoing too much to tell!

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.160
Hey, this is bad! We'll be crushed!

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.580
Wimpy guys always want
to hide how weak they are.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.000
They want to make themselves look strong,
so they look down on others from above.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.920
Organized crime guys...

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.800
They're lame, huh?

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.810
One For All...

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.180
...Full Cowling!

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.900
Smash...!

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.400
M-My Quirk...!

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.030
Sorry, yakuza!

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.870
I think we'll do what we want after all.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.450
Bye!

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.830
The League of Villains?!

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.160
Bastards!

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.580
Catch him!

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.800
The League betrayed him...?

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.430
"Pro Hero - Sir Nighteye - Quirk: Foresight"

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.180
It looks like we've been used.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.020
But that put an end to the maze.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.850
Eri... Togata...

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.400
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.730
Excuse me...

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.360
But can I ask you some questions...?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.450
You shouldn't have been
able to get here so fast.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.490
I took a shortcut...

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.460
I'm here to rescue that girl.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.250
Now that you know the situation,
you're putting on your hero mask, huh?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.170
Mr. Student.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.340
Right! We're still new, so we're pretty nervous.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.640
Back then, you were pretending
not to see, weren't you?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.890
This girl doesn't want you to rescue her.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.270
"Eri"

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.690
To her, you're not a hero.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.980
That's why I'm here.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.070
I'm not getting through to you.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.440
Let me make this simpler.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.200
I'm telling you to die.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.290
Wh-What?!

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.160
My sense of equilibrium...

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.250
Are you shloshed?

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.630
Your legsh look sshaky...

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.090
Mine're too...
Thash why I'm walkin' up 'ere...

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.930
Don't get closh t' me...

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.020
--You'll catcsh my drunkenesh...
--Is it this guy's Quirk?

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.980
--You'll catcsh my drunkenesh...
--Eri's right over there...

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.440
I can't let a guy like this take me down!

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.730
What's your Quirk?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.900
Permeation. When activated,
I can slip through anything!

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.160
I didn't mean to say that!

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.410
I was wondering where you sprung up from.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.950
I see. That's why you could get
through Mimic and the others.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.250
You misshed? What're you, drunk?

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.670
That would be you.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.840
Me?

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.550
You should just be quiet
and support the extraordinary me.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:45.730
"Shin Nemoto - Quirk: Confession"

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.130
From the Eight Bullets of
the Hassai Group, Shin Nemoto!

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.180
Quirk: Confession!

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.350
He can force people to tell
the truth if he asks them a question.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.520
Occasionally, he can even drag out truths
the person talking doesn't know about!

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:53.070
"Deidoro Sakaki - Quirk: Sloshed"

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.060
Also from the Eight Bullets of
the Hassai Group, Deidoro Sakaki!

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.360
Quirk: Sloshed!

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.440
He makes those around him
lose their sense of equilibrium.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.200
I see. You forced me to talk, huh?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.410
But you're not the type
to stand in the front lines.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.950
Hence, I am different from
the other dispensable pawns.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.870
In the Hassai Group, I'm the only one

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.500
who's been allowed to get
close to the young boss' ambition.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.970
How can it be called ambition
if he's using his own daughter?!

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.550
Hm?

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.720
Oh, in order for things to proceed smoothly,
emotions are unnecessary.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.180
I'm sure that's something you understand well.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:34.110
When you first encountered Eri,
you let it go once because of that, right?

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.820
That's right.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.530
And then you probably guessed
what our plan was and regretted it.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.950
Rescue Eri?

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:49.250
You just want to use her as a cover
to make yourself feel better, right?

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.920
His body is already swaying.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.840
All that's left is his heart.
Hearts are the same as brains.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.800
Just shake it up a little,
and he'll stop in his tracks.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.840
I live for the young boss' ambition!

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.010
He needs me!

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.350
I must follow him!

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.470
We'll walk together!

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.100
We'll share the joy when it's realized!

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.520
--Now!
--Now!

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.020
Die, nuisance!

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.530
Ultimate move...

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.910
...Phantom Threat!

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.950
"Phantom Threat!!"

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.160
That's right...

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.160
I'm weak...

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.710
I knew that I was being made to carry
the burden of some repulsive karma.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.300
I spoke and acted cruelly in front of that girl.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.590
Even so, rather than see us get hurt,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.510
she chose to return to that hell!

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.260
Such a kind girl--

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.350
That's why I chased after her.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.230
And why I'm here now!

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.770
No way! How can you still move?

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.940
I get a taste of something much
worse than intoxication all the time!

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.900
Even if you discover a truth
about yourself you didn't know...

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.910
I won't waver!

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.410
For that girl to keep not being able to smile...

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.870
I definitely...

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.540
...can't allow that!

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.380
Power...!

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.890
Chisaki...!

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.310
Why...?

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.480
You can't be here...

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.860
He'll kill you!

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.410
I will never make you sad anymore.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.450
It's fine!

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.410
I will become your hero!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
"Lemillion"

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.010
"Mirio Togata"
"Quirk: Permeation"
"His body can pass through anything. When he uses it, even his breaths pass through him."

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.010
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Course 3rd Year"
"Birthday: 7-15"
"Height: 181 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: Ramen, Comedy"

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.220
I will become your hero!

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.850
How filthy...

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.810
Come back, Eri.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:16.940
Killed?

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.400
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.280
You break people.
That's how you were born.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.820
No... You shouldn't...

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.200
You don't have to listen to him.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.280
Aren't I always telling you?

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.450
I have to get my hands dirty
because of your selfishness.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.040
Each and every action you take kills people.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.170
You're cursed.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.300
How can you say that to your own child?!

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.640
Huh? Oh, I see. That's the story I told you...

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.140
I don't have any children.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.480
Chisaki's Quirk is Overhaul.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.690
His power lets him
disassemble and restore things.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.490
This isn't just restoring...

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.570
What amazing speed!

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.030
That was close!

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.200
But this guy...

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.160
He didn't care that she was here.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.290
Yeah, it wouldn't have been
an impediment even if she broke.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.880
If I put her back right away, I can revive her.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.880
Even if she didn't keep her shape,
I could put her back the way she was.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.220
She should already know that firsthand.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.100
What'll you do if Eri gets injured?

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.730
Under these conditions,
I'm the only one who can heal her.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.770
I've sealed off your escape.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.780
You won't be able to run away
using Permeation if you're holding Eri.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.700
Are you going to fight me? Mr. Student.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.790
I thought I knocked him out,
but was my center off?

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.500
Is that drunk's Quirk still in effect?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.750
Blockhead, aim for the arm carrying Eri.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.550
I didn't think he'd be
using his Quirk so precisely.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.720
He must have trained very hard.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.510
Break the spikes to eliminate his screen.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.350
If he's shooting with his gun,
then the spikes won't come!

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.180
Sorry about this.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.520
I can't see his face,
but based on what he's doing,

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.400
I'd say it's the assistant
to the young head, Kurono.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.240
I definitely don't want to be on the
receiving end of the Quirk he had listed!

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.370
He hid his body to make me miss!

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.370
I thought a hero's cape
was just them trying to look cool.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:38.910
Chrono!

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.630
Sorry, Overhaul!

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.630
He's strong.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.760
But he put Eri down!

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.180
If I break that,
then he won't be able to resist!

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.300
That's the kind of guy you are, right?

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.140
A hero puts on his cape

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.900
so he can use it to wrap up a
hurting girl who's suffering and in pain!

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.940
Look carefully at your opponent!

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.320
Predict his next move!

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.650
Chisaki!

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.280
He's so agile, it'd hard
to believe he's merely a yakuza!

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.580
You're strong.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.950
But...

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.290
...I'm...

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.710
...stronger!

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.920
I will never make you sad anymore.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.090
I will become your hero!

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.260
I won't let you lay another finger on her!

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.430
I'll take you both down at once!

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.470
You've lost, Chisaki!

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.640
Don't use my name so casually.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.520
I've already...

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.230
...thrown that name away!

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.060
Boy...

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.480
If you have nowhere else to go, come with me.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.110
What's your name? Can you talk?

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.660
Chisaki... Kai Chisaki...

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.370
The Todo gang just got disbanded.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.330
We just keep getting more
and more restricted.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.380
At this rate, it's only a matter of time for us.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.590
We need to be more innovative.

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:13.470
What about the plan I told you
about before. Have you given--

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.340
You're still saying that even after
getting shut down so many times?

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.270
If you turn away from the path of a human,
that's the end of your chivalry, Chisaki.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.230
No one's going to follow
a demon with no heart.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.400
Master!

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.230
Wh--? I thought I knocked him out completely!

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.320
Nemoto! Shoot!

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.780
Join me.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.080
It'll be reassuring to have you with me.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.830
Those were his true feelings.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.660
Master needs me.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.370
I must give my life...

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.630
...and walk by his side.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:51.630
Where should I shoot?

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.130
At the one who uses Permeation!

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.510
I only have one bullet!

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.640
How can I keep him from using his Quirk...?

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.390
For that girl to keep not
being able to smile...

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.010
I definitely...

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.350
...can't allow that!

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.850
Those were his true feelings!

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.360
You bore it like that this whole time, right?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.280
Thinking you had no choice
but to accept the despair...

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.660
That help would never come...

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.580
She should already know that firsthand.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.500
I won't make you sad anymore.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.880
I won't...

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.090
...let you suffer anymore!

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.990
I'll become a hero and save people, too!

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.820
Mirio.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.240
With our Quirks, if you take one
wrong step, you could be split in two.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.410
What?!

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.000
It's a really hard Quirk to use.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.120
That's why I gave up on being a hero.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.460
Knowing that, do you still want to be a hero?

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.840
I'll do my best!

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.220
Then, I'll support you with everything I've got!

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.680
"Cape"

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.680
"The Mistake"

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.180
Do your best, Mirio.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.430
Do your best.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.190
The diseased...

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.070
...have been given Quirks,
and that lets them dream.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.820
Thinking you can actually become something

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.540
--is an illness of the mind.
--M-Master... I did it...

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.700
It's funny!

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.370
With the power of that girl
you've come here to save,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.960
everything you've worked to cultivate...

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.130
...has now gone to waste!

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.090
Look carefully at your opponent!

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.640
Predict his next move!

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.680
Everything I've done up
until now has not gone to waste!

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.520
I'm still Lemillion!

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.110
I can't believe it.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.530
Sakaki's Quirk should still be in effect.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.860
He should've lost his Quirk
that made him seem invincible.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.240
He should have the shackles
of not being able to hurt Eri!

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.040
What...

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.950
What is he?!

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.890
I'll do my best!

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.580
I'll become a hero and save people!

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.590
Did you want to become a hero that badly?

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.430
To save Eri that badly, Lemillion?

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.560
It's all a filthy disease of our time.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.730
I'll fix guys like you.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.730
With Eri's power.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.690
Nighteye...

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.690
Tamaki...

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.330
Everyone!

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.860
--Chisaki!

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.240
--I thought I told you I threw that name away!
--Chisaki!

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.880
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.530
Togata protected Eri until the end.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.670
No matter how much they hurt him...

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.330
No matter that they took away his Quirk...

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.220
Now, it's my turn.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.220
But Chisaki is furious that
Eri has been taken from him

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.930
and unleashes his Quirk,
switching to counterattacking.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.740
Next time, "Unforeseen Hope."

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.850
Nighteye said he can't see the future...

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.070
Eri and my futures are...!

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.620
"Next time: Unforeseen Hope"

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.110
Go beyond!

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.590
Plus Ultra!
