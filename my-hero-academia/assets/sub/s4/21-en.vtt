WEBVTT

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.310
Tomorrow's finally...

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.940
...the school festival!

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.150
The gym's closing soon!

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.610
Let's do a final check and one last run-through!

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.900
Here we go!

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.780
Tap, tap, two! Tap, tap, two!

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.280
Up!

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.040
Then, Aoyama, center.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.580
Midoriya, run offstage.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.910
--Oui.
--Roger!

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.790
Midoriya! Your movements
are still too half-hearted.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.380
Focus your attention on the moves!

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.790
Roger!

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.630
Before we started,
I was worried we'd seem amateurish,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.590
but the band and dance teams are
both better than amateur level, huh?

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.100
Ashido is an unexpectedly mean coach, too.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.350
Yeah.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.140
Because she likes dancing,
she can be really serious about it, huh?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.150
Let's kill everyone in U.A. with our sound!

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.110
The band team weren't the only ones
who got stirred up by those words.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.070
I am getting nervous.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.070
Don't improvise weird stuff
during the actual performance.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.570
It'll confuse some people.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.370
Those words hurt!

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.450
Kaminari, it's not just you.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.210
And then Midoriya, go straight
to the ceiling from the wings

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.250
and set Aoyama up,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.090
pulling him up with the rope.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.510
That's it, that looks good!

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.720
It's already! Nine o'clock!

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.470
Students should only be here till nine!

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.720
Shoot, let's go home.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.850
And with this,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.480
after we go to sleep and wake up again,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480
the school festival will start at 9 a.m.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.330
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.870
Woo, I can't sleep!

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.540
I'm at max excitement!

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.200
Quiet down! Some people are sleeping!

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.460
I wonder if everyone will get excited with us...

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.540
It's better to not think about stuff like that.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.010
Getting embarrassed or nervous is the worst.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.220
Once you get on stage,
all that's left is to have fun!

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.560
You were super embarrassed, though!

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.680
After being told all that...

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.310
...to not do it...

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.650
...wouldn't be rockin' at all, would it?

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.070
That was different.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.320
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.190
What Jiro said works for a lot of things, huh?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.360
Oui.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.370
When you think of others,
it ends up helping you, too.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.040
I see.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.620
The rope's frayed.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.250
Wow! We did abuse it
quite a bit during practice.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.460
It's proof of our friendship!

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.750
Yeah... Wait, no, it's dangerous.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.250
Sorry I didn't realize...

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.050
Oh my, why don't you ask
Yaoyorozu to make you one?

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.680
Yao-momo's already sleeping!

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.640
Don't treat her like a handy tool!

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.520
But people use me as a charger.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.940
This is what it means to look down on men.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.270
I'll go buy new rope
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.360
I'm the one who didn't realize it was frayed.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360
I've got morning practice anyway,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.570
and there are some
other things I want to buy, too.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.490
Wait, but the performance
starts at ten tomorrow.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.570
Most stores don't open till nine, right?

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.620
There's a hardware store
about 15 minutes from U.A.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.700
That place opens at 8 a.m.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.160
That's cutting it pretty close.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.880
Now, I really should be getting to sleep.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.790
Yes.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.670
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.880
Well, then, we'll probably
do this again tomorrow, but--

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.590
Night owls! We're a little early, but...

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.010
...let's definitely make this a success!

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.140
Yeah!

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.600
"Deku vs. Gentle Criminal"

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.150
And then, on the day
of the school festival...

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.110
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.320
Continuous Full Cowling at 8%...

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.780
...and then switch to 20%
just at the moment of impact.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.200
"Mei Hatsume - Quirk: Zoom"

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.610
I knew you'd be here, Midoriya!

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.370
Hatsume, you're so dirty!

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.120
It's the dark circles and grime.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.330
I thought you'd be here
even on the day of the festival.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.340
I got the items you asked for to work,
so I came to give them to you.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.250
Wow, they're so cool!

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.300
Thanks! You could've waited
until after the school festival, though.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.130
When it's over, I'm going to sleep for 36 hours!

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.260
Can I take a look?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.550
Sure, here.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.060
...even an item made for
20-30% of my power was bulky.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.190
They can be made so compact now!

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.730
I also made sure the design went
with the rest of your costume!

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.410
A good designer can
satisfy the client in one go!

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.950
I'm so happy. Thanks so much!

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.200
With this, I can do what
I've been wanting to do.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.370
Here's the manual! See ya!

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.670
Thanks, Hatsume!

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.170
Let's hurry up and test this.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.340
Yes, sir!

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.760
Oh, shoot!

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.930
It took time to get used to it,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.220
so I ended up practicing
until I was almost out of time!

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.060
I thought they'd sell it
at the convenience store,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.770
but I guess there are places
that don't have it, too...

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.150
I've used up a lot of time. I need to hurry!

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.200
I was able to buy the rope, too.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.990
I need to get back soon.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.290
--Whoops!
--Wha--

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.500
Excuse me!

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.870
Please be careful.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.420
You were about to ruin the
aftertaste of the Gold Tips Imperial.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.760
Th-That surprised me...!

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.600
"Villain - Gentle Criminal"

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.680
Oh, dear!

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.550
I can't believe I just did that!

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.890
I must avoid contact
with others as much as possible!

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.720
Come, let us go, L--Honey...

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.640
Honey?!

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.100
Yes, I'm Honey!

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.310
Gold Tips...

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.860
Oh, Yaoyorozu made some for us...

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.860
Oh? That house--

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.110
Is it a café or something?

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.280
You can't tell.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.570
Gentle?!

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.910
If you did not know what Gold Tips Imperial was,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.830
then you would not have thought that...

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.000
Are you... someone who understands?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.460
It's wonderful, even though you're so young!

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.380
Um... I don't know that much...

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.720
I just know because
my friend made some for us...

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.600
I feel like I've heard this voice before.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.020
Oh-ho, you have such a high-class friend...

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.770
A high-class friend?!

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.730
An elite school...!

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.440
You have... a good friend...

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.940
Oh, no.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.280
Yes, I've been blessed...

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.490
Wait a minute.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.530
That is a wonderful thing.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.950
This child is from U.A....!

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.330
This voice... Tea...!

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.880
She said it's an elusive tea that's hard to get.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.590
Really?

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.840
Thanks, Yaoyorozu!

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.430
Before and after a job,

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.680
I always choose the brand
based on the size of the job.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.810
In the next video I put out,

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:25.230
an alarm will sound, not just to
my dear listeners, but to all of society.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.230
Now, if you will excuse me--

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.110
No way...

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.030
I got excited by the tea...

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.030
I can't believe I did that!

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.570
Before he realizes...

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.990
Please wait.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.790
Is this like a ritual for you?

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.710
"Villain - La Brava"

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.750
Don't blame yourself, Gentle!

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.250
It couldn't be helped!

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.380
But...

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.130
...it's too late.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.760
And if the alarm sounds,
even if it's a false alarm,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.560
we had to agree to cancel it and
evacuate, otherwise we can't have it.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.690
Ritual? What are you talking about?

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.560
I saw your video.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.770
Just...

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.150
La Brava, start filming.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.570
...stop it already.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.200
"Schooent!"

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.290
...there are a lot of different
people working hard,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.290
so I wonder how it'll turn out...

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.130
Please, stop...

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.090
Don't make a move on my school!

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.970
"Tenya Iida"
"Quirk: Engine"
"He can run very fast using the engines in his calves."

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.970
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 8/22"
"Height: 179 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Beef Stew"

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.980
"Momo Yaoyorozu"
"Quirk: Creation"
"She can create any non-living thing from her body."

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 9/23"
"Height: 173 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Reading"

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.900
Don't make a move on my school!

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.570
You're a very perceptive boy.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.150
I think this boy is...

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.030
Saturday morning, no people around...!

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.030
There are almost no hero agencies near U.A.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.910
I can't expect any backup...!

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.330
I should ask someone
at the store to call the police--

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.330
No...!

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.420
La Brava, there's a been a change of plan.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.420
From this moment on, no matter
what happens, don't stop the camera!

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.260
Of course, Gentle!

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.130
But, but! Are you going to fight? Here?

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.930
Do you think that's a good idea?

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:26.350
Dear listeners! The grand adventure of
a man of extraordinary talent is starting.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.940
Don't be so dazzled you look away--

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.190
I am the gentleman thief
who will save the world,

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.070
Gentle Criminal!

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.030
My plans have shifted.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.160
In this current predicament, I'll keep it brief.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
This time...

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.450
I tried going into U.A.!

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.420
That's so unsophisticated!

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.630
I won't let you do that!

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.220
I put this up as I took off my overcoat!

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.720
If you've watched my videos,
then you should already know...

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.430
My Quirk is Elasticity.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.520
I bestow elasticity to the things I touch.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.980
Even if it's air...!

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.480
Gently Rebound!

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.820
I don't like resolving things through violence.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.030
You're acting so violent
it's almost nasty, Gentle.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.080
I am also in the midst of surprise
and confusion right now, La Brava.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.750
That is, this speed and power is startling

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.250
and unexpected from his appearance.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.210
I'm sorry, young man! I will overcome!

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.170
If you're going to apologize,
then don't attack my school!

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.590
That is not something I can do!

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.010
Gently...

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.640
...Trampoline!

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.350
When I was a student, I, too,
worked hard to put on events.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.690
I'm sure you have feelings invested in this, too,

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.360
but they can't win against
my mustache and my soul!

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.110
This scheme is a big step toward
my becoming a legend.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.910
Please don't get in my way!

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.830
Farewell, glimmer of youth!

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.330
Gentle, I remember now!

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.790
That boy is Izuku Midoriya!

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.330
He broke his arms as
he fought in the sports festival.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.000
He's a crazy boy!

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.380
Insanity! I'd better not get involved!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.260
Before he finishes warming up,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.840
we will carry out the plan!

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.220
Dear listeners!

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.180
"I tried going into U.A." will now switch
to being a race against the clock!

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.020
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.110
Sorry, our break's almost over, so I'm heading off.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.190
Okay! Just so you know,
I'm looking forward to it, too!

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.280
"Eri"

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.490
Deku, you're leaving already?

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.410
Sorry, I have to practice.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:53.210
On the day of, once Midoriya's done,
the three of us can walk around together!

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.170
Deku... Lemillion...

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.460
I'm getting excited.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.090
I'm sure you have feelings invested in this, too,

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.640
but they can't win against
my mustache and my soul!

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.350
Midoriya, you sometimes write
a lot all at once in your notebook,

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.020
but what's it look like in there?

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.480
Is there a hero you want to know more about, Jiro?

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.650
No, I wanted to see how
you organized your notes--

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.320
I want to make it easier
to see important points in my notes,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.280
but there's too much to write,
so I can't organize them.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.070
Advice for the band members?!

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.410
You wrote all this?

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.200
Wow!

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.000
This makes me happy!

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.370
I hope the others feel the same.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.290
You know, since I thought people
would think it was a useless hobby...

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.460
I kind of got over enthusiastic

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.380
and wrote too much.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.010
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.220
Tokoyami!

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.350
I told you to make your notes
more distinct, bird head!

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.100
You think you can destroy U.A.'s ears
with those damn weak riffs?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.520
Huh?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.600
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.190
What does that mean?

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.770
Tokoyama, it's in lesson 3.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.360
"Advice!!
For Tokoyami"

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.820
Gentle Criminal!

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.120
I have to stop him!

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.120
It's still hard for you to shoot
consecutively or while you're moving, huh?

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.160
I need to land.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.250
Calm down! I'll mess up if I panic.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.420
I have to stop him.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.880
I need to land... Both are...

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.920
No! Midoriya, how many times
do I have to tell you?

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.760
As you move,
focus your attention for an instant!

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.430
You want to be able to direct wind pressure?

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.470
Yeah.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:38.230
For example, in an urban area,
it'd destroy a lot of surrounding structures...

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.110
It's better if I have more options...

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.900
...of course!

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.280
Delaware Smash...

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.610
Air Force!

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.990
A... An air cannon?!

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.280
All right!

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.830
But it's not good enough to stop me!

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.210
I...! Will not...! Be discouraged!

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.590
We're all invested in this!

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.670
My apologies then!

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.260
Gentle!

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.760
I smell trouble...

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.430
Don't worry about it, Mister!

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.640
We are just filming something here!

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.270
Do you think you can tell your neighbors?

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.570
A trick like this will barely buy us any time!

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.320
Gentle!

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.400
It's hard, but the plan is already in tatters!

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.110
You should retreat--

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.620
Thank you, Hatsume!

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.580
I see. Currently, it shoots
forward across a wide range, right?

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.830
I'm not sure how much it'll help,

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.790
but with one of my babies,
you should be able to fire them like shots!

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.840
You've been practicing finger flicks,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:53.090
but someday, with your iron soles,
it can strengthen your Shoot Style!

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.140
That's it! You did it!

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.350
Thank you, Ashido!

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.650
This was thanks to my extra dance practice!

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.520
Where is he?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.240
This is certainly...

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.570
...an unexpected situation.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.160
However, I will not lose my composure!

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.450
How can you still be like that?!

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.410
I will definitely make my plan succeed!

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.830
I have the resolve to do it!

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.540
A gentleman does not lose his composure.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.290
Resolve...

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.380
He's showing no sign of giving up...

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.760
--That's right! I am Gentle Criminal!

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.550
--You're no gentleman!
--That's right! I am Gentle Criminal!

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.300
You're planning to do something to U.A., right?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.100
What are you planning?

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.890
What am I planning?

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.020
What channel? When'll it be on?

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:52.030
Please, don't lump me with those people
from the League of Villains.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.530
Gentle! My beloved Gentle!

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.450
I am not trying to kidnap or stab anyone.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:05.210
All I want is to sneak into
your school festival. That's all.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.040
Please!

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.630
Don't lose!

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.170
Let me go, young man.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.880
He's pleading for his life!

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.090
You know that we're
on emergency alert, don't you?!

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.640
Even before you sneak in,
if someone like you is found,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.850
the alarm will sound!

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.690
The school festival will be cancelled,
and you'll have nowhere to run!

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.900
Just give up!

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.360
Oh-ho, in that case, it'll be fine.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.820
My partner has devised a way
to disable the alarm sensors.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.030
It won't be cancelled.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.700
Our plan can succeed.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.200
It's a win-win situation!

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.660
That's an even bigger problem!

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.580
That's true.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.790
His argument's being refuted!

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.670
But yes, that is my plan!

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:53.260
Before it becomes too troublesome,
I would like to continue on my way.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.050
I've already called the police!

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.180
I'll keep you here until they
and the heroes arrive!

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.720
Please, give up with this bluff!

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.310
We'll never agree.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.390
While the aftertaste of the tea remains,

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.100
I'll have you go to sleep, U.A. student!

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.320
Predict the opponent's movements, and...

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.610
I can't...

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.030
...predict them!

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.460
What's going on?

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.130
Over there, he...

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.250
If they're air bullets,
then I'll return them with air membranes.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.720
Gentle, it's sad, but you should retreat--

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.810
No, La Brava.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.480
Not yet.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.810
I need to catch him!

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.440
Whoops!

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.650
You must listen to what I say.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.940
I cannot cancel the effects of
my Quirk of my own volition.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.410
Things return to their original state gradually.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:05.660
Steel beams regaining their firmness
while still keeping some unnatural bounce--

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.540
And the one I'm standing on
with all its bolts removed.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.920
At this rate, the steel beam will fall.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.920
It is quite dangerous.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.550
Looks like something shaking.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.810
You are a student of U.A.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.390
There's no way...

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.100
...you can ignore a steel beam falling.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.860
You were trying to drop it on the person below?!

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.830
No. I just wanted to pull you in.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.410
I was always planning on
making it bounce back so it wouldn't fall.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.750
Scary, scary.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.000
This must be the climax scene!

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.540
I thought you'd head toward the bottom,

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.340
but I see you really do have
frightening speed and power.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.510
It pains me to say this,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.140
but please stay there and bear it patiently.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:11.140
I'm sure someone will notice
by the time I finish filming.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.650
Grab on, La Brava.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.980
That's harsh, Gentle! Playing dirty!

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.610
My partner has devised a way
to disable the alarm sensors.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.120
I'll sneak into the school festival.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.790
No, don't let him go!

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.670
It's almost time!
I'm getting nervous!

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.250
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.960
"nervous"  "nervous"

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.920
Clear and serene...

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.040
Calm down, Kaminari.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.840
"nervous"  "nervous"
"nervous"

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.550
Clear and serene...

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.050
Anyway, Bakugo, put on your T-shirt.
Since we had them made and all.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.970
The dance outfits are perfect, too!

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.220
We just modified some
ready-made clothes, though.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.930
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.060
It's gotten pretty wrinkled.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.140
Doesn't matter, as long as it's sexy!

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.690
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.770
Midoriya's not here.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.230
He went to go buy rope.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.230
It's so late, though. What's he still doing?

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.310
That's true.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.190
Our plans have changed, La Brava,

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.240
but if they're on their guard
and I still manage to sneak in,

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.910
then I will become even more well-known!

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.740
As a man who accomplished a great feat!

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.260
He's tenacious!

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.560
Neither you nor that boy will give up, huh?

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.230
Let's use it--

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.860
My Quirk.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.950
"69 minutes until the performance"

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.000
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.630
The instant Gentle Criminal sneaks into U.A.,

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.420
the school festival will be cancelled.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.430
For everyone's sake, and for Eri,

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.890
I need to stop him!

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.350
It's time to use that, Izuku Midoriya.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.270
What you learned from training with All Might--

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.270
Next time, "School Festival Start!!"

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.820
The Love of Gentle's partner,
La Brava, won't stop!

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.320
Go beyond!

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.600
"Next time: School Festival Start!!"

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.430
Plus Ultra!
