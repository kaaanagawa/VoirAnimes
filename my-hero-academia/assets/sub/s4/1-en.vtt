00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.140
Even if I don't have a Quirk,
can I become a hero?

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.110
You can become a hero.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.200
My Quirk is the power to transfer power...

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.280
Crowned with the name, "One For All"!

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.990
One person cultivates the power

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.830
and passes it on to another person,
who also cultivates it and passes it on.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.750
It is the crystallization of power that spins
together the voices of those who need help

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.010
with a courageous heart.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.800
And next, it is your turn.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.020
About 80% of the world's population

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.270
is born with some kind of special trait,
a Quirk, in this superhuman society.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
"Quirk"

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.110
To fight against villains using
their Quirks to commit crimes,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.110
"Villains"              "Enemies"

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.650
the profession of "hero" was created.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.850
I, Izuku Midoriya, dreamed of becoming a hero

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.730
and enrolled in the
prestigious U.A. High School

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.940
as I continue to run toward my dream.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.300
With my friends who are
working toward the same goal,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.680
we stand up to any difficulties
and save people with a smile...

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.980
...in order to become the greatest heroes!

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.560
That's right, this is...

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.690
...my hero academia!

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.410
It's weak!

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.710
That's because my back wasn't in it!

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.710
United States of...

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.300
...Smash!

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.010
The villain has stopped moving!

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.470
--Victory for All Might!

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.050
--All Might...!
--Victory for All Might!

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.300
He's standing in victory!

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.930
I can't believe this is his last fight...

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.980
Don't just stare at that.
Get your files together!

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.730
Yes, ma'am!

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.770
"Juko News"

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.310
Hero name: All Might.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.440
He became partners
with the genius, David Shield,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.240
and came into the limelight
at the world level.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.990
After returning to Japan,
he started his own agency,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.160
and as the immovable
number one hero and Symbol of Peace--

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.990
No, no!

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.080
No one'll buy our newspaper
with a bland article like that!

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.130
We need a scoop the likes of
which have never been seen before!

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.340
We're already the last ones to put out
a special issue on All Might's retirement...

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.760
"Company A" "Company O" "Company S"

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.130
All of All Might's
acquaintances are tight-lipped...

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.430
It's your job to do something about that.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.180
What do you have on the
last villain All Might fought?

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.640
The police are treating that
as super top-secret information.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.400
All I know is that he's the mastermind
behind the League of Villains--

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.980
You can't just wait for stories to fall
into your lap! You have to go after them!

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.030
Oh, dear...

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.110
The editor-in-chief doesn't
look good when she's mad.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.490
You're so pretty, it's a waste.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.490
"Freelance Journalist
Taneo Tokuda"

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.410
Oh, Tane! Long time no see.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.830
Editor-in-Chief...

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.910
I've got a good story...

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.340
Next, it's your turn.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.510
What do you think these words mean?

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.590
I defeated the mastermind. You're next.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.010
In other words,
it's a warning to other villains, right?

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.350
Don't you think the way he said
it was too nice for it to be that?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.560
"I'll get you bastards next!"

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.230
He could've said something like that.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.610
What are you trying to say?

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.280
Four months ago,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.610
when All Might suddenly
became a teacher at U.A. High School,

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.410
he was nearing his limit as a hero.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.830
And the message he left was
"Next, it's your turn."

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.120
Does that mean...?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.410
That's right.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.790
All Might is looking for someone
in the next generation to take his place

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.630
among the students at U.A.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.670
No, looking at his last words,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.300
he's already decided on who that is.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.020
And you already have an
idea of who that is, don't you?

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.900
At first, I thought it'd be one of
U.A.'s Big Three, the third year, Togata.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.150
He also regularly visits the agency run
by Sir Nighteye, All Might's former sidekick.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.740
It could totally be him!

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.490
However, it appears All Might
and Sir Nighteye have parted ways.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.410
And I haven't had any information
saying the two have contacted each other.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.080
Could it be camouflage?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.340
It's possible, but I'm thinking
along different lines.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.300
I've heard that All Might is putting in
extra work teaching those in Class 1-A at U.A.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.720
Class 1-A...
All Might's successor is among them...?

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.140
I believe that's the case.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:23.980
But U.A. has increased security after being
attacked twice by the League of Villains.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.700
A freelance journalist like me would have
a very hard time getting permission to--

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.860
Very well.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.120
We'll do something about it on our end.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.790
However--

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.330
Of course, I will only provide
the scoop to your paper.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.210
Please buy it for a lot.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.420
"The Scoop on U.A. Class 1-A"

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.170
A newspaper?

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.760
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.180
Yeah. A newspaper wants
to do a feature on you all.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.640
Isn't that amazing, Deku?

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.220
Y-Yeah...

Sh-She's so close...!

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.350
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.520
Why?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.560
The sports festival was
broadcast around the country, right?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.440
Mina, we'll be in the paper!
We've gotta look our best!

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.650
Yeah!

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.650
You don't have to do
much, though, Hagakure...

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.240
Don't get too excited.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.200
The article is supposed to be about

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.740
how you students are doing
in the dorms you just moved into.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.830
The principal thought it would be
good for your parents and guardians

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.620
to see you all living happily in the dorms,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.040
--so he gave special
permission. That's why...

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.590
--Do you think the reporter'll be a woman?
A woman newscaster?
--so he gave special permission. That's why...

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.340
A female news announcer?

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.090
He said it was for a newspaper.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.510
"Pant..."
"female announcer"

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.470
If you think about it, "announcer" sounds like
"bouncer," which sounds like "bouncy boo--"

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.220
So you better not do anything like that.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.730
You don't have to be like that, Mr. Aizawa.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.520
I want to report on the U.A. students
in their natural state in the dorms.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.570
Mr. Tokuda, I didn't say
you could come in yet--

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.820
I was told I could be here
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.780
It's already time.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.790
Hello, everyone. I'm Tokuda, a reporter.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.660

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.460
Nice to meet you!

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.420
You don't have to do anything special.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:11.470
Please just show the camera
how you normally live.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.930
I might ask you questions occasionally,
so I'll be counting on you then.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.850
Oh, he's so delightful and handsome!

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.720
Not a woman, huh?

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.230
What to do?

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.480
I'm always sparkling, so I can't help
but be a wonderful subject for pictures.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.690
You're amazing, Aoyama.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.690
I'm sure you've already
heard from the principal,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.450
but please do not interfere
with my reporting.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.200
--I want--
--I understand.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.240
If you need anything, please let me know.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.830
I won't need anything.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:46.380
Everyone in Class 1-A is a promising candidate
to become a hero in the future, right?

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.500
Iida, if there's a problem,
let me know immediately.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.130

Yes, sir!

As the class representative for Class 1-A,
I, Tenya Iida, will carry out my duty--

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.220
Okay, then, um...

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.850

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:01.930
Having breakfast!

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.020
You don't have to be so nervous.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.230
Just pretend I'm not here...

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.730
This reporter is up to something,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.270
but it doesn't smell criminal.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.530

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.010
Number 17, Katsuki Bakugo.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.020
His Quirk lets him make the sweat
on the palms of his hands explode.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.980
Number 18, Izuku Midoriya.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.400
His Quirk lets him
increase his physical abilities.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.860
Number 19, Minoru Mineta.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.160
His Quirk lets him stick to anything.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.540
Number 20, Momo Yaoyorozu.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.250
Her Quirk lets her create
things with her body.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.180
There are 20 students in Class 1-A.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.800
I got permission for you to go talk to them,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.760
but how are you planning
to discover who the successor is?

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.980
I can narrow it down if I think about
who All Might would've considered.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.730
For example, the six students from
Class 1-A in the sports festival finals.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.980
I'll try looking at them first.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.240
I said that,

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.360
but I already had someone
in mind from the start.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.950
It was a simple process of elimination.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.620
Katsuki Bakugo's abilities are
on par with those of pro heroes,

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.330
but in middle school, he declared
that he would surpass All Might,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.000
so it's hard to imagine him
as All Might's successor.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.920
The runner-up at the sports festival,
Shoto Todoroki, can also be eliminated.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.010
After all, his father is
the number two hero, Endeavor.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.310
It's hard to think he would let
his son be All Might's successor.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.430
Check, with the rook.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.810
The only ones left then are the third place
Fumikage Tokoyami or Tenya Iida,

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.940
or Eijiro Kirishima...

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.280
No...

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.530
My instinct, which has gotten me
many scoops, is telling me...

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.530
It's Izuku Midoriya...

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.290
Hey.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.080
All Might!

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.920
He's the one who will be the next All Might...
the next Symbol of Peace.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.010
"Izuku Midoriya"
"Quirk: One For All"
"Smashes villains with a super power passed down from one generation to the next."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.010
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
" Birthday: 7/15"
"Height: 166 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Pork Cutlet Bowl"

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.010
"All Might (True Form)"
"Quirk: One For All"
"Smashes villains with a super power passed down from one generation to the next."

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.010
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Course Teacher"
"Birthday: 6/10"
"Height: 220 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Yakushima Cedar"

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.390
What's up, All Might?

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.560
Actually, I was just at the
hospital for a regular check up,

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.610
and since I'd been there since morning,
I was a little hungry.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.230
So...

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.730
"Our All Might"

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.940
All Might...!

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.400
You've helped me so much!

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.280
As a citizen of this country,
please let me thank you!

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.450
You want meat buns, right?

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.740
Here, take them all! They're good!

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.950
It's raining, so take this umbrella, too!

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.910
It'll block the rain!

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.450
Wow!

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.830
So I brought these to share with the class.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.750
As expected of All Might...

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.210
You're so popular.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.930
It's only natural, though.
You're the number one hero.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.970
Protecting the people this whole time,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.510
fighting against evil villains,

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:38.480
you were the Symbol of Peace who
brought courage and smiles to so many...

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.310
Next, it's your turn--

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.190
No, it's all of your turns.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.700
Right.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.610
I'll train you hard again
starting tomorrow, okay?

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.370
Please do!

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.540
You're working hard.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.330
Training on your own before dinner, too?

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.380
Huh? Um, yes...

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.760
Something smells good.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.720
They're meat buns... Would you like one?

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.090
Yes, please.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.600
Oh? You're a fan of
All Might's, too, Mr. Tokuda?

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.770
Anyone in my generation who said
he wasn't a fan of All Might's is bogus.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.980
He was so cool he was blinding to look at,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.610
and so powerful.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.070
I wonder if you remember the bombing
18 years ago at an industrial complex...

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.620
Of course I know about it!

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:40.370
All 24 of the people working there at
the time were saved by All Might, right?

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.340
My father was among them, you know.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.180
It was a terrible catastrophe
where even the rescue squads hesitated.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.760
Even so...

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760
It's fine now.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.640
Why?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.770
Because I am here.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.650
Dad!

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.150
I turned my camera on it without thinking.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.820
"All Might Saves People from Flames"
"Police Hurry to Find the Cause"
"All Might carrying a victim (reader-submitted photograph)"

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.280
The picture I took then was in the paper.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.160
It wasn't just that someone
from my family had been rescued.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.200
It also brought light into my own life.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.200
I can't thank him enough.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.040
Is... that right...?

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.840
That's why I was really
shocked by All Might's retirement.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.470
What will happen to the superhuman society
now that it's lost its Symbol of Peace?

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.640
That's right, there's this vague unease...

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.890
But that unease is slowly
starting to seep into society.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.980
This person's uneasy, too...

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.440
I have to work harder...

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.480
After inheriting
One For All from All Might...

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.570
Midoriya.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.650
Yes?

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.950
There is hope.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.700
Huh?

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.740
Next, it's your turn.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.000
What, a picture?
But you don't have a camera.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
You even printed it out?!

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.040
I thought my Quirk was only good
for taking snapshots on vacation.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.510
A camera lens...?

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.180
I can produce them anywhere.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.310
Freelance journalist, Taneo Tokuda.
Quirk: Whole-Body Lens.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.890
He can produce lenses anywhere
on his body to take pictures.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.060
He can even print them out from his chest!

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.980
With this, he can get
as many scoops as he wants!

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.400
All Might's last words
after the Kamino incident...

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.570
Next, it's your turn.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.580
As I thought, he was saying them to you.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.160
As I investigated,
I found a lot of similarities.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.960
How the Quirk you manifested
was a power type.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.300
How you tried to rescue Bakugo in
middle school when he was taken by a villain.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.470
How All Might was the one
who saved you both back then.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.510
How you enrolled in U.A. at the same
time All Might became a teacher here.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.310
I went to the Pussycats' agency, too.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.060
And I met Kota.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.480
Kota?

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.150
There, my guess was confirmed...

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:15.610
That you were All Might's successor.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.070
What do you think about my deductions?

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.490
Huh? Um... uh, that's...

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.740
You can't lie, huh?

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.200
I like that.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.250
You're acting very much like a hero.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.840
Everyone, it's about time for dinner.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.880
Gather quickly, everyone!

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.840
Let's go, Ochaco.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.720
I wonder if Deku's still training...

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.060
I wonder what they're talking about...

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.980
U-Um, I...

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.190
You don't have to worry.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.690
I don't plan on writing an article
based on a guess with no evidence.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.150
I'm the one at fault for coming here
under false pretenses

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.160
saying I'm writing an article
about the dorm life of U.A. students.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.200
I'm sorry about that.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.080
But I just had to know...

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.750
...that hope was not lost.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.120
Mr. Tokuda...

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.710
With this, I don't have to give false
encouragement to those who are uneasy.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:21.470
I can proudly report that even
if All Might retires, there is still hope.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.760
I'm sorry I made you feel bad.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.760
But...

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.850
Thanks.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.560
It's no problem.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.060
Also...

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.440
Huh?!

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.030
Wh-What was that?!

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:45.910
I'm going to cherish this picture
and keep it inside my body.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.290
Until I publish my book about you...

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.040
As for its title, I think I'll call it...

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.750
"When the New Symbol of Peace Was Young."

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.380
What do you think?

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.590
I'll give my all to make that true.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.340
Do your best, hero.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.760
I will!

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.760
It was the end of the time he was allotted,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.930
but Mr. Tokuda left without
even saying goodbye to the class.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.980
After hearing how Mr. Tokuda felt,

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.440
I felt again how big
what I'd inherited really was.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.110
But, even so, I...

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.150
Deku, it's time for dinner.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.740
Oh, sorry. I'll be right there.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.780
Deku, what were you talking
about with the reporter earlier?

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.160
Um, well...

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.290
I smell meat.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.790
Huh? Oh, All Might brought
snacks for everyone earlier.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.420
He said to eat it with everyone.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.250
What is it?

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.920
Meat buns.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.960
Meat buns?

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.010
If we don't bring it to
everyone soon, they'll get cold.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:41.970
Yeah.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.380
Everyone, there're meat buns!

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.680
They're from All Might!

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.300
Thank you!

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.100
"Juko News"
"The next day"

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.230
Welcome back, Tane!

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.100
How was it?

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.190
Did you figure out who
All Might's successor is?

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.520
Sorry...

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.270
Huh?

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.860
It looks like I jumped
to the wrong conclusion...

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.320
What, so it was a waste of time?

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.070
I had to do a lot of groundwork to get
permission for you to go there, you know.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.410
I'm very sorry, Editor-in-Chief!

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.290
I'm not saying this'll make up for it,

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.160
but I came back with a different scoop.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.460
All Might buying and eating a meat bun!

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.210
This is good! So cute!

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.420
Well done! As expected of Tane!

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.800
The heaven-sent scoop finder!

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.550
Much obliged...

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.430
I'm sorry...

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.760
...All Might.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.390
A summer cold?

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.720
Please don't get me sick.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.730
Yeah, I know.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.730
Sorry.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.240
The vague unease from All
Might's retirement...

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.000
It will eventually become reality...

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.160
...and become even greater.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.580
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.010
As those of us in Class 1-A look
for places to do our work studies,

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:32.640
those guys are quietly wriggling
in the depths of the darkness.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.060
The mysterious man who made contact with
the League of Villains led by Tomura Shigaraki--

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.310
What in the world is he after?

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.770
Next time, "Overhaul."

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.030
The curtain rises on the
new fight the heroes are facing...

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.190
Go beyond!

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.620
"Next time: Overhaul"

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.450
Plus Ultra!
