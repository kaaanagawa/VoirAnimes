WEBVTT

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.150
On the day Kacchan and Todoroki had
their provisional license training course...

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.610
Oh! Hey!

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.820
U.A.!

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.740
Oh, what's this?

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.870
This guy's super hot.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.330
That's like, totally crazy.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.620
I'm totally psyched to train with a hot guy.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.830
Camie, that's beneath you!

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.170
As a student of Shiketsu,
you should throw away things like that!

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.550
Meat! You failed in the
first test, didn't you?

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.220
I received permission to observe!
I'm just watching!

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.380
Go home, Meat!

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.140
My name is Seiji Shishikura!

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.470
It's about time, huh?

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.220
Yeah...

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.940
Shall we make today's
training a little harder...?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.030
Hey, Todoroki,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.030
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"
"Inasa Yoarashi - Quirk: Whirlwind"

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.830
what things do you like?

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.660
Soba, served cold in a basket.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.250
Man, I like my soba hot!

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.040
And I like udon better!

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.250
We're not compatible.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.210
No, but I feel like we've gotten closer!

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.670
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.460
I say this every time,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.760
but you don't have to force
yourself to be friends with me.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.840
That makes me sick.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.230
Well, today we've rented out
the general sports center for the training.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.650
"Heroes Public Safety
Commission - Yokumiru Mera"

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.730
Recently, I've gotten
scared of falling asleep.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.980
I'm Mera. Look forward
to working with you today, too.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.820
This seems kind of bad.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.700
One more thing before we begin.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.410
Up until now, we have
had ten people in this class,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.960
but starting today, we will have 11.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.330
"Pro Hero - Present Mic - Quirk: Voice"

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.580
We can just sit up front, right?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.830
It'll be easier to see.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.840
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.130
Let's take a seat where we won't stand out.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.840
I don't want to get in anyone's way.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.260
"Pro Hero - Endeavor - Quirk: Hellflame"

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.550
Shoto!

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.760
You're not someone who should
be suffering a setback in a place like this!

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.270
Show them why you're in
a different league from them!

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.390
What? No way.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.980
It's Endeavor!

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.730
The number two... no, number one hero...

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.150
Seriously? Why is he here?

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.690
Endeavor...

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.490
You're in the way.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.580
Don't get in my way.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.290
Wait, next to Endeavor...

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.370
Huh?!

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.250
It's All Might!

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.630
Look, everyone's looking at us now.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.880
What's he doing here?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.840
Wow!

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.630
Seriously?

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.760
Well, he is a teacher at U.A. right now.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.310
Um, everyone, please calm down.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.220
May I continue?

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.560
She'll be joining the class starting today--

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.850
I'm a second year at Shiketsu High School.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.770
"Camie Utsushimi"

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.150
Please call me Camie.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.860
Like the rest of you,
she made it to the second exam

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.780
and fulfilled the requirements
to take the supplemental class,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.240
but because the cause of her foggy memory
from the days before the exam was unknown,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.500
she had to pass up
the opportunity to participate.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.870
They said ok-ok to, like, making an exception,
and it's, like, sooo generous!

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.290
I totally owe them tons, but, like, 'sup!

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.210
I don't know what she just said.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.760
'Seiji Shishikura - Quirk: Meatball"

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.630
Camie is extremely idiotic.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.630
Let's call her upbeat.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.050
And that was probably what was targeted.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.470
With her personality and the way she
talks and acts, it took longer to discover.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.890
I failed? But, like, I
don't remember taking it.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.400
Anyway, I slept for, like, four days?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.980
OMG, that's, like, so long.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.400
There were the discrepancies
from the people around her after that

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.650
and anesthetics detected in her blood...

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.490
And then, the U.A. student's testimony
yesterday put the last nail in the coffin.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.910
To think that someone had
changed places with her...

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.080
The League of Villains...

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.000
To not notice that one of
my fellows had been replaced...

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.300
I am pathetic...

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.380
The predictions of the police
and the heroes were wrong.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.840
We must really take measures promptly

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.010
to deal with the absence of a Symbol.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.560
Now...

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.980
I leave it to you, then...

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
Gang Orca.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.070
You all came today, too,
without being discouraged, huh?

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.030
"Current Hero Rank - 10th - Gang Orca"

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.330
You failures who were
culled out by that easy exam!

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.250
He took control of that relaxed
atmosphere in an instant, huh?

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.090
He doesn't realize that
he's also being rebuked indirectly.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.130
"*Failed the first exam."

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.050
There's something I realized
from the course up to this point.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.470
Far from being heroes, you lot are
lower than the ocean bottom dwellers!

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.310
You're goby fish turds!

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.770
Sir, yes, sir!

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.770
I can't hear you.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.480
Sir, yes, sir!

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.190
What the heck? He's scary.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.650
Especially you!

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.730
Do you even want to be a hero?!

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.900
First of all, I'm not a turd.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.530
Disciplinary action!

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.400
How can turds save the mighty humans?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.450
Indirectly through fertilizer and--

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.990
Disciplinary action!

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.870
Can people be praised for
just combat ability and mobility?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.830
--Sir, yes... sir!

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.290
--Disciplinary action!
--Sir, yes... sir!

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.960
I know that the three of
you have enough combat ability.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.670
But that's all you have.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.380
Foolish behavior, like being
disrespectful to those needing rescue

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.060
and ignoring the situation around
you while competing stubbornly...

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.430
Today, we will put you
through a special trial.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.440
What you lot are missing...

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.600
...in other words, "heart"!

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.110
Will anyone take hold
of the hand you put out?

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.190
No!

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.030
Even if they bare their fangs at you,

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.660
if there is a life there, you must save it!

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.740
To save and be saved--

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.040
The essence of that is an agreement
and understanding between your hearts!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.750
Now, conquer this!

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.670
Through this life-or-death battle,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.050
show that you can come
to an understanding with them!

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.130
That's the trial you face!

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.510
Wow, a real hero!

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.180
"Win Those Kids' Hearts"

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.020
Come on, greet them properly...

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.320
Lame! Bombs are lame!

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.900
Hey, listen to what I'm saying!

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.620
They're from Masegaki
Public Elementary School.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.950
Ma'am, we will take
responsibility for these children.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.500
Thank you for your help.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.040
Where's the battle?!

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.000
Everyone, he made Takuto cry!

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.670
Don't make him cry, Bomb!

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.840
Stop crying!

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.090
There are people like that, huh?

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.720
Adults that think that if they yell
without letting anyone else get a word in,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.600
everything will turn out the way they want...

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.600
Anyway, it won't work.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.850
What's with this kid?!

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.060
Hey, what's this?

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.020
What's this?

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.980
What's this, what's this, a wee-wee?

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.150
Oh, this is--

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.230
A wee-wee! A wee-wee! A wee-wee!

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.110
This is not a wee-wee.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.570
This is first-aid treatment
for when relief doesn't arrive in time--

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.660
Boring.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.740
It's a wee-wee, right?

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.080
You're a hero with five wee-wees,
Five Wees, right?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.160
Wee-wee! Wee-wee!

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.170
You jerk!

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.920
You jerk! You jerk!

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.000
--I'm stronger than you, you jerk!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.420
--I...
--I'm stronger than you, you jerk!

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.670
...won't turn into that.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.430
Where are you looking, jerk?!

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.050
Hey, hey!

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.810
Oh, shoot! I looked away again!

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.440
Why am I, like, part of this group, too?

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.440
You are an exception.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.690
We couldn't see you in action at the exam.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.820
Also, you seem like
you wouldn't be good at this.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.900
What the heck? I'm, like,
seriously exasperated.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.110
Oh well, I like kids, anyway.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.280
Ouch!

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.790
Don't seduce Sho.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.750
Ignore her, ignore her, ignore her.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.290
Man, she's seriously at that age, huh?

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.790
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.590
My class is full of problem children.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.720
No matter what I do, they're rebellious...

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.390
They've already started
causing problems for you all.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.560
Ma'am, don't worry.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.270
Mr. Whale...

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.400
By the end of today,
I believe they will change your class.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.280
I'll have you four work together

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.280
and grasp the hearts of
the kids in this class.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.360
Are you telling us to
be nursery school teachers?

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.620
Now, the rest of you will have a lecture

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.200
after your practical exercises
with my employees, as usual.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.490
Attention!

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.370
Sir, yes, sir!

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.770
My MC spirit has reached its limit!

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.360
Background music and live reporting!

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.280
Without them, there is no soul in an event!

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.780
Well, whether there is or not is honestly--

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.320
If it doesn't matter whether there is or not,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.990
then obviously it'd be better
to have them, Mighty Boy!

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.330
Now, let's get this party
started, underachievers!

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.750
Yeah!

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.000
The battle between the future
heroes and the rugrats has begun!

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.790
Let's, like, have some fun, okay, kiddos?

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.090
Ignore her, ignore her.
Ignore the wanton woman.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.840
Leave her, leave her.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.970
You seem to have been
considerate of my feelings.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.270
So, you wanted to talk?

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.190
Honestly, I don't know
what I could say as I am now...

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.610
Did you know?

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.910
The number of crimes
committed in the past month

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.950
has gone up 3% compared to past years.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:31.580
I... have resolved more
incidents than anyone else.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.170
Even now, I've done more than before...

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.340
However, I can hear it...

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:43.340
The sound of something unseen
that you built up... crumbling away.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.930
Former number one hero...

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:52.060
What is the Symbol of Peace?

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.020
"Inasa Yoarashi"
"Quirk: Whirlwind"
"He can create strong winds around himself and control them."

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.020
"Affiliation: Shiketsu High School 1st Year"
"Birthday: 9/26"
"Height: 190 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Passion"

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.030
"Endeavor"
"Quirk: Hellflame"
"He can produce high-temperature flames with his body."

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.030
"Affiliation: Pro Hero"
"Birthday: 8/8"
"Height: 195 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: Kudzu Mochi"

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.780
Give that back!

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.030
That's not a toy for kids!

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.080
Is it okay for that to be so easily removed?

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.450
I took them off because
it'd be dangerous, damn it!

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.170
I mean, "grasp the hearts" is,
like, super vague.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.840
Like, what're we supposed to do, anyway?

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.720
Now, Team Goby looks like they don't
know what they're supposed to do!

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.140
It's fine for you to do this,
but it's still a class, so don't go overboard.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.640
Okay, okay!

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.270
However, what should they be doing?

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.310
What would you like out of this, ma'am?

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.560
Well...

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:43.030
The early elementary school years are
an important time for building character...

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.700
Because the difference
between Quirks has a big effect,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:51.490
we offer counseling in order to
support healthy emotional development,

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.370
but counseling is not a cure-all.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:59.210
The children of this class
have closed their hearts to us.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.420
I understand that this is my responsibility.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.800
But, if interacting with you all,
working so hard to achieve your dreams,

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.850
will help them remember
their honest feelings...

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.270
Let's stop saying crass things to each other.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.650
There's someone in trouble.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.940
In other words, we just need
to make friends with everyone, right?

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.690
All right!

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.030
Let's get this babysitting
over and done with...

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.280
...and join the training on the other side!

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.950
Oh, you're already being crass, Bakugo!

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.080
Now, how will U.A.'s ammunition
depot handle this?!

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.800
Because the teacher didn't fulfill her role
as "leader" and was looked down on,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.460
the brats ended up taking over.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.130
This isn't something that "just happens"
"without you realizing it."

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.180
There's definitely a "boss"
who's creating this atmosphere.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.930
Find that kid!

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.390
And then?

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.810
And then beat him up and hang
him up to make an example out of him

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.650
and make the other kids throw rocks at him!

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.360
It'll be the most effective way to make
him realize just how insignificant he is!

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.700
We just need to make friends
with everyone, right?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.910
Now, Bakugo has put out his opinion...

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.450
Whoever's the strongest, come out!

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.120
Fight me!

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.790
...but it doesn't look like it'll work!

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:25.130
Such an outdated, violent way of thinking...

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.130
You're giving yourself away.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.130
He's given himself away!

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.550
Enough already! Just come out!

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.810
Um, it might be impertinent to say this,

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.770
but will it really be all right?

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.140
Don't worry. This is the side show.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.060
Delinquents aren't fashionable, you know.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.230
Then make them fashionable!

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.280
Getting to know each other first
is the fastest way to becoming friends.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.950
Who wants to become a hero?!

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.660
The second to try is the kid from Shiketsu!

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.530
I do!

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.530
They're cool!

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.030
I'm super strong, too!

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.370
Playing with children might
be something Inasa is good at.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.250
His passion cheers those around him.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.330
Now... this is something to see.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.250
He's started a commentary...

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.010
He's easily influenced, huh...

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.550
Really? I wanna be one, too!

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.930
Don't heat and passion
just make your blood boil?

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.970
I don't really know what he's talking about,
but it seems pretty good!

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.980
It's the job of a hero
to protect everyone's smiles, right?

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.690
Can kids who give their teachers
trouble become good heroes?

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.940
No...?

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.690
Right! In that case...

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.570
But...

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.780
Then... since you all gave the teachers

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.160
and safety commission more work
by making them run this class,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.240
you can't become one, either?

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.080
That's true!

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.540
I'm not in a position
to talk all high and mighty!

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.460
I'm sorry!

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.720
He's big-hearted and pure, huh?

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.680
Don't you think these kids are more,
like, twisted than expected?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.220
That's why I said sometimes
violence is necessary.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.020
Bakugo, that's not true.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.850
Huh?! That's how I was raised!

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.650
There should be a better way to do this.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:12.820
Oh? Then show me your way of doing things.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.110
Sure.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.580
I have entrusted everything to Shoto.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:27.840
I had already climbed to the
number two spot by the time I was 20.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.970
Because I'd climbed here, I understood...

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:41.220
...that I couldn't reach the top.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.730
If all I'd wanted was the title,

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.780
I could've acted friendly like you
and ingratiated myself with everyone.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.900
But I wanted to become stronger than anyone.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.370
This isn't like you.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.450
Just answer me!

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.420
What the Symbol of Peace is, huh...?

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.460
Honestly, I'm not sure what to say.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.590
I believed that this country needed a Symbol

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.600
and ran forward at full speed.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.930
A strong light that could
be hope or a warning...

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.310
I swore that that's what I would become

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.310
and ran to this place.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.820
When I went into town,
everyone looked uneasy.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.030
No matter how many heroes there were,

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.160
the number of crimes never went down.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.620
Even more than now, everyone was afraid.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.870
I'm here because I wanted
to do something to help you!

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.040
All Might!

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.670
I ignored the kindnesses around me

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.170
and cast off many things

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.300
to choose this path.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.720
Your former sidekick?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.390
Endeavor,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.100
I understand the situation
you've been placed in

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.940
and what's being said about you.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.270
There are many who compare you to me.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.200
"Special: Where is hero society headed?"

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.490
It's not that I don't like Endeavor,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.660
"Japan without All Might"
"Businessman (36)"

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.660
it's just that I can't help
comparing him to All Might!

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.030
It's All Might!

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.330
What's he doing here?

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.740
Wow!

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.950
It's Endeavor!

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.920
Seriously? Why is he here?

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.830
But you and I are different.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.840
You do not have to copy
the Symbol that I was aiming for.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.800
You should look for a way
that suits you without rushing.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.350
Now, next is

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.230
Shoto Todoroki, with both
calmness and passion!

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.060
Shoto!

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.190
Huh...?

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.230
Now, how will he get closer to them?
It's something worth seeing!

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.030
Getting to see a hot guy
who likes kids is, like, the best.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.030
Oh no, we'll be at the same level as her.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.990
Ignore them, ignore them.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.740
Right.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.990
Man...

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.250
Five Wees is boring. We don't need him.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.460
Let's go tease the big gorilla.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.170
He's talking about you, Baldy.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.630
I told you, I'm not bald!

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.590
What kind of person I am...

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.720
I need them to know that first,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.090
or nothing I say will reach them.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.350
Don't turn your back on the past!

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.690
I'm not "Five Wees,"

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.900
I'm Shoto, a U.A. student
who wants to be a hero.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.990
My father is the current
number one hero, Endeavor,

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.160
but I'd always hated him and wanted to...

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.830
He's started by talking like
a character introduction page!

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.080
Boring...

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.290
No one likes him!

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.120
Sorry.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.080
Nice try, Todoroki!

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.790
I guess I have no choice.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.790
Hey.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:00.300
You three've been doing things
normally this whole time,

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.970
but wouldn't it be faster if we,
like, showed them our Quirks?

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.350
I was just about to say that!

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.430
No way, what a coincidence.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.270
The gap between us is still deep.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.310
And there are still some
who are having fun giving us trouble.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.610
To attack, we can't just try to fill the gap.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.230
Our only choice is to jump--

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.690
with a practical skill demonstration!

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.650
I see. Got it!

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.030
They're talking about something.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.910
No matter what they try, it won't work.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.750
Because we all know...

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.210
Our mommies and daddies,
and everyone on TV...

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.670
They're all wondering if heroes will be okay.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.170
Stop! It's dangerous!

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.970
That's right. We know...

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.010
That we're better than you guys!

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:51.770
Come on, brats, I'll fight you!

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.980
In the end, all you can do
is hold us down from above.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.110
Of course, that won't work.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.400
Why are these guys having so much
trouble with some grade schoolers?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.450
Fighting power with power
is the epitome of foolishness.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.030
Who the heck are you?!

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.040
For a while now, you have not seemed
to grasp the significance of Shiketsu High.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.920
In order for the commentary to be fair,
I have come to assist you.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.210
What'd you say?

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.340
As Present Mic stated,

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.550
if they clash seriously,
the children will only be left ashamed.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:30.220
On the other hand, if they use
their discretion and let the children shine,

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.270
then it will only make
the children even more impudent.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.060
By abandoning discourse,
they have entered an impasse!

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.480
I'm sorry, but this isn't the time
to be talking so leisurely!

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.610
Those children believe that
their Quirks surpass those of heroes

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.450
and are seriously trying to defeat them!

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.960
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.840
The children of Masegaki
Elementary School distrust heroes

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.710
and believe they're stronger,

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.090
and they've picked a fight with
Kacchan, Todoroki, and the others.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.590
If they use their Quirks
and force them to yield,

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.310
then they can't come to a
mutual understanding with the children.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.600
The qualifications of Kacchan
and the others as heroes,

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.890
and their true worth,
are being called into question.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.400
Next time, "Relief for License Trainees."

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.690
Aoyama's eccentric behavior
goes out of control, too!

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.620
"Next time: Relief for License Trainees"

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.090
Go beyond!

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.700
Plus Ultra!
