00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.300
Why won't anyone...

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.650
...look at the big picture?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.660
What I'm going to tear down
is this world--its very framework!

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.200
Your justice is small.
You only see what's in front of you.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.910
It's mere sentimentalism.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.000
You hero pretenders...

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.380
Stay out of my way!

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.990
If you get injured, you'll definitely
break yourself apart and restore yourself.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.590
If I'm at 100% speed, then I can
get through during that opening.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.100
And then, I won't let you recover anymore!

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.760
If I can't save...

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.900
...the one small girl in front of me...

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.070
...how can I become...

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.750
...a hero who saves everyone?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.950
Too long...

There's no way you'll lose, right?

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.470
Kai.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.610
I've been watching this whole time, how,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.080
in order to preserve the dignity of the
organization, ever since you were young,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.290
you were always willing to put
in an exorbitant amount of effort.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.550
If Kai loses, then at least I'll take
the finished drug and serum and...

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.970
For the Hassaikai.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.300
For Kai!

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.720

"Tamaki Amajiki - Quirk: Manifest"

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.560
I know the conditions
you need to activate your Quirk.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.480
Move.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.560
It's the police!

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.760
Resistance is useless!

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.570

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.250
Oh, good.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.200
Lemillion's okay.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.870

Eri's Quirk is getting stronger...!

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.430
"Eri"

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.370
You got into a fight because
someone called us villains?

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.080
As yakuza, we can't raise
a hand in retaliation.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.340
What you did was bad...

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.260
...but thanks for trying to protect...

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.100

We've called for residents
in the vicinity to evacuate!

Deku's fighting Chisaki! But...

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.010
...something seems off!

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.880
No!

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.970
Stop... He's going to die!

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.050
Each and every one action you take...

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.180
No!

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.680
...kills people.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.950

Stop...!

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.030
Sorry, Midoriya!

She started getting
feverish after passing out...

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.030
Let's take her to the hospital for now.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.330
And you, too.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.000
Yes, sir.

I forgot to tell you!

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.340
Midoriya...

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.080
This is a different future
from the one I saw.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.780
I don't understand why it happened,

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.070
but he made my wish into a reality...

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.950
Midoriya...

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.620
You twisted the future...

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.870
A-All Might said he would live!

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.210
He said he couldn't face you...

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.300
You should definitely
see him again! See him, and--

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.430
So... hang in there!

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.050
We're in a hurry. Please stay back.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.350
Midoriya.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.270
There are many injured,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.590
so this isn't really the time
to celebrate without restraint.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.030
Thanks.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.530
And so, the battle to save a single girl

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.140
came to an end.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.920
"Complete!"

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.430
We are currently transporting
11 members of the Hassaikai.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.270
All have sustained serious injuries.
We are heading to Tacodana Villain Hospital.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.890
Their personal belongings
have been confiscated.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.560
In addition to the aforementioned bullet,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.660
we have also confirmed
previously unreported capsules--

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.080
What's that?

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.030
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.890

to get the king, right?

"Villain - Mr. Compress - Quirk: Compress"
"Villain - Dabi"

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.200
It's not that simple.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.040
Yeah, they're here, just like you said!

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.870
To get from the Hassaikai
to the nearest villain hospital,

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.370
it's fastest to use this highway.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.830
Thanks for letting us know.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.630
Toga, you're so efficient. I'm much obliged.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.760
Jin's the one who told me to call.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.470
"Villain - Twice - Quirk: Double"
"Villain - Himiko Toga - Quirk: Transform"

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.670
Fight.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.130
I was too busy watching Izuku.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.260
Run away!

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.720
In fact, I'm sorry to make
you get your hands dirty.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.640
I only have one hand, though.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.020
We couldn't get the girl
who's the crux of their plan,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.350
but we think the finished
products are where you are.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.370
We watched the police's movements
for a while, so there's a high probability.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.450
Even if they aren't there...

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.320
Kill them!

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.000
...we want to say hi, right?

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.450
That's--

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.580
Tomura Shigaraki from the League of Villains!

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.670
Hey, lizard! Stop weaving!

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.170
I get motion sick.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.040
"Villain - Spinner"

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.710
Don't call me "lizard"! I'm Spinner!

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.260
What are you getting mad for? Shut up!

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.220
Is attacking the police

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.430
really following the will of Stain,
who wanted a true hero society?

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.010
I'm not sure about that!

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.930
It's a necessary sacrifice, Spinner.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.790
I'm counting on you to drive.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.610
Now...

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.630
What's with him?

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.690
The League of Villains!

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.000
A gang of evil spirits with
a grudge against society!

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.960
A hero! Of course there'd be one. Ugh!

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.000
Spinner, slow down!

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.970
Perfect!

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.140
If you touch something with all five fingers,
your Quirk will make it decay,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.630
but you won't be able to do that with sand!

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.620
Then we're natural enemies.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.180
He's famous, huh?

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.140
Shigaraki is the misdirection;
in other words, the decoy.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.190
Let's go.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.320
Police car gently levitating!

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.200
No trickery or devices involved.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.630
Are you all right?!

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.050
That's right.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.380
Heroes end up prioritizing lives.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.550
Recently, burnt corpses have been
turning up one after another in various places.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.560
Oh, are people talking about me?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.020
That makes me happy.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.310
Have you ever thought about
the feelings of those they left behind?!

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.740
That's hot...

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.040
Sand doesn't burn, does it?

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.160
From what it looked like,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.220
he could only make the top half of
his body sand, so he'll probably die.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.190
Who's going to be the next leader again?

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.490
Did you come to kill me?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.490
No, I thought of what you'd hate the most.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.210
I hate you.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.190
You're too full of yourself.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:42.910
Me, too.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.460
There are two boxes here.
Which is the finished product?

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.200
Oh, well.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.410
Give it back.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.620
You know what, Overhaul?

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.170
A person who erases people's Quirks

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.970
shouldn't depend on their own Quirk, right?

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.080
If I don't cut it off,
your whole body will turn to dust.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.150
All right, now you're a powerless,
helpless, Quirkless man.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.650
And the fruits of all that effort you spent

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.360
are now mine!

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.780
Now you won't even have
a finger to put in your mouth

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.240
as you look on enviously at the rest of us.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.820
Let's do our best!

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.470
Pursuers are coming! Hurry up and get in!

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.050

Hassaikai member, Rikiya Katsukame,

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.840
those who could move joined the local heroes

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.220
"Nejire Hado - Quirk: Surge"

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.750
and checked the damage.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.730
From Chisaki's dismantling,
four houses or buildings collapsed.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.600
But in terms of casualties, there
were only three with minor injuries,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.770
and they were all just scratches.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.690
It helped that it was a weekday
morning in a residential area,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.030
but that's pretty miraculous.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.130
Hey, hey, you know what?

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.700
Half of that was thanks to Deku.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.950
"Deck"?

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.950
I was exhausted and
about to fall over, but I saw.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.830
He sent the huge Chisaki flying into the air,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.830
and then slammed him
back down near the big hole.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.990
He fought trying not to
damage more than he needed to.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.080
That's hard when they're huge!

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.340
Meanwhile, those who
were injured in the fight

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.810
were transported to
a nearby university hospital.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.770
I examined your whole body,

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.290
but other than your arm, there seems
to be nothing out of the ordinary.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.400
Thank you very much.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.020
But how did your arm end up like that--

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.440
More importantly, where's everyone else?

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.530
I went to check on them.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.110
Mr. Aizawa! What about your injuries?

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.280
I had ten stitches.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.190
Come with me.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.200
Sorry I couldn't be with you when it counted.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.520
It's all right.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.420
Anyway, how's everyone else?

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.390
Kirishima has bruises and lacerations
on his whole body, but he'll live.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.720
Amajiki cracked a bone in his face,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.060
but none of his injuries will leave a scar.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.640
Fat Gum has broken bones in a few places,

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.170
but he seems fine.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.610
Luckily, the blade that stabbed
Rock Lock didn't hit any vital organs,

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.220
so his wound won't develop
into anything serious.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.470
I'm so glad...

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.910
Um, what about Eri?

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.910
She's still feverish and sleeping.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.830
She's being quarantined right now.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:25.630
Quarantined... So, I can't even see her?

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.800
Apparently, it was decided based on
the information we got from you about her.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.550
She can't control her
Quirk that rewinds people.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:39.060
If something activates it again,
I'm the only one that can stop her.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:45.030
You were able to touch her by continually
destroying your whole body, right?

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.310
Yes.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.290
There aren't many people who could do that.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.400
Even if there was someone who could,

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.620
if that girl's Quirk became
powerful enough to surpass that...

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:02.410
Yeah, if you hadn't erased Eri's Quirk,
I don't know what would've happened...

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.960
Since it didn't work on the buildings
or the ground, but only on people,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.850
training to teach her control isn't
something we can approach lightly.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.010
Thinking about her emotional state
on top of the unknowns,

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.970
right now, it would be the most
logical to keep her quarantined.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.840
For her sake, as well.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.310
In other words,

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.990
we cannot depend on her Quirk.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.050
Huh?

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.190
All we can do is accept it.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.000
He also just arrived.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.030
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.280
All Might...!

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.060
And Recovery Girl...

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.530
Why...?

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.500
"Pro Hero - Centipeder - Quirk: Centipede"

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.670
I called them... because...

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.870
Sir was always talking about All Might...

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:47.460
Awata.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.060
There's nothing else that can be done...

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.920
Honestly... it's mysterious
how he's even still alive...

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.630
"Pro Hero - Recovery Girl - Quirk: Heal"

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.630
There's nothing I can do
with my healing at this point...

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.590
Unfortunately, I don't think
he will live to see tomorrow...

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.980
Nighteye...

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.780
All Might...

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.440
You finally feel like seeing me...
on my deathbed...?

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.440
There's nothing I can say to that...

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.450
I've done terrible things to you...

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:25.660
Nighteye!

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.540
Live! Do your best!

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.010
You're being... very respectful...

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.170
I don't resent you at all.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.210
Because all I wanted was
for you to be happy...

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.640
If you've decided to fight, then--

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.060
You should fight, too!

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.360
Please let me atone
for all I've done until now...

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.230
There's nothing to atone for...

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.240
I wanted to change the future
where you were killed,

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.780
so I kept looking for ways to change it...

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.660
But it was to no avail...

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.520
But today, Midoriya showed me.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.930
I think... it might have to do with energy...

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.480
A strong vision with no room for doubt.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.550
Energy that wished for a future.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.260
I'm sure it wasn't just Midoriya.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.690
Everyone believed strongly in it
and brought it together.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:41.280
So I thought it could be the result
of that energy converging on Midoriya...

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.290
...and being released...

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.240
The future is uncertain--

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.210
You have changed my thinking...

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.460
That's enough for me...

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.000
My only regret is...

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.440
Sir!

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.010
Togata...!

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.470
You can't!

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.430
Please, live!

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.300
You can't die!

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.680
Mirio...

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.460
You suffered so much because of me...

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.480
If only... I had been...

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.020
It was...

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.690
...because you taught me

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.610
that I was able to become strong!

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.700
It was because you taught me
that I'm living like this now!

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.580
Please, teach me more!

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.660
Mirio...

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:30.980
Forgive me...

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:38.490
At first, I only lured you
in as a vessel for One For All.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:44.590
But you followed me and believed in me,

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.820
and before I knew it, you became my pride...

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.230
Mirio, you'll be...

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.670
...fine.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:05.010
You'll become a finer
hero than anyone else...

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.160
This is the only future...

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.500
...that shouldn't be changed.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.750
So, smile...

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.010
Smile...

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.290
A society without cheer and humor...

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.370
...will not have...

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.220
...a bright future...

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.910
"Bright Future"

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960
"Preview"

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:21.960
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.000
Our fight with the Shie Hassaikai has ended,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.470
and we were able to change the future.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.000
But it wasn't all completely over yet.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.340
As we were overcome
with grief at the loss of Sir Nighteye,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.680
the League of Villains started
to move toward a new stage.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.580
Next time, "Smoldering Flames."

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.980
That was the calm before the storm...

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:51.540
"Next time: Smoldering Flames"

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.990
Go beyond!

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.440
Plus Ultra!
