WEBVTT

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.600
Today is Saturday.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.940
And Kacchan and Todoroki don't
have provisional license training today, so--

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.360
Each group is practicing this afternoon.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.280
We just have to single-mindedly...

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.450
...practice to kill!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.910
"Band Team"

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.280
I see, that's a great idea!

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.250
"Effects Team"

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.410
Let's talk to the dance team about it!

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.620
Wait, but that means
we don't have enough people.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.330
Midoriya, that's wrong!

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.590
Put more muscle into it!
The "lock" in locking is spelled L-O-C-K!

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.380
"Dance Team"

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.630
So do it like you're turning a lock...

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.350
...and stop it with a snap!

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.600
Snap!

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.770
Looks like no one has noticed yet...

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.400
Let's see, I'll make my appearance
with a joke and grab a laugh...

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.900
Oh, Togata!

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.240
Ribbit.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.070
Eri!

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.290
Here's a peach!

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.630
Eri!

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.460
Deku.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.960
What? Who's this? Your daughter, Togata?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.260
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.470
What lovely clothes.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.140
S-S-So cute!

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.850
Midoriya,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.930
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.680
the principal has given permission.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680
That's a good idea.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.560
But, Aizawa.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.730
That girl has been separated
from society all this time, right?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.480
"Pro Hero - Nezu - Quirk: High Specs"

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.190
For a girl like that to suddenly be
thrust into something like a school festival

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.610
might be a little too much.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.860
That's why...

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.620
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.280
In order to keep her from
being surprised and panicking,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.740
we wanted to let her
visit once to get used to it.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.160
Eri... I see, you're from the work study!

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.040
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.920
I'm Iida! Nice to meet you!

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.090
I'm Mineta! I can't wait to
see how you look in ten years.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.630
She's kind of shy, right?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300
"Eri"

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.670
Shy, huh?

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.720
So, I wanted to take Eri around U.A.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.310
Midoriya, do you want to come, too?

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.310
Huh?

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.560
Yes!

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.230
Hey, dance team! We wanted to talk about--

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.230
Oh, it's Eri!

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.320
Hey there! Wait, you don't know who I am, huh?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.690
Then, why don't we take a break?

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.490
Let's have teatime!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.780
"Gold Tips Imperial"

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.790
"U.A. Festival"

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.120
Today's a weekend,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.450
but since everyone's in the dorms,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.170
a lot of students are
still preparing for the festival.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.960
Oh, it's Togata!

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.540
"Business Course Student - 3rd Year"

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.500
What?! A kid?!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.010
Don't tell me this is why you're
on temporary leave from school...?!

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.640
Wait, say something! This makes it seem real!

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.050
"Special Lecture"

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.300
Putting all jokes aside,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.310
this year's Class I will be amazing,
so make sure you come!

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.020
You, too.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.140
I'll definitely go!

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.140
This is a really nice flyer...!

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.980
Can you get that nail?

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.650
Hey, wait! Don't put a poster up there!

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.570
Even though there's still a month,
everyone's really busy!

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.990
Everyone's trying to do
something cooler than last year...

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.820
They're trying to make it "Plus Ultra!"

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.620
Oh, sorry!

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.830
"Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu - Quirk: Steel"

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.870
Hey, you're Midoriya from Class A!

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.710
What's this, what's this?

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.460
"Neito Monoma - Quirk: Copy"

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.420
For you to be idling around in a place like this...

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.290
You don't have any work to do?

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.090
Eri, are you okay?

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.000
I thought it was the person
that fell from the sky...

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.460
Fell from the sky...?

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.090
Oh, you mean Ryukyu.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.800
Oh, are you ignoring me?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.050
You sure that's okay?

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.890
I heard Class A is doing a concert or something.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.220
You okay with that?

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.390
This time, to put it bluntly,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.770
Class B's performance is going
to be much more amazing than yours!

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.980
"Romeo and Juliet and the
Prisoner of Azkaban: The Return of the King."

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.190
It's a completely original script written by us,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.320
a super spectacular fantasy play!

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.950
You should probably go prepare--

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.080
A handkerchief to wipe your tears
when you're blown away by us, that is!

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.330
"ahahahaha hahahaha"

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.330
"Awase"

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.130
He seems to be even nastier than usual...

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.670
Sorry, Class A.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.840
"Kendo"

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.130
Kendo isn't around,
so there's no one to stop him.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.930
It seems like she always
came as a set with Monoma...

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.800
"Yosetsu Awase - Quirk: Weld"

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.060
Not today. She's going
to be in the beauty pageant.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.310
Beauty pageant?!

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.890
Yeah, she was entered against her will.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.650
I'm not Monoma, but let's all go all out!

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.360
Sorry to suddenly show
you the bad parts of U.A., Eri.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.150
Mr. Aizawa didn't say anything
about a beauty pageant.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.910
Speaking of the beauty pageant,
she's also really into it this year.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.280
Who?

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.870
"Equipment Room"

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.500
Last year's runner-up...

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.460
...Nejire Hado, right?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.120
"Nejire Hado - Quirk: Surge"

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.290
Hey, hey, why is Eri here?

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.960
It's so strange! Why? Why?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.340
How fun!

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.550
Nejire is more of a cute type than a sexy type!

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.590
That's how she lost last year, remember?

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.720
Your Quirk is flashy,
and with your looks and b-b-bo-bo...

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.980
"Body proportions."

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.890
Even with all that,
you were still only runner-up?!

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.060
Yeah, listen to this! Are you listening?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.150
Every year, I keep losing!
There's this other girl who's amazing!

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.940
The beauty pageant champion--

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.740
Bibimi Kenranzaki, in support course Class 3-G!

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.030
"Kenranzaki"

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.620
It's kind of amazing!

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.620
This year's pageant

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.540
also includes Kendo, who gained a lot
of secret fans from being in a commercial.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.620
"Tamaki Amajiki - Quirk: Manifest"

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.210
Hado is also going all out.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.510
Just thinking about performing...
in front of so many people...

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.300
Oww... Is making my stomach hurt...

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.930
At first, I just tried entering
because Yuyu told me to,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.730
but it's pretty fun, and I don't want to lose.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.730
That's why this year, I'll definitely win!

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.440
It's my last chance.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.730
You can do it.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.030
Yeah.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.320
Now! Next is...

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.530
The support course!

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.620
All the grades work together
to put on an exhibition of their work.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.040
I know about this! This is something
that makes a splash every year!

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.550
That's right! The school festival
is the support course's time to shine!

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.840
Hatsume...!

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.880
Wait... whoa!

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.760
It's my super cute baby #202!

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.470
"Mei Hatsume - Quirk: Zoom"

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.470
Oh, you look like you've got dirt on you...

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.640
Bathing just seems like a waste of time!

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.600
Really?!

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.020
Wow!

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.190
The sports festival was like a secondary
place for the hero course to show off.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.320
But, this time, we've been given the spotlight!

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.700
It's so I can get even bigger companies
to look at my babies even more carefully!

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.330
I need to raise them in a
way that doesn't embarrass me!

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.830
How did the iron soles work out for you?

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.120
If there's anything else,
please let me know right away!

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.750
I will, thank--

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.420
Baby?!

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.800
Hatsume, again?!

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.010
Water! Water!

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.800
--Hatsume, sorry about that!
--It exploded again!

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.220
--Let's go, Eri!
--It exploded again!

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.550
Okay.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.440
"Lunch Rush's Eatery"

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.770
Well, that's about it.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.650
Are you used to it...? I mean, how was it?

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.070
I don't really know...

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.200
But...

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.620
...there are a lot of
different people working hard,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.460
so I wonder how it'll turn out...

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.630
That's what people call "getting excited."

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.670
"Pro Hero - Midnight - Quirk: Somnambulist"

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.380
Principal Nezu! Ms. Midnight!

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.760
It seems like it was worthwhile!

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.430
He's eating cheese...!

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.760
I'm also excited about the school festival!

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.940
So many students are working hard
and having fun in order to make it the best

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.600
and to let people enjoy it!

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.440
The police also had stuff to say about it.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.480
Now, Kayama.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.610
Anyway, I hope you all
enjoy it to your hearts content.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.120
Exercise self-restraint and
voluntarily cancel the school festival.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.000
I can't believe the police chief
himself is paying me a visit.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.500
With villains becoming more
arrogant and heroes feeling insecure,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.380
if something were to happen to U.A. again,
we might not be able to stop it next time.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.010
You are quite right.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.630
However--

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.970
No, don't put honey out for the villains.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.310
I believe that it is
because of the times we're living in

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.100
that the students need this event.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.770
We will make sure it's absolutely safe.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.690
So, please...!

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.280
We can't let the future look any bleaker.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.120
I won't tell you the details,
but it looks like the principal worked hard.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.290
As a result, the security is even stronger...

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.250
And if the alarm sounds,
even if it's a false alarm,

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:13.090
we had to agree to cancel it and evacuate,
otherwise we can't have it.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.840
That's strict...

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.970
Of course, to keep that from happening,
we're also beefing up our defense.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.390
We're even releasing Hound Dog
around the vicinity of the school.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.760
"Pro Hero - Hound Dog - Quirk: Dog"

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.890
Releasing?!

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.390
Oh, yeah, Class A's performance
is causing a stir in the faculty lounge, too!

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.310
Do your best at living your youth!

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.980
Yes, ma'am!

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.230
Deku, what are you doing?

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.150
We're performing a dance
with music! I'll be dancing!

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.320
I'll do my best to make it fun for you,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.160
so make sure you come watch!

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
Sorry, our break's almost over,
so I'm heading off.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.040
Okay! Just so you know,
I'm looking forward to it, too!

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.500
And then...

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.960
After a week passed...

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.590
Midoriya...

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.920
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.430
You're...

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.840
...fired from the dance team!

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.970
"Mei Hatsume"
"Quirk: Zoom"
"She can see clearly up to 5 km away."

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.970
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Support Course"
"Birthday: 4/18"
"Height: 157 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Steampunk"

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.980
"Yuga Aoyama"
"Quirk: Navel Laser"
"He can shoot a strong laser beam from his bellybutton."

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 5/30"
"Height: 168 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Himself"

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.520
You're fired from the dance team!

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.730
I said fired, but strictly speaking...

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.860
...the effects team scouted you!

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.610
They said they need more people!

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.410
Why me...?

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.950
I already told Eri that I'd be dancing...

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.700
They want to make it
so Aoyama can reach the whole room...

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.370
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.250
What does it mean for Aoyama
to reach the whole room...?

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.540
...but we don't have
large-scale equipment like that,

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.710
so they said they wanted a
power-type person to move him by hand.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.010
During the beginning of the performance,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.680
I'm going to transform
from a dancer into a disco ball.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.890
It's the perfect job for me.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.180
I'd like your help.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.890
Which means, I'll just have a smaller part...

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.640
Sorry! It'll waste all that practice you put in,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.610
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.650
but can you do it?

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.150
We want to make it even better...!

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.440
The audience will get used to it.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.280
When Aoyama turns into a disco ball,
it'll only be interesting for that instant,

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.910
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.410
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.620
but I don't think anyone will even
notice it anymore after about a minute.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.160
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:13.500
Th-Then, what if the disco ball starts
moving in all directions in the middle?

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.830
Oh, that's it!

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.710
Great idea, Koda!

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.760
If I can still dance,
I won't have been lying to Eri.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.100
If it's to make this into something good...

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.220
All right!

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.350
Thanks, you're such a man!

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.770
Merci!

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.610
After class, we have practice
and meetings like this.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.690
I don't have much free time
before the performance.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.110
In that case, my training is...

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.280
"Early Morning"

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.620
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.290
It's still hard for you to shoot
consecutively or while you're moving, huh?

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.080
You have some internal bleeding.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.410
Cool it down with this.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.580
Thanks.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.590
When I'm trying to exercise so much
more control than I've had to before...

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.550
Is there a trick to it or something?

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.010
I don't know.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:10.260
I was just kind of able
to use 100% right away...

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.600
All I can say is what I told you from the
start--to create an image in your head.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.650
That's all.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.360
Solidify it with the image and
remember how it feels through experience.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.980
I think all you can do is keep repeating tha--

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.400
It's been a while since you coughed up blood!

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.330
Even if we both started out Quirkless,
there's a big difference between us.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:34.410
All Might really is a natural-born hero,
through and through.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.960
I'm sorry! Is anyone hurt?

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.050
Hatsume?!

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.420
--Oh, I sometimes test my babies around here.
--Wait, isn't this bad?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.840
--Oh, I sometimes test my babies around here.
--To be seen in a place like this...?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.890
Don't worry about it.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.550
Thank you very much!

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.930
This baby is a mini third eye...

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.470
She's not interested in me at all...

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.350
Oh, yeah! Midoriya!

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.230
About that new item you
asked me for the other day--

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.560
I had a baby that could do something similar,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.980
so I'm customizing it right now.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.820
Once the application goes through,
I'll get it to you right away!

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.370
Huh? I thought I said you could
do it after the school festival...

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.200
It's like how an artist draws on their breaks.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.870
I've got a base for it,
so it'll be done in no time!

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.960
It's like... aw, thank you!

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.830
Huh? Where are you going, baby?

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.670
Wait!

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.000
Item?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.300
Actually, there's something
I want to try with this new move...

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.680
I see.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.970
I also tried something like that in the past.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.970
All Might, you used a support item?!

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.350
I had no idea!

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:42.110
It was just that even an item made
for 20-30% of my power was bulky.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.490
It would've been fine
if I mainly fought mid- or long-range,

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.360
but since I was mainly short-range,
I kept breaking it...

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.120
In the end, I chose to fight
with nothing except my own body!

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.290
It's been a while since your last muscle form!

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.040
Reinforcing your power
with an item is a wonderful idea,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.880
but just make sure you don't
end up relying on it too much.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.010
Not being able to show
their power after losing an item...

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.550
I've seen many heroes like that.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.640
Yes, sir!

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.310
All right, let's create an image!

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.810
This feels really nostalgic right now...!

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.400
You're rushing, bastard!

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.650
Follow my lead!

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.400
But you keep throwing in new
arrangements, so it's confusing.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.660
Jiro, you seem to be born to teach.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.700
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.250
For a beginner like Kaminari to be able
to learn chord progressions in just a week...!

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.040
It's not that amazing.
Anyway, today's tea smells really good!

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.580
Can you tell?

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.500
Mother sent me this elusive tea,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.420
Gold Tips Imperial.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.760
Everyone, please try some!

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.840
I don't really get it, but thanks, as always!

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.720
I don't really get it, but that's so bourgeois!

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.350
"mutter mutter mutter"

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.600
All Might with an item,
All Might with an item, All Might with an item.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.600
--I'm such a failure for not
knowing about that rare Might.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.560
--Deku, you're not going
to drink Yao-momo's tea...?
--I'm such a failure for not knowing about that rare Might.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.480
Is there merch? Pics...? None.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.730
Maybe it's in a video?

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.270
All Might with an item, All Might with an--

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:06.940
"[Crime Announcement]
On that day, history will move [Official Start]"

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.490
Shoot, I tapped on it!

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.820
Gentle Video.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.530
Dear listeners, what kind of tea
do you drink at what times?

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.660
Before and after a job,

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.000
--A video about tea? Perfect timing! Here.
--I always choose the brand
based on the size of the job.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.870
Thanks.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:28.210
And this one is called Royal Flush.
Do you know what that means?

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.630
That you're cool because
you have discriminating taste?

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.470
In the next video I put out,

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:38.640
an alarm will sound, not just to
my dear listeners, but to all of society.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.060
Please wait with caution!

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.640
That's short.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.940
This person...

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.820
"[Crime Announcement]
On that day, history will move [Official Start]"

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.150
Is he famous?

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.320
People don't seem to like him much, though.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.820
I only kind of know who he is,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.910
but he's a villain who's kind of famous
in certain circles for causing trouble.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.620
It's kind of amazing that
he's been putting out these videos

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.160
but hasn't been caught yet, though.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.370
I wonder what he's planning next...

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.040
Gentle, this is bad...

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.250
"Villain - Gentle Criminal"
"Villain - La Brava"

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.590
You haven't had a tea break in a week.

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:11.050
Are you all right?

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.220
Yes.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.510
La Brava,

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.050
recently, people have been
full of discontent toward heroes.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.510
This is solely because
they have been acting cowardly.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.100
What they lack is preparedness
for unexpected circumstances.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.860
In short, they don't seem
to realize the crisis they're in.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.650
This is apparent in how they are putting
on a school festival even in these times.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:33.900
But, but, Gentle,

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.530
I don't know how I feel about you getting
children with a bright future involved.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.160
La Brava, this is just a warning.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.670
With my invasion, those future
heroes will also become stronger!

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.960
So it's because you are truly anguished!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.840
You're so cool, Gentle!

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.010
Now, let us go over the route
we'll take to get in, La Brava!

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.390
Open the Criminal Folder!

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.720
It won't open...

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.600
Sorry, I locked it.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.520
Right-click there...

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.400
This main road has the fewest number
of hero agencies and the least traffic.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.900
On the day of, at 5 a.m.,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.200
we will enter a side road here
and continue on toward U.A.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.070
You won't use your Quirk, then?

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.870
No, because there are heroes
who patrol the skies.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.830
After a while,
we will reach a large nature park.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.630
Once we get through that, we'll be almost there.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:35.170
If we go carefully without making any sound,
it should take 60 to 65 minutes.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.760
And then, after that... Can you see it?

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.260
There's an old house standing
in the shadow of a hardware store.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.390
Yes.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.770
This house is a café.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.140
You will not be enjoying
your cup outside, as usual?

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.480
That's risky!

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.650
The owner is past 70 and just barely getting by.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.730
In the first place, no one notices
that it's a place of business,

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.820
and there are only five or six regulars.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.780
But, La Brava, I must drink it there.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:08.210
Because this café carries
the elusive tea, Gold Tips Imperial!

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.750
Don't you think it's fitting
for the big job we're doing this time?

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.960
How wonderful...!

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.670
And because of the owner's advanced age,
it opens early, at 7 a.m.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.430
We can have a 90-minute teatime
if we get there right when they open!

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.600
This is more research than you usually do...

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.480
After that, we go back to the side street
and past the construction site

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.350
where a slightly elevated mountain
surrounded by forest will appear.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.150
Once we climb that...

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.190
...we will arrive at U.A.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.700
Most likely, Hound Dog, who excels
at sniffing out the enemy, will be on guard.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.740
Once we get to the forest,

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.290
we must first rub dirt and leaves
over our bodies to hide our smell.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.790
And for the crucial school grounds--

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:53.080
There is a sensor-style
security system called the U.A. Barrier

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.540
that covers its expansive campus.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.340
That's where I come in, right, Gentle?

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.210
"Her house key"

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.670
I'll infiltrate U.A.'s internal network

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.090
and secretly disable the sensors!

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.680
Because to be frank,

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.060
I'm a professional hacker!

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.060
I really have a wonderful partner.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.150
La Brava, I am truly grateful to you.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.560
Oh, stop, Gentle!

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.110
I love you, Gentle!

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.820
La Brava. I mean it.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.820
For my dream...

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.830
I learned to use technology
to debut my video, but I was bad at it.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.250
But no one even looked at it,

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.920
and the rare comments I did get were harsh...

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.540
"It's so boring I can't even lol"
"Right?"
"world's worst video"
 "It's a waste of time!"

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.710
It's only been viewed 56 times!

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.460
But it's already been a month...

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.430
That bell signaled the end of my gloomy days.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.260
I couldn't hold back my feelings...

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.600
...so I hacked into
your account to get your address.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.100
I'm a huge fan.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.810
I will help you carve your name... into history!

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.570
My... first fan...

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.030
At first, honestly, I was afraid...

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.160
So afraid that I was careless.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.950
However, when it became the two
of us scheming and editing together...

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.080
...my videos got more views in no time!

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.670
"[800,000 yen in damages]
Tried going to a big bank [Lottery Con]"
"35,512 views"

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.500
La Brava!

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.050
I am betting the mustache I'm so proud of
and my soul on this scheme!

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.720
For the sake of the world,
for the sake of others, for the sake of my dream--

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.140
And to respond to your feelings!

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.020
Gentle!

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.810
La Brava!

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.190
I love you! I love you so much, Gentle Criminal!

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.150
I love you, too, La Brava!

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.990
I will make this succeed...

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.820
No matter...

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.370
No matter what...!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.040
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.420
It's finally time for the
U.A. school festival to start.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.380
Early in the morning, I leave to go
buy some supplies for our performance.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.760
There, I have a fateful encounter
with a certain person.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.640
He said,

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.560
"You'll ruin the aftertaste
of the Gold Tips Imperial."

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.600
Next time, "Deku vs. Gentle Criminal."

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.650
Stop already. Don't lay a hand on my school!

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.580
"Next time: Deku vs. Gentle Criminal"

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.990
Go beyond!

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.070
Plus Ultra!
