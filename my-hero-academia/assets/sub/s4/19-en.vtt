00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.230
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.770
We're going to have a school festival.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.730
"Schooent!"

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.400
Schooent!

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.980
"Schooent!"
"*Short for 'super normal school event'"

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.860
Each class needs to participate with something.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.700
I see... Song and dance, huh?

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.870
If we're talking about music...

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.910
Huh? What?

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.920
It's super cool to be able
to play so many instruments!

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.000
After being told all that...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.550
...to not do it...

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.220
...wouldn't be rockin' at all, would it?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.180
Mr. Aizawa!

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.010
Could Eri leave the hospital for just one day?

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.730
The school festival. Can Eri come, too?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.940
"Next Video"

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.570
With the Symbol of Peace,
All Might, at the head of the list,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.490
there are those called heroes from
the days of the vigilantes to the present

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.370
who shine in the annals of history.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.550
Then, there's the legendary leader, All For One,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.670
the commander of the
Meta Liberation Army, Destro,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.180
and the peerless thief, Oji Harima--

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.180
There are also many called villains by
history who have had their names recorded.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.600
Before the legislative system
of superhuman society became fixed,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.360
when the distinction between
"hero" and "villain" was still vague,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.980
there was chaos.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.070
But in that chaos, there was freedom.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.870
There was a naked freedom
like that of the Anglaise!

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.950
Nice to meet you, dear listeners.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.910
Here, I will bring you the grand adventure
of a man of extraordinary talent.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.170
That's right! It is I, Gentle!

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.290
Gentle Criminal!

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.510
"Villain - La Brava"

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.460
Wonderful! That was wonderful, Gentle!

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.340
Oh, my Gentle!

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.310
La Brava, has the upload finished?

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.930
Yes, Gentle! The account was deleted again.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.310
That's why I reuploaded everything,
starting with your debut video!

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.030
I was swooning over your morning
coffee substitute debut video.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.820
"Villain - Gentle Criminal"

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.660
I expect no less from you, La Brava.
Wonderful work today, as alwa--

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.030
That's hot!

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.950
Now, shall we go to today's shoot?

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.290
After finishing off
this cup elegantly, of course.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.630
It is I, Gentle!

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.500
Gentle Criminal!

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.760
I upload videos of what are called
criminal actions onto an internet site.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.310
But please do not jump to conclusions.
I am not committing crimes at random.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.060
For example, in the convenience
store robbery the other day--

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.320
J-Store is the number one chain in
the nation, with stores across the country.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.240
Their best-selling item,
nearly expired Fluffy Pudding,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.990
"Use by August 25"

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.320
was caught up in a
suspected case of mislabeling.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.120
Despite this, the company has feigned ignorance

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.160
and the situation seemed to be about
to end without a clear resolution.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.540
You understand now, don't you?

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.250
That's right. I punish those
who behave in an ungentlemanly way--

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.340
I'm a modern-day "gentleman thief."

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.260
"Gentleman Thief"

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.050
This is so frustrating, Gentle!

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.340
What is, La Brava?

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.640
I mean, the J-Store video
isn't getting many views at all!

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.640
The public has no taste!

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.140
Even though you're so wonderful, Gentle!

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.820
If you blame others,
then you won't be able to grow, La Brava.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.190
But, but, but!

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.410
You've been a villain in
online videos for six years! But...

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.790
Suddenly, this Stain guy steals all
the glory with a video of his life story!

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.740
"Hero Killer: Stain"

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.210
And he didn't even upload it himself!

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.920
Now, when people think of villains,
they only remember the League of Villains!

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.090
They're wicked and gloomy! So unpleasant!

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.300
You're right, La Brava.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.630
Sometimes extreme and
violent actions fascinate people.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.760
That goes against my way of doing things...

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.560
However--

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.150
It's true that they have momentum.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.490
All of the videos related to them
have over 10,000 comments,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.860
while the comments on
my videos are things like--

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.070
He only works on iffy cases.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.870
Doesn't look like J-Store lost anything.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.700
He just keeps failing. It stresses me out.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.830
The scale's too small.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.210
Show us La Brava!

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.210
But I am not discouraged, La Brava!

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.710
Why not?

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.800
Because my next plan will surpass all of that!

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.590
How wonderful! Let me hear it, Gentle.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.930
What's your next plan?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.060
Great works are
constantly questioning the times.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.150
The place where it all began,
the place that made them the talk of the town...

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.730
That is where I will go next.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.110
"Prepping for the School Festival Is the Funnest Part"

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.570
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.910
The work study students
have extra classes, right?

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.580
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.700
Yeah!

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.570
Sorry.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.330
You don't have to apologize.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.040
We'll work on the school festival stuff here.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.750
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms" "Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.870
The dance choreography and costumes...
There's a lot to decide!

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.130
What do you think people will like?

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.300
We should do what's popular. Right, Jiro?

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.880
Hm...

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.050
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.220
Hey, did you hear?

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.930
Hero course Class 1-A is doing a concert.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.760
For us.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.220
General studies...

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.230
For us? What's that supposed to mean?

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.020
Aren't they thinking too much of themselves?

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.480
Seriously, they're too carefree.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.860
Even though they were attacked by villains,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.110
they went to training camp
nonchalantly and were attacked again...

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.820
They even had people injured.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.320
Thanks to that, even we had to go through a lot.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.580
Even though it was all their fault...
They've got some nerve...

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.660
The school festival is exactly one month away!

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.540
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.670
We don't have much time,
so we should decide various things today!

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.920
First, we need to decide on a song, huh?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.130
What should we do?

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.340
I don't know much about stuff like that,
so I'll go along with what you guys think.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.470
Same here.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.100
Anyway, since it's for everyone,
shouldn't we do a song most people know?

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.680
We should do something with a beat!

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.980
Something you can dance to!

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.810
If I put together everyone's opinions,

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.900
then we're looking at a four-on-the-floor
new rave type of club rock song.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.860
For dance music,
we should really be playing EDM,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.240
but you guys want to play instruments, right?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.610
Huh...?

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.120
Has anyone ever played bass
or drums or anything?

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.200
"silence"

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.330
Right.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.660
First, the backbone of a band is the drums,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.960
but I mainly play guitar,
so honestly, I'm still learning drums.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.590
Teaching a beginner and practicing myself
will be a lot to do in just a month.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.390
Oh, didn't you say you were made
to take music classes as a kid?

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.220
Huh?

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.970
Really? That's surprising!

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.600
Bakugo, try playing the drums a little.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.020
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.140
Like I'd do that.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.940
I hear it's pretty hard.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.320
Well?!

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.200
P-Perfect...

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.950
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.070
Wow...

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.660
There he is--Mr. Talented!

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.950
Bakugo's gotta be on the drums!

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.000
Huh?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.210
I'm not doing anything so stupid.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.630
Bakugo, please!

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.590
I mean, if you do it,
it'll definitely turn out good!

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.800
There's no way it'll be good!

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.050
It's that, right?

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.100
Some empty promise to let students
from other courses blow off steam?

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.020
For the cause of that stress to do that--

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.190
if that's not self-satisfaction, then what is?

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.810
There's no way they'd take that
quietly from people they're mad at!

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.650
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.940
Hey, you don't have to say it like that!

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.110
That's exactly what I'm talking about!

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.570
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.660
But...

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.530
It's true that we may not
have been considerate enough...

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.000
You didn't participate in the discussion,
so don't complain about it now.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.960
Doesn't it make you mad?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.000
It's not like we wanted to be
messed around with by the villains.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.340
Why do we have to think about how they feel?

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.550
If you guys are doing this to make
them feel better, then stop right now!

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.010
We've gotta hit 'em!

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.300
We're not here to make friends,
we're here to fight!

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.010
If we're gonna do this, we've gotta be serious--

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.930
Let's kill everyone in U.A. with our sound!

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.060
Bakugo!

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.520
Your reasoning is scary, but you'll do it?

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.690
This is serious!

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:53.980
Got it, super serious.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.530
You're not being honest with yourself!

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.320
I'm always serious.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.030
I see.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.280
Don't come, Deku!

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.250
At the summer training camp,
Bakugo was kidnapped by the villains...

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.080
He's been carrying a heavy burden, huh...?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.880
Isn't this great, Jiro?

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.840
Yeah.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.010
I'll do my best.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.050
Hey, Gentle, will you tell me now?

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.310
What'll we do for the next plan?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.850
In a month, if it's the same as past years,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.980
then there will be a school festival.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.730
The school has already been attacked
and has reinforced their security.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.940
At that school that is
a symbol of heroes today...

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.490
By "that school," could you mean...?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.950
If I show that I can sneak in there,

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.080
then I'm sure it'll become...

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.580
...a big deal.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.040
"Minoru Mineta"
"Quirk: Pop Off"
"He can pull ball-shaped objects from his head that can stick to anything and be used for offense or movement."

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.040
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 10/8"
"Height: 108 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Women"

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.050
"Fumikage Tokoyami"
"Quirk: Dark Shadow"
"He has a shadow-like monster inside him that can change shape elastically and fight with him."

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.050
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 10/30"
"Height: 158 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: Apples"

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.470
As part of my education,
I studied the piano from a young age.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.770
Will that be of any help?

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.850
Then Yao-momo, you'll be on the keyboards!

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.850
We've gotta have a synth for club music.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.520
Yao-momo, it'll be a big help!

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.150
I will do my best!

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.610
I was gonna have a girls
dance group with all the girls...

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.700
...but you'll be cute, so it's fine!

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.370
I'll play bass, so we just
need guitars and vocals, then.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.910
So everyone else will be in the dance?

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.870
Yeah. But will that be
enough to fire everyone up?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.750
In that video with the dance--

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.710
We've gotta put in some effects!

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.000
That.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.460
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice "

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.960
Effects?

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.380
For example, like this.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.600
See how they use sparks and streamers
and that disco ball to fire everyone up?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.680
Effects are there to set the mood!

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.140
Ooh, let's make it like the parades
at the happiest place on earth!

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.400
We can do it like that
with everyone participating!

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.940
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.400
We're using the gym for this, right?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.730
Yes, Mr. Aizawa has already
made the arrangements.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.820
Then, what if, what if--

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.820
Uraraka makes Todoroki and Kirishima float,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.910
and then Kirishima scrapes
at Todoroki's ice to chip away at it!

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.710
Then, Aoyama can be a disco ball...

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.330
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.170
...and it'll look like light's
twinkling down like stardust!

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.250
I call it "Team Snowmen"!

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.130
A human shaved-ice machine!

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.800
It's like the teaming up
we were talking about before!

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.300
I'm a disco ball?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.720
That's not bad!

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.060
The gym will look spectacular.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.270
Yes, I think it's a great idea!

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.020
In that case, we need people working
behind the scenes for the effects, huh?

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.980
Hey.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.110
Sorry we're late.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.230
We've finally made up all our classes.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.190
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.240
We can help out for real now!

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.950
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.950
Ribbit!

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.490
I see.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.240
We've decided on new rave
type club rock for the music, huh?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.620
I understand Jiro on bass
and Yaoyorozu on keyboards...

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.130
But Bakugo on drums is kind of...
how do I put it...?

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.040
Unexpected!

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.500
You got a problem with that?!

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.140
So, who will sing the all-important vocals?

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.550
Well, we haven't decided yet...

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.640
Huh? You're not going to sing, Jiro?

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.180
Huh?!

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.980
If it's vocals you want,
I can do it! It'll make me popular!

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.270
I can be a disco ball and sing!

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.860
Yeah! I can't play any instruments,
but I'm a pretty good singer!

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.650
♪ Man of the ship ♪

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.820
--♪ You, go get that ♪

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.700
--Isn't that a different genre?
--♪ You, go get that ♪

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.040
He's just yelling, isn't he?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.160
Falsetto?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.630
I'm with Ochaco. I think it should be you, Jiro!

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.750
When you were teaching us in your room,
your singing was super cool, too!

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.590
--Hey, don't make this harder
by making people expect--

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.470
--It's fine, it's fine!
--Hey, don't make this harder
by making people expect--

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.970
You're just gonna disregard
the shouts of our souls?

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.760
Just how good is she, huh? Huh?

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.430
I wanna hear your singing, Jiro!
Sing something for us!

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.060
My ears are so happy!

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.520
What a husky, sexy voice!

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.820
Right? Right?

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.610
All right!

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.320
It's unanimous, then!

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.320
Then, let's leave that aside...

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.910
So, we still need guitars!

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.990
I want two!

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.040
Yay! I wanna do it! It's so cool
to be able to play an instrument!

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.040
Let me do it!

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.500
I feel like I'd cut the strings.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.040
It's not "I wanna do it"! Are you gonna kill it?

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.670
Yeah, yeah, I totally will!

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.500
The guitar is the star of the band!

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.640
Because of my character design,
my hands won't reach!

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.050
I want to dance!

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.970
Me, too!

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.640
I can move pretty well with my tail.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.560
I want to work on effects with my Tape!

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.480
What a heartrending sound!

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.150
You can play? Why didn't you say anything?

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.450
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.030
I quit once at the F chord.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.290
The F chord is where many beginners
have a hard time when learning to play guitar!

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.870
Mineta, if you are giving up on the guitar,

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.370
then I will strum for you, as well.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.170
Do what you want, damn it.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.750
This is stupid. Stupid.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.050
Let's get this stupid festival over with.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.920
I hope you all break a nail!

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.630
Mineta! If I make a harem part
for you in the dance, will you do it?

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.680
I will. The school festival
can't come any sooner!

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.930
And so, after 1 a.m...

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.810
All right! Everyone's roles have been decided!

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:04.850
The band team...

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.820
The effects team...

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.360
The dance team...

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.780
Everyone, we'll be busy starting tomorrow!

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.240
Yeah!

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.870
"Lounge"
"In use"

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:25.500
I hear Class A's doing something like
a dance hall concert for the school festival?

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.870
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.000
It sounds fun.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.300
Yes. It looks like we'll be busy.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.670
That's one of the things
I'm looking forward to, too.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.840
So, what did you want to talk
about at a time like this?

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.850
I feel like it's been a while since
we've talked like this, just the two of us.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.190
At the work study...

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.860
I was able to force out
20% with my own strength...

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.150
It took a toll on my body,
and I could only use it for a short time,

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.200
but even then, I couldn't win.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.120
Far from it. If Eri hadn't been there,

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.500
I wouldn't have been able to move,
and I would've been defeated.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.210
I couldn't do anything in response
to the long-distance attacks.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.000
I tried thinking about it,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.590
but I don't know how
I should fight in my current state,

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.760
unable to use 100% of my strength.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.970
You're at a dead end, huh?

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.140
Yes.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.100
There's only one thing I can say...

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.520
You should also make long-distance attacks.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:33.740
I wish I could draw out the power
to change the weather like you, All Might...!

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.950
I've also been looking back
and thinking about various things.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.240
For your sake.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.120
Let's go outside.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.000
"School Grounds Forested Area"

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.000
I'll wait for you,
so go change into your gym clothes.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.590
You want me to use 20% here?

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.920
Yeah! Let's Full Cowling!

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.760
But...

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.640
...like I was saying earlier,
when I'm at 20%, my body starts to creak

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.560
and I end up not being able to move...

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.730
That's why I'm working hard
to build strength right now...

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.230
Forget that! Just go into Full Cowling!

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.900
Y-Yes, sir!

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.780
One For All, Full Cowling... 20%!

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.540
Send out one attack after
another in that state in that spot.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.550
Th-The wind pressure...

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:42.930
I was going to teach you this once
you passed an allowable limit of 15%.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.720
If you didn't figure
this out in that last fight,

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.940
either you must have been
fighting a very defensive match,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.520
or you can already send out the
pressured winds without breaking your body!

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.650
But... either way, my body...

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.280
Let's take a look at the stages
your body has gone through.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.830
"1. 100% on one body part"

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.910
One, use One For All at 100%
on one part of your body.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.830
"2. Control % on one body part"

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.960
Two, control the percentage
you use on one part of your body.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.880
"3. Control % on whole body"

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.130
Three, control the percentage you
use on your whole body continuously.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.340
"4. Shoot Style"

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:20.720
Four, use Shoot Style, which uses
your legs rather than your weaker arms.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.140
"5. Raise control to 8%"

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.890
Five, raise your control from 5% to 8%.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.770
Six, currently, if you force yourself,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.270
you can draw out up to 20% for a short time.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.440
And now, the essence of today's lesson--

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.020
Actually, I...

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.400
...am not continuously
putting out 100% of your power...

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.900
Right?

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.200
If All Might was always
at 100% for his every move,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.830
then he would leave shock waves
and disaster around him.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.290
That's it, right? It must be!

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.040
Since I can't hold 20% for very long...

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.330
...just at the moment of impact,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.550
I take number two, controlling
the percentage on one body part

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.720
and number six, drawing out
20% for a short time by forcing it...

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.010
"2. Control % on one body part"
"6. Forced 20% can be drawn out for a short time"

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.470
...and put them together!

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:09.470
It's easy to say, but you need to draw out
power right at your limit in an instant.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.850
You'll need even more delicate
control than you've had until now.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.610
And now, I have a question
for you, Young Midoriya--

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.030
What part of the human body
can you move with the most precision?

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.490
That's right.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.410
You should practice control with those fingers.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.700
One For All, Full Cowling, change to 8%...

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.000
And then, just for the instant of impact...

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.330
...change to 20%!

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.970
You won't be able to get
the hang of it right away.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.470
Thank you, All Might...

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.680
I can see my path now...!

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.310
Once I master controlling my power...

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.320
I can go beyond, to the next stage...!

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.360
Okay, we're here!

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.200
It's okay! Everyone's nice here!

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.750
Welcome to U.A. High School!

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.720
Gentle Video.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.760
Dear listeners, what kind
of tea do you drink at what times?

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.260
Before and after a job,

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.060
I always choose the brand
based on the size of the job.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:04.440
And this one is called Royal Flush.
Do you know what that means?

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.780
That you're cool because
you have discriminating taste?

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.650
In the next video I put out,

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:14.870
an alarm will sound, not just to
my dear listeners, but to all of society.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.290
Please wait with caution!

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
"Preview"

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.420
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.920
We're pressed for time as
we get ready for the school festival,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.050
but Eri's here to visit us!

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:32.760
But Gentle Criminal is making steady
progress on the preparations for his plan.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.560
When Gentle finishes drinking
the legendary tea, a crisis will arise.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.600
The name of that tea is...

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.770
Next time, "Golden Tips Imperial."

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.270
He's after U.A., and the school.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:51.660
"Next time: Golden Tips Imperial"

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.690
Go beyond!

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.660
Plus Ultra!
