WEBVTT

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.830
At Red Riot's debut fight the other day...!

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.210
A type I'd never seen
before was shot into Tamaki.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.130
A drug that destroys Quirks.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.180
And after analyzin' the contents,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.600
we discovered that human blood
and cells were inside!

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
In other words,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.350
that effect came from a person...
someone's Quirk?

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.940
A Quirk that destroys Quirks...

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.980
The young head, Chisaki's Quirk is Overhaul.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.280
Disassemble... A Quirk that lets
him break things and then fix them.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.240
And a bullet that can break down Quirks.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.240
Chisaki has a daughter named Eri.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.500
There are no records or details about her birth,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.120
but when Mirio and Midoriya encountered her,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.460
she had a large number of bandages
wrapped around her arms and legs.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.800
We're wondering if this Chisaki bastard

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.470
is turning his daughter's body
into bullets and selling them.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.890
Wouldn't this have been resolved already
if those two had just taken the child?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.060
The ones most frustrated here
right now are these two.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.230
We will definitely take Eri next time...

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.400
...and protect her!

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.200
That's right. That is our goal.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.130
A few days after discovering
the shocking truth...

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.130
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.840
While the pro heroes that teamed up
with Sir Nighteye were pinpointing

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.890
the location of the young head
of the Shie Hassaikai, Chisaki, and Eri,

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.140
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.980
we were on standby.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.440
And we were absolutely forbidden

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.070
to say anything about our work studies.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.740
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.610
The movements of the work
study group are especially sharp.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.450
They figured something out while outside!

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.250
Hey, what'd you figure out?! Tell me!

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.750
Sorry, I can't!

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.250
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.830
Kirishima,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.040
Uraraka, and Asui.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.920
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.960
Everyone who was there at that time

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.090
would be part of the operation to save Eri.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.180
That said,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.220
"Tamaki Amajiki - Quirk: Manifest"
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"
"Nejire Hado - Quirk: Surge"

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.480
apart from the Big Three,
who are at least as strong as the pros,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.600
the rest of you probably
won't have big parts to play.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.940
Asui, Uraraka, Kirishima.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.450
You three aren't here of your own volition.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.360
What would you like to do?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.200
Mr--I mean, Eraser Head!

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.120
After hearing that,
I can't say I'm not going to help!

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.250
If you aren't going to say we can't do it,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.500
then I would like to help!

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.830
Since the heroes had you
participate in the meeting,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.880
I think they have recognized
you first years' abilities.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.340
In fact, I saw firsthand how a first year
could shine much brighter than me.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.590
You start going off on that
whenever you get the chance.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.140
If I can help that girl with my power
even a little, then I'll do it, Eraser Head!

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.060
It's fine as long as you understand.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.110
Our goal this time is only
to rescue the girl, Eri.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.940
We won't step in further than that.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.740
It is the opinion of the police and Nighteye

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.870
that the League of Villains and the
Shie Hassaikai are not in a partnership,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.620
so the chances are low that the
League will be involved in this time's raid.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.590
But in case they're wrong,
and the League ends up involved,

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.920
then you guys are out.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.300
Roger!

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.550
Everyone is being moved
to action by Eri's rescue.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.350
On the other hand...

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.900
If you continue like this,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.730
you'll face off against a villain

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.320
and die an unspeakably gruesome death!

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.530
It didn't seem like a good time to ask Nighteye.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.120
Since we were now forbidden
to talk about our work studies,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.830
I couldn't ask All Might about it.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.870
I can't talk to Kirishima or the
other work study students, either.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.000
Eri's situation and All Might's situation...

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.960
They're both too heavy for me.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.590
D... Don't go...

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.890
I had to put everything I had into rescuing Eri.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.560
But back then, my mind was too scattered,
and I was barely holding it together...

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.730
You're not gonna eat?

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.150
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.730
I am! I'm e-eating!

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.320
Are you okay?

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.740
You've been looking gloomy ever
since you started your work study.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.410
Really?

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.300
If you ever feel hopeless, let me know.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.090
We're friends, right?

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.590
If you ever feel hopeless,
make sure you let us know.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.970
We're friends, right?

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.140
That's what you told me back then,
when I was being foolish.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.850
Before the internships...

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.360
--Hey!
--Midoriya...

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.070
Sorry! I'm okay. It's nothing.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.580
I can't tell you.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.330
But thank you, Iida!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.670
Regret... sorrow...

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.420
The chaotic feelings I'd stored up in my heart

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.260
overflowed a little.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.050
Heroes don't cry!

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.390
No, I think heroes cry
when they need to, too. Probably.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.100
Do you want half of my soba?

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.520
You can have some of my beef stew, too!

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.770
Thanks...

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.020
You want green onion, too?

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.860
Yeah, thanks.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.110
And wasabi?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.990
Yeah.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.820
"The same day"

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.700
"Near a Shie Hassaikai facility"

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.090
"Pro Hero - Rock Lock"

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.010
We have found groups
with connections to the Hassaikai

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.050
or land owned by the Hassaikai

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.050
and made as thorough a list as possible.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.010
I would like you all to investigate each place

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.930
and narrow the list down to possible locations.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.810
Possible locations, huh?

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.030
"Pro Hero - Fat Gum - Quirk: Fat Adsorption"

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.360
As you investigate possible locations,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.110
I would like you to
pay attention to the following:

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:16.320
1. Is this a place where bullets
that destroy Quirks could be made?

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.790
2. Do people and goods
go in and out frequently?

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.330
"Pro Hero - Ryukyu"

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.380
3. Are there large numbers
of unauthorized drugs circulating?

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.590
"Pro Hero - Bubble Girl" "Pro Hero - Centipeder"

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.300
The Hassaikai is refining their detailed plan

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.970
"Pro Hero - Sir Nighteye - Quirk: Foresight"

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.590
working quietly and deeply to carry it out.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.890
Please proceed with the utmost care.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.640
Tsukauchi, how are things on the police side?

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.770
I see, please continue your investigation.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.030
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.780
Half of the places on
the list are clear, huh...?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.200
Then we'll have to search the rest carefully...

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.050
Hurry...

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.920
Please hurry...

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.090
...and find...

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.310
...where Eri is...!

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.890
"Two days later"     "Late at night"

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.670
Did you all get the message?

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.670
Yeah.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.750
We did.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.630
The day we move.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.260
They did a good job finding out
in such a short time.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.890
Mirio.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.490
Let's do our best.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.950
Eri...

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.660
This time, we'll definitely...

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.660
...definitely save you!

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.920
Definitely!

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.050
"Ochaco Uraraka"
"Quirk: Zero Gravity"
"She can make people and things weightless with the pads on the tips of her fingers."

"Birthday: 2/12"
"Height: 150 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Jello"

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.430
Today's weather will be sunny.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.020
It will be a nice day to enjoy
the sunshine, but in the evening--

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.060
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.100
Tokoyami's in Kyushu, so it's expected,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.770
but the other work study
students are absent, too, huh?

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.360
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.020
Midoriya's been acting weird lately, hasn't he?

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.570
Especially this morning.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.530
Yeah.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.780
He looked at his fish with
a really serious expression.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.910
It wasn't just Midoriya.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.580
Kirishima, Uraraka, and Tsu also looked
like they were brooding over something.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.710
You think they're after something big?

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.090
Even if they were, they'll be with pros.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.750
That's true.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.960
I guess we don't have to worry about them...

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.090
Huh?! The Eri girl is in their stronghold?

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.930
By stronghold, you mean...

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.600
The residence of the head of the Hassaikai...

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.730
What, so our investigations were for nothing?

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.570
No, we were able to
get new information, as well.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.360
How were you able to confirm this?

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:44.370
"Gung-Ho! Glitter Squad 10!"

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.120
A member of the Hassaikai went to
a nearby department store the other day

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.490
and bought playthings aimed at young girls.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.200
Huh?

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.540
What the heck...?

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.960
Maybe he just likes things like that!

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.170
There are all types in this world, Nighteye!

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.750
Anyway, why did you buy one, too?

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:03.470
No, he said something that no one
who has that sort of hobby would say--

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.060
Hey, do you have any
Glitter-something-or-other toys?

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:12.520
"Cashier"

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.390
The ones little girls like.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.020
Do you mean Glitter Squad?

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.690
Oh yeah, that!

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.560
I remember now, "Squad Action! Glitter Squad!"

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.480
Where are the toys?

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.650
I'm sorry, the Squad Action! Glitter Squad!
series was from a number of years ago.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.740
The current series
is Gung-Ho! Glitter Squad 10!...

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.780
What a pain.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.120
Oh, well. Where's that, then?

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.830
They have them right here.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.670
What the...?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.710
I like it, too.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.040
Glitter Squad.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.600
You ended up using Foresight anyway?!

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.440
I believe I said I would use it once we
narrowed it down so that we could be sure.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.400
Anyway, this means it's been decided, right?

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.910
We know for sure when they'll be
there thanks to our stakeouts.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.830
We also worked with
the police to get a warrant.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.750
All that's left...

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.370
...is to get in there!

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.250
He took my line!

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.710
Deku.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.470
Midoriya.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.140
--Let's do this! We're gonna do it!

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.600
--What's with those moves?!
--Let's do this! We're gonna do it!

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.980
--He's back to normal.
--We're gonna do it! We're gonna do it!

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.850
--Look!
--We're gonna do it! We're gonna do it!

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.060
--We're gonna do it! We're gonna do it!

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.400
We're gonna do it!

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.690
Let's do this!

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.990
Mirio...

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:52.990
You've been regretting what happened
back then this whole time, haven't you?

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.580
But it's because you held your ground

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.880
that we were able to be completely prepared.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.170
Regret and failure are part of life...

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.600
...but what's important it
what you do afterward.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.810
I don't know if it's possible
to change the future.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.610
But you can change the past.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:30.870
By interpreting the past,
it's possible to change how you see things.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.200
Mirio,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.080
shine.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.670
You are a man who can do that!

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.840
This time, for sure!

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.340
For sure!

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.180
Now, let us go!

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.640
"At the same time"

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.690
"Shie Hassaikai"
"Residence of the head - Underground"

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.690
"Villain - Chronostasis"

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.570
Yes. Heroes gathered
this early in the morning...

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.440
The police are also bustling around.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.950
Boss, it looks like they've
gotten wind of this place.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.950
"Villain - Mimic"
"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.620
They're here, huh?

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.660
Proceed according to plan.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.080
Very good, sir.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.160
Get ready.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.540
Yessir.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.960
Boss, where are you going?

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.630
Just taking care of something.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.300
"In front of the police station"

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.970
After Nighteye used Foresight
on the Hassaikai member,

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.770
we discovered the existence of
undocumented underground facilities

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.390
at the head of the Hassaikai's residence.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.980
We were able to confirm that
the girl we are trying to rescue

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.730
is being held in one of the rooms there.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.900
Although we were unable to
uncover the entire underground layout,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.280
the path the man took is
the shortest route to our target,

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.410
and it's the best intel we could have

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.410
for searching the
Hassaikai's expansive stronghold.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.000
However, even if we head there,
if they use their Quirks freely on us,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.840
it would make the search difficult.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.050
So, we have made a list
to the best of our knowledge

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.010
of Quirks registered to Hassaikai members.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.930
Please memorize this list.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.760
It's nice to be able to just pull this out, huh?

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.060
We don't want to give them time to hide,

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:25.350
so we want to identify and apprehend
all the members as quickly as possible.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.570
Things are moving fast now, huh?

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.530
You're energetic for how early this is...

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.900
I'm getting nervous.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.950
From detective work to
cooperation with the police...

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.620
There's so much I don't know.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.950
Right? Isn't it mysterious?

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.330
Yeah, schools don't really teach
you much about things like this.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.420
I had a hard time when I first started.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.630
Yeah.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.090
All the pros are so calm.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.300
Is it 'cause they're used to this?

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.340
Hey, I haven't seen
Gran Torino all morning...

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.970
I wonder where he is.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.100
Apparently, he cannot come anymore.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.350
Huh?!

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:06.190
It looks like the League, which Tsukauchi
is keeping an eye on, is on the move.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.860
But well, we have enough people, too,

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.070
so it should not impede us.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.940
I see...

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.450
Maybe we can catch the Hassaikai
and the League of Villains all at once!

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.450
Yeah!

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.030
All right!

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.240
Hey.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.620
Mr--raser Head!

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.710
I will move with the Nighteye Agency.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.580
Do you understand what that means?

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.340
I'll watch you.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.470
If you're going to do this,
do this properly, Midoriya.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.010
Yes, sir!

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.550
Heroes!

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.850
Things might get a little violent.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.190
If you see even a hint of
suspicious behavior or resistance,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.650
please deal with it immediately!

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.610
Tamaki, eat this. It's swordfish.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.320
Why swordfish...?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.190
Thanks, I'll be sure to eat it.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.860
We're up against gangsters
who have survived until now.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.780
Don't let your guard down

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.040
and carry out your respective tasks.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.210
We will commence the operation at 08:30!

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.790
All hands, move out!

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.320
Sorry, Pops.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.070
It looks like things are about to get noisy.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.580
"Commence!!!"

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.410
Once they've read the warrant, charge in!

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.580
I'm counting on everyone to move swiftly.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.590
He keeps saying the same thing over and over.
It's like he doesn't trust us.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.460
You know that's not what he means.
Stop being mean.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.920
In the first place,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.470
these yakuza guys are
living secretly in the shadows.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.260
If they see all these heroes and police,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.310
they might just curl up on themselves.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.980
Are you all right?

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.030
I'm fine... thanks...

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.030
What do you want?

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.790
Bringing all these people
so early in the morning...

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.040
Hey, wait! Hang on a second!

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.660
Did they already notice us?

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.670
Forget about that, let's just
all hold them back together!

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.460
I feel a little more awake now. Jeez...

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.510
Get back!

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.260
What do you people want?!

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.110
Anyway,

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.650
we shouldn't split up our forces here.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.950
Ryukyu Agency will take care of him.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.410
The rest of you go now,
while you have the chance!

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.700
Let's go support Ryukyu!

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.490
Right!

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.160
Okay! Everyone, get in! Quickly, quickly!

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.910
It's heroes and the police!

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.370
We have a warrant to search your premises

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.420
on suspicion of the manufacture
and sale of illegal drugs!

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.000
A search warrant?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.460
Who cares?!

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.430
Stop resisting!

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.970
There was that big guy, too...
Are none of them scared?

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.690
Use the shortest route

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.520
to get to the target!

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.690
Midoriya, let's go!

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.480
Right!

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.990
Eri, wait for us.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.160
This time, we'll definitely...

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.030
...definitely save you!

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.670
I can hear it faintly.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.010
The sound of a large number of people
running in the same direction.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.470
Which means they already know
where they want to go.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.720
They probably already know
where this place is, too.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.430
It happened sooner than I thought it would.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.890
We cannot be found right now.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.810
"They acted violently on their own."

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.570
Let's make that the story.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.400
That's what those pieces were groomed for.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.110
The Eight Bullets of the Hassai Group.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.200
This power is...

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.220
While they're buying time for us,

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.890
we'll take Eri and everything with her

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.680
and hide her away completely.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.100
"Preview"

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.350
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.440
The mandatory investigation is underway.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.940
Chisaki sent some underlings
calledÂ the "Hassai Group" after us.Â

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.400
The thought of leaving Amajiki
behind to face them alone kills us,

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.030
but we have to keep moving.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:37.700
Every minute--every second--counts
in our mission to save Eri!

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.710
Next time, "Suneater of the Big Three."

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.880
It's an explosion of the
U.A. Big Three's true power,

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.670
and of Amajiki and Togata's friendship!Â

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.130
"Next time: Suneater of the Big Three"

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.130
Go beyond!

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.130
Plus Ultra!
