U.A...

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.610
I wish to turn myself in.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.190
Turn yourself in?

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.820
I've seen him before.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.740
He's that villain who's quick to escape--

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.990
The one who posts those impertinent videos.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.910
Gentle!

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.490
Anyone else with you?

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.080
No.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.870
What are those injuries
and that gouged out ground?

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.960
I told you. I tripped and fell.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.340
Just two of you?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.340
That's right.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.960
"That's right"?!

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.970
There's one more, isn't there?

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.180
I can smell one of our students!

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.810
Where's our student?!

"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.450
I have committed many crimes up until now...

"Villain - La Brava - Quirk Love"

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.550
...but my greatest crime was to kidnap
and brainwash an innocent girl.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.050
Giving myself a nice-sounding
reason for my self-interest,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.510
I've lived this whole time for myself.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.190
Betting my feelings, fighting,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.230
reduced until all that's
left at the bottom of me...

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.780
...is a heart that can
feel... for someone else.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.700
Izuku Midoriya,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.660
I'm glad that you were the one
I was able to trade blows with last.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.040
All the blame lies on me.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.380
So please, pardon Manami Aiba.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.590
Gentle...! For my sake...!

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.640
No... No...

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.850
I...

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.520
I love Gentle!

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.190
That's not fair, Gentle.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.020
Even though you know that
I wouldn't want to cause you any trouble...!

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.230
What about your injuries?

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.990
Were you fighting?

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.330
I realized that he was going
to play a joke on U.A.,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.120
"Pro Hero - Hound Dog - Quirk: Dog"

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.630
"Pro Hero - Ectoplasm - Quirk: Clones"

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.290
so we had a small disagreement.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.130
But...

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.300
...it's fine now.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.140
Hound Dog, Ectoplasm C, any irregularities?

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.440
Snipe.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.520
Please report.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.280
Some video streamer who was being
a nuisance wants to turn himself in.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280
What the heck?

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.780
I don't get it either!

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.070
Huh?

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.410
Anyway, this is not an emergency.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.950
Please continue to be vigilant.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.790
You can tell us more at the police station!

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.210
Izuku Midoriya...

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.510
I was once in the hero course at school, too.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.970
Gentle Criminal is the mere shadow
of someone who was once a hero dropout.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.690
Why?

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.980
If it's for your dream,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.150
then you can steal
people's hard work and passion,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.030
and the smile of a girl who
doesn't know how to smile yet?!

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.700
I'm in no position to say this,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.000
but I hope your feelings reach
those you want them to reach.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.800
A bright future, huh?

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.800
All Might was worried about you.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.640
Class A's performance starts at 10, right?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.680
Right now, it's 9:16... 9:17.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.310
Well, from here, you can get
to school in five or six minu--

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.070
Um, sorry, I left the bag
of things I came out to buy...

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.440
Where is it? I'll go with you.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.820
Gentle Criminal...

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.910
He was hard to fight...

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.660
Midoriya's not back yet?

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.290
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.250
Why's that guy taking so
long buying one thing?

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.750
Jeez!

The mere shadow of someone
who was once a hero dropout.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.970
I figured out why he was so hard to fight.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.640
Because I could've turned out like him.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.470
Because Gentle and I had a lot
of the same thoughts and feelings.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.310
He did it thinking of La Brava...

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.940
As for me...

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.320
Midoriya, you're late!

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.240
Aoyama! Sorry!

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.700
Why are you so beat up?

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.990
I fell!

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.910
What are you doing, clumsy boy?

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.950
Here, change your clothes.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.500
Thanks.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.620
Wait, those scratches!

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.880
Do you plan to perform covered in dirt?

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.050
If you do, then everyone will be worrying
about you rather than enjoying the show.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.630
You'll still make it even
if you get those healed first, right?

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.640
I wonder what Class 1-A's
performance will be like.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.810
I'm kind of excited to see.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.810

They're not here to have a good time,

they're here to evaluate Class A critically,

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.980
so they don't see this as entertainment...

I'm sure he'll come out again.

I'm sorry.

I always admired it...

But I didn't want the music
you taught me to go to waste,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.670
and I love music, too, so...

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.670
I couldn't tell you...

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.880

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.590
...you can do what you want.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.510
Your mom and I became musicians
because that's what we love.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.730
At first, it always starts out
as something as trivial as thinking,

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.980
"It's so cool!" or "I did it!"

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.520
Think about what you'll
be able to do for a long time.

What can you do for others
with your own sound?

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.950

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.230
I was in such a hurry...
I left without my cellphone...

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.770
"All Might"
"All Might"
"All Might"

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.270
You'll be surprised
when you check your missed calls.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.610
I have a rough idea of
what happened from Ecto's report.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.450
Don't think what you did was "correct."

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.990
You weren't really injured, and in the end,
the school festival is continuing.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.870
But that's just the result!

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.500
You're a hero with a
provisional license and a U.A. student.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.080
If you were going to fight,
you should've relied on us!

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.300
We have things we need to protect, too!

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.050
Yes, sir.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.050
Why do you look so gloomy?

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.380
Get out of here!

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.010
If it's going to continue,
then make sure you enjoy it!

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.850
Yes, sir!

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.270
Hound Dog, thanks--

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.600
All Mi... grr...!

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.320
You only forget human speech
when you are truly angry.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.410
Hey, good work!

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.990
You know what?

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.240
At first there was
a loud noise and it was scary,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.870
but then everyone was hopping with the dance

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.620
and then there was a
flash and Deku, you went away,

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.500
but then it got cold and
then there was a spinning light

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:11.640
and a girl's voice said "wow"
and I said "wow" too...

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.810
I'm glad you had a good time.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.860
You shouldn't be!
Are you slacking off now after being late?

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.860
Carry this!

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.570
Oh, sorry! I'll take it!

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.070
Take mine, too.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.780
Class A!

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.610
We had a lot of fun!

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.200
Oh, great! Thanks!

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.330
Yeah... It was fun...

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.700
Good job.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.830
Sorry!

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.420
We watched it to criticize it!

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.250
I'm really sorry!

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.010
They didn't have to come to say that...

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.550
We won.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.340
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.260
I wonder if they're some of the people
Mr. Aizawa was talking about who were stressed.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.720
If they were, then Iida,
our feelings reached them!

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.930
Yeah!

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.810
But no matter what their reason,
it was because they watched us!

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.480
I'm sure there are those who didn't watch.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.100
Let's not let this end today
and let our feelings--

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.770
It's fine, isn't it?

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.900
We heard about what you guys
wanted to do when you planned this.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.570
We got it.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.240
Now, we'll tell the others.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.570
I mean, it really was fun!

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.740
Those of us who watched it
will pass on your feelings.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.200
That'll be great!

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.660
Thank you for your kindness!

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.330
I don't like it.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.580
Find the guys who didn't
watch and bring them here!

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.670
It's fine, stop that. Stop it, jeez.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:30.090
Hurry up and finish cleaning up all the ice!

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.970
Oh, sorry! Mineta, you've
been on edge this whole time.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.590
If we don't hurry,

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.350
then we won't be able to get
good seats for the beauty pageant!

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:42.640
Kendo!

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.020
Kendo, who can blast you away in one hit!

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.110
"Itsuka Kendo - Quirk: Big Fist"

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.270
She tears her gorgeous dress
for this martial arts demonstration!

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.610
The perfect coexistence
of strength and beauty!

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.200
What a wonderful performance!

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.410
How dull! You don't know anything, do you?

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.710
To try and compete with me with that!

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.670
Support course third year
and beauty pageant queen!

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.170
She uses advanced techniques
to show off her face!

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.840
A stunning performance!

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.090
What kind of performance is this?

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:18.720
It just got harder to tell, right?

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.640
Dazzling splendor is the goal of beauty!

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.350
Oh, third year... not bad...

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.570
I heard everyone liked your play. Good job!

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.610
You too!

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.400
Next, we have third year, Nejire Hado!

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.490
"Nejire Hado - Quirk: Surge"

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.490
"Tamaki Amajiki - Quirk: Manifest"

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.870
Nejire!

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.990
Hado... People are just animals...

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.950
Just think of them as mammals,
and you'll feel more relaxed...

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.790
Nejire lost last year because
she tried to be flashier than Kenranzaki.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.670
Kenranzaki's strength is being flashy.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.130
Nejire has her own strength!

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.930
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.550
It's Uraraka! And Tsu!

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.560
Togata and Eri!

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.930
Everyone looks so surprised.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.600
It's so strange...

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.020
Looking at her like this...

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:16.740
Hado really looks... like an innocent fairy.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.490
So pretty...

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.120
What a magical dance in the air!

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.000
She pulled me in!

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.380
Vote for one of these contestants!

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.630
Results will be announced at 5 p.m.!
It's the closing event!

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.010
Kendo from Class B!
Vote more than once for Kendo from Class B!

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.640
She'll be disqualified!

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.050
Woo-hoo! Tonight's gonna be great!

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.220
Class C's haunted maze looks crazy!

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.140
Wanna go?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.140
Yeah!

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.270
I'm not going to that.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.690
There's an obstacle course!

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:49.770
Crepes!

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.860
We've still got a lot to enjoy!

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.190
Yeah!

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.090
"Beauty Pageant Results"

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.190
Thanks for today! It was fun!

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.400
Yeah.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.820
Eri.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.530
Surprise!

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.490
A candy apple!

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.370
They were selling them?

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.750
I couldn't find any!

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.540
Looking at the program,
I thought maybe there wouldn't be any,

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.250
so I bought ingredients for it
when I went out this morning.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.380
It was easier to make than I expected.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.590
The only thing I couldn't find at the
convenience store was food coloring,

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.010
so I borrowed some from Sato.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.100
Well, you should be able
to see her again soon.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.980
It's even sweeter!

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.190
I'll make it again.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.900
Look forward to it!

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.230
I will!

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.620
You taught yourself how to do this?

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.330
Yes.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.290
I can't believe it! What's your job?

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.460
La Brava...

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.500
Do you feel like using this talent
for the good of the world?

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.130
No.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.640
I only want to help Gentle.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.850
You can test for brainwashing really easily.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.850
Don't tell stupid lies.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.150
She really does love you.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.940
You had a lot of failed attempts,
but with all the crimes you committed,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.980
both you and the girl--

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.150
Aiba has never been involved directly.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.030
We are not equally guilty.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.370
So your love is mutual, huh?

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.160
Oh, dear.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.500
High school dropout, former
hero course student,

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:43.000
twisted until you became a person
who uploaded videos of crimes, huh?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.670
I couldn't help but remember my dream.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.390
Even if I took the wrong path...

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.100
Then, it's good that we stopped you today.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.270
Guys who say you there
are no do-overs in life

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.730
are either those who don't want to,

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.940
or those who're impatient
and want results fast.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.740
Want some tea?

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.160
Black tea please...

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.790
It's just cheap tea!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.290
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.550
The Japanese Hero Billboard Chart!

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.050
It's a ranking of active heroes
based on cases resolved,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.050
service to society,
percentage of citizen support,

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.350
and other factors.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.680
Now that All Might has retired,
the rankings are fluctuating a lot.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.770
The one chosen to be the new number one is...

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.770
Next time, "Japanese Hero Billboard Chart."

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.650
The Wing Hero: Hawks makes
his first appearance!

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.580
"Next time: Japanese Hero Billboard Chart"

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.820
Go beyond!

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.580
Plus Ultra!
