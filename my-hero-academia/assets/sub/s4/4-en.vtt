WEBVTT

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.640
Oh, heroes!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.060
It's the boy who was in
the U.A. sports festival on TV.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.270
I-I'm nervous...

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.070
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.980
You must've at least gone on
patrol at your internship, right?

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.780
Oh, was the League of Villains
attack too traumatic?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.030
No, but for various reasons,
I wasn't able to experience the basics...

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.030
Really? That's strange, right?

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.580
But don't worry!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.500
Sir and Bubble Girl are the ones
actually watching the target today.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.000
We're just on patrol!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.960
I'll teach you a bunch of stuff.
Stick with me!

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
Even so, why didn't
All Might say anything to me?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.430
...he should have had let Mirio
inherit One For All after all.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640
There are reasons that make it
hard for me to talk to him.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.890
All Might and Nighteye...

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.190
Just what in the world
happened between them...?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.860
Now that I think about it, we haven't
told each other our hero names, huh?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.400
Th-That's true...

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.360
I'm Deku.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.280
"Deku? Deck?"

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.070
Deku? Deck?

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.160
You okay with that?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.410
I am.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.080
I'm Lemillion.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.830
I don't have to save everyone,
but 1,000,000...

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.950
Not all, but a million--

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.000
That's what I want to do,
so that's why I chose Lemillion!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.590
Once we put on our costumes and
go out into the streets, we're heroes.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.630
Don't let your guard down, Deku!

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.920
I won't, Lemillion!

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.270
Sorry, that must've hurt.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.690
Can you stand? Are you okay?

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.160
She's trembling?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.620
Now, you know...

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.580
...you can't go around
causing trouble for the heroes.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.630
Be careful not to let them suspect anything.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.630
No way...

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.640
My long work study...

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.010
...had begun.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.190
I'm sorry about my daughter, hero.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.780
"Villain - Kai Chisaki - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.490
She likes to play around a lot
and keeps getting hurt.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.030
I don't know what to do with her.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.410
Shie Hassaikai's Chisaki...

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.370
The man Nighteye is after...

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.210
Your hood and mask came off again.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.210
Maybe the sizing's off?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.300
We're sorry, too, for bumping into her.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.420
Oh yeah, my expression...!

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.840
My "no way" feeling showed up on my face.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.720
If he suspects anything,
it'll impede Nighteye's work.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.720
With that lovely mask,
you must be from the Hassaikai, right?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.520
You guys are famous around here.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.350
Yes, don't worry about the mask.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.600
I'm sensitive to filth.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.400
It's my first time seeing you two heroes.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.860
Right! We're still new,
so we're pretty nervous.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.450
Now, stand up, partner!

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.910
Let's head toward a future
we haven't seen yet!

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.700
He's obviously on his guard.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.540
I can't tell him Sir's name.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.870
What agency do you belong to?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.250
We're students!

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.420
We're still so new that it would be
presumptuous to identify with an agency.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.420
We're just gaining some experience
in different places for our internships.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.050
Anyway, we need to finish patrolling
this division by lunch. Let's go!

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.510
Right!

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.060
D... Don't go...

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.810
U-Um...

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.020
Your daughter... seems scared...

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.780
It's because she just got a scolding.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.030
Stop with the extra suspicion.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.160
Let's go!

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.740
Wait, but...

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.290
This girl... She's grabbed
me and won't let go.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.870
Her bandages don't seem like
they're from playing too much...

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.460
She falls a lot.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.630
For such a small child to be trembling
like this without making a sound...

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.550
I don't think that's normal...

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.890
Please don't force your own "normal"
on other people's families.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.640
Everyone has different dispositions, right?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.020
Stop it.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.860
Chisaki obviously doesn't want you to pry.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.230
If he becomes more cautious,
then he'll be even less likely to show himself.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.650
Let's just let it go.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.240
No, he'll be more suspicious then.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.320
It's unnatural!

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.950
A hero wouldn't just let a scared child go.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.040
Once we put on our costumes
and go out into the streets, we're...

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.710
...heroes.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.460
What are you doing to this girl?

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.600
Jeez, heroes are so sensitive
to the subtle signs in people, huh?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.230
Very well.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.020
It's embarrassing to talk about it.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.900
People are watching here,
so will you come this way with me?

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.870
Actually, recently,
I've had a lot of problems with Eri.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.240
She just keeps defying me
no matter what I say.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.500
Abuse...?

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.960
Parenting, huh? It must be hard.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.500
Yes, children are hard to understand.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.960
They feel like they can
and will become someone...

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.800
They seriously think that...

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.850
Huh?

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.520
What, done with your tantrum already?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.360
Huh? Um, Eri...?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.820
She's always like this.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.870
I'm sorry you had to
listen to my problems, too.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.040
Sorry for the trouble.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.330
Well, do your best at work.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.410
Wait--

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.290
Why...?

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.090
We're not going after them.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.210
Didn't you notice?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.420
He showed his killing intent
to pull that girl back to him.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.720
If we chase them too far,
it'll be even harder to catch him.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.760
Let's ask Sir what to do.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.690
Man, even though they're weak,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.530
this is what you'd expect
from the surviving yakuza, huh?

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.940
The walls are high and
there aren't many windows...

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.200
They live in a nice house.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.580
"Pro Hero - Sir Nighteye - Quirk: Foresight"

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.280
It's been a week and a half
since we started watching them.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.740
There are less people
going in and out than usual.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.200
What?!

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.500
"Mirio Togata"

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.120
"Pro Hero - Bubble Girl"

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.540
It's Million... He says they
came into contact with Chisaki...

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.420
The young people these days
are sicker than ever.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.210
Chrono, prepare the bath.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.590
Yes, sir.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.300
I-I'm sorry, Boss!

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.470
I just took my eyes off her
for a second, and that kid escap--

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.600
And clean that up.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.850
Yes, sir.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.020
This is maddening...

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.940
They're all sick with hero syndrome...

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.320
Sorry! It was an accident!

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.530
I never thought we'd run into him

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.610
like running into a
transfer student at a crossroads...

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.360
No, this was my fault.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.030
We could've avoided this if I'd used
Foresight on you two beforehand.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.830
Anyway, I'm just glad you're all right.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.790
If you'd acted carelessly and made him
suspicious, you might've been in danger.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.540
It didn't seem that scary...

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.880
The other day,
as a band of robbers was escaping,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.590
there was a truck accident
that involved some people.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.220
The people involved were Chisaki
and others from the Hassaikai.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.050
But there were zero casualties.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.810
Those from the band of robbers
felt intense pain and passed out,

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.180
but for some reason, they were uninjured,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.600
and even chronic ailments like rheumatism
and cavities were completely gone.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.730
They thought this was due to Chisaki's Quirk,

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.440
but because they caught
the villains and no one was injured,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.700
there wasn't anything to accuse him of.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.120
But they said that all the money that
was stolen burned up and nothing was left.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.330
The police found no sign
of a crime in that regard,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.410
but either way, it seemed suspicious,

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.290
so Nighteye Agency started watching them.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.590
We don't know what they're thinking,
but we do know that they act when they must.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.960
Oh, right, Sir!

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.050
I guess this is a lucky break,
but we got some new intel, right?

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.140
Chisaki has a daughter!

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.760
A daughter?

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.020
He called her "Eri."

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.600
Her arms and legs were wrapped in bandages...

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.940
I don't know anything about her,
but she was asking for help...

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.900
If there was any way we could protect her...

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.240
Don't think so arrogantly.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.740
That's...

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.870
Haste makes waste.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.540
If you rush to chase after them,
then they'll be more likely to escape.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.330
You're not so special that you can save
anyone you want whenever you want.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.090
Currently, we are also requesting
that other agencies team up with us.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.590
First, we must predict
what our opponent will do

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.840
and after analyzing it, arrange for
the most complete preparations possible.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.760
This world isn't so lenient that
you can save her with good intentions.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.100
The truly wise villains hide in the shadows.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.270
Know that sometimes, things will take time.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.230
The two of you should
go back to the office today.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.030
Bubble, let's go.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.490
Yes, sir!

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.410
And so, the first day of
my work study ended...

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.450
...leaving behind a heavy,
unpleasant feeling.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.460
Eri, don't disobey me anymore.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.090
You're the crux of my plan.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.010
Please, don't make me get my hands dirty.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.680
Overhaul, there's a call for you.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.930
It's from Shigaraki,
from the League of Villains.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.430
He said he'd give you
his answer from the other day...

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.980
"Katsuki Bakugo"
"Quirk: Explosion"
"He uses a nitroglycerin-like substance secreted on the palms of his hands to create explosions."

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 4/20"
"Height: 172 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Spicy Food"

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.150
"Beat up..."

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.440
What's up with Bakugo? Was he fighting again?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.360
"Mina Ashido"       "Katsuki Bakugo"

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.450
Oh, the girls didn't see him yet?

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.740
"Denki Kaminari"        "Kyoka Jiro"

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.280
Take a look at Todoroki, too.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.740
"Beat up..."

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.990
"Shoto Todoroki"

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.030
Ah, it messed up his pretty face!

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.330
What happened?

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.700
Apparently, the provisional
license classes are harsh.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.250
Must be good for jocks!

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.120
Stop talking about us like we're not here!

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.170
"Tenya Iida"

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.540
Class is starting!

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.790
Uraraka and Tsu haven't come yet?

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.750
They have excused absences, Class Rep.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.550
"Momo Yaoyorozu"

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.010
"Hanta Sero"

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.590
Of the boys, Kirishima isn't here, either.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.880
Oh, you didn't hear?

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.340
All three of them found places
to do their work studies at.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.340
Seriously?!

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.140
Hey, how was your work study?

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.350
"Minoru Mineta"

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.220
Was there a super perverted
female hero there?!

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.220
Uh...

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.440
Don't talk about stuff
you're ahead of me on!

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.240
D... Don't go...

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.490
My pent-up feelings got worse...

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.920
I couldn't concentrate on my classes.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.380
It's not good

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.880
to keep going like this!

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.710
"Pro Hero - Midnight - Quirk: Somnambulist"

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.050
All Might's out jogging.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.170
You didn't know?

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.510
After finishing the home visits,
for some reason, he started working out.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.510
If he's retired, he should just take it easy.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.980
All Might!

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.400
Tell me everything, All Might!

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.230
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.110
All Might!

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.860
Young Midoriya is here?!

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.330
How did you know I was here?

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.790
Did you know everything?

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.460
That Nighteye knew about One For All,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.670
and that he wanted it to go to Togata?

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.220
You knew, didn't you?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.970
Why didn't you tell me?

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.270
I wonder... if I needed to tell you...

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.770
Of course you did!

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.230
All this new information coming at once,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.600
and getting rejected before
I could make sense of it all...!

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.650
More than that, I didn't
understand your intentions!

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.690
I don't understand why you're keeping it
a secret, so I don't know how to feel!

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.950
Why didn't you tell me?

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.620
Not as your fan, but as your successor,
I want to know everything!

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.790
I didn't think knowing would do you any good.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.840
Do you really want to know?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.300
It's better than having you continue
to keep it secret from me.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.760
Don't regret this.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.340
I won't.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.270
Nighteye had always been a big fan of mine.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.480
It was my policy to not have a sidekick,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.190
but I gave in and allowed him to be one.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.730
We worked together for about five years.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.030
He supported me as
the brain behind my operations.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.240
I know.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.280
I also know you two got along.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.870
Yeah.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:17.040
But six years ago, we dissolved
our partnership because of my injury.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.750
We valued different things.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.130
That's reckless, All Might.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.050
You should retire.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.720
Everyone's... looking for me...

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.430
If they're waiting... I have to go...

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.810
If you keep being a hero in that body,
it'll just make everyone suffer.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.230
For the peace that you wish for, too,
you should retire while you're still a legend.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.030
"Pro Hero - Nezu - Quirk: High Specs"

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.440
If you're looking for a successor,
you can look as much as you want at my school.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.110
You've worked hard enough.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.530
You can have a good night's
sleep in a nice, soft bed.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.080
Find someone cheerful,
strong, and approachable--

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.960
someone like you--and entrust it to them.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.580
And who will be the Symbol
until I find someone like that?

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.170
Even if All For One is gone,
someone will replace him soon.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.670
I understand your theory about the Symbol!

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.220
I hold it in great esteem.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.590
But... see?

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.140
You can't smile at all, can you?

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.350
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"
"Pro Hero - Recovery Girl - Quirk: Heal"

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.350
I'll say it again.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.810
You should retire.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.850
If you continue with
your hero activities like this,

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.860
then I will not support you.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.400
I can't.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.190
I don't want to.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.740
Did you see it?

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.240
Didn't I tell you that you didn't
have to use your Foresight on me?

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.950
Even if you retire,
the next number one will appear!

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:43.290
Things might get rough for a while,
but we might be able to avoid that!

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.840
In that short time...

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.170
...how many people will have to be afraid?

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.470
All Might!

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.760
Besides...

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.600
...your Foresight has
never been wrong, has it?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.970
There has just been no precedent!

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.140
I will...

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.230
...change the future!

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.350
At this rate, it'll all go
according to my Foresight!

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.850
That can't happen!

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.480
I...

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.400
I'm here because I wanted
to do something to help you!

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.990
All Might!

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.410
For the sake of the world...

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.370
...I shouldn't be here, Nighteye.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.790
All Might!

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.040
If you continue like this,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.500
you'll face off against a villain
and die an unspeakably gruesome death!

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.050
We were divided about my future...

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.260
Nighteye and I parted
ways after that argument.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.010
Principal Nezu recommended
Young Togata to me,

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.810
but before I met him,

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.980
I ended up meeting you.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.820
I didn't want to tell you.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.690
Sorry.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.740
Because... you're my fan.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.750
All Might's...

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.500
...going to die...

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.580
It was thrust in front of me...

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.590
...death...

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.760
I'd already had a feeling
that it was coming...

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.550
I mean, everyone will die someday. But...

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.770
...for it to be thrust in front of me
so clearly by the person himself...

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.640
Die...

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.350
When I met you and decided
to pass on my power to you,

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.770
I told Nighteye.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.780
But he opposed me even then...

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.110
...and the rift between us grew even deeper.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.990
You're going to pass your power on
to a Quirkless middle schooler?!

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.290
He wants to become someone
who can save people.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.170
He can't fulfill his duties
with just his intentions!

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:51.130
There must be a number of
other people who are more suitable!

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.510
But a Quirkless middle schooler

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.590
is also a suitable person.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.600
He rejected it flat out,
saying it was foolish,

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.100
and started training a candidate
he thought was more suitable, Young Togata.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.980
Please, wait!

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.270
Wait, All Might!

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.610
How far into the future
was Nighteye's Foresight?

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.860
Six or seven years in the future, he said.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.110
Apparently, the further into the future,
the less accurate the time,

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.870
but what he sees with
his Foresight has never changed.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.910
Then... it'd be this year or next year...!

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.080
You're kidding, right?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.500
No... Why...?

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.130
I don't want this, All Might.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.750
Live!

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.920
Do you remember what
you said at the sports festival?

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.260
Our promise?

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.510
I want you to tell the world "I am here!"

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.680
I couldn't keep my promise!

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.190
Please live until I can keep my promise!

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.360
Stay alive and watch me
tell the world, "I am here!"

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.280
All Might!

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.160
Young Midoriya, you know,
when I heard the prediction,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.490
I accepted it pretty readily.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.830
If I could see the finish line--the end--

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.670
then I'd run until then.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.330
That's...

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.880
When I fought All For One,
I thought that was the finish line.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.470
But you were there.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.100
You--timid, Quirkless you--

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.940
and all the days we spent
together affected me.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.900
And those days whispered to me,
telling me to live.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:40.450
And then, your mother told me
to live and protect and raise you!

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.530
After all this time, I'm going to fight.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.370
You changed me!

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.490
I will live!

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.660
I will twist fate and anything else
into the shape I want with these arms!

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.460
I will not die.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.090
I will not be killed.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.930
It won't become the future you imagine!

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.640
That's what I have resolved,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.520
All For One.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.730
But after going through all this,
I've reached this conclusion.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.690
In the end, it has turned out
the way Nighteye said it would.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.110
That's why... I can't
face him after all this time...

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.610
I didn't want to become a shackle to you

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.530
as you ran to get stronger
with everything you had...

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:31.460
Well, it's possible that I've already
twisted fate into the shape I wanted.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.500
Not yet...

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.630
We still can't tell if
the prediction has changed...

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.800
I don't want this, All Might...

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.550
I absolutely refuse it.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.180
I...

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.850
No matter what happens to you,
I will twist fate with you!

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.860
I'll do my best to not cause you trouble.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.500
Oh, wait.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.710
You should have Nighteye
use his Foresight on you again.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.580
Make up with him so we can see
if the future's already been changed!

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.050
Wouldn't that be too convenient?

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.460
It's a matter of life and death!

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.130
I'll try to bargain with him!

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:27.010
"Fighting Fate"

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.970
Wait, young man!
Think about how Nighteye will feel!

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.360
What a drab office.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.360
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.610
I don't like disorderly layouts.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.740
I was made to walk in circles
underground for 30 minutes.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.240
I feel like an ant!

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.490
Did you really mean what you said
on the phone the other day?

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.830
That depending on the
conditions, you'd join us?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.380
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.710
Kirishima's doing his work study at the
agency of Fat Gum, who's based in Kansai.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.340
One of the U.A. Big Three,
Amajiki, is also with him.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.600
But Kirishima and the others are
caught up in a fight between thugs...

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.390
How will Kirishima fight against
an opponent with a boosted Quirk?

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.690
Next time, "Let's Go, Gutsy Red Riot."

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.320
Kirishima, show them the
results of your intensive training!

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.580
"Next time: Let's Go, Gutsy Red Riot"

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.820
Go beyond!

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.910
Plus Ultra!
