WEBVTT

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.570
Who's going to be the next leader again?

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.320
I hate you.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.200
You're too full of yourself.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.450
"Villain - Mr. Compress - Quirk: Compress"

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.780
Me, too.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.500
There are two boxes here.
Which is the finished product?

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.040
"Villain - Overhaul - Quirk: Overhaul"

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.080
Oh, well.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.130
Give it back.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.380
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.050
You know what, Overhaul?

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.130
A person who erases people's Quirks

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.850
shouldn't depend on their own Quirk, right?

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.350
The fruits of all that effort you spent

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860
are now mine!

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.480
Now you won't even have
a finger to put in your mouth

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.280
as you look on enviously at the rest of us.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.660
Let's do our best!

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.000
Next, it's our turn.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.190
Eyewitness reports, huh?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.980
This deep in the mountains
with no sign of life...

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.240
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.860
Is he really here?

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.400
The League of Villains' Kurogiri.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.450
"Police Officer - Naomasa Tsukauchi"

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.490
There have been four eyewitness
reports in the last two days.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.950
Since there aren't many people here,
they're more credible.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.700
But you know...

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.870
His Quirk is Warp Gate.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.250
It's perfect for secrecy.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.340
Even so, he was seen four times...

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.590
And he's acting alone.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.890
I don't understand...

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.100
Even if we don't understand
the League's motives,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.680
this is our best chance to arrest Kurogiri.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.680
We definitely want this to work.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.440
We're counting on you, Gran Torino.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.020
Good grief, you're working
an old man like me hard.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.070
"Smoldering Flames"

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.450
This is a report from the mountains.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.830
The suspect has been found.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.040
Please secure him promptly
before he activates his Quirk.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.080
Gran Torino.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.710
I know!

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.340
I won't let you!

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.520
We finally meet, huh?
Kurogiri from the League of Villains.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.310
"Villain - Kurogiri - Quirk: Warp Gate"

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.770
Gran... Torino...

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.440
If we get you, the most
troublesome of the League,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.570
then the rest should come falling in our lap.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.440
Gran Torino.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.570
Be careful.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.910
He can use Warp Gate not just
with his head, but with both his hands.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.570
He'll be hard to restrain.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.030
I know.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.410
Then I'll just take him and accelerate.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.250
If you've got a preference for a date,
then I'll go with you wherever you want.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.960
Gran Torino.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.510
Have you heard the rumors of
a wild man appearing in this area?

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.720
What?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.350
It seems he's gotten a
little too much attention,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.390
but I guess it can't be helped.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.810
I have business with that wild man.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.900
Tell me about it in detail later.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.360
What are these vibrations?

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.610
That man is always looking at the future.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.330
"That man"?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.750
Remember this.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.210
If I ever go away in the future,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.710
then you will be the only one
who can protect Tomura.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.590
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.260
At that time, if you ever feel uneasy...

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.300
...then you should rely on him.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.310
Detective Tsukauchi, Gran Torino.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.730
Shigaraki was not the
only one that man raised.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.740
One of All For One's faithful servants...

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.610
Gigantomachia.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.490
Everything is for my master...

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.260
Kai Chisaki, arrested for the abduction
and confinement of a young girl,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
is the young head of the
designated villain group, Shie Hassaikai.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.180
"Suspect Kai Chisaki
'Attacked during transport'"

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.890
As police were transporting him,
they were attacked by the League of Villains.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.810
During this incident,

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.640
Sand Hero: Snatch, who was there
as backup for the escort, was killed.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.560
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.310
There were also a number
of police officers injured.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.070
"Suspect Kai Chisaki
'Attacked during transport'"

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.690
This attack on a villain in transport
is an unprecedented failure...

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.950
"Pro Hero - Recovery Girl - Quirk: Heal"
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.360
This is all they've been
reporting on since yesterday.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.450
It isn't something you should
feel responsible for.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.450
You don't have to worry about it.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.960
But...

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.170
For now, the students
are to return to school.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.210
They want to monitor Togata a little longer,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.220
but the other students have already
been completely healed by Recovery Girl.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.840
They should be here soon.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.350
I'll stay a while longer to heal
a few more of the patients here.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.690
Can't I stay, too, until Eri wakes up?

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.860
Even if you stay, the situation won't change.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.740
All we can do is leave Eri to the doctors.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.610
I know, but...

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.450
Midoriya...

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.790
Before I leave, I'm going to go see Togata.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.200
Please watch my stuff for me!

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.670
Hey, right now...

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.260
It's Midoriya.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Excuse me.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.060
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.640
Hey, you!

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.720
'Morning, Midoriya!

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.850
It looks like I'm the only one stuck here
another day so they can monitor me!

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.270
Even though I'm this energetic!

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.150
Damn it!

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.230
Togata...

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.030
I know.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.570
I've lost my Quirk,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.700
and my mentor has passed away.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.080
I shouldn't be in a laughing state of mind.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.370
But that's why.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.000
Nighteye wasn't really that way with you,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.300
but when he was with me,
he actually smiled a lot.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.380
Smile...

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.300
A society without cheer and humor...

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.970
...will not have...

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.930
...a bright future...

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.270
That's why I'm not going to cry.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.530
Because I'm going to be a fine hero someday.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.160
If I look gloomy,
then Eri will probably also feel bad.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.540
You have enough power to become a symbol,
but you're completely ordinary.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.790
In that case, he should have had
let Mirio inherit One For All after all.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.760
Even when your Quirk was taken away,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.300
you still kept protecting
Eri by yourself, didn't you?

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.890
Compared to that,

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:08.190
I was supposed to protect Eri,
but I needed her help, and Mr. Aizawa's...

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.400
If you'd been the successor,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.030
then Nighteye might...

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.910
And All Might's future, too...!

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.790
If I said I could give
my Quirk to you, then--

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.870
I don't need it.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:31.170
If that were really possible,
and you gave your Quirk to me,

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.470
then it'd cause you trouble, right?

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.340
I don't know what you're so dejected about,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.310
but you did a good job!
You're Deku, the hero!

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.890
Besides...

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.360
Eraser told me about Eri yesterday.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.610
Later, if Eri is able to
use her Quirk properly,

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.120
then I'll try asking her if she can
rewind me to when I still had my Quirk.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.080
Even if that doesn't work,

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.370
I'll try a bunch of things
to get back to normal.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.800
I'll probably have to take time off
from U.A. until my Quirk comes back,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.300
but anyway, I'm fine.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.840
...you'll be fine.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.720
You'll become a finer
hero than anyone else...

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.640
I have what Nighteye
predicted with his Foresight.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.520
So, let's keep smiling!

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.070
Okay.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.070
I'll definitely go back to U.A.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.870
As Lemillion, who'll save a million.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.410
Okay. I'll be waiting.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.040
Are your injuries okay?

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.840
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.720
Izuku Midoriya, Eijiro Kirishima.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.220
Sorry to bother you right
after your discharge,

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.600
but we'd like you to come
with us to the station

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.270
to answer some questions
about the Shie Hassaikai incident.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.310
Yes, sir.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.020
I understand.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:18.940
It looked like it would be a while
longer before we would return to school.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.320
On the other hand, for those in Class A...

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.370
Bakugo, let's go.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.620
Shut up, I'm going!

"Height: 176 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Soba (the kind that's not hot)"

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.850
With the police inquiry and
paperwork continuing one after another,

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.680
we didn't end up getting back
to the dorm until after dark.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.850
Deku! Kirishima!

Did you two just get back, too?

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.730
Yeah.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:02.150
There was a lot of paperwork
to do at Ryukyu's office.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.490
We had a bunch, too.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.700
It feels...

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.740

back here in a long time.

Yeah.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.960

Those guys are back!

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.300
We were all worried about you.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.760
--Yeah, yeah!
--We saw the news!

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.800
Looked like you had a tough time!

you guys keep getting
involved with some crazy stuff!

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.730
It's scary, you know!

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.030

You saw on the news, didn't you?

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.380
A lot has happened to them.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.640
If you're their classmates,

"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.470
you should console them
and let them rest quietly.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.390
Because I'm sure it's not just their bodies--

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.020
their spirits must also be worn down.

Back then...

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:00.480
...wasn't there more I could've done?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.740
I... With my hands, I held Nighteye...

You all did everything you could.

The responsibility lies with us.

I won't tell you to be positive right away,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.170
but I want you to take this
and think about what you want to do.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.930
I...

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.340
...want to save people.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.890
Yeah.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.310
Why didn't you tell us
about what was going on?

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.440
We were super surprised, too!

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.360
Sorry, there was a gag order.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.480
You okay?

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.320
I'm not there yet!

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.450
I see.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.320
Oh, that's so cute!

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.120
I borrowed it from Koda!

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.740
Tsu, you wanna try holding it?

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.540

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.080
Me next!

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.370
So cute!

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.580
Hey, Kacchan! What're you sulking for?

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.000
You're here 'cause you were worried, right?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.880
Be more honest with yourself!

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.130
I'm going to sleep.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.670
Huh? Isn't it too early?

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.220
You old or something?

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.470
Unlike the rest of you, I've got stuff to do.

Midoriya, Uraraka, Kirishima,
Asui, sorry, but I'm going, too.

Huh? Isn't it too early?

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.690
You old or something?

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.980
I understand Bakugo, but even Todoroki?
What's going on?

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.190
They've got their provisional
license training course tomorrow, too.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.240
Even so, it's pretty early.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.610
I see...

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.290
Kacchan and Todoroki's
provisional license training course...

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.500
It's already started, huh?

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.920
Thanks to Iida and the others,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.840
us interns also went back
to our rooms promptly

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.550
and each had time to reflect by ourselves.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.760
I'd only heard a little about
how Kirishima and the others were...

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.270
...but I knew that a lot had happened.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.100
No, too much had happened.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.360
D... Don't go...

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.780
We will definitely take Eri next time...

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.200
...and protect her!

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:17.990
It's fine!

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.700
I will become your hero!

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.000
I'll twist that future!

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.380
I'll never...

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.960
...let you go again.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.050
She rewinds humans. That's who Eri is.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.970
Eri, will you lend me your power?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.640
If I can't save...

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.060
...the one small girl in front of me...

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.110
...how can I become...

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:56.160
...a hero who saves everyone?

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.910
You twisted the future...

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.540
Smile...

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.630
Even though my body was tired,

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.220
that day, I couldn't really fall asleep...

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.650
Walk behind me!

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:37.610
I feel bad making Mr. Aizawa
take us after yesterday...

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.200
I'm not here to make small talk with you!

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.330

"Pro Hero - Present Mic - Quirk: Voice"

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.830
You're late, bad boys!

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.540
Present Mic and All Might?

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.290
I will be taking you today, too.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:56.680
It seems Eraser will be out a lot
because of yesterday's incident!

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.510
What's going on?

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.720
Apparently, they need his power
to help with the girl they rescued.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.810
So! Eraser asked me
to come along as a bodyguard!

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.440
It's a measure we're taking after
considering the League's actions, too.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.150
You captured the League's Kurogiri?!

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.990
Yeah, although we took
some hard blows while doing it.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.790
Then, it's like you've got them
by the scruff of their necks...

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.410
No, we couldn't get the other one.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.040
"Other one"?

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.500
It was a bitter choice.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:37.550
All For One's direct subordinate hid himself.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:43.680
Honestly, between arresting
Kurogiri and letting that go,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.100
it's hard to say if it was worth it.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.780
He's a walking disaster.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.530
We quickly chased after him
with backup, but it was too late.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.780
The search is still going on.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.910
I'll let you know if there
are any developments.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.790
Now, let's go.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.130
Yesterday was just an easy classroom lecture,

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.250
but I hear today's training will be tough.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.550
Hurry up and get your provisional licenses
with a hop, step, here we go!

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.180

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.260
We mustn't be late.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.600
Come on, get on the bus.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.270
All Might's taking us today, too, huh?

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.860
It might get annoying...

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.030
Well then, we'll be watching from up here.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.670
This is perfect.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.710

and have a talk with you.

Uh, sure.

Right! She wasn't here,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.370

you should throw away things like that!

first test, didn't you?

Kacchan and Todoroki, who are
taking classes for the provisional hero license,

are ordered to undergo an outrageous
trial by their instructor, Gang Orca.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.730
