00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.480
Please wait.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.190
Is this like a ritual for you?

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.110
You're a very perceptive boy.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.530
Dear listeners! The grand adventure
of a man of extraordinary talent is starting.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
Don't be so dazzled you look away--

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.620
I am the gentleman thief
who will save the world,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.130
Gentle Criminal!

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.130
My plans have shifted.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.550
In this current predicament, I'll keep it brief.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.930
This time...

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850
I tried going into U.A.!

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.260
I won't let you do that!

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.640
That is not something I can do!

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.020
Gently...

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.480
...Trampoline!

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.150
I'm sure you have feelings invested in this, too,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.860
but they can't win against
my mustache and my soul!

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.780
This scheme is a big step
toward my becoming a legend.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.780
Please don't get in my way!

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.290
Farewell, glimmer of youth!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.210
We're all invested in this!

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.800
For the sake of the world, for the
sake of others, for the sake of my dream--

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.020
And, La Brava, to respond to your feelings!

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.030
"Day of U.A. School Festival"

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.830
"Green Room"

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.370
"Neito Monoma - Quirk: Copy"

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.540
What's with those clothes, Kendo?!

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.210
--Oh, that looks good on you!
--Isn't it too sexy?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.080
"Yosetsu Awase - Quirk: Weld"
"Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu - Quirk: Steel"

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.920
Hey, boys, don't just walk in like this.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.130
That appearance!

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.180
It's hard to believe that's the look of
someone who's sold her soul to violence!

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.680
"Reiko Yanagi - Quirk: Poltergeist"
"Itsuka Kendo - Quirk: Big Fist"

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.680
Is that a compliment or an insult?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.930
A compliment!

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.930
After all, the one who entered you was me!

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.480
Since you're popular after being
in the commercial, I'm sure you'd win!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.070
If you win, then Class B
will be even more "Plus Ultra"!

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.980
Most importantly,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.150
during that time, I would
be free from your powerful fist!

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.870
Well, if I'm going to do it,
I'm going to aim for the top.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.280
Hey, hey, wait!

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
"Nejire Hado - Quirk: Surge"

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.330
Why is Kendo sure to win?

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.870
We don't know that yet.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.830
Nejire Hado!

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.630
Looking forward to competing with you, Kendo.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.300
I-I'm looking forward to it, too--

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.220
Oh my, speaking of victory
while disregarding me?

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.390
I am the one graced with perfect beauty!

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.520
Bibimi Kenranzaki!

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.320
It's a fight among women...

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.360
We'll be there soon.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.240
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.530
Class A's performance starts at 10 a.m.,

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.530
and then after that is Class 1-B's play.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.910
Then, it's lunch and the beauty pageant.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.040
"Eri"

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.920
Aren't you excited to see Midoriya, Eri?

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.670
Yeah.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.750
Hatsume,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.420
"Mei Hatsume - Quirk: Zoom"
"Pro Hero - Power Loader"

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.510
clean yourself up before the presentation, too.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.090
Don't you think I already look great?

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.640
"Permission to Leave Campus Form: Izuku Midoriya"

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.800

"Pro Hero - Midnight - Quirk: Somnambulist"
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.560
Morning!

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.060
What's that?

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.020
A permission to leave campus form?
On the day of the festival?

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.770
Yeah, he said there was something he had to buy,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.980
so he went down the mountain to buy it.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.740
The festival's about to start!
Isn't he cutting it a little close?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.530
He doesn't have to act so youthful!

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.790
"School Festival Start!!"

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.840

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.170
Gentle, neither you
nor that boy will give up, huh?

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.800
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.170
Let's use it--

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.010
My Quirk!

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.890
If I don't hurry up and go after them...

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.310
It's not visible,
but traces of the Quirk still remain.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.940
I cannot cancel the effects
of my Quirk of my own volition.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.660
Watch carefully.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.370
He's on our tail, Gentle!

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.080
"Villain - Gentle Criminal"

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.920
La Brava, if possible, I want
to save your Quirk for our retreat.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.250
But, but, Gentle! At this rate,
it's highly possible you'll fail!

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.970
I know that! Because it's a race
against the clock this time.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.300
He's too fast!

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.390
Earlier, he lost his footing
because of my air bullets.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.400
In order to recover from that and land,
he put up two air membranes.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.820
One above this tree!

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.160
Remember where they are!

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.670
Gentle!

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.300
Don't resist.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.010
Please, just give up.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.430
The usual Gentle would've
run away when he was discovered.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.810
I am betting the mustache
I'm so proud of and my soul on this scheme!

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.230
His feelings ended up hurting him...

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.030
Gentle!

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.080
There's that girl Aiba in Class 3, right?
The short one.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.250
I've never talked to her before,
but she sent me a love letter.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.920
What, really?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.800
The stuff inside the letters made it
obvious she'd been following me around!

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.920
Huh?!

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.090
And there were pages and pages of it...

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.180
She's a stalker!

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.140
Scary...

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.680
In the fall of my first year of middle school,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.810
the love letter I worked up the courage
to give was mocked by the person I liked.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.650
After that, I couldn't
believe in anything anymore.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.200
I passed my days aimlessly
clinging to my computer.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.950
Maybe I'll say goodbye to my life...

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.000
Nice to meet you, dear listeners.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.580
That's right! It is I, Gentle!

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.840
Gentle Criminal!

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.590
Those of you lamenting the times,
believe in me and follow me!

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.930
I will change the world!

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.600
That's when I first came across...

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.440
...the light that was you.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.150
The dark circles won't go away.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.700
I hope he won't think I'm creepy.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.240
I couldn't hold back my feelings...

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.080
I'm a huge fan!

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.370
I want to help you carve...

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.120
...your name...

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.830
...in history!

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.220
You just accepted me without saying anything.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.050
And, you were kind.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.310
You responded to my feelings...

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.640
...and accepted me.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.360
You walked...

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.570
...together with me.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.880
Manami Aiba.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.710
For your codename...

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.430
How about "La Brava"?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.800
"* La Brava
* Honey"

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.510
We are already the best team.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.690
Gentle...

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.070
My Gentle...!

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.030
I will hand you two over to the police

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.240
as soon as I can!

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.870
I love you.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.750
Thank you, La Brave.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.580
La Brava.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.920
Quirk: Love.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.500
By murmuring her love,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.510
she can power up the person
she loves most for a short time.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.310
What...? His strength...

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.140
The deeper her love,
the more power she can give,

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:33.150
and if activated in a crisis,
it can jump up to tens of times more.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.240
Sorry, young man.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:46.120
I don't like using brute force,
so I always cut scenes like this.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.130
Please sleep for me for a while.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.590
Sorry, Izuku Midoriya.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.890
I've...

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.760
...fought against stronger...

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.600
...faster people...

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.150
I...

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.900
...haven't lost yet!

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.990
"La Brava" "Quirk: Love"
"She can power up just one person
she loves for a short period of time.
The effect depends on how deep her love is."

Good morning!

"Pro Hero - Present Mic - Quirk: Voice"

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.950
Hey, guys!

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.790
That's it for preparations!
It's almost time to start!

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.590
"Pro Hero - Hound Dog - Quirk: Dog"

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.920
We're partying today!

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.050
All grades and courses
should just go out and have fun!

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.300
Let's hear it, everyone--

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.930
The U.A. School
Festival starts now!

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.560
This is impossible, young man!

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.520
No way...!

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.600
This was our last resort!

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.560
We always use this,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.440
Lover Mode, to extract ourselves!

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.940
Always, the two of us!

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.860
Please, just stop!

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.450
Gentle! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.120
My love... My love wasn't enough!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.750
No one has proved that your love was not enough!

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.340
Gently Sandwich!

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:24.050
A sandwich is deemed
more elegant the thinner it is.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.470
I don't like piling layer upon layer...

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.770
But even so, I want to fulfill...

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.270
...the fleeting dream of my middle years.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.310
To leave my name in history! For posterity!

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.280
This dream is no longer
a dream I hold for myself!

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.030
Today, I take the first step
toward my great work.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.660
It's not so trivial that I can just
give it up when someone tells me to.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:54.580
If you're a U.A. student, then you must
understand my yearning for my dream.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.090
Why?

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.710
If you understand so much,
then why the school festival?

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.880
Why would you trample on everyone's hopes?!

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.470
That's because that's how it is!

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.640
If it's for your dream,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.640
then you can steal people's
hard work and passion,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.190
and the smile of a girl who
doesn't know how to smile yet?!

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.820
If that means...

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.450
...I can make my dream come true!

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.370
My dream

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.910
is to become a hero

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.330
and become a man great
enough to be in textbooks.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.120
"Gentle - Age 18 (2nd year of high school)"

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.460
Well, that's not what I was asking.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.250
You're in trouble, Tobita.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.630
Our school isn't that prestigious,

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.470
but you keep failing and getting held back.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.510
On top of that, this is the fourth time
you've failed the provisional licensing exam.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:52.010
Honestly, the only thing I can recommend
is for you to voluntarily withdraw.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.520
I heard the Takeshitas' son
already has agencies asking for him.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.270
Don't worry, Mom.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.770
I won't be discouraged.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.280
I'll do my best!

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.450
Call a hero!

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.450
A hero!

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.030
He's gonna fall!

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.250
I thought that with my Quirk,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.500
I could make a cushion.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.520
The man who fell was seriously injured
and will take six months to fully recover.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.640
"Tobita" "Trash"

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.140
In the end, your actions interfered
with a hero's rescue attempt.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.400
That is obstructing
the discharge of official duties,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.860
"Notice of Withdrawal"

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.360
and you will be charged with that crime.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:58.500
"Gentle - Age 22 (Part-timer)"

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.540
Spring is nice.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.250
I can eat wild vegetables.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.750
I had already forgotten my dream...

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.340
Takeshita?!

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.130
You already formed your own agency?
That's wonderful!

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.510
Do you remember me? We were in the same class--

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.680
Oh, um... who are you again?

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.690
My dream was already...

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.820
Would I just continue
to grow older, poor and pathetic?

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.160
"History of Supervillainy"

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.620
No!

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.700
Not yet!

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.330
Not yet!

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.660
Gentle!

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.590
Up until now, we only used Lover Mode to escape.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.090
Gentle doesn't like violence, and yet he's--

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.010
You can mock me and say that I'm mentally weak!

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.640
That's fine!

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.810
I...!

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.190
I won't mock you, Gentle Criminal.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.570
Win!

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.360
Gentle!

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.450
That girl's Quirk...!

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.290
His power is getting stronger!

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.870
You!

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.630
Why do you want to be a hero?

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.460
I love you.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.760
This dream is no longer
a dream I hold for myself!

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.680
I'm the same as you, Gentle.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.810
My dream isn't just my own anymore!

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.060
A dream too big for the body I was born with!

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.820
A dream I'd given up on
from the bottom of my heart!

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.570
For everyone that didn't laugh!

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.280
For everyone that acknowledged me!

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.570
I want to live up to their expectations!

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.950
For those who have been hurt...

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.910
I want...

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.870
...to become someone
who can show them a bright future!

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.420
The same... huh...?

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.680
I believe!

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.770
I believe that Gentle will win!

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.690
The computer and program
that I put together for this day--

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.230
If I can connect to U.A.'s
internal network with this special wi-fi,

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.280
then I can deactivate their security system,
and we can get inside.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.990
From here, the wi-fi just barely doesn't reach!

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.410
I need to get closer!

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.830
What I need to do for Gentle's sake!

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.790
La Brava, no!

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.500
It's dangerous to go alone!

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.050
I need to stop him!

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.670
Am I still...

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.550
...not as strong as those you've fought before?

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:06.350
I will throw away shame, honor,
and my way of doing things to defeat you!

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.980
That is the courtesy
I can show a person like you.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.740
No...

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.200
No...!

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.050
Shoot Style...

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.550
...St. Louis Smash!

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:55.150
You were harder to fight than anyone
I'd ever fought until now, Gentle.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.320
Gentle! There are heroes just over there--

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.080
Run... away...

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.620
The power up from Love
lasts for only a short time

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.500
and can only be used once per day.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.920
No, stop... Let go...

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.170
Let Gentle go...!

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.840
Let go! No!

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.800
Gentle had his heart set on this scheme!

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.890
He even forgot about the
tea breaks he loves to get ready!

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.310
Let go! What "bright future"?!

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.520
Gentle is my only light!

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.150
Don't take my Gentle from me!

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.570
Don't take him away!

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.200
La Brava.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.830
Even though I knew that you wouldn't run away...

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.500
...I told you to run...

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.300
You can't help me.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.210
That would make you an accomplice to my crimes.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.340
Please! I've already
committed a crime with my hacking.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.600
It's fine, Gentle!

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.770
If I can be with you,

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.980
then I'll be happy no matter
what I'm doing or where I am.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:19.690
Would you have been happy to escape alone?

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.320
No...

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.910
I'll die before I'm going to
be separated from you, Gentle!

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.410
I'm sure you would've gone on to commit
crimes much worse than what we've done.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.790
The one who brought you here,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.420
who accepted you and made you my partner--

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.170
is me!

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.140
La Brava,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.260
I was happy, too!

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.980
If I get caught by the heroes like this,

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.020
then it'll be obvious you're my accomplice.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.990
In that case, at least...

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.240
...I can make it so this fight never happened.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.990
To make the crime just a little less serious.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.170
Just go away like that, Izuku Midoriya.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.840
For the sake of her bright future.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.100
Izuku Midoriya. You should be proud.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.850
You protected everything you stood for and won.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.940
I stumbled over a pebble on the road.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:47.820
U.A., I wish to turn myself in.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.210
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.000
Gentle's feelings, La Brava's hopes...

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.380
The two of them always put each other first.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.680
With the taste of
my bittersweet victory still lingering,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.300
I run at full speed toward U.A.,

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.600
to where my friends are waiting.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.930
Because I want to see
the smiles of everyone--of Eri.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.560
Now, let's start the show!

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.610
Next time, "Let It Flow! School Festival!"

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.030
Let my feelings reach!

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.580
"Next time: Let It Flow! School Festival!"

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.900
Go beyond!

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.580
Plus Ultra!
