00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.500
About 80% of the world's population

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.250
is born with some kind of special trait,
a Quirk, in this superhuman society.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.170
"Quirk"

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.880
To fight against villains using
their Quirks to commit crimes,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.170
"Villains"     "Enemies"

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.300
the profession of "hero" was created.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.730
I, Izuku Midoriya, dreamed of becoming a hero

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.980
and enrolled in the prestigious U.A. High School

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.610
as I continue to run toward my dream.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.320
With my friends who are
working toward the same goal,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.870
we stand up to any difficulties
and save people with a smile...

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.000
...in order to become the greatest heroes!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.630
That's right, this is...

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.050
...my hero academia!

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.850
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.220
Look, look!

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.350
Look at me!

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.730
Breaking, breaking!

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.320
--Pow, pow!
--Pow, pow!

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.650
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.650
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"
 "Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.690
Breaking! Breaking!

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.950
Pow, pow!

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.200
Dancing is her hobby, huh?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.780
if you're gonna wear something under,
then take off your skirt!

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.620
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off "

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.120
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.290
Mineta, you can't talk like that!

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.710
Ashido must be able to
fight well because of her dancing.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.870
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.460
It's like she uses her
whole body in all her movements.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.090
During our first combat training,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.640
I'll never forget how
she burned through my cape.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.390
And the finals at the sports festival...

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.930
I'll never forget that, either.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.020
Maybe I'll try it, too.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.400
Why don't you get her to teach you?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.190
Okay, boy, let's dance!

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.440
Oh, um, please teach me!

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.950
First, the two-step.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.370
Step forward and back,
left and right, and swing both arms...

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.740
L...

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.080
Like this...?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.380
Sato's baking is similar, too--

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.460
It's nice to be able to apply your hobbies
to hero work. Makes you strong!

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.670
Speaking of hobbies,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.050
you have an amazing one, too, right, Jiro?

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.630
Hey, stop with that.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.220
You know, your room at the dorm--

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.010
It was like a music store in there!

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.100
That went past just a hobby!

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.930
I said, stop!

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.850
Can you just forget about my room?

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.940
Man, but that was a pro's room!

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.360
Honestly, it was co--

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.030
Seriously!

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.660
Why...?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.250
"School Festival"

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.670
October...

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.460
In the fall, at U.A. High School,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.920
we're preparing for a certain event...

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.380
The event, which probably
happens at most schools, is...

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.590
Um...

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.350
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure "

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.890
We're going to have a school festival.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.850
"Schooent!"

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.310
Schooent!

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.270
"Schooent!"
"*Short for "super normal school event""

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.270
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.310
School festival!

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.730
It's a super normal school event!

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.770
Let's decide what we're gonna do!

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.360
Mr. Aizawa, is this really okay?
To be so carefree in these times?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.900
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.820
Kirishima... you've changed.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.450
But it's true--villains
are flourishing right now!

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.410
You're right. That's a very reasonable opinion.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.370
However, U.A. isn't just about the hero course.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.290
If the sports festival is the
big moment for the hero course,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.250
the school festival is for the others--

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.130
the support course, general studies,
and business course students--to shine.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:07.970
"Support Course" "General Studies" "Business Course"

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.050
It doesn't get as much attention
as the sports festival,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.090
but for them, it's an
event they look forward to.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.640
And there are those who are feeling
stressed by the current conditions,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.730
which, starting with the dorm system,
came about because of the hero course.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.690
Thinking about it that way,
there's no excuse for not holding it.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.030
Yeah. That's why we can't
just say we won't have it.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.580
Unlike past years, this year,
other than some of the people involved,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.830
the festival will be just for the school.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.830
Even if we aren't the focus,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.170
each class still needs
to participate with something.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.260
You need to decide that today...

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.840
He's asleep!

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.470
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.220
I, Tenya Iida, Class 1-A representative,
will take things from here!

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.850
I'll do my best to help things go smoothly!

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.480
First, put out some options.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.860
If you have a suggestion, raise your hand!

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.730
Me, me, me, me!

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.610
Their attitudes changed so fast!

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.320
I will definitely consolidate everyone's ideas!

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.740
Okay, Kaminari!

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.370
Let's do a maid café!

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.740
This is what I imagine!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.790
This is what I imagine, with more details!

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.330
If I add my own desires, it's like this!

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.380
So, let's do a maid café!

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.300
Maids... So we'd be serving others!
That's not bad!

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.630
That's too tame, Kaminari!

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.170
Mineta!

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.670
A boo--

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.680
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.390
Do you have a weight?

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.640
Yeah...

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.050
A mochi shop!

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.600
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.760
I see, something Japanese!

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.970
An arm-wrestling tournament!

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.930
That's intense!

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.980
A fun house!

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.940
I don't know what that is,
but I'm sure it's interesting!

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.520
A crepe shop!

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.980
It's great for eating on the go!

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.400
A dance!

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.520
Sounds dazzling!

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.570
A hero quiz.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.740
That's so like you, Midoriya!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.150
Let's sing "Frog Song" in a round.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.240
How charming!

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.870
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.700
A petting zoo.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.030
A petting zoo!

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.910
Hand-made soba.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.990
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.120
It's your favorite!

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.490
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.330
A death match.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.700
An unexpected fight to the death!

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.040
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow "

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.200
A feast of the students of darkness.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.250
Oh-ho!

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.670
My twinkling show!

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.500
Huh?!

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.580
A skit or something?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.840
I see!

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.960
Now, any others?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960
An Asian café!

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.970
A dance performance!

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.430
A takoyaki shop!

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:21.100
"Maid Café"
"Arm-Wrestling
 Tournament"
 "Fun House"
 "Mochi"
 "Students of
 Darkness Feast"
 "Dance"
 "Boo?"

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:21.100
"Skit"
"Local History
Presentation"
"Death Match"
 "Petting Zoo"
 "Takoyaki"
 "Asian Café"
 "Dance Performance"

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:21.100
"Study Session"
"Hero Quiz"
"Hand-Made Soba"
 "My Twinkling Show"
 "Frog Song"
 "Crepes"

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.560
I think we've got something from everyone now?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.390
I'll eliminate the ones that are
inappropriate, impossible, or confusing.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.310
"Students of Darkness Feast"
"Boo?"

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.310
"Death Match"

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.310
"My Twinkling Show"

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.310
Merciless!

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.230
Don't ask us in the first place, then!

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.240
The local history presentation
seems kinda boring.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.110
That's true.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.570
It's fine, but the others seem more fun.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.830
I cannot go against the consensus!

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.580
We do study sessions all the time.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.620
I thought maybe it would be of help...

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.130
Can't we combine all
the food suggestions into one?

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.380
Don't you think crepes and soba would clash?

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.960
You can't have crepes at an Oriental place.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.170
Quiet down!

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.840
We should do a fun house!

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.590
What does that mean?

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.140
Quiet! Quiet!

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.100
We haven't been able to come to a consensus...

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.890
Quiet down!

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.480
That was a very illogical meeting.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.820
Decide what you'll do by tomorrow morning.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.200
If you don't...

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.120
...I'll make it a public lecture.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.660
"Public Lecture"

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.870
Public lecture!

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.660
That's just studying!

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.450
He's joking, right?

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.370
Everyone, let's decide what we'll do by tonight!

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.040
Yeah!

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.130
Huh? Where are the interns?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.930
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail "

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.130
Extra classes.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.390
They can't participate in the discussion,
so they said they'd do what we decided.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.550
What about Bakugo?

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.720
Sleeping.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.100
Everyone, I took a step back
and thought about it again...

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.690
And the stress we cause the other courses
that Mr. Aizawa was talking about--

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.980
I think we should do something
to help them relieve that.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.690
You're right.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.650
Those aiming to be heroes

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.570
cannot cause trouble for others
without doing anything about it.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.450
In that case, honestly,

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.950
I don't think we can offer U.A. students
who know Lunch Rush's cooking

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.660
anything that could satisfy their stomachs.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.580
Oh, do you mean we shouldn't do food?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.330
Personally, that's what I think.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.790
If we think about how to
serve students in the other courses...

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.090
If you put it that way...

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.300
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.130
It would be rude to them
if we were the only ones having fun.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.090
It's frustrating, but we can't beat Lunch Rush.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.640
Then...

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.680
If we look at the ones falling
under experiences, we get...

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.190
"Maid Café"
"Arm-Wrestling
Tournament"
 "Fun House"
 "Mochi"
 "Students of
 Darkness Feast"
 "Dance"
 "Boo?"

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.190
"Skit"
"Local History
Presentation"
 "Death Match"
 "Petting Zoo"
 "Takoyaki"
 "Asian Café"
 "Dance Performance"

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.190
"Study Session"
"Hero Quiz"
"Hand-Made Soba"
 "My Twinkling Show"
 "Frog Song"
 "Crepes"

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.440
...the maid café, petting zoo, or fun house?

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.480
A zoo would be hard
to keep sanitary, wouldn't it?

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.150
Hmm, stress relief, huh?

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.070
We can't do a funny skit?

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.070
Watching amateurs perform
is really stressful, you know?

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.120
It's fun if we all dance together...

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.160
A dance... might be good.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.250
I'm getting support from
someone super unexpected!

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.500
Hang on a second.
There was something, wasn't there...?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.420
I don't know what it's called,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.840
but it's the one where
everyone's having a good time.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.380
Oh, something like this.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.930
This isn't something I'd expect from Todoroki.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.310
Did you turn into one of
those "party people," Todoroki?!

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.640
No.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.940
I agree with Iida's opinion

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.650
that we should provide
stress relief for the other courses.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.730
In order to do that,

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.240
don't you think it would be good to offer
a place where everyone can have fun?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.280
The idea came from our supplemental
classes for the provisional license.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.910
What kind of supplemental
classes are they taking...?

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.950
I see... Song and dance, huh?

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.920
I'll say it again, but watching amateurs
perform is really stressful, you know?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.420
I can teach people how to dance!

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.750
Two-step!

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.920
An amateur that moved
bizarrely mastered the step in one day!

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.720
Ashido's instruction is proven to work!

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.340
Wait, you amateurs!

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.970
Dance is about rhythm!

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.390
In other words, sound!

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.140
Party people need the
ultimate music to dance to!

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.140
If we're talking about music...

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.400
Huh? What?

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.740
We can play live music on your instruments!

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.320
Wait a second!

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.360
What's wrong?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.120
You're really good at playing
and teaching people how to play,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.500
and you always look like you're having
a lot of fun when you play music!

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.580
I want to hear your music!

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.250
Ashido... and the others...

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.800
Their hobbies are all
rooted in hero work, right?

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.390
Mine... is really just a hobby...

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.810
Honestly, I don't think it's
something I can boast about publicly...

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.980
Speaking of hobbies,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.440
you have an amazing one, too, right, Jiro?

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.440
Hey, stop with that.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.360
Seriously!

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.030
Is that what that was about this afternoon...?

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.160
It's super cool to be able
to play so many instruments!

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.580
Jiro!

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.290
It's a technique that might
be able to make people smile.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.540
I think that's definitely something
you could use in your hero work!

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.880
I understand where you two are coming from,

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.140
but the decision should
be left up to Jiro herself...

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.180
After being told all that...

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.890
...to not do it...

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.100
...wouldn't be rockin' at all, would it?

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:20.740
"Play Next Video"

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.360
Yeah!

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.440
Then, Class 1-A will be doing
a live performance and dance

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.950
to create a partying atmosphere!

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.860
Yeah!

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.990
"Mina Ashido"
"Quirk: Acid"
"She can secrete acid from her body and use it to attack or move."

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.990

"Shota Aizawa"

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.590
Eri!

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.590
"Eri"

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.050
"Mirio Togata - Quirk: Permeation"

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.970
Sorry I couldn't come see you sooner.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.420
Here's a fruit basket!

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.340
Eat some if you'd like!

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.140
Is there a fruit you like? Can I try guessing?

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.270
It's peaches, right? 'Cause you're like a peach!

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.060
Apples...

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.890
That's what I thought!

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.060
Then, let's peel it! Since it's an apple!

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.400
Eri wants to see Midoriya?

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.740
"Supplementary Classroom"

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.650
Yeah.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.740
Strictly speaking, she's concerned
about Midoriya and Togata.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.580
Apparently, it's her first request
since being admitted to the hospital.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.500
I wonder if it'll be okay...

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.500
You had said that it would be
better for her to be kept away

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.800
from anything that would
remind her of the incident...

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.880
I was worried about
her powers going out of control.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.180
However,

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.930
there's no need to worry, at least for now.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.310
Right now, there's no energy left
in that girl to go out of control.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:39.860
This whole time, even when
I had a fever, I was thinking...

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.440
...about when you rescued me.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.070
But I didn't know your name.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.410
I only knew Lemillion.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.410
I wanted to know your name.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.580
I'm Izuku Midoriya. My hero name is Deku!

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.880
Um, maybe since Deku is shorter,
it's easier to remember...

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.920
Deku. I'm Deku!

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.380
Hero name?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.510
It's like a nickname.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.670
Deku.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.430
That's right!

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.930
Lemillion. Deku.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.350
And...

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.900
...that man wearing glasses...

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.310
All of you...

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.230
...were injured badly because of me.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.860
We haven't told her about Nighteye.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.070
From what I hear, she's been
blaming everything on herself

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.080
and holding onto the guilt.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.750
Because of me, you all suffered...

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.210
I'm sorry...

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:46.590
She will find out someday,
but right now, it's too cruel.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:53.970
It... It was my fault that
you lost your power, Lemillion...

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.350
Eri.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.890
No one thought they were suffering.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.940
This is what we all think:

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.230
"I'm glad Eri is okay!"

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.610
There's no point in apologizing
to someone who doesn't exist.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.660
Don't worry about it.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.080
Everyone fought because
they wanted to see your smile!

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.300
I'm sorry...

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.680
How do you smile again...?

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.100
Eri...

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.810
Someone else is about to die because of you!

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.230
That's right.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:53.530
It's easier to be hurt yourself than
to have others get hurt for you, huh?

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.080
The shadow of Chisaki is still there...

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.790
That's right, this girl...

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:06.130
This girl hasn't been saved yet at all...

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:12.050
She still doesn't know
anything fun or how to smile!

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.010
Is there anything that can make Eri smile...?

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.060
Surprise.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.270
Surprises make you happy, right?

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.980
Wait.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.690
According to the doctor,

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.070
the horn that lets her use her Quirk has shrunk.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.610
There's a low chance of it going out of control!

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.870
Unlike past years, this year,
other than some of the people involved,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.330
the festival will be just for the school.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.540
Unlike with other activities,

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.840
there's a low chance that she'll come
into contact with anyone from the outside!

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.210
Mr. Aizawa!

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.880
Could Eri leave the hospital for just one day?

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.680
It's not impossible,
but anyway, she's going to be--

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.680
Then, can Eri come, too?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.560
I see...

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.060
The school festival. Can Eri come, too?

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.530
School festival?

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.030
Eri, this is a great idea!

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:20.240
A school festival is a festival
that takes place at our school!

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:26.830
"School Festival"

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.460
The people at school plan things
for everyone at school to have fun,

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.000
and they sell food--

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.880
Oh, apples! There might be candy apples!

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.340
Candy apples...?

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:37.800
It's a type of candy where they
make apples--of all things--even sweeter!

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.220
Even sweeter...

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.350
All right. I'll talk it over with the principal.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.980
In that case...

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.900
Eri, what do you think?

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.650
I... thought...

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:58.530
...about the people who saved me...
when I was saved...

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.950
I thought about how I wanted
to know more about everyone.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.330
I'll tell you more than you want to know!

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.790
Let's work on the principal, too,
to get him to say "yes"!

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.090
Okay!

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.550
I'm on a break from school right now,

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.550
so I can stay with you
the whole time on our date!

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.050
Date?

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.590
An outing taken by a man
and a woman who are intimate!

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.220
An outing taken by a man and a woman...

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.810
Togata, what are you saying...?

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.230
Chief! Another video's been uploaded!

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.400
It's a new post! From him!

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.650
We haven't gotten a single clue yet, woof...

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.280
Hurry up and investigate
where the post came from, woof!

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.070
But they throw up a smokescreen every time!

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.490
Just hurry!

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:52.710
"At a certain convenience store"

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.790
Yes, sir!

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.540
Dear listeners, how are you today?

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.380
Today...

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.760
...I committed a robbery!

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.300
"I've seen you before."

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.510
I've seen you before.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.140
You're popular on that video site.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.930
"You're popular on that video site."

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.640
Excuse me.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.940
I do not have time to enjoy a chat with you.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:15.610
Before the heroes come,
please put cash into this briefcase.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.110
Go on!

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.740
All right...

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.870
Oh, and it would be lovely if you
could put the 1,000-yen bills in stacks of ten.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.330
That's very specific...

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.750
Thank you.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.880
Put down your weapons!

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.510
This is bad, Gentle! The heroes have arrived!

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.840
Will you be all right?

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.300
Calm yourself, La Brava.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.180
"A composed Gentle!!"

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.180
Do you think just two champions could stop me?

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.390
Put down your weapons!

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.820
"A bunch came"

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.860
All right, come this way!

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.860
La Brava.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.820
I know, Gentle!

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.530
Cut this part.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:13.460
"Gentle's so strong!"

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.080
Come now, let us go, La Brava.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.710
Wait, Gentle!

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.790
You forgot the money!

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.920
No, La Brava.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.210
I'm paying the appearance fee.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.850
Money is not my goal.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.600
I want my name to go down in history...

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.270
That's right! It is I, Gentle!

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.110
"Looking at the camera!"
"So cool, Gentle!!"

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.230
Gentle Criminal!

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:43.450
And now, dear listeners, until the next video!

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.860
Gentle Video.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.660
See you next time!

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.500
They're becoming more elaborate.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.920
Gentle Criminal...

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.210
Is he messing around, or is he serious...?

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.590
I can't tell at all, woof.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.010
Gentle, Gentle!

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.640
What's the matter, La Brava?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.560
We're not getting that many views, Gentle!

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.350
Even though you were so wonderful today, too!

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.520
I wonder why!

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.020
As I thought...

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.360
I must accomplish an even greater feat.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.070
A great feat means action...

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.070
It is a question for the ages, La Brava.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.080
That's hot!

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.460
I am searching, La Brava!

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.750
For a scheme that will
make me even more magnificent!

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:46.840
And that scheme will arrive soon...

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.300
That's hot!

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.980
"Preview"

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.230
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.110
For the school festival,

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.940
we'll be putting on a show that
combines a band performance with dancing.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.820
We decide what everyone's doing,
on the choreography and costumes,

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.320
and put together the
different elements we'll have on stage.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.450
It's all to bring smiles to everyone's faces.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:41.790
But Gentle Criminal's shrewd
look clings to the backs of our necks.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.300
Next time, "Prepping for the
School Festival Is the Funnest Part."

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.010
"Next time: Prepping for the
School Festival Is the Funnest Part"

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.760
Go beyond!

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.010
Plus Ultra!
