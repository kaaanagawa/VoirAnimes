00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.421
<i>I killed my family.</i>

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.342
<i>After that, I rushed out of my front gate
as if I was running for my life.</i>

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.971
<i>I had no idea what I should do.</i>

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.558
<i>I had no idea
what I should do from then on.</i>

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:22.605
<i>Anyone, please tell me the answer.</i>

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.024
<i>Please save me.</i>

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:30.905
<i>I couldn't speak
because the guilt was stuck in my throat.</i>

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.199
Little boy.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.160
Are you all right?

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:36.995
Why are you wearing that rag…

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.083
Police or heroes will be here soon.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.253
I must go to work now. Be a good boy.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:51.801
<i>Places with higher population density
will always have more troubles.</i>

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.848
<i>There are plenty of troubles that are
more pressing than a missing child.</i>

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.476
<i>Even so,</i>

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.103
<i>no one was there to help me
despite the fact</i>

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.272
<i>that the street was crawling with heroes.</i>

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:08.234
<i>Is this the retribution I deserve
for taking the life of my family?</i>

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:13.740
<i>At that moment…</i>

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:18.828
<i>Had someone reached out to me…</i>

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.962
<i>that obnoxious itch might have stopped.</i>

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:04.434
You possess a destructive impulse

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.936
that is too strong for you
to even control.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:13.526
That impulse is overflowing and the itch
is a form of warning by your body.

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:16.613
You don't have to put up with anything.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.532
<i>That's not wrong.</i>

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.038
Are you looking for trouble?
You should just walk behind us!

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.041
We're not going to let it slide
just because you're a kid!

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.375
Not a chance!

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.718
<i>Oh, poor child.</i>

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.762 line:20%
What are you afraid of?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.057
Follow your heart and do as it beckons.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.894
Otherwise, you'll end up suffering alone.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:54.192
Conscience, morality, and ethics
are the made-up values by humanity.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:57.654
These came from people
who want society to run smoothly.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.199
Do not be shackled and have no fear.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.453
Your thoughts are more important
than anything.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:10.583
Now, Tenko, what will you do from here on?

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.007
I want to kill the two jerks
that beat me up.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.927
I don't know why,

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:25.306
<i>but these off-putting emotions
keep pouring in, they just won't stop.</i>

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.185
I can't control them.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.022
Then I wish you all the best.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.821
More hero agencies
are popping up in this place.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.906
It's such a pain in the neck.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:50.623
<i>Carry them with you wherever you go.</i>

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.919
<i>Do not let the bond fade away.</i>

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.880
What now, brat?

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.675
That is so gross! What do you want?

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:09.976
This is incredible.
He must have had amnesia.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:15.148
The memories are merely sealed away.
It's still inside his heart.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.859
It's as though he's clinging onto them

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:21.154
all while punishing himself for the sins
as he carries them around.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:26.659
His emotions are unstable because
his memories have been sealed away.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.287
He feels insecure.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:30.913
See?

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.624
He is subconsciously
keeping his Quirk in check.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.421 line:20%
I shall cultivate him
as he goes down the path.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.424
The Symbol of Fear
that craves destruction,

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:46.429
you've taken
that first step of your journey.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:51.809
It feels so disgusting.
I feel like puking.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.729
But I don't know why.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.107
My mind is so calm.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.944
I have this feeling that I will be
forgiven no matter what I do.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.780
<i>Rejoice.</i>

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:07.075
You held back your tears
and endured the suffering.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.160
You have been reborn.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.370
This is my gift for you.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:15.416
These are the hands of the two thugs
who helped you grow.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.920
The two of them?
But there are five hands here.

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:22.673
It's a bonus. One of them was spoiled.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:26.552 line:20%
It's to make sure you remember
this memorable day of your life.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:31.265
<i>It's like holding a newborn child
in my arms.</i>

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.976
<i>It's like soothing an exhausted body.</i>

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:39.148
Now let me witness your new form,

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.276
Tomura Shigaraki.

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:50.868
Tomura Shigaraki…

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:55.623
"Tomura" means to mourn for the dead
and bid them farewell.

00:06:55.706 --> 00:07:01.045
Tenko Shimura has been reborn
into an existence that invites mourning.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.506
What about "Shigaraki"?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.050
That is my surname.

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:10.346
<i>I remember everything now.</i>

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:16.269
<i>Back then, I killed my father
because I wanted to.</i>

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.523 line:20%
<i>I felt a burden lifted from my chest</i>

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.400
<i>when I saw Mom
and the others disintegrate.</i>

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:26.195
<i>That was no tragedy.</i>

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.238 line:20%
VILLAIN: RE-DESTRO

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.658 line:20%
All I want is to destroy.

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:33.411
I don't need a future.

00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:38.875
I don't care what the League of Villains
will do from now on.

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.712
I don't need these things anymore either!

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.882 line:20%
<i>Stress: 100%!</i>

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.471
<i>This should have defeated him.</i>

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:57.935
VILLAIN: GIGANTOMACHIA

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.813 line:20%
Re-Destro…

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:05.860 line:20%
VILLAIN: DABI

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:10.948
Your attack is nothing
if I can destroy it before it reaches me.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.287
You're simply bulky.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.873
I know how it feels.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:24.045
Destroying everything in sight
must be very exhilarating.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.759
My power is a means to my goal.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:34.555
It's a means to liberate humans.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.183
It's a means to finish
what Destro started.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.561 line:20%
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:43.231 line:20%
<i>I have this restless sensation
in my chest.</i>

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.359
<i>Is it fear? No.</i>

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.906
<i>Even fear can be a source of power for me!</i>

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:55.618
<i>So why…</i>

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:59.580 line:20%
You've been pushed
into a corner, Re-Destro.

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:03.000
<i>Why is the stress receding?</i>

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:08.798
Rikiya, we've been living in hiding
for generations.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.176
You're the chosen one
who can fulfill Destro's legacy.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.012
You must finish what Destro started.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.766
<i>Detnerat Patented…</i>

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:23.062
<i>Burden-Amplifying Steel
Pressure Mechanism: Claustro!</i>

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:30.027
<i>Stress at 150% output!</i>

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.198
I see. This is good.

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.869
-We should stay away from them.
-That hurts.

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.663
-They haven't found us.
-My arm hurts.

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:43.332
It's good to have him distract
the enemies.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.585
The enemies stand no chance against him.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.837 line:20%
We must use this window
to regroup with everyone.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.257
He actually woke up sooner than expected.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.594 line:20%
We'll be completely wiped out
if we run into him now.

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:56.053
Damn that ice guy.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.389
I was so close to burning him to a crisp.

00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:00.349
Doctor, did you copy that?

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.853
<i>Gigantomachia is too dangerous.
Get us out of here or we'll be at risk.</i>

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:06.689
-Are you trying to kill Johnny?
<i>-What?</i>

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:10.192
Johnny gets tonsillitis
every time he is teleported.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.527
Why should I care? Just do it.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.697
Besides, you use it all the time.
So that must be a lie.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.036
I don't want to be associated with people
who are now targets of others.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:24.040
Come to me after you've broken free
from the Liberation Army's surveillance.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.834 line:20%
Don't you care about Shigaraki?

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:29.045 line:20%
Isn't he All For One's heir?

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.840
That's all the more reason
to push him into desperation.

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.512
<i>When we fight the League of Villains,</i>

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:42.767
we must be wary
of Dabi's large-scale flame attack.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.812
Geten, you are the core
of the Liberation Army.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:50.024
Sorry, Re-Destro.

00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:52.109
I shouldn't be worried about your safety.

00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:00.451 line:20%
We must protect Re-Destro.

00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:02.119
Giran, hang in there!

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:03.788
Re-Destro!

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.769
So that was your 150% output.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.647
Is this the so-called Plus Ultra?

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.109 line:20%
The heir of my master…

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:38.239
<i>It's not oppression but liberation.</i>

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:42.701
<i>As human beings, it's our right
to use our abilities freely.</i>

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:50.126
<i>After going through pain and reawakening,
it's as though he's…</i>

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.841
<i>broken free from all forms of shackles.</i>

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.678
<i>I see.</i>

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.055
<i>I know what that
flustering sensation really is now.</i>

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.103
<i>I'll just have to stay away
from his effective range.</i>

00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:12.565
<i>Have no fear.</i>

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.692
<i>Think of it this way.</i>

00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:22.616
A person's life, progress, and endeavor
are all within his grasp.

00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:28.789
You can decide whether you want
to crush it or toy with it as you please.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.835
If your hatred aligns with your joy,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.714
<i>then you're free.</i>

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.317
I'll destroy everything!

00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:19.924
TOMURA SHIGARAKI
QUIRK: DECAY

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:22.009
CORRUPTING ANYTHING HE TOUCHES
WITH HIS FIVE FINGERS

00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:23.260
RE-DESTRO
ABILITY: STRESS

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:25.221
TURNING THE STRESS HE COLLECTED
INTO STRENGTH

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:51.372
Your leg touched the ground just now.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:55.626
But you severed it before the corruption
spread to your entire body.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.088
Hey.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:03.384
Why are we even fighting each other?

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:08.847
Were you the one who started it first?

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.647
Re-Destro!

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.816
Our grand commander…

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:19.859
This can't be happening.

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:23.445
Everyone, we must rescue
our grand commander!

00:14:28.158 --> 00:14:31.912
<i>My Incite has been negated as well.
How can this be?</i>

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.289
<i>Trumpet.</i>

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:36.876
At this rate,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.672
you'll die in vain.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.555 line:20%
<i>The freedom to use our abilities</i>

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.766
<i>is liberation, not oppression.</i>

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:57.229
<i>Great Destro.</i>

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:00.733
<i>If the person
who leads the charge of liberation</i>

00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:03.485
<i>is the reflection of freedom,</i>

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:08.157
<i>it would be this young man
who can laugh it off</i>

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:13.162
<i>as he sees the weight of history
and blood-stained destiny as a liability.</i>

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:18.125
<i>I see it now.</i>

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:22.421
<i>I can see the brilliance
of this young man.</i>

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:30.596
They all agree with me. No.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:35.559
They agree with Destro's legacy
and have the resolve to become martyrs.

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:39.605
You are right.
I started it first and lost the fight.

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.273
Do whatever you please with me.

00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:46.654
But I always have the resolve
to give up my life for Destro's legacy.

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:53.911
The Meta Liberation Army
will follow your command.

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.213 line:20%
The heir…

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:13.597
Had we joined hands with Hassaikai,
we would be enjoying sushi right now.

00:16:14.848 --> 00:16:21.105 line:20%
Since you're the President of Detnerat,
you must be loaded with money.

00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:27.319
ONE WEEK LATER

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.614
<i>A tragic event laid waste
to the peaceful town.</i>

00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:35.911
<i>The criminal group lured the heroes away</i>

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.288
<i>from the city for their attack.</i>

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:42.126
<i>In the face of the abrupt disaster,</i>

00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:44.336
<i>the people of Deika united as one
against evil.</i>

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:48.590
<i>The heroes arrived
after learning more about the situation.</i>

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:51.927
<i>Many didn't make it in the end.</i>

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:58.100
<i>As all 20 criminals were killed in action,
the tragedy came to an end.</i>

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:06.734
<i>The CEO and President of Detnerat,
Rikiya Yotsubashi, was also in Deika.</i>

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:09.778
<i>He lost his legs
and suffered heavy injuries,</i>

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.739
<i>but he managed to survive.</i>

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:18.704
<i>There are comments
about how untrained citizens</i>

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:21.915
<i>caused greater damage with their Quirks,</i>

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:27.004
<i>but the cheers for the heroic deeds
of Deika's citizens are everywhere.</i>

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:32.634
<i>But the incident left
many mysteries unsolved.</i>

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:35.596
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.849
So this is what they mean
by "the calm after a storm."

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.769
You barely did anything.

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:44.813
Don't be silly. I did my best to escape.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:47.024
Dabi, if you're not eating it, I am.

00:17:47.107 --> 00:17:49.443
Go ahead. I hate fish anyway.

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.906
Sorry, Toga.

00:17:53.989 --> 00:17:58.619
If you hadn't transfused your blood
to Toga, you would still be alive.

00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:00.204
Please don't do that.

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:02.372
I'm still alive
so that is very off-putting.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.542
Let's not get on anyone's nerves!

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.837
My leg moved on its own! Stupid leg!

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.256
I've been a bad kid. Please don't hit me.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.634
What am I talking about?

00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:17.971
I thought he overcame his trauma,
but it seems to have gotten worse.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:21.600
Violent treatments
had done a number on him.

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:23.060
It's time.

00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:25.729
Shut it! I'm still enjoying my sushi!

00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:29.691
<i>But we paid for the sushi you're eating.</i>

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:35.531
We provided treatment, image alterations,
and Toga's coat as well.

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:36.448
What?

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.367
The baldy should have been
in a hospital ward!

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.120
Don't forget who you owe your life to!

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.080
Stop arguing with them, Skeptic.

00:18:43.163 --> 00:18:45.040
They are Grand Commander's…

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:48.085
I mean, they were chosen by Re-Destro.

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:53.048
<i>Re-Destro's decree
is still Destro's decree.</i>

00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:57.970
Welcome.

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.472
Fellow warriors of liberation,

00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:04.643
I am Re-Destro of Meta Liberation Army!

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:09.398
From now on,
the Meta Liberation Army shall be reborn!

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:13.652
I thought Tomura
had lost all of his little hands.

00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:15.863
There is still one left.

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:18.907
It was a miracle it wasn't destroyed
during the chaos.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.410
Is he going to use it
as his personal trademark?

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:22.995
Up until that very day,

00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:26.081
I had been treating
the League of Villains as a threat.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.375
I had no doubt about that belief.

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:32.254
But I was too narrow-minded.

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:36.258 line:20%
I was shackled
by my bloodline and the creed!

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:39.136 line:20%
At that moment,
I witnessed the true form of liberation!

00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:42.139
This is not submission!

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:46.351
I believe Tomura Shigaraki
is the true liberator!

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:50.939
I'm stepping down for I've been baptized
by the sheer respect I have for him.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.025
<i>The Liberation Army will be reborn</i>

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:57.196
<i>with Tomura Shigaraki
as the grand commander!</i>

00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:00.699
We will walk the path
of a more profound liberation!

00:20:00.782 --> 00:20:03.952
The Meta Liberation Army
and League of Villains will be united

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.496
-and be crowned a new name.
-Let's go.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.249
I, Re-Destro, and Spinner
from the League of Villains

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:10.709
came up with the name.

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:14.213
Announce the name, Tomura Shigaraki!

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:17.049 line:20%
<i>Paranormal Liberation Front.</i>

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:21.803
The word "villain" has been removed.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:26.433
The word "Meta Ability" will have a wider
and more general definition.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.811
Furthermore, I have appointed
the nine members on the stage

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.063
as my lieutenants.

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:34.107
They will each form their own platoon
based on their special characteristics.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:40.155
Anyway, a name is just a decoration
such as this thing on my face.

00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:42.908
Do as you wish with it.

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:54.336
That was remarkable work from you.
Do you care for a drink?

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.379
Get lost.

00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:56.338
As you wish.

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:58.090
<i>Let's scram, Trumpet.</i>

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:02.427
<i>I hate to see him in this state.</i>

00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:09.059
It's a miracle you're still alive
after suffering those damages.

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:12.062
<i>"Paranormal Liberation Front."</i>

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:14.314
<i>Such a fancy name.</i>

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:19.736
<i>Well, at least it's not
as cheap-sounding as "League of Villains."</i>

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.572
Gigantomachia now follows my command.

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:27.619
I think I've met
the minimum requirement you mentioned.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:28.996
Yes.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:34.376
Your memories and Quirk returned
to their original state.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:37.087
As promised,

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:42.926
<i>I will grant you the power,
if you want it.</i>

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:16.812
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:21.358
<i>Tomura Shigaraki now commands
the Liberation Army.</i>

00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:23.652
<i>After receiving this information,</i>

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:27.405 line:20%
<i>the heroes are now mustering
their resources to face the threat.</i>

00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:30.617
<i>The inevitable war is nigh.</i>

00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:34.538
<i>Even the students of U.A. High
are caught up in this war.</i>

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:37.791
<i>Next episode, "The High, Deep Blue Sky."</i>

00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:40.794
<i>The smoke signal marks
the prologue of an all-out war.</i>

00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:42.212
<i>Go beyond.</i>

00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:43.588
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
