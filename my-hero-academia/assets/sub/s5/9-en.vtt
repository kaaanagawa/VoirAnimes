00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:02.002
CLASS A VS CLASS B

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:09.926
<i>Class A and Class B of U.A. High</i>
<i>are in a joint training battle.</i>

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.015
<i>After the third battle,</i>
<i>each class has won one battle so far.</i>

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.183
<i>And now, the fourth battle will begin.</i>

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.562
<i>Hold on. Are you serious?</i>

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.522
Are you kidding me? Your strategy…

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:23.815
That's right.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:27.277
<i>Wait and see, you stupid Deku.</i>

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.296
With Jiro and Sero on this battleground…

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.217
I have a bad feeling about this.
They are both very tough opponents.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:18.138
Not to mention Bakugo and Sato
are both powerful as well.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.098
<i>Their team balance is impeccable.</i>

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:23.643
<i>It's best to assume they can wipe us out</i>
<i>if they have the upper hand.</i>

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.854
Whatever it is,

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.022
we should chop them up now!

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.109
Let's strike them
with a preemptive attack!

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.994
Class A and Class B
have won one battle each.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:44.247
Do you think their strength is equal?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.626
But Class A only won thanks to Shinso!

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.921 line:20%
Well, is their strength really
on the same level?

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:55.300 line:20%
-Mr. Vlad King, that's too much!
-Mr. Vlad King, that's too much!

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.511 line:20%
He can control blood, but not his brain.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.890 line:20%
He loves his students a little too much.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.308 line:20%
Are you done over there?

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.519
Sir, we are simply against
this bias broadcast!

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:10.106
Are you going to protest
if you lose a battle?

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.526
Class B's tactic is much more formidable
than you think.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.279
That is a fact.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.490
It seems like Vlad is the better teacher.

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:24.662 line:20%
In the end, you're just troublemakers!

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:25.830 line:20%
Don't you see that?

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.542 line:20%
Only failures will cause trouble
to themselves!

NEITO MONOMA
QUIRK: COPY

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:37.675
Class B has been training day and night
to improve their skills and Quirks.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.511
But Class A should be
capable of more than that.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:43.389
All Might, you're still very fond
of Class A.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.391
I like all the students.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:51.814
<i>I look forward to your performance,</i>
<i>Young Bakugo.</i>

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.734 line:20%
Move faster, you slowpokes!

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.570
I have to listen to their movements!

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.447
Stop nagging! Just catch up!

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.200 line:20%
He always wants us to catch up.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.827 line:20%
He hasn't changed since sports day.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.497 line:20%
In any case, he always helps out.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.332
However…

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.167
Listen up, you second-rated jerks.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.044
Just follow my lead.

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.545
Don't call us "jerks."

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.464
And stop saying we are second-rated.

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:18.424
I'll take the lead in the battle.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.344 line:20%
Your job is to provide me with support.

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.721
Ears, check for any sound
of their movements.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.223
Find out where they are.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.267
Stop calling me names. My name is Jiro!

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.727 line:20%
Bakugo, are you going
to attack them head-on?

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:32.647
Their team is mostly people
who can counter our attacks.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.107
Since we have Jiro with us,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.068
we can look for an opening
and proceed with caution.

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.236
Fools.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.948
That is exactly
why we should strike first.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.659
We don't look for an opening.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.703
We create it ourselves.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.580 line:20%
As long as we can track them down,
we can win.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.291
Do you get it now?

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.750
Be careful!

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.043
This is dangerous!

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.962
Hold onto those.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.925
These aren't very powerful,
but they will come in handy.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:02.969
And there's more.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.932
<i>Is he certain this is the right tactic?</i>

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:13.771
I spot someone!

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.565
-Ear!
-It's Jiro!

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:19.777
They are all in the area.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.987
Find them!

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.130
Hurry up!

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:40.548
Be patient!

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.976 line:20%
We fell for their trap!

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:55.271
Indeed. It's over for you.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.527
<i>We used Jiro's scouting ability</i>
<i>to our advantage.</i>

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.696 line:20%

<i>Quirk: Lizard Tail Splitter.</i>

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.661 line:20%
<i>She can divide herself into parts</i>
<i>and control them at will.</i>

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:19.212
<i>After further improving her Quirks,</i>
<i>she can control up to 50 different parts!</i>

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:20.963
<i>Get out of my way!</i>

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.302
Bakugo, over here!

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:30.348
All right! It's game over!

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:33.017
Glue Squall!

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.687
It's glue!

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.856
This is bad. We walked right into it.

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.527
It's like he created a web
to capture even himself!

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.572
I did it. It's just as Setsuna planned.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.783 line:20%

<i>He can spray a large amount of glue</i>
<i>and adjust the rate at which it dries.</i>

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:58.835
You are too slow!

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.045 line:20%

<i>He can produce large blades</i>

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.809
<i>We disrupted Jiro's hearing</i>

00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:17.728
<i>The pipelines and tapes</i>
<i>are covered in adhesive.</i>

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.857
<i>There is no way to escape</i>

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.281 line:20%
<i>I must protect them!</i>

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:36.873
Bakugo!

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.500
The perfect timing!

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.961
I'll finish off Jiro first!

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.970 line:20%
<i>He saved his team and won the fight.</i>

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:56.267 line:20%
<i>Win and save them all.</i>

<i>Don't forget…</i>

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.241 line:20%
When you're in danger, I will aid you.

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:15.745
You managed to withstand that.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:18.498
You sure are fast as a bug!

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:21.959
For real?

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:24.795
Thanks!

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.755
Shut it!

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.882
They got away. Search for them.

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.802
I don't care if this is training or what.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.891
I had made up my mind long ago.

00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:40.811
I must win every battle
with undeniable victory!

00:08:41.562 --> 00:08:43.481
I won't let them capture anyone!

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:45.858 line:20%
That is…

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:50.988 line:20%
the real victory for a true fighter!

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.116
This is strange.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.245
Am I seeing things now?

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.914
I think he was protecting Jiro.

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:02.416
He did. But he also kicked her.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.877
Bakugo is always so unpredictable.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.379
Monoma, don't worry.

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:08.381
Your eyes are perfectly fine.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.468 line:20%
He changed his fighting style!

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.180
Well, yes.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.975
This is the first time I've seen him

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.310
standing out to protect others.

00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:28.776
<i>I shouldn't fight him head-on. Retreat.</i>

00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:34.240
<i>If we get into a real fight,</i>
<i>there is no way we can win.</i>

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.370
<i>As soon as the capture operation fails,</i>
<i>we must retreat.</i>

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:43.291
<i>We must keep ambushing them</i>
<i>to maintain our advantage.</i>

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.380
There are too many noises.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.299
But the number has dwindled.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.551
The number has dwindled?

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:56.178
They are falling back.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.180
Are they regrouping?

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.142 line:20%
Jerks, they are looking down on us.

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:07.064
<i>They are a one-man team that follows</i>
<i>Bakugo's lead in any strategy.</i>

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:10.943
<i>We can keep baiting Bakugo</i>
<i>by giving him more pressure.</i>

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.071
<i>When he makes a mistake,</i>
<i>the team will crumble!</i>

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:17.033
I can't locate them.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.659
However…

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.953
I can recognize the sound
if I concentrate!

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.288 line:20%
Let's go!

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:36.010 line:20%
-They went into hiding!
-They are using their Quirks again!

00:10:36.093 --> 00:10:37.720 line:20%

00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:40.473

<i>He can fuse different objects</i>

<i>But he can't activate his ability</i>
<i>unless he touches the objects.</i>

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.448
Impressive precision!

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.952 line:20%
There is no way your tape can hit me
in this environment.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.955
Is this part of Tokage's plan?

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.582
She foresees everything.

00:11:14.298 --> 00:11:15.341
Go!

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.889
Curse you!
Don't you dare stick me to the pipes!

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:24.266
Do you have to be so upset?

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.768
I'm counting on you!

00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:28.145

<i>The others assist his attack.</i>

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:43.637
<i>There will be some gaps in between.</i>

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:46.974
<i>We can make use of those gaps</i>

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.518

00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:09.079 line:20%
Bakugo let them attack freely
because he trusts his teammates!

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:10.831
Their coordination worked.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.083
His drumming practice
was useful after all.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:21.467
<i>Tokage can split her body into 50 parts</i>
<i>and control them freely.</i>

00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:25.638
<i>But the separated parts will stop moving</i>
<i>after a certain time.</i>

00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:28.307
<i>Then the parts will regenerate</i>
<i>from her main body.</i>

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:31.852
<i>If that assumption is correct,</i>

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:35.606
<i>there must be a limit</i>
<i>to how much she can regenerate.</i>

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.025
<i>Just like Yaoyorozu,</i>

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.654
<i>she will be worn out</i>
<i>and her level of concentration will drop.</i>

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:45.241
<i>If she split her body into parts</i>
<i>to make noises,</i>

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:50.287
<i>that would work against her regeneration.</i>

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:57.169
<i>Which means these parts will return</i>
<i>to her body to reform and reset.</i>

00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:02.758 line:20%
<i>Jiro mentioned there were fewer sounds.</i>
<i>That proves my hypothesis!</i>

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.138
That was close.

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:14.812 line:20%
You…

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:18.274
How much have you changed?

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.989
I've always been the same.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.409 line:20%
Whenever it is, my goal…

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:33.455
is to become the No. 1 Hero
that surpasses All Might!

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.960
<i>What…</i>

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:39.837 line:20%
WELCOME

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.840
<i>In less than five minutes,</i>

00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:46.343
<i>Class A's flawless teamwork</i>

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:49.638
<i>won the battle</i>
<i>without losing any teammate!</i>

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:51.807
KATSUKI BAKUGO

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:54.602
SECRETION OF NITROGLYCERIN-LIKE SWEAT
FROM HIS PALMS

00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:56.312
KYOKA JIRO
QUIRK: EARPHONE JACK

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:58.522
HER EXTENSION JACKS
CAN CAUSE A SONIC BOOM

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:01.609
There were no unnecessary casualties.

00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:04.236
The capturing operation
was swift and smooth.

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:07.948
Bakugo acted as the main attacker
with his mobility and firepower.

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:10.034
The other three coordinated well.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.787
You came up with a tactic
based on past data

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:16.332
while considering the difference in power.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:20.753
But you didn't adapt to the situation.
You lack Honenuki's flexibility.

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.632
We failed miserably because of my mistake.

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:27.718
Never mind.
Let's take it as a learning experience.

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:28.636
Yes.

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:32.973
That impulsive guy won't lose control
when he's thinking rationally.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.350
You got that right.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.101
That was surprising for sure.

00:15:37.811 --> 00:15:40.773
Kacchan, there is nothing you can't do!

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:43.233
Jiro stole the spotlight as well!

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:44.485
I'm a hero, okay?

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.488 line:20%
You look like a stray kitty
taken in by a delinquent.

00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.073
I'm a human being, all right?

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.664
I got chills.

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:01.210
Did you catch a cold or something?

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.796 line:20%
-Kacchan!
-Stand aside, you junk!

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:07.549
But I'm not even in your way…

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.301 line:20%
IZUKU MIDORIYA
QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:11.637 line:20%
I've moved forward even more.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.973
Indeed. You were amazing.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:17.518
I'll become stronger at a pace
you can't catch up.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:19.770
I will surpass you.

00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:23.649
Shut it! Was that supposed to be a threat?

00:16:23.732 --> 00:16:26.485
There is no way
I would let you surpass me!

00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:27.778
You useless trash!

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.531
We'll see about that.

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.787
You have a great childhood friend.

00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:39.289
Jerk!

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.875
I wish his attitude could be better.

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:47.715 line:20%
HITOSHI SHINSO
QUIRK: BRAINWASH

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:53.178
That hysteric explosion guy…

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.305
This is going to be fun.

00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:58.142
Sorry, Monoma.

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.686
One win, two defeats, and one draw.

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.022
There is no way we can win this.

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.399
Your apology is not needed, Tokage.

00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:09.695
Your teammates will learn
from their mistakes.

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:11.280
Isn't that a great experience?

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:15.868
It's true Class B can't win,
but we haven't lost yet.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:19.413
But I want all of you
to understand one thing.

00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:23.250 line:20%
People who get serious
and don't become a liability,

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:26.879
or the attention seeker
who resorts to unpleasant means,

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:30.049 line:20%
who is on the correct path?

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:34.011
We are all supporting characters
of others' lives.

00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:37.639
But we are the protagonists
of our own lives!

00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:40.225 line:20%
What do we do then?

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.852 line:20%
Don't get so discouraged!

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:46.065 line:20%
I think it's best
to follow Tokage's tactic.

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.483
In terms of team balance,

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:50.069
both teams have almost
the same composition.

00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:53.280
Most of us have technical Quirks.

00:17:53.363 --> 00:17:56.325
There are various ways
to launch an ambush.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:59.328 line:20%
Most importantly,
we have five combatants on our team.

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:02.664
Head-on battles won't do us any good.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:07.419
After watching the last battle,
I feel resentment towards Midoriya.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:08.962
Resentment?

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.715
That's her way of saying "scary."

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:13.008
I see.

00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:16.804
<i>Midoriya…</i>

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.893
<i>His mobility and power are on par</i>
<i>with Bakugo's, if not better.</i>

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:26.980 line:20%
<i>He even learned ranged attacks recently.</i>

00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:31.276
If we make the slightest mistake,
we'll be decimated as the last team.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.487
Midoriya will break through our defense.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.075
Then let's make Midoriya our priority.

00:18:38.158 --> 00:18:40.869
We must take him down first.

00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:44.623 line:20%
But he is capable
of breaking my Brainwash.

00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:48.627
However, with Monoma's Quirk,

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.004
there might be a way to subdue Midoriya.

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:54.258
I feel a little daunted
with the high hopes.

00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:57.261 line:20%
After all,
there is a chance it might fail.

00:18:57.344 --> 00:18:58.470 line:20%
It might fail?

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.973 line:20%
That means he can't copy
his opponent's Quirk.

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:01.974 line:20%
I see.

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:05.686
Well, we must stop him if we want to win.

00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:08.605 line:20%
We're counting on you, Shinso.

00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:12.943 line:20%
The fifth battle is the last round.

00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:15.028
How will Shinso perform?

00:19:15.612 --> 00:19:16.905
The battle is a test

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.908
to see if he is qualified
to transfer into the Hero Course.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:23.704
<i>He put up a great performance</i>
<i>in the first battle.</i>

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:27.291
But the same trick might not work twice.

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:28.750
That's true enough.

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:31.545
Class A is very strong too.

00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:33.797
<i>I wish him all the best.</i>

00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:37.885
We should first deal with Shinso.

00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:40.512 line:20%
I'm worried.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.931 line:20%
I don't want to get brainwashed.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.684
Don't dwell on that.

00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:47.936
They are capable of many ways

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.856
to ambush us
without even showing themselves.

00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:52.733
And our Quirks…

00:19:52.816 --> 00:19:53.734
I can float.

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:54.693
I can melt!

00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:56.153
I can stick!

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:01.617
This is not looking good.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.410
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:06.330
We can't go on defensive or offensive.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:12.377
Very well!
We should use my Pop Off: Vineyard!

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.796
No one would fall for that.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:19.176
We must find them
and let them fall into our trap.

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:22.679
I will act as the decoy.

00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:24.181
Deku!

00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:25.682
But how?

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.352
You mentioned your Quirk was acting weird.

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:30.604
Yes.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.440
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:37.402 line:20%
But after watching the fourth battle,

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:39.947
my guess is they will be wary of me.

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:42.824
I must be even more mobile.

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:45.327
-Are you sure about this?
-What?

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:47.454
We are counting on you to win.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.207
Don't worry.

00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:53.293
We will win!

00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:57.589
Yes!

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:02.052 line:20%
The old you would have panicked instead.

00:21:03.553 --> 00:21:05.180
<i>Everything feels normal.</i>

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:09.559
<i>I've moved forward even more.</i>

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:13.230
<i>I'll become stronger at a pace</i>
<i>you can't catch up.</i>

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.025
<i>He left me with a challenge.</i>

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.945
<i>I must not let everyone down!</i>

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.911 line:20%
All right! It's the fifth battle!

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.961
<i>This is the last round.</i>

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.671
<i>Are you ready?</i>

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.758 line:20%
<i>Never let your guard down! All the best!</i>

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:46.513
<i>Start!</i>

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:17.938
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:21.858 line:20%
<i>It's the final battle</i>
<i>of the joint training.</i>

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:25.153
<i>Class A will only need a draw</i>
<i>to secure victory.</i>

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.030
<i>But we must not be complacent.</i>

00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:29.366 line:20%
<i>Class B has Shinso on their team.</i>

00:23:29.449 --> 00:23:32.035
<i>There is also Monoma</i>
<i>who can copy our Quirks.</i>

00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:35.872 line:20%
<i>I'm the key to winning this battle.</i>
<i>That's why I must strike!</i>

00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:38.333 line:20%
<i>Next episode, "That Which Is Inherited."</i>

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.962
<i>An anomaly manifests inside of me</i>
<i>during the battle.</i>

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:43.463
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:44.881
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
