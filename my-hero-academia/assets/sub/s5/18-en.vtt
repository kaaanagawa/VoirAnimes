My sister invited you over for dinner.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.266
Why?

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.560
She wants me to introduce
my friends to her.

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:22.230
Tell her we're not your friends!
Is that clear?

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.732
Kacchan…

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.484
Welcome.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.945
Thank you for taking out
some time to come here

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.321
despite your busy schedule.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.199
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for looking after Shoto for me.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.951
I'm his elder sister, Fuyumi.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.288
<i>During our internship</i>

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.834
<i>Kacchan and I were invited</i>

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.843
Sorry, Fuyumi.
I still can't bring myself to do this.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.900
It's not that
I don't share Natsuo's feelings.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.571
But this is our chance.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:14.991
Todoroki.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:20.914
I'm sure you're preparing
to forgive him at some point.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.665
What?

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:28.004
If you really hated him that much,
it wouldn't be wrong not to forgive him.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.717
But because you have a kind heart,

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.179
it seems like you're waiting
for the right moment.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.101

-Endeavor…

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.970
<i>Endeavor!</i>

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:46.559

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.785
<i>When I had lost hope for everything,</i>

<i>when the wispy clouds of autumn days</i>
<i>were harsh enough to burn my eyes,</i>

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:11.876
<i>I saw you apprehend a thief named Takami.</i>

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.673
<i>From that day onward,</i>

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:21.719

<i>What do you think I did</i>

<i>I went and asked around about you</i>
<i>before I even filled my stomach.</i>

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:47.745
<i>Why?</i>

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:51.708
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.295
<i>I want you to put an end to all of this.</i>

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.256

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.218

<i>Your brother…</i>

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:17.317
Haven't you told Midoriya and the others
about your brother Toya?

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.652

Natsuo was very close with Toya.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.243
They used to play together all the time.

After our mother was hospitalized,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.543

She couldn't even see Shoto.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.383
But we made it through.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.387
<i>Shoto has started</i>

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.098
<i>Our family is finally becoming normal.</i>

00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:54.979

I'm sorry if this is all
too sudden for you.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:10.995
Not at all.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.498
It's time for you to go back to school.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.083
Yes!

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.503
Thank you for dinner.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.588

Yes.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.762
I'll ask my sister to send it to me.

Thank you

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.115
Don't mention it.

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:50.118
I should thank you instead.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.831
It's me.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:58.084
I'm sorry I had to cancel the appointment.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.255
I'll be free the whole day tomorrow.

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:03.589
We could watch a movie…

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.601
I hope you grow stronger
at a quicker pace.

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:17.854
Except for weekends,

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.816
I'll do my best to arrange for you to work
at least two days during the weekdays.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:25.570
I think Uraraka and Kirishima
had training like this before.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.197
But we have to study for our finals.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.491
Todoroki, could you help me

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:31.409
Sure.

00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:34.704
Aren't you the No. 1 Hero?
Can't you get us a bigger car?

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:37.748

What?

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.564
Natsuo?

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.358
Don't stick your head out of the window!

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.235
Mr. Kurumada, the lines on the road…

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.946

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:33.513
Endeavor!

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:39.602
You were the villain I apprehended
seven years ago.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:43.648
You even told us your villain name.

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.525

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:58.120
I'll only say this one more time.
Let go of him!

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.748
Sorry, Endeavor.

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:02.250
I hope you understand.

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:07.797

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:10.049
I long to be you!

00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:13.886
I have nothing I want to protect.

00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:16.722

Please…

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.401
take my life.

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:37.274
It's all right. You saved us.

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.693
Was it you? Thank you!

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:42.863
I'm glad everyone is all right.

00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:46.617
Hey, you!

00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:48.953
What?

00:13:58.546 --> 00:13:59.588
Are you hurt?

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:00.631
No!

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:03.133
It was too hot.

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.427
Old-man stink.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.015
Where is that white-line jerk?

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.517
Target immobilized.

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:16.272 line:20%
No, this isn't what I wanted.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:19.108
No, this can't be happening!

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.610
Stinking Deku! How are the civilians?

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:25.322
Everyone was inside their cars!
No one was hurt!

00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:29.493
A total victory.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.579
-Shut it!
-But why?

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:36.750
What did you say back then, No. 1 Hero?

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:40.880
"Try to at least take down one villain
before I do before the winter ends."

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:44.133
We took down the villain.

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:48.637
Yes, that was splendid.

00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:55.102
You managed to turn the situation around
immediately after my mistake.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.066
Why is he acting so friendly
all of a sudden?

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.109
Kacchan…

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:04.153
At least say it with a more pompous tone.

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:08.574 line:20%
Let go of me!

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:19.293
It was my fault.

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:24.006
At that moment, I couldn't help but think…

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:27.843
Had I saved you,

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:30.846
perhaps from now on…

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:37.102
you wouldn't hate me as much.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:38.187
What?

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.816
Natsuo, you don't have to believe me.

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:46.779
It wasn't my intention
to distance myself from you.

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:51.784
But I would be a liar if I said
I wasn't irresponsible or running away.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:57.247
It was the same for Toya.
I might as well have killed him myself.

00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:03.545 line:20%
It wasn't your intention
to distance yourself from us?

00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.341
Are you even being honest?

00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:11.387
I had always heard
the same thing from Toya.

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.223
I will never forgive you

00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:16.809
for the rest of my life.

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:23.148 line:20%
That's because I don't have
a kind heart like Shoto.

00:16:26.443 --> 00:16:27.695
Even so…

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.657
Even so, you chose to come home

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:34.827
for Fuyumi and your mother, am I right?

00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:40.124
<i>Fuyumi longs for our family</i>
<i>to be whole again.</i>

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.210
<i>I ruined this family with my own hands.</i>

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:49.758
You understand your sister's wish
to have a normal family and start over.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.011
That's why you keep trying.

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:55.347
You do have a kind heart.

00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:03.147 line:20%
<i>I'm sure you're preparing</i>
<i>to forgive him at some point.</i>

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.568
But because you have a kind heart…

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:12.906
It's fine by me
if you choose not to forgive me.

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.747 line:20%
I don't want your forgiveness.

00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:21.749 line:20%
I want to make amends.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.631
Fuyumi was happy.

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:35.471
But as soon as I saw your face,
the memories came back to me.

00:17:37.097 --> 00:17:40.434 line:20%
Why should we play along
with your change of heart?

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.689
You want to make amends,
but is there anything you can do?

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:49.443
I have an idea.

00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:52.321
Hey!

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:55.741
Cut it out, Endeavor!

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.368 line:20%
What's with the look on your face?

00:17:58.452 --> 00:17:59.995 line:20%
Please stop it!

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:04.249 line:20%
Where is that dazzling
and prideful flame of yours?

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:08.045
My hope is dying! No!

00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:12.007
It's dying! It shouldn't end like this!

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:16.095
No, Endeavor!

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:24.478
He used a booster shot to enhance
his Quirk of controlling white lines.

00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:26.021
A booster shot?

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:30.317
Yes. It's rare on the black market now,
but you can still find it.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.986
You need to be more careful.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.448
This is the second villain
that targeted you.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.451
Evil never gives up.

00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:42.412
That man is the real culprit!

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:45.874
The radiance he gives out
will invite greater darkness!

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.669
He will bring about the end to us all!

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:53.799
-But light never perishes.
-Look! Isn't that Shoto?

00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:54.800
My goodness!

00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:56.927
Thank you for saving us earlier.

00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:59.721
Well, what was your hero name?

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.057
-What?
-It's "Bakugo," right?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:03.725
No.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.061
What? Have you decided on a hero name--

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.939
I'm not going to tell you! Not a chance!

00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:10.190
Go to hell!

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:11.567
Can you tell me?

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.694 line:20%
No! Go to hell!

00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:17.156
I have to tell someone first.

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:23.787
<i>Hawks, it seems like</i>
<i>you were right about them.</i>

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:32.129
<i>Someone is talking about me.</i>

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:35.966
<i>I bet it's Endeavor.</i>

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:12.062 line:20%
<i>Endeavor sent us back to school afterward.</i>

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:18.443
<i>Todoroki told us what happened later on.</i>

00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:21.738
A villain attacked you?

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:23.448
Are you all right?

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:26.493
Yes, Shoto and his friends saved me.

00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:27.869
Shoto saved you?

00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:29.621
Yes.

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:32.916
Fuyumi.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.003
I've discussed it with Shoto and Natsuo.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.800
You're rebuilding a home for your mother.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:46.388
But I've left all the work to you…

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:49.516
But don't you worry.

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:53.520
<i>To make commuting easier for all of you,</i>

00:21:53.603 --> 00:21:55.439
<i>I picked a land for you</i>
<i>to build a new house.</i>

00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:58.025
<i>You could live there with your mother.</i>

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:03.322
Her chief physician told me
she could be discharged soon enough.

00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:07.284
I'm sorry if it's too sudden, but
you should start packing your belongings.

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.453
Wait, Father.

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:12.789
What about you?

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:20.630 line:20%
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>what more can I do for my family?</i>

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.842
<i>This is the question I ask myself</i>
<i>every night.</i>

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.930
<i>I've been having the same dream.</i>

00:22:29.931 --> 00:22:33.393
<i>My wife and the kids are having</i>
<i>a delightful time at the dinner table.</i>

00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:37.189 line:20%
<i>They talk about trivial matters</i>
<i>in everyday life.</i>

00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:40.734
<i>They appreciated every moment</i>

00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:44.071
<i>of this sliver of happiness.</i>

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.576
<i>But I am never at the dinner table myself.</i>

00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:54.956
<i>Yes. If I really care</i>
<i>about their happiness…</i>

00:22:57.834 --> 00:23:00.045
What about you?

00:23:01.254 --> 00:23:02.547
I'll stay here.

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:03.465
What?

00:23:07.427 --> 00:23:10.055 line:20%
<i>If I really care about them…</i>

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:14.142
<i>if I truly want to make amends…</i>

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:17.771
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:21.108
<i>The third semester has begun.</i>

00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:23.777
<i>We have to manage both</i>
<i>the busy school life</i>

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.986
<i>and our hero internship</i>

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.364
<i>to better the skills we need</i>
<i>to become great heroes.</i>

00:23:27.447 --> 00:23:30.367 line:20%
<i>Mr. Aizawa and Present Mic</i>

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.578 line:20%
<i>were meeting with Kurogiri,</i>
<i>who was imprisoned in Tartarus.</i>

00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:36.123 line:20%
<i>What secret is Kurogiri hiding?</i>

00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:38.875
<i>Next episode,</i>
<i>"More of a Hero than Anyone."</i>

00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:42.129
<i>The reality is more disheartening</i>
<i>than we had expected.</i>

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.171
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.381
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
