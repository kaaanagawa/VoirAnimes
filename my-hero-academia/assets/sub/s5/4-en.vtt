WEBVTT

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.379
<i>It's my first high-school life.</i>

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.383
<i>The second semester was about to end.</i>

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.593
This is so exciting!

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.762
Hagakure, don't you feel cold?

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.222
It's so cold out here!

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:19.310
Our costumes have changed a lot
since we first came to U.A. High.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.939
I'm surprised you managed to wear this
during the hot summer.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.899
Kacchan's outfit looks different too.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:25.817
What?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.403
Say it to my face!

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.530
Hey!

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.825
You all seem very relaxed.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.911
Bring it on, Class A!

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.039
Let's settle the score today!

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.790
CLASS A VS CLASS B

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.293 line:20%
<i>The Hero Course of U.A. High</i>

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.545 line:20%
<i>Class A and Class B</i>

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:49.424 line:20%
<i>will soon have their joint training.</i>

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:59.559
<i>Shinso who wants to transfer</i>
<i>to Hero Course has joined this battle.</i>

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.939
<i>With that, the first battle began.</i>

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:09.694
<i>Class A soon ran into a predicament.</i>

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.121 line:20%
BEFORE THE FIRST BATTLE

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:44.998 line:20%
<i>In case some of you didn't know,</i>

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:49.419
I'll explain to you how my Quirk,
Brainwashing, works.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:54.007
First of all,
I must focus on one single target.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.467
I must have the thought
of controlling the target.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.552
With that as a foundation,

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:00.763
as soon as the target talks to me,
I can seize control of them.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.891
<i>They will move as I order.</i>

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.144
<i>There are different degrees</i>
<i>of brainwashing.</i>

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.688 line:20%
<i>But the target can break free</i>
<i>after taking damage.</i>

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.232
I haven't tried this before,

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.985
but brainwashing multiple targets
is impossible.

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:16.529
I'll get distracted.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.742
Even so, your Quirk is still very potent.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:25.121 line:20%
However, I can't target
under my control speak.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.583
Orders that require thinking
won't work either.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.795
<i>I can show my target</i>
<i>the name "Tsuyu Asui."</i>

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.964
<i>I can order the target to copy that name.</i>

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.469
<i>But I can't ask my target</i>
<i>to use that name as an answer.</i>

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.679 line:20%
This is common for heroes,

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.057 line:20%
but we are doomed if the weaknesses
of our Quirks are known.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.142
They can just ignore your voice.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.061
Which is why I need this device.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.188
It works like a vocal cord.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.148
This mask can mimic different voices.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.608
The Persona Chord.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:58.696
My Quirk won't work through
microphones or speakers.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.282
So it must be your own voice.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.325
Yes.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:06.246
The countless plates in this mask
can shift and resonate

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.707
to change my voice and send it out
as a different voice.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.376 line:20%
I see.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.752 line:20%
Which means…

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:14.045
That means…

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.964
It's a voice changer.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.716 line:20%
That is awesome!
You have the strongest Quirk!

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.177
<i>The first battle begins!</i>

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:23.554
The battle has begun.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.724
We don't have a strategy yet.
I guess we'll have to improvise.

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.979
<i>How strong can this device be?</i>

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:37.652 line:20%
<i>That's up to me!</i>

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:38.695 line:20%
JUROTA SHISHIDA

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.659
Okay, let's finish them off!

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:47.078
Leave it to me!

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.664 line:20%
He spoke with my voice!

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:53.668 line:20%
Are you kidding me?

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.799
<i>He copied my voice</i>
<i>and took control of Shishida!</i>

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:02.635
<i>That guy…</i>

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:12.895
-Before he wakes up…
-You're too slow!

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.189
Air Prison!

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.568
Wake up, Shishida.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.236 line:20%
Wake up!

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.072
<i>Shinso from General Education.</i>

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:26.284
<i>Damage and impact</i>
<i>can break his brainwashing.</i>

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.662
<i>Shiozaki told me about this Quirk.</i>

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.165
<i>I didn't know he could change his voice.</i>

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:36.919
You fool! Stop!

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:41.341 line:20%
If you touch me,

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.427
you get shocked!

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.891
That hurts.

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:52.852
I electrocuted him.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.021
How is he still standing?

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:55.938
Shishida!

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.151
I got you!

00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:01.110
Nice!

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.321
Take him to the prison, Tsuyu!

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.952 line:20%
Seriously?

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:13.081
You should have passed out!

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.251
Shishida from Class B.

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:19.462 line:20%
Such incredible strength.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.172 line:20%
Tsuyu…

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:22.882 line:20%
-Don't worry.
-What?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.717 line:20%
Class A…

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.553
<i>can count on him!</i>

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.809
What? Koda!

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:36.396 line:20%
<i>That air wall can't be very durable.</i>

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:39.190
<i>It's surprisingly tough!</i>

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.234
Well…

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.821
I'll strike again!

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.074
Kirishima…

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:52.703
-I'll send him to the prison.
-Okay!

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.834
You shall not pass!

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:01.838
My tiny friends, lend me your strength!

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:05.591 line:20%
Red Gauntlet!

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:10.263
I'm in human form again!

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:11.848 line:20%
<i>Jurota Shishida.</i>

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.349 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Beast.</i>

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.476 line:20%
<i>Activating this Quirk</i>
<i>will make him increase in size.</i>

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.521 line:20%
<i>When deactivated,</i>
<i>his body goes back to its normal size.</i>

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.775 line:20%
Beast form, once again!

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:29.323 line:20%
The only one who can match my strength
is probably Kirishima.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.617
In that case…

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.996
That direction…

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.875 line:20%
Hey, wait!

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.794 line:20%
A lost lamb descends from the heavens.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.468 line:20%
They got Kirishima!

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:49.802 line:20%
Even so,

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:52.805
<i>Asui got Tsuburaba as well.</i>

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:54.640 line:20%
The score is now even.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.184 line:20%
SHOTO TODOROKI
KATSUKI BAKUGO

00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:59.145
It's far from even.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:03.900
<i>I can't speak.</i>

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.194
<i>He's too strong!</i>

00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:14.368
I knew it!

00:08:17.788 --> 00:08:20.833 line:20%
<i>But Koda is still quite a handful</i>
<i>to deal with.</i>

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.002 line:20%
<i>Carrying him during a battle</i>
<i>puts me at a disadvantage.</i>

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:24.587
<i>It's time to retreat.</i>

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.466
<i>I'll finish this match</i>
<i>with a life advantage!</i>

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:31.928 line:20%
WELCOME

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.429 line:20%
HIRYU RIN

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.890
That's 2:1 for us.

00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:39.018
Sorry, Koda.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.109
They got me. However…

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:53.950
<i>She wrapped me with her tongue!</i>

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:59.539
This barrier is much harder
than what we saw on the sports day!

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.958
Class B is really strong.

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.378
This must be the fruition
of their intensive Quirk training!

00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.504
Is that right?

00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:08.673
Both teams
have already started undermining

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:10.383
their opponents' combat strength!

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:13.844
Shishida and Tsuburaba did a great job!

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.555
Both teams
have equal number of combatants.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.849
But Class B seems to be holding up
much better with their morale!

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.561 line:20%
My students' ferocious attacks

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.646
might finally bring Class A to its knees!

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.731 line:20%
That's our teacher, Vlad King!

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.150 line:20%
Vlad King, don't be so biased!

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:31.279 line:20%
Shishida is too strong. He's a threat.

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.531
His nose can sense anything.

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:34.532 line:20%
PRO HERO SHOTA AIZAWA

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:35.783 line:20%
<i>Shinso…</i>

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:38.786 line:20%
<i>It's undeniable that he lacks experience.</i>

00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:40.830
<i>Judging by the way he used the binding,</i>

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.249
<i>he only had them made</i>
<i>after knowing the situation.</i>

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:47.086
<i>It seems like he still lacks</i>
<i>the speed for real combat.</i>

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:51.591
<i>To utilize Shinso's strong point…</i>

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:56.470
What now, Tsuyu? We'll lose at this rate.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:10:00.683
It took us some time
to understand Shinso's Quirk.

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.768
They caught us off-guard.

00:10:03.352 --> 00:10:04.854
I should have acted faster

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.315
with my binding.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:10.151
Sorry.

00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:12.653
We should apologize.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.781
We let you fight them head-on.

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:19.035
It's my fault for coming up
with that strategy.

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.536
Speaking of which,

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.414
injury is very common in combat training.

00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:25.124
Thankfully, you acted fast.

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:27.209
I was saved thanks to you.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.087
Thank you for saving my neck.

00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:33.924
<i>I know you're not interested</i>
<i>in becoming our friend,</i>

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.427
but I like you a lot.

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:39.847
You really do want to become a hero.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.224
It's nothing.

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.894
We should figure out our next plan.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:47.104
I have an idea.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.360
Kaminari, check your navigator.

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:55.071
Navigator?

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.116
You used me as a decoy
to initiate the attack.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.287
Such sinful action.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.789
You deserve flogging.

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:06.290
Flogging?

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.751
But I pulled off a great feat.

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:13.214
We only need to catch three
from Class A to win this battle.

00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:16.050
We know about Shinso's voice changer.

00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.259
If we can catch him,

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:20.888
we can still secure the victory
by ignoring Kaminari.

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:22.556
Shinso…

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:25.393
Losing Tsuburaba took a toll on our ranks.

00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:28.062
What?

00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:29.146
This is…

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.067
What is it, Shishida?

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.860
I don't know how this is happening.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:37.363
But there is no doubt about it.

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:41.325
I can sense three Asuis coming this way.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.493
Three Asuis?

00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:46.664
Is this their strategy
against your sense of smell?

00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:47.790
In that case,

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.084
I should teach them a lesson.

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:53.421
Your plan

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:57.174
will only lead to foulness.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.594
HITOSHI SHINSO
QUIRK: BRAINWASHING

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.930
TAKING CONTROL OF ANYONE
WHO REPLIES TO HIM

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:04.432
DENKI KAMINARI
QUIRK: ELECTRIFICATION

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.934
RELEASING ELECTRICAL CURRENT
FOR ATTACK OR RECON

00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:10.438
<i>I can sense three Asuis coming this way.</i>

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:12.815
What is Shishida talking about?

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.985
Tsuyu is not like Ectoplasm.

00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:18.195
<i>They can't be her clones.</i>

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.698 line:20%
Midoriya, that's…

00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:22.283 line:20%
Yes, it is.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:26.912
Tsuyu told us about it,
but we've never seen her use it before.

00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:30.207
<i>I'm going to explain my Quirk to you.</i>

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:34.420
I can jump high, climb walls,

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:35.880
and stretch my tongue

00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:38.215
20 meters max.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.801
I can take my stomach out and wash it.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.845
I secrete a toxic mucus

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:46.640
which only stings a little.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.059
-Toxic mucus!
-Toxic mucus!

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:52.354
<i>She covered both of them with her mucus</i>
<i>to mask their scents!</i>

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.815
<i>We almost forgot her ability.</i>

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.735
<i>I bet Class B didn't see this coming.</i>

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.821 line:20%
<i>Kaminari, check your navigator.</i>

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.990
Navigator?

00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:06.702
I put a tracker on Shishida
when I attacked.

00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:10.539
You can stick the tracker to any surface.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.126
You can also use the visor
to locate your target.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.378
You actually prepared
for everything, Tsuyu.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:20.132
-You're awesome.
-You're amazing for not noticing it.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.596
Shishida can pinpoint our location.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:29.058 line:20%
My nose can sense anything!

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.897
It's best to assume
he has our location at all times.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.649
We'll use that to our advantage.

00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:38.651
We all smell like Tsuyu.

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:42.905 line:20%
He can't tell who we are
unless he sees us in person!

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:45.533
He hasn't noticed the tracker yet.

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:47.117
There is no sudden movement either.

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:49.537
We need to deal with his other teammates.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.788
We don't know where they are.

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:54.208
Rather than searching for them,
we should take down Shishida while we can.

00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:56.293
His nose and strength are too powerful.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.254
Tsuyu, how are you holding up?

00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.713
He sent your flying just now.

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:01.966
I managed to avoid any serious injuries.

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:05.511
But I won't hold up for long
if we face him head-on.

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:12.810
In the name of Vine,

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:15.187
punish the treacherous evildoers!

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:17.648
Via Dolorosa!

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.695 line:20%
Beast of Revelation,
reveal their locations!

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:29.785
<i>Ten o'clock! Twelve o'clock!</i>
<i>And two o'clock!</i>

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:33.455
<i>They are splitting up and closing in!</i>

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:37.835 line:20%
And stop calling me
the Beast of Revelation!

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.379 line:20%
I am Gevaudan!

00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:41.422 line:20%
DRAGON SHROUD

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:44.550 line:20%
They are closing in.
So they know where we are.

00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:47.428 line:20%
Do they have a scouting Quirk
we don't know?

00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:50.806
What? Hey, Beast of Revelation.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.516
There's something stuck on you.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.520
-What?
-This came from Kaminari.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:57.813
I got one.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.649
I'll drag you out!

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.526
We don't know who that is.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.694
Find cover, Shishida!

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.614
If it's Kaminari…

00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:09.283
Yes, you got it right!

00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:11.035
But you chose the wrong target!

00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:13.412
All of you are here,

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:17.333 line:20%
start holding hands and get electrocuted!

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.918
Crucifixion.

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:20.669 line:20%
What?

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.547
Faith's Shield!

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.720
I sealed off his electricity
with layers of vines.

00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:32.723
I can even use this as a shield.

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.517
It's a flawless execution.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.437
I tricked you.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.440
As long as the navigator
is within ten meters,

00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:43.484
my electricity…

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:46.362
can form a straight beam!

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:54.244
What?

00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:56.664
Give me a break!

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.415
That was so close!

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:00.125 line:20%
<i>Hiryu Rin.</i>

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.543 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Scales.</i>

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.129 line:20%
<i>He can form hard scales with his body.</i>

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.924 line:20%
<i>He can shoot them as projectiles</i>
<i>or wear them as armor.</i>

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.969
Reset the vines now!

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.096
Yes. Shishida, give me their location.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:17.226
That wasn't my voice!

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.270
It's Shinso's voice changer!

00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:25.484
Come on, look at those vines!

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.736
Is Shiozaki still with them?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.364
It's over if she catches us.
Let's fall back.

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:33.242
No, I have an idea.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.245
Let her catch me.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.955
Let her catch you?

00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:39.957
They are wary of me.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.251
That means I'm a real pain in their necks.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.003
<i>On the sports day,</i>

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:47.423
<i>she put up a huge pile of vines</i>
<i>to stop my current.</i>

00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:50.134
If I annoy her enough,

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:52.469
the vines will thin out.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:55.389
Then, Shinso and Tsuyu, it's your opening.

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:57.099
Come on.

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:04.982
<i>I never underestimated Kaminari,</i>

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:08.110
<i>but his experience in combat</i>
<i>makes a difference.</i>

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:11.405
<i>So this is the Hero Course's strength.</i>

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.208
<i>We have no idea where the voice came from.</i>

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:26.754
<i>He used the environment to reflect sound.</i>

00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:29.256
Shishida, where are they?

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:33.927
Is someone there?

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.055
Hey, talk to me!

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:40.059
Just looking at his mouth
will put us in danger!

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:42.853
I need to wake up Shiozaki.

00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:47.941
Your scale shots won't hit her!

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.068
Asui!

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.614
<i>She is really agile.</i>

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.408
Shishida, it's Asui!

00:17:56.992 --> 00:17:58.744
<i>He is not listening.</i>

00:18:07.836 --> 00:18:11.090
<i>Judging by the scent,</i>
<i>I can tell Tsuyu is right over there.</i>

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.967
<i>That means</i>

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.054
<i>this scent here came from Shinso!</i>

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:19.556
<i>Shinso…</i>

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.309
<i>You said you were falling behind.</i>

00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:25.312
<i>But you're a terrifying foe.</i>

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.857
<i>You're a real threat!</i>

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:42.621
Not bad.

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:45.666
<i>I won't fall for the same trick!</i>

00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.292
Eraser Head's Binding Cloth!

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.843 line:20%
Capturing Cloth!

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:00.973
<i>I see.</i>

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:03.392 line:20%
<i>However…</i>

00:19:03.892 --> 00:19:06.937
<i>Villains won't be defeated so easily</i>

00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:10.190
<i>with your puny trick.</i>

00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:12.526
I'm right behind you!

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:14.319
<i>Enough!</i>

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.989 line:20%
I'm behind you, Beast!

00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:20.284 line:20%
<i>You can't brainwash me again!</i>

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.661
<i>Beast?</i>

00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:25.873
Get out of the way!

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.043
Sorry for that.

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:38.802
Yes!

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:40.721
A stunning performance!

00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:42.723
Shinso, that was too close.

00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:44.224
How is this match balanced?

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.436
No, Asui and Kaminari figured out a plan

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.271
and put Shinso's Quirk to good use.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.481
This is so cool.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.526
<i>Asui's mucus masked their scents.</i>

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.029
<i>That confused Shishida's nose.</i>

00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:59.781
<i>Then he used the voice changer</i>
<i>to bait their opponents,</i>

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.492
<i>stopping them from communicating.</i>

00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:05.621
<i>Under the right circumstances,</i>

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.957
<i>his very presence can dominate the field!</i>

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:12.002
Brainwashing…

00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:14.880
This Quirk is far more formidable
than I thought.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:21.220
<i>With his new support device</i>
<i>and Capturing Cloth,</i>

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:25.057
<i>he's totally different</i>
<i>from the person I met on the sports day.</i>

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:29.770
<i>I guess he had been secretly training.</i>

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:33.815
It can't be helped, I want to be a hero.

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.611
<i>To realize our dream…</i>

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:42.157
<i>To become a true hero…</i>

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:47.829
WELCOME

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:51.458
Shiozaki!

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:54.586
Why am I inside the prison?

00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:59.132
I was brainwashed?

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.178
Lord!

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.764
Please forgive my foolishness!

00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:09.101
Shiozaki!

00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:14.815
I'm already falling behind all of you.

00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:16.775
Sorry, but I must do my best.

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:20.070
Forget it. You can't catch up to us.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:23.740
Shinso, you're already too strong.

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.701
I have a long way to go.

00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:28.662
I will need guidance.

00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:33.250
I will become a pro hero
with my own strength.

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.713 line:20%
CLASS A
WIN

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:44.136
The victory of the first battle…

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:48.515
<i>goes to Class A and Shinso!</i>

00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:22.776
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:26.113
<i>The second battle between Class A</i>
<i>and Class B is about to begin.</i>

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:29.533
<i>Class B learns from their mistake</i>
<i>in the first battle.</i>

00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:33.161 line:20%
<i>They came up with a more refined tactic</i>
<i>with Kendo as their focus.</i>

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.997
<i>Tokoyami's Dark Shadow</i>
<i>is at a disadvantage,</i>

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:38.750
<i>can Class A overcome their predicament?</i>

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:42.212
<i>Next, "Operation New Improved Moves!"</i>

00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:45.966
<i>We'll finally see Tokoyami's new move!</i>

00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:47.592
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:49.344
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
