<i>At the Hero Course of U.A. High,</i>
<i>Class A and Class B held a joint training.</i>

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:13.138
<i>Class A won the match</i>
<i>with three victories and one draw.</i>

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.728
CLASS A

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.067
I still have a long way to go.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:30.155
I've seen how amazing
the Hero Course can be.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.826
I will not be satisfied
with just passing the test.

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:40.081
I will work even harder
to achieve greater heights!

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.417
That's good to know.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.421
Fight on with your Plus Ultra spirit.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.131
Yes!

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.853
Shinso, in the end, you were trying

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:28.940
to cause disruption and shift the battle
to your advantage, right?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.986 line:20%
<i>You were quick to block my way</i>
<i>with those pipes.</i>

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.614
<i>You were moving like Mr. Aizawa</i>
<i>with your binding cloth.</i>

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:38.825
<i>In the first battle,</i>

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:42.537
<i>I thought the team's coordination</i>
<i>enabled you to unleash your potential.</i>

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.623
But that wasn't the case.

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:48.835
Shinso's mobility and reactions
were impeccable.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.920
You were on par with those
from the Hero Course.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.422
You made me nervous for a moment.

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:57.260
You're much better at using your strength
for others than I ever was.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:02:59.596 line:20%
SHOTA AIZAWA

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.847 line:20%
Indeed.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.434 line:20%
We will make another assessment.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:05.935
But it's likely…

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.687
No, it's almost certain

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.857
that Shinso will join the Hero Course
in his second year.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.152
Don't you let him overtake you!

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.528 line:20%
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:16.863 line:20%
Sir, which class will he be in?

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.615
-Class A?
-Class B?

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:22.619
We'll decide when the time comes.
It's too early to be certain.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.204
Sir!

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:27.165 line:20%
Mineta's actions were so low.
Please punish him now.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.082 line:20%
What?

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:32.003 line:20%
<i>It was nothing but a lucky coincidence.</i>

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:36.090
<i>Not to mention, I was giving my all</i>
<i>to deal with Shota and his teammates.</i>

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.055
It's undeniable that Class B lost.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.723 line:20%
However,

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.351 line:20%
we didn't lose to you when it came down
to the marvel we displayed!

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.603 line:20%
Had I known Midoriya's Quirk
wasn't compatible with mine,

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.688 line:20%
I would have come up
with a strategy against that!

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.023 line:20%
Which means

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:55.068 line:20%
the outcome might be different
if we fight again!

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.279
That's not going to happen.
Today's class is over!

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.365
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.117
<i>Monoma activated Shota's Quirk on me,</i>

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:07.205
<i>so we must have made physical contact.</i>

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:12.877
<i>So One For All was copied too.</i>

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:16.256
My Quirk, One For All,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.676
has many people's extreme physical powers

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.135
compiled into one.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.305
A weak body can't support it all,

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.642
<i>so you may explode into pieces.</i>

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:31.062
<i>That was what made me worried.</i>

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.607 line:20%
Had I known Midoriya's Quirk
wasn't compatible with mine…

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.944
<i>What does he mean by "compatible"?</i>

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:39.737
Excuse me, but I have some questions.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.366
Monoma, come to Eri's place tomorrow.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.121
<i>They are visiting Eri tomorrow?</i>

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:55.211 line:20%
MIRIO TOGATA

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.672 line:20%
You've learned how to write.

00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:59.716 line:20%
Yes. I want to write a letter.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.634
A letter? For whom?

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.137
For you and Deku.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.141 line:20%
I don't know what I should say
so I want to write it down in a letter.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.977 line:20%
I want to thank you.

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.113 line:20%
What's wrong with you?

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.491
Are you scared, you jerk?

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.743
I told you to wait!

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.661
Hold on! It's not coming out!

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:29.912 line:20%
Stop!

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.749 line:20%
This isn't what you're supposed to do!
Calm down!

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.835 line:20%
His new power came out
when he was in danger!

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:39.088
No. We are training to keep it in.

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:42.216
Young Midoriya, how do you feel?

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:45.970
It's not coming out.

00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:53.227
I can no longer sense it.

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.816
A Quirk from the previous wielder…

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.320
Is this what One For All
has developed into?

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.947
Do you always chitchat in this place?

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.700
Yes. I was surprised when you came here.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:11.704
Bakugo is also keeping this
a secret for us after all.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.043
All Might, do you know what happened?

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:18.878
About those black tentacles?

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.214
I saw those for the first time too.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.717
A bald wielder in the past…

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:29.263
The wielder before my master
was a young man with dark hair.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.809
One For All holds the powers
of all its previous wielders…

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.478
Perhaps even my master didn't know it.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:39.023
So you're the first
to have it all, you trash.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.274
Don't call him that.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:43.611
Was there anything that triggered it?

00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:45.238
Nothing at all.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.783
The bald guy told me the time has come.

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:52.078
There might be
other external trigger points.

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:56.040
Could it have anything to do
with All For One?

00:06:56.707 --> 00:07:01.170
After all, that guy gave birth
to the Quirk of One For All.

00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:04.215
Having multiple Quirks at once.

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:07.969
I see. It's the same as his power.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.557
You just said what I hated
to admit the most.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.936 line:20%
In any case, to prevent Midoriya
from becoming him,

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:19.939 line:20%
we need to know more about this new power.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.692
You lack danger awareness!

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:25.778
If I keep crushing you,
it will come out for sure!

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:30.283
So if I crush you
while the tentacles are out…

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:32.243
Please tone down your motivation.

00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:36.539
If One For All
is answering to my thoughts,

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.666
then at that moment…

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:44.755
<i>This power exists before One For All.</i>

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:48.759
I decided it was a power
I couldn't master at the moment.

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:52.346
Perhaps that's why the Quirk
seemed to be sealed away.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.349
In that case, I should try to imagine it
as locking and unlocking a door.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.977
I must first learn
how to unleash those tentacles.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.770
This is too boring, you jerk!

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:02.148
It's pointless if you can't use it!

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:03.149
I'm out of here.

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:06.819
Your nagging is getting on my nerves!

00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:11.782
I think that's all for today.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.075
Yes.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:22.210
<i>All For One's power?</i>

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.254 line:20%
<i>You fool!</i>

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:29.592 line:20%
You fool! How can you be so discouraged?

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:33.888 line:20%
But my performance today
was nowhere as remarkable as yours.

00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:36.766
I could withstand the heat
because my body is made out of metal.

00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:40.603
<i>And because it's metal,</i>
<i>there is a limit to its hardness.</i>

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:44.106
<i>Unlike you, I can't get denser</i>
<i>after taking a beating!</i>

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.858
You and I…

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.361
We each have our own uniqueness!

00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:52.406
Yes! Tetsutetsu!

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.992 line:20%
We're having beef stew for dinner.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.411
-That's great!
-Wow! That's amazing!

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.372
Class B is here too.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:02.959
Some of them are here for a postmortem
and to exchange thoughts.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.174
Midoriya, I've been looking for you.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:11.551 line:20%
Todoroki.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.263 line:20%
-Do you have two different Quirks too?
-What?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.765
On the sports day…

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:22.353 line:20%
Come at me with all you've got!

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:25.106
You looked very serious back then.

00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:28.025
So it would be shocking to me
if you were hiding a Quirk from us.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.735
No!

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.321
How should I put it?
I think it's an extension of my Quirk.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:36.200
I think they are still
the same thing at the core.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.370
I was terrified when it happened
for the first time.

00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:42.790
I see. It must have been hard for you.

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:44.667
I apologize for ever doubting you.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.460
What happened today was too shocking.

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.714
<i>That sharp and dim-witted fool.</i>

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.716
You did well too, Todoroki.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.886
<i>You already have so much control</i>
<i>over your flame.</i>

00:09:56.887 --> 00:10:01.350
No, I still have much to learn.
I was just as surprised as you were.

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:03.269
Which is why…

00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:06.856
<i>I must work to improve myself.</i>

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:08.983
I WANT TO ASK SOMETHING ABOUT FLASHFIRE

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:09.900
I can't believe it.

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:13.487 line:20%
You actually came to me.

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.629
Well, that settled it.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:33.382
I can handle the related paperwork.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.843
You should focus on teaching.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:37.845
I appreciate your help.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:44.810 line:20%
Shinso is very much like you
when you were younger.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.563
Do you see yourself in him, Aizawa?

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.399
Or perhaps you saw…

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.319
Just get to the point.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:54.904
I still have work to take care of.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.574
It's nothing. Just chitchat.

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.788
The dark side of U.A. High…

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.416
What is this kid talking about?

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:13.089 line:20%
I told her during the school festival
that you were the dark side of U.A. High.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:16.592
I'm a man who walks
the path of righteousness!

00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:20.596
What exactly are we doing here?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.556
Midoriya. Togata.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.684
I'm sorry to ask you here.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.977
But I need a favor from Monoma.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:30.356
It's frustrating because Eri and Monoma
don't have much in common

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:31.482
in their personalities.

00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:34.568
What do you take me for?

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:48.207
Well, Monoma?

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:51.585
It's a feint.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:54.839
I'm sorry, but the result
is disappointing, Eraser Head.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.800
I see. What a shame.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:00.428
He copied Eri's Quirk.

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.971
But for what purpose?

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:03.806
Monoma, what do you mean, it's a feint?

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.350
Both of your Quirks are of the same type.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.561
Your Quirk is the accumulation type.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.690
My Quirk allows me to copy
the fundamental qualities of other Quirks.

00:12:12.773 --> 00:12:16.986
But if the Quirk stores energy
to be unleashed,

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:20.030
I can't copy the energy
that has already been stored.

00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:22.074
I see.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:26.787
<i>Fat Gum's Quirk allows him</i>
<i>to store energy from fat.</i>

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.082
<i>If Monoma copies the Quirk,</i>
<i>his body will still be as weak.</i>

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.335
This kind of thing happens.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:37.590
I copied your Quirk, but I couldn't use it
because of this principle.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:42.845 line:20%
<i>Had it worked the other way,</i>
<i>I would have caused Monoma to explode!</i>

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.723
But why is he copying Eri's Quirk?

00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:50.227
Even if we let Eri activate
her Quirk again,

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:54.648 line:20%
<i>the same disastrous incident will happen</i>
<i>unless we know how to control it.</i>

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:59.653
So I thought I could ask Monoma to copy
her Quirk and show her how to use it.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.614
It would have made her life much easier.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.074
But I don't think that's possible now.

00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:06.869
Sorry.

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.872
I am always causing you trouble.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.959
My power will only make everyone worry.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.713
I wish I could get rid of this power.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:19.840
Eri…

00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:22.593
It doesn't just make people worry.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:26.597
Remember, you once saved my life!

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.311
<i>What matters is how you use it.</i>

00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:36.106
Take a kitchen knife as an example.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.233
The knife can be dangerous,

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:40.194
but a sharper knife makes it easier
to make delicious cuisines.

00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:44.198
Your power is amazing.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.451
<i>After all,</i>

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:52.039 line:20%
<i>that guy gave birth</i>
<i>to the Quirk of One For All.</i>

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:55.000
<i>That is true,</i>

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.795
<i>but this power will become my comrade.</i>

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.174
I will try my best.

00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:10.307
<i>I must master the power of One For All</i>
<i>and make it my own extension.</i>

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.310
MIRIO TOGATA
QUIRK: PERMEATION

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.020
HE CAN PHASE THROUGH OBJECTS

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.313
ALL MIGHT
QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.190
THE POWER HE INHERITED
CAN CRUSH POWERFUL FOES

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:24.405
It's snowing!

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.407
Clear the mind
and rub down with a dry towel!

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.033 line:20%
Your shirt is getting drenched!

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:29.368 line:20%
Be careful not to fall down!

00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:32.788
Close the windows! Tsuyu stopped moving!

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.623 line:20%
Oh, god! Sorry, Tsuyu!

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.917 line:20%
Let's check the weather forecast.

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.628 line:20%
When is Todoroki coming back?

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.922
I want to borrow the next volume
of the manga he lent me.

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.424
Around 6:00 p.m.

00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:45.509
This is the last day
of the provisional license test.

00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:48.387
<i>If they pass the test today,</i>

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.557
<i>all of us from Class A</i>
<i>will be provisional license holders!</i>

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:56.687 line:20%
After today, I won't see you fools again.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.189
This is worth celebrating!

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:01.692
Are you ready, puny plankton?

00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:04.862
All right, let's begin.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.368
They should be taking the test now.

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:13.078 line:20%
I wonder if they are doing well.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.413 line:20%
Don't worry.

00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:17.458 line:20%
Bakugo seems to be doing well lately.
But he is still a jerk.

00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.418
I should make a cake
for when they come back.

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:20.336
Great!

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:25.299 line:20%
The only thing I beat them at
is getting my provisional license.

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:26.800
Don't be so petty.

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.344
Petty Kaminari!

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.345
What was that?

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:32.306 line:20%
Kaminari, you're special too.

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:33.766 line:20%
Thank you, Shoji.

00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:37.478 line:20%
<i>They have announced venturing</i>
<i>into the market of hero support.</i>

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:56.163
The fish took the bait!

00:15:57.539 --> 00:15:59.208
-My bag! Give it back!
-Curse it.

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.251
The heroes will be here soon.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.170
Is there trouble?

00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:04.213
Where are the heroes?

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:07.508
It's been less than 30 seconds
since it happened.

00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:09.093
Then leave it to me.

00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:11.762
No, we should confirm the situation first.

00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:14.765
I checked. Please handle the evacuation.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:18.018
You can't fight, but we can.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.269
You have a point, but…

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:23.899
Boss, you were right to pick a holiday!

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.819
This is a torrent of wallets!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.322
But you've only had your license
for 30 minutes.

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.007
Thirty minutes?

00:16:53.887 --> 00:16:54.722
Well…

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:58.684
How long does it take to be a hero?

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.689
What's wrong with you two?

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.108
Do you think you're heroes?

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.818
Leave this place now!

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:09.069
My goodness! It's All Might!

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.572
Those wallets and bags…

00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:14.575
It's wrong to rob.

00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:16.410
Hey!

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.456
Cursed kid.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:25.627
Do you think your ice
is enough to make me…

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:28.005
give up the money?

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:31.675
To pull this off,

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:35.721
we probed all the patrol routes
in this area thoroughly!

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.223
It's near the end of the year!

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:40.392
It took us one month to plan this!

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:43.520
A place and time
with crowds and no heroes…

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:45.981
This is the perfect place!

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.399
Get a job!

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:49.735
Sorry to disappoint you,
but your plan is ruined.

00:17:49.818 --> 00:17:53.655
Ruined? You are too naive, kids.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.408
You two still have a lot to learn!

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:59.745
Listen up! I can control carbonic acid.

00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:01.955
I live to seek thrills!

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:06.210
My resolve is much stronger than kids
who go home from school every day!

00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:10.380
I have the resolve to get away!

00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:19.181
What?

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.019
They passed out.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.730
I was only using enough firepower
to immobilize you.

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.691
Have you lost your resolve?

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:33.529 line:20%
Show me your resolve to lose!

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:36.824
Who would want that?

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:47.042
It's too strong!

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.422
A carnival of ice and snow!

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.466
Lady, please stay away from there!

00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:04.143
Go somewhere else
if you want to end your life!

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:08.397
This is my most powerful attack!

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.821
It could get a little ugly,
but I guess there's no other way.

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:23.871
Flashfreeze Heatwave!

00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:36.175
With heat,

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.595
carbon dioxide will evaporate.

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.471
Curse you! That move just now…

00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:50.272
I controlled the output.

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:51.231
Are you hurt?

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:54.359
No way, you jerk.
Are you looking down on me?

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:55.569
What about that girl?

00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:57.362
She's fine, you jerk!

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.405
Hey!

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:00.324
Are you two all right?

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.744
You must be that crazy kid from U.A. High.

00:20:03.827 --> 00:20:05.621
Mind your words!

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:09.416
Did you two take care of these villains?

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:13.462 line:20%
They robbed the wallets and belongings
of the people on the street.

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:16.965 line:20%
We confirmed the enemy's number
and apprehended them.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.218 line:20%
-And the things they took?
-There.

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:23.055
I gathered everything
before they could get burned.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:27.226
A flawless execution! This is amazing!
I can't believe you're still students!

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:28.894
Thank you so much!

00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:31.438
You'll become outstanding heroes
in the future!

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:35.651
Leave the cleaning up to me, Slidin' Go!

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:41.031
His gauntlet exploded.

00:20:41.114 --> 00:20:42.074
Indeed.

00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:44.576
It must be some half-baked item
from the black market.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.789
You two did well.

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:50.332
Thank you.

00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:52.000
Sure.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:57.381
<i>All right, let's head back.</i>

00:20:57.464 --> 00:20:58.757
<i>You must be starving.</i>

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.342
<i>I have to melt the ice first.</i>

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:01.802
<i>I'm not going to help you.</i>

00:22:39.983 --> 00:22:41.943
Why is it so dark in here?

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:43.987
Has everyone gone out?

00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:45.781
Congratulations…

00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:50.660
…on getting your provisional license!

00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:54.456
-Have some cake!
-No one can eat that much!

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:55.665
Todoroki!

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:58.710
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:00.504
Nice job, Bakugo!

00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:04.049
Kacchan, we can now go
on hero activities together!

00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:05.175
What?

00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:11.056
<i>Don't act so high-and-mighty,</i>
<i>you stupid nerd!</i>

00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:15.102
<i>-That's not what I meant!</i>
<i>-Don't argue with me!</i>

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.481
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:23.944
<i>Kacchan and Todoroki</i>
<i>got their provisional licenses.</i>

00:23:24.027 --> 00:23:27.155
<i>All of Class A can now take part</i>
<i>in hero activities.</i>

00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:30.951
<i>The second semester ends on December 25th.</i>

00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:32.828
<i>We're throwing a Christmas party!</i>

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.372
<i>Next episode, "Have a Merry Christmas!"</i>

00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:40.710
<i>But we didn't know</i>
<i>that darkness was brewing</i>

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:43.380
<i>while we celebrated in joy.</i>

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:44.631
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:46.091
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
