WEEKS AGO IN KYUSHU

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.379 line:20%
<i>Hawks.</i>

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:07.007
<i>Sorry for the other day.</i>

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.633
I could say the same.

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:12.137
We weren't expecting
those things to happen.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.027
Had you told me beforehand about that,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.279
I could have done it with more subtlety.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.780
<i>You talk too much.</i>

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.490
<i>It's futile to try
sniffing out any traces.</i>

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:33.658
Not at all.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.827
That hurt my feelings.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.415
Hawks is on the phone with someone!

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.793
Who could it be?
Is it his girlfriend? Please, no!

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.129
-It's a secret.
-There is still hope for us!

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.341
I only hope that you trust me.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.845
<i>I get to feel it first-hand
because I'm part of the industry.</i>

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.058
<i>I must say, I wish all the heroes
could be gone for good.</i>

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.020
<i>You can never cut me off.</i>

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.522
<i>You called me,</i>

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:08.318
<i>so you must understand
how valuable I am to you.</i>

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.154
<i>As long as I keep playing like a fool,</i>

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.949
<i>you will take the risk
for the sake of results.</i>

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.453
<i>I bet you can't wait
to use me as your tool.</i>

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.502
Next time, it will be your last chance.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.504
<i>Just you wait.</i>

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:31.090
Prove your loyalty
to the League of Villains

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:32.926
and your resolve to tear down the system.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.387
Please find someone
other than the No. 1 Hero.

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.935
<i>I contacted Dabi.</i>

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.230
<i>Honestly, I think he is still wary of me.</i>

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:49.400
<i>My communication with you
will be monitored for the time being.</i>

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.863
From now on, contact me with your code.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.659
I will do my best to find out
where the Nomus are coming from.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.578
Well, I have to go now.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.210
This is rare.
I'm surprised you would visit me.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.838
How are you doing lately?

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.841
My condition has improved.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:20.473
Did you ask the old lady from U.A. High
to take a look at you?

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:25.103
Recovery Girl can't recreate lost organs.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:29.232
Surprisingly, a man can live
even without a lung.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.442
What about your hero works?

00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:34.279
I plan to make an appearance in public.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.991
After all, there are people
that could use some corrective lessons.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.660
I see.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.707
Such a shame.

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.133
<i>Something is amiss.</i>

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:58.386
<i>It's already time,
but no one has contacted me yet.</i>

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.347
<i>No one on the Hero Network</i>

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:05.268
<i>has uploaded any information about
the League of Villains or witness reports.</i>

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.395
<i>Did something happen?</i>

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:11.107
<i>This is different
from their usual operation patterns.</i>

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.621
<i>I really hope…</i>

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.165
<i>you don't toy with my resolve.</i>

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:01.259
NEW YEAR'S EVE LIVE STREAM

00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:02.427
<i>New Year's Eve.</i>

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.721
<i>Because of the new dorm system,</i>

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.140 line:20%
<i>we thought it would be
impossible to go home.</i>

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:13.062
<i>But the students could go home for one day
under the supervision of pro heroes.</i>

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.358 line:20%
With Uraraka and Shinso's assistance,

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.110 line:20%
I finally made it through.

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:20.486
But that superpower…

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.155 line:20%
Mom!

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.949 line:20%
Listening to all this is giving me
a heart attack.

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.958
-By the way, Mom…
-Yes?

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.835
Do you remember
what I told you on the phone

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.587
about a girl named Eri?

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.005
Yes.

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:40.548
Well…

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:42.508
Eri wrote me a letter.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.093
She's amazing.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.388 line:20%
While she was learning how to write,
she wrote me a letter.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.641
I can't do much for her at the moment,

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.977
but she still wrote me a letter.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.395
She's amazing.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:06:00.651
Hold your tears!
Our neighbors downstairs will be flooded!

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:07.116 line:20%
You've always acted like All Might
since you were a kid.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.078
<i>You always end up with wounds,</i>

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.121
<i>but you never stop talking
about helping people.</i>

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.416
You don't have the power.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.918
This is why I've always thought

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:22.173
<i>I had to keep you safe from harm.</i>

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.343
But somehow,

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.845
when I look at your face,

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.848
I feel relieved.

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.392
Mom…

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.365
<i>The next day, the new year began.</i>

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.742
-Did you bring your handkerchief?
-Yes.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.370
-Don't catch a cold out there.
-All right.

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:54.580
-Stay in contact!
-Yes!

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:56.833
Do your best for this internship.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.252
I'm going now.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:13.433
<i>All right. Off to the Endeavor Agency.</i>

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.813 line:20%
I'm back.

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:22.316
Hey. Where were you just now, No. 2 Hero?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.901
I went to get some coffee.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.237
The coffee here tastes like sewer water.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.906
You will cause us trouble
if you keep flying around as you please.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.325
You must get permission
before you do anything.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.285
What?

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:35.580
My rank is higher than yours here, Hawks.

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:36.539
Yes!

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:39.083
You have the higher rank?
Why didn't I know about that?

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.294
I've never heard about that before.

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:47.508
Do you mean your status gives you access
to the information within the Commission?

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.010
No.

00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:51.554
Location data, contact records,

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.514
real-time conversation recordings,

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:54.932
anything he can see.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.520
We installed countless microdevices
on Hawks

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.356
<i>so we can know everything
about the heroes.</i>

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.279
A nobody like yourself can only peek
at the Hero Network at best.

00:08:08.362 --> 00:08:13.075
But as the No. 2 Hero,
he has access to so much more.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.536
I've been watching you.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.498
You seemed nervous
when you were off to get your coffee.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.294
I like my coffee sweeter.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.719 line:20%
Welcome to the Endeavor Agency.

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:34.430
As if I would welcome you.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.682 line:20%
KATSUKI BAKUGO
SHOTO TODOROKI

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:40.144
I only agreed because of Shoto's request.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.146
I only wanted him to work with me.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.106
You already agreed, so stop complaining.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.316
Shoto!

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.818
I've known it
since you gave us extra lessons.

00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:49.779
You're quite a handful.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:53.533
Shoto, is this guy really your friend?

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.910
Fine. As long as I get to see
how the top heroes work,

00:08:55.993 --> 00:08:57.245
I'm fine with anything.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.413
I told you to be careful
with who you befriend!

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.667
Thank you for accepting us
as your interns.

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:07.171
<i>Flame Hero: Endeavor.</i>

00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:10.925
<i>His overwhelming presence
makes him one of the top heroes.</i>

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.720 line:20%
<i>He left quite an impression on me
on the sports day.</i>

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.099
<i>Honestly, I've been scared
of him ever since.</i>

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.018
<i>But he seems different now.</i>

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.398
<i>You're going to Endeavor's?</i>

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:26.732
All three of you?

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.860
This is great! You should train well.

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.405
What about my training
to control One For All?

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:36.450 line:20%
So far,
everything has been going smoothly.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.828 line:20%
Since the day
those black tentacles showed up,

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:41.706
no other unknown Quirks have manifested.

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:44.709
As long as you complete your training
by locking and unlocking the Quirks,

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:47.587
you won't lose control
and go on a rampage again.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.671
Yes.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:51.048
I would do everything
to make it come out if I were you.

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:52.258
I think you could.

00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:54.844
This is good timing
for Young Bakugo as well.

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.095
What?

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:58.848
You and Endeavor share
quite some similarities.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.934
This is your chance to observe
how Endeavor works close-up.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.811
It will be a great opportunity for you.

00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:08.232
Both of you aim to be top heroes.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.109
<i>So make the best of this opportunity.</i>

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:15.698
I will learn everything I can
from the No. 1 Hero!

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:27.084
"I'm not Shoto," right?

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.377
What?

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:32.590
Excuse me.

00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:34.967
I don't care about anyone
other than Shoto!

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.013 line:20%
Watch closely if you want to learn!

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.266
Please give us the order!

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.395 line:20%
Stay put and watch!

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.614
I received the revelation
from the cosmos itself.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:00.493
Run, people of this country!

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:04.622
The Dark Lord is smiling upon you!

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:09.168
The end is nigh!

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:13.464
Oh, dear.

00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:15.383
This is such bad timing.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.010
ENDEAVOR
QUIRK: HELLFLAME

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.845
PRODUCE AND MANIPULATE INTENSE FLAME

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:20.846
HAWKS

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.807
MANIPULATING HIS FEATHERS
TO SHOOT AS PROJECTILES

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.692
What do you mean, we should stay put?

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.945
I would miss out on the battle.

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:40.366
<i>He rushed out before
the impact noise even reached us.</i>

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.120
<i>He's incredibly fast!</i>

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:53.295
I received the revelation
from the cosmos itself.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.506
The malefic planets
are conspiring against us!

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:57.925
We must stop them!

00:11:58.008 --> 00:12:00.386
Isn't that Starservant from Ni-Chome?

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:02.638
It's only morning
and he's already making noises.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:07.768
This place will be shrouded in darkness!

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.358
He sucked away the glass windows!

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.944
It's too late to wait for the heroes!

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:19.238
Run, citizens of this country!

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:25.035
I will become the man
who slays the culprit!

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:26.954
ENLIGHTENED FALLEN KING

00:12:27.037 --> 00:12:29.665
I will weed him out!

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:32.418
Emissary of the Dark Lord! Show yourself!

00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:36.046
What?

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.132
<i>Flashfire Fist!</i>

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:42.928
Old man, you can manipulate glass.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.264
You have marvelous control over the power.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:47.600
But I don't understand
what you're trying to achieve.

00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:50.895
But I wouldn't bother
to try and understand.

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.524
My throat is burning!

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:58.402
Endeavor!

00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.737
Handle the evacuation!

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:10.122
This is it!

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.081
All right!

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.291
Master!

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.380
What?

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.674 line:20%
Oh, are these your interns?

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.134
Hawks?

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.346
Sorry, but I was a little faster.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:30.226
I thought Endeavor was in danger.

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.520
Do I look like I need your help?

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.189
It did seem like it. Right, Shoto?

00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:36.941
Indeed.

00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:39.151 line:20%
You should have called before you came.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.030
Well, I was merely passing by just now.

00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:48.786
We were only following
Starservant's orders!

00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:50.496
We couldn't go against his will!

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:51.664
Let go of me!

00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:54.416 line:20%
Let go of me before it's too late!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.710
Leave the rest to us.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:58.128
Thanks for the help.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.922
That man is the real culprit!

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.925
The radiance he gives out
will invite greater darkness!

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:06.136
He will bring about the end to us all!

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.848
We resolved the situation
without any casualties.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:11.809
With you in charge of the security,

00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:13.644
this city should be safe.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.653
It's a pleasure to finally meet you!

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:25.406
I'm in Class 1-A of Hero Course
in U.A. High School.

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:27.157
My name is Izuku Midoriya.

00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:30.286
-I know you. You crushed your own fingers.
-What?

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.538
I heard about you from Tsukuyomi.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:36.208
I hope I get to work
with him again someday.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:41.005
I thought Tokoyami would be working
in your agency for the internship.

00:14:41.088 --> 00:14:43.674
He is working with my sidekick in my area.

00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:47.636
I've got my hands full with work.
I feel sorry for him.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:51.056
I was faster than you just now.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.766
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.436
What brought you here, Hawks?

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.813
It's nothing particularly important.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.064
Endeavor.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.109 line:20%
Have you read this book?

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:04.612 line:20%
<i>"Paranormal Liberation Front"?</i>

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:06.322
What kind of book is that?

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:07.239
It's nothing.

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:11.368
You know, this book has been selling
like hotcakes lately.

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:14.830
It's a note from a long time ago,
but it foretold the incident today.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.332
Take this as an example.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:22.087
"Giving a certain group freedom will
bring negative implications onto others."

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:26.967
If you're too busy to read the whole book,
just go through the parts I marked.

00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:30.179
<i>"A society completed
by personal responsibility."</i>

00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:33.182
<i>This is the ultimate goal of Destro,</i>

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.601
<i>commander of
the Paranormal Liberation Front.</i>

00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:37.227
It suits the current trend.

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.564
<i>I'm sorry if I made it sound too vague.</i>

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.734
What are you trying to say?

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:45.945
Endeavor, if that ever became a reality,

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.447
heroes like us could finally relax.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.366
<i>I'm being monitored.</i>

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:53.202
<i>This is the only way I can send
the message to you.</i>

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.913
<i>I hope you notice it, No. 1 Hero.</i>

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:01.001 line:20%
<i>I really just want a relaxing life.</i>

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:05.422
I want to create a world
where all heroes have nothing to do.

00:16:06.423 --> 00:16:09.176
<i>Something feels off about him.</i>

00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:13.847 line:20%
<i>What's with the look on his face?</i>

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.268
Make sure you read it.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.688
A book recommended by the No. 2 Hero.

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.064
I should read it too.

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.858
Perhaps the secret to his speed is in it.

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:25.985
<i>What?</i>

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:29.029
I have prepared extras for anyone
who is interested!

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.323
This can't be a coincidence!
Where were you keeping those?

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.826
That's right! I own this era!

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:35.452
Speaking of speed…

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:39.373
I think this book should shed some light
on how the world will shift.

00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:41.500
He even gives out the books
a little too fast.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.752
You seem to like this book a lot.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.587
You carry copies of them with you.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.089
I think he's preaching it.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.173
You're right!

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:52.094
I'm promoting this book to all the heroes
across the nation and my friends.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:56.765
This should somewhat help
with liberating their mindsets.

00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:02.229
At least go through the parts I marked.

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.982
This comes from the No. 2 Hero himself.

00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:10.195
The four of you,
give it your best to this internship!

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:15.826
<i>Hone their skills to the limits
during this internship, Endeavor.</i>

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.832
He's so young yet the way he sees
the world is so refreshing.

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:23.792
He's only 22 years old.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.045
He's only six years older than us.

00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:27.379
I don't like it.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:30.049
Yes, well said.

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:35.387
"A society completed
by personal responsibility."

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:43.062
<i>Welcome to the Endeavor Agency.</i>

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.522
We are the Flaming Sidekickers!

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:48.817
That's the famous sidekick Burnin!

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:53.197
Bakugo and Shoto,
this is your first internship, am I right?

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.785
Starting today, you will both do
the same jobs as us.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.912
As you can see, this is a sizable agency.

00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:01.872
We have over 30 sidekicks.

00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:06.043
This means the chances for you
to put up a good show don't exist at all!

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.211
Interesting.

00:18:07.294 --> 00:18:09.463
Do you want us to learn
from the pro heroes?

00:18:09.546 --> 00:18:10.547
That's right.

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:11.882
It's the same for Shoto.

00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:14.426
We won't go easy on you
just because you're our boss' son.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.303
Give it your best and try to catch up.

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:17.513
Deployment request.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:18.472
Where is it?

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:20.099
In Area 37.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:22.184
Contact the patrol team now!

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:24.937
They won't make it in time.
We'll go instead!

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.814
Everyone is full of spirit.

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:28.982
That's because we're the No. 1 Agency.

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:31.652
Our operations consist of patrol teams
and standby teams.

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:33.862
We cover emergency deployments,
security requests,

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:35.322
and also event invitations.

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:38.617
We handle over 100 cases on a daily basis.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.079
Well then, let's get working.

00:18:42.162 --> 00:18:45.457 line:20%
That funny bird guy left a sour taste
in my mouth after he stole my takedown.

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.167
Funny bird guy? Do you mean Hawks?

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.710
I like your spirit.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.796
But you should wait for Endeavor's order.

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:54.341
Don't you have over 100 cases
to take care of? What are you waiting for?

00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:56.677
Kacchan, cut it out.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.097
<i>I don't get it.</i>

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.808
I hope that you, No. 1 Hero,

00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:05.185
can become a reliable leader.

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:09.565
After that, come forward
and tell the whole country, "Don't worry."

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.818
<i>He looked different from before.</i>

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.071
"A society completed
by personal responsibility."

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.865
It suits the current trend.

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:20.909
<i>He sounded totally different this time.</i>

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.873 line:20%
<i>He always opens up to me while making it
sound like a boisterous joke.</i>

00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:31.837
<i>At least, he always smiled
when he was with me.</i>

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.093
<i>On the contrary…</i>

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:43.640
At least go through the parts I marked.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.935
<i>This comes from the No. 2 Hero himself.</i>

00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:50.772
<i>There seems to be a message behind it.</i>

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:54.109
<i>It was as though
he couldn't be upfront about it.</i>

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.820
<i>But he was determined to send the message.</i>

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.033
<i>No. 2…</i>

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:26.934
<i>The second words!</i>

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.187
<i>The second words of the marked lines!</i>

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.688
<i>They form a message!</i>

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:33.690
OUR ENEMY IS THE LIBERATION FRONT

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:40.489 line:20%
<i>Either way, I managed to send
my coded message to the Commission.</i>

00:20:41.114 --> 00:20:44.618 line:20%
<i>But Endeavor didn't look too bright.</i>

00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:47.371 line:20%
<i>Perhaps it was too vague
for him to notice.</i>

00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:51.291
<i>After all, there are already
a few pro heroes in the Liberation Front.</i>

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:54.628
<i>It's not like the Commission
could make this information public.</i>

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.923
<i>I came up with the idea.</i>

00:20:58.006 --> 00:20:59.967
<i>But it's gross
to know he's thinking about my face.</i>

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.594
<i>Well, I guess it can't be helped.</i>

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:05.097
<i>There was no other way I could tell him.</i>

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.687
<i>"Our enemy…</i>

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.108
<i>is the Liberation Front."</i>

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:18.610
<i>"They have…</i>

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.573 line:20%
<i>over 100,000 people."</i>

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.538
<i>"In four months…"</i>

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:34.793
THEY WILL ATTACK

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:40.674
<i>Yes. Four months from now,</i>

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:43.593
<i>they will attack.</i>

00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:18.105
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:22.025
<i>While I am working as an intern
at the agency,</i>

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:25.946
<i>Kacchan, Todoroki, and I
must face our issues.</i>

00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:27.948
<i>I must control my power.</i>

00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:30.951
<i>I must be able to move freely
with my best performance.</i>

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:33.036
<i>I'll take it slowly.</i>

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.455
<i>I will surely move forward.</i>

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:37.999 line:20%
<i>Next episode, "One Thing at a Time."</i>

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.586
<i>Every little bit of effort is another step
towards my goal of becoming the best hero.</i>

00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:43.421
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.090
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
