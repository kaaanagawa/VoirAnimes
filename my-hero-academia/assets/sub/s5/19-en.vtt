00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.712
It's fine by me
if you choose not to forgive me.

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:07.090 line:20%
I don't want your forgiveness.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.009 line:20%
I want to make amends.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:14.431
<i>Todoroki's family is slowly</i>
<i>undergoing a change.</i>

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.644
<i>I solemnly pray for this</i>

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.063
<i>to be a change for the better.</i>

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:56.282 line:20%
<i>The winter break ended</i>
<i>in a blink of an eye</i>

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.076 line:20%
<i>after the hero internship was over.</i>

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.286 line:20%
<i>The third semester has begun.</i>

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.457
<i>Before we know it, the first year</i>
<i>that was full of bumpy rides</i>

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.751
<i>is only three months away from ending.</i>

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.421 line:20%
Everyone! Happy New Year!

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:11.714 line:20%
Happy New Year.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.968
Our lesson today will be
about your internship reports.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.471
Please share your experience
during the winter break with us.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.848
All right, everyone.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.892
Suit up and get to Ground Alpha.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.603 line:20%
How long are you going to keep talking…

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.397
Happy New Year, sir.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:32.443
I conveyed the main agenda of the day
to the class.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:33.945 line:20%
I see.

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:36.156 line:20%
I'm sure you made use
of your winter break too.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.282 line:20%
Yes.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:41.536
I had my internship with Manual,
the leader of Hosu City.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.955
It was only for a week, but I've learned…

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.292
how to be more flexible.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.127
-Look at my new move!
-Gosh!

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.962
-He's at it again.
-Oh, yes!

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.256
He's like a bicycle with a loose chain.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.217
-But Iida is more like a motorcycle.
-He does have an engine.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:01.598
<i>Mr. Aizawa, please come</i>
<i>to the staff office as soon as possible.</i>

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.933
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.352
Ochaco, you got a new costume!

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.687
It suits you well.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.231 line:20%
Indeed, it looks great on you.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.026 line:20%
Really? That's a relief.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.778
So this is Uraraka's new wrist.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.071
It's so heavy.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.032
That's because there are wires inside.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:22.160 line:20%
Weight won't be an issue
as long as I have my Quirk.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.703 line:20%
But the crate is quite heavy.

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:25.038 line:20%
What is this?

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.839
That's…

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.062
I knew it!

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.438
You got it all wrong!

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.277
You really misunderstood.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.195
What?

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.949
I'll keep this safe.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.534
I'll cherish it.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.203
PASSION

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:08.581
You can already control that new power?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:09.499
Yes.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.501
Seriously? That was fast!

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.127
That thing from our joint training?

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:16.506
<i>Those black tentacles just sprouted</i>
<i>from your wrists!</i>

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.300
<i>Yes. I call it the "Blackwhip."</i>

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.512 line:20%
You must be kidding me.
That sounds awesome!

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.807 line:20%
Working as the No. 1 Hero's
intern paid off.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.809
You're improving at an astonishing pace!

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.728
I can control it,
but I can only use it for a short time.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.730
I can't utilize it all the time,

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.358
but it sure is powerful.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.277 line:20%
Midoriya!

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.194 line:20%
Bakugo!

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.487
What was that for?

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.780
He got on my nerve.

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:41.823
Oh, no!

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:44.367
The bleeding is not stopping!

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.952
Midoriya!

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.831 line:20%
The main takeaway is to make
the body get used to it.

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:54.002 line:20%
-Well, that's about it.
-It's fine now, my cotton candy!

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.753 line:20%
COTTON CANDY MACHINE

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.298
I can control the speed now.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.675 line:20%
If I think while moving,
my body can't catch up.

00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:04.220 line:20%
The way you ignore
my punchline is remarkable.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.346 line:20%

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.641
It's fine now, I'm here.

It's fine now, my cotton candy.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.896 line:20%
-It's fine now…
-What?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.773 line:20%
-Where is Mr. Aizawa?
-What?

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:20.903
Mr. Aizawa has some urgent matters
to attend to.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.492
Can't you drive faster?

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.120
Shut it, and calm down a little.

<i>we didn't notice anything at all.</i>

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:49.682
No one would be so disgusting.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.602 line:20%
I can't believe it at all.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.813
<i>Tsukauchi and his men</i>

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.111
As you know by now,

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.865 line:20%
a Nomu is created by modifying
the human body

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.284
that can hold several Quirks at once.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.161
However…

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:14.999
It's not done with a living person.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.796
From the brain to the heart,
everything is a mess.

00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:24.801
A Nomu is a puppet.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.346
It's a mindless husk.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.479
Gran Torino, we left our classes
to come here in a hurry.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.690 line:20%
Please make it brief.

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:41.442
Aizawa.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.320
Calm down.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:48.157 line:20%
We need to convey
the information in order.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.369
That should give you time to process it.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.958
This man is the core
of the League of Villains.

00:06:57.458 --> 00:07:01.671
If we could get something out of him,
that would be huge progress.

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:05.091
But he refused to disclose
any critical information.

00:07:05.716 --> 00:07:07.301
He's usually chatty.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:10.221
But when the information
is working against the villains,

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:13.599
he goes completely silent
as if his brain just shuts off.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:15.810
Which means…

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:20.815
It was very delicate, so it took us
some time to make a breakthrough.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:27.530
It's a new Quirk that was created
by merging multiple Quirk Factors.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.200 line:20%
The Quirk Factor that was used as the base

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:35.955
is very similar to your comrade
back in your days in U.A. High,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.626
the man who was identified
to have died at a young age.

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:49.969
The Quirk Factor is almost the same
as that of Oboro Shirakumo's.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:03.107
<i>Our common goal in the past</i>
<i>was to become heroes.</i>

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:05.902
Shota, Hizashi,

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:09.363
let's open up our own agency
after we graduate.

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:13.326
The three of us can overcome anything
that comes our way.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.912
Think about it. There are three of us.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.540
So even if one of us makes a mistake,
the other two can still cover him.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.334
And I've said it before,

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:24.086
nothing escapes Shota's keen sight.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.589
Hizashi is an expert
in resolving disputes.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:29.342
Come on, let's partner up.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.178
Don't start whining
if you can't make enough money.

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:33.638
You got it!

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:35.014
Well, Shota?

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:39.018
Give me a break. I didn't even say a word.

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:41.103
Man, just join me.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.147
Let's partner up.

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:49.570
<i>We lost Oboro Shirakumo</i>
<i>during our hero internship together.</i>

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:54.450
<i>The building collapsed,</i>

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:57.161
<i>so his passing was too sudden for us.</i>

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:07.505
<i>It wasn't long after he suggested</i>
<i>that we open up an agency together.</i>

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:14.512
So Kurogiri is a Nomu.

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:17.890
And Oboro Shirakumo's corpse
was used as its base.

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:21.602
We think that's very likely the case here.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:27.191
People used to call us
the "Three Dummies of Class A."

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:32.029 line:20%
What should I make of this?

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.908
<i>The reason for assaulting U.A. High</i>

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.952
<i>is a simple one.</i>

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:41.414
<i>U.A. High has a cluster</i>
<i>of outstanding Quirks.</i>

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.250
<i>Does that make sense to you now?</i>

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:51.299 line:20%
"It's like collecting leftovers
from a three-star restaurant," he said.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:58.389 line:20%
My guess is someone swapped out
Oboro's body before the cremation.

00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:01.434 line:20%
Then they turned the body
into this disgusting Nomu.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.688
The whole action was never pointless.

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:09.191
But the intention behind it
is pure evil, DJ.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.861
I just don't get it.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.655
We just sedated it.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.616
He was trying to use that Quirk.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.828
So what are we here for?

00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:23.998
If you're hoping to see a miracle
created by our friendship,

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:26.250
then I'll say you've watched
too much melodrama.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.837
With facts,
we can make miracles a possibility.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.260
<i>As for the Nomu defeated</i>
<i>by Endeavor in Kyushu,</i>

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:43.100
<i>the reports say it possessed personality</i>
<i>and an obsession with strong opponents.</i>

00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:47.355
<i>The result of the DNA analysis showed</i>
<i>that the base used to create this Nomu</i>

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:52.485
<i>was an outlaw who fought</i>
<i>in underground rings for a living.</i>

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.446
That Nomu retained the personality
of that person?

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.909
Unfortunately,
when I fought Kurogiri in USJ,

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.577
his speech pattern was different.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.914
He didn't show
any particular interest in me.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.500
Maybe they were conducting experiments

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:14.340
<i>to see if memory alteration or deletion</i>
<i>would affect the Nomu's ability to fight.</i>

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.634
I'll make it clear.

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:20.346
If we can get him to talk,
that will be huge progress.

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:24.392
<i>Present Mic. Eraser Head.</i>

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:30.314

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.680
I think you people have made a mistake.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.932
This thing is nothing like Shirakumo.

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:49.268
Tomura Shigaraki, how is he doing?

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.688
Did you capture him as well?

00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:56.108
How should I know?

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.277
I see. How unfortunate.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.863
Do you care about Shigaraki?

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:04.366
Yes. It's my duty to look after him.

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:08.162
What kind of crap duty is that?

00:13:08.245 --> 00:13:12.249
You're saying caring
for that Gothic brat is your duty?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.670
I don't find it tedious.

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:19.256
It's my nature to never ignore
the needs of others.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.061
In the past…

00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:33.521
What?

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.441
I left a stray cat behind
without giving it much thought.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.487
<i>But he took the cat home</i>
<i>without any hesitation.</i>

00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:47.576
I don't understand what you mean.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.079
Why are you here?

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:52.206
No reaction yet.

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:59.088
I was good for nothing because
I always did everything halfheartedly.

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:03.926
So your name is Shota Aizawa.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:05.845
I'm Shirakumo.

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:07.638
It's nice to meet you, Shota.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.392
Shota! The cafeteria is going to be full!

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:14.478
You can use my goggles.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.314
Then you can close in on your opponent
while keeping your eyes safe.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.567
We use the same goggles!

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.319
<i>You had always been</i>

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:25.030
the person who pulled me along.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.533
Is this some kind of confession?

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:31.370
But we are not in a church.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:36.333
You were always so optimistic.
You never stopped moving forward.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.753
You never thought about the consequences.

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:45.259
<i>But the dead has no future.</i>

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.768
Yamada and I are both teachers.

00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:57.938
I was very strict with my students.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:01.442
Is this about the high expulsion rate
of your classes?

00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:02.985
That's what the file says.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.153
What?

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.989
<i>Did you see the look on Eraser Head?</i>

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.825
<i>-I saw it. He was so scary.</i>
<i>-His face is always scary to look at.</i>

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:13.329 line:20%
<i>It was more intense this time,</i>
<i>like the time he threatened to expel us.</i>

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:17.207
I still get nightmares from that.

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:19.209
I thought I was doomed.

00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:20.586
Even with that said,

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:23.589
we became better because of it.

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:25.174
-Not really.
-Not really.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.718
He should use expulsion as warnings.

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:31.096
<i>Because of him, everyone in Class 2-A</i>
<i>has a tainted record.</i>

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.016
The permission to expel
and reenroll students?

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:34.975
Yes.

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:38.562
Selfless sacrifice is not the same
as giving up one's life.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:41.231
The teenagers can't tell the difference.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:44.526
So I will teach them
the lesson about dying.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.782
Then I will reenroll them,
giving them the motivation to be better.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.660
Please grant me permission.

00:15:56.705 --> 00:16:00.000
Freedom is U.A. High's
iconic selling point.

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:07.091
I don't want my students
to repeat your mistake.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:13.097
I don't want them to throw away
their lives in the name of justice.

00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:17.518
I want them to have your virtue.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:23.107
I want them to become heroes who lead

00:16:24.608 --> 00:16:29.947
and live long
as the best heroes out there.

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.535
Shirakumo!

00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:38.455
If you're still in there,

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.293
let the three of us

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:46.171
strive to become heroes once more!

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:49.967
Brainwave anomaly!

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.884
Could it be…

00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:52.594
He's having doubts.

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.098
The location of Nomu factory.

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.725
Shigaraki's whereabouts.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.228
<i>Even if the hypothesis is true,</i>

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:03.897
<i>even if this monstrosity</i>
<i>really is Shirakumo,</i>

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.400
<i>my friend</i>

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:11.989
<i>can never come back to life</i>
<i>despite what we're doing now.</i>

00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:16.535
Tell us! Who created you?

00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:18.704 line:20%
Who messed with your brain?

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:21.248
Just now…

00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:22.332 line:20%
Back then,

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:26.754
<i>did you not feel anything when we met?</i>

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:32.885
I have no idea
what you've been raving about.

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:34.053
Shirakumo!

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:35.763
Answer him, Shirakumo!

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:39.683
I am Kurogiri.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:42.770 line:20%
You're a student of U.A. High Class 2-A!

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:45.397 line:20%
We were going to become heroes together!

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:47.649
-Oboro Shirakumo!
-Oboro Shirakumo!

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:52.446
What are you talking…

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:03.499
I'm Kurogiri,
Tomura Shigaraki's caretaker.

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:11.673
What you said just now
made no sense to me.

00:18:15.719 --> 00:18:17.721
Shirakumo…

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.681
-The brainwave readings…
-Silence.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:23.393
Shota…

00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:25.229
Keep trying, Shirakumo!

00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:26.730
Shirakumo!

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:34.029
<i>Think about it. There are three of us.</i>

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:37.950
<i>So even if one of us makes a mistake,</i>
<i>the other two can still cover him.</i>

00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:43.914
Hospital…

00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:50.087
I am…

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.469
Eraser Head. Present Mic.

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:01.265
That's all for now.
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:19:04.434 --> 00:19:07.271
How are your eyes?

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.899
They are drying up and hurting.

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.657
The hospital?

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:22.661
I think we could have gotten a more
specific location had we tried harder.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:25.831
I'm sorry we couldn't be of any help.

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:26.832
You did great.

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:32.004
How is Kurogiri?

00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:35.215
It was as though his brain malfunctioned
and shut down entirely.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.885
But this is a breakthrough nonetheless.

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:42.931
You were both students
who pursued the same dream.

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:46.268
I'm sorry to have brought up
such unpleasant memories.

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:49.229
I will definitely repay your kindness.

00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:54.818
What exactly is a Nomu?

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.238 line:20%
Why was it created?

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:02.993
I bet you can't wrap your heads around it.

00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:05.412
It's like winemaking.

00:20:05.495 --> 00:20:08.332
You crush the grapes to extract the juice.

00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:14.546 line:20%
I just want to keep enjoying
the thrill of fermenting the wine.

00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:17.132
I'm not sure either.

00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:18.967
However,

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:22.888
we can't let more people
become their victims.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.807
I'll do my best to stop it from happening.

00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:30.395
I look forward to seeing the results.

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.695
Very well.
I should report this right away.

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.155
A hospital?

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:44.451
It's not a lot to go on,
but it could be an opening.

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:49.498
I see. Well done.

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:55.254
<i>Thugs wreak havoc at Wakagumo Hospital.</i>

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:57.756
I'm a little busy right now. I'll pass.

00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:00.425
What was it?

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.219
It was a deployment request.

00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:03.553
Was it about your hero job?

00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:06.181
Yes. I am the No. 2 Hero after all.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.307
That sounds cool.

00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:08.684
It sounds lame.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:11.144
I'm going to buy some drinks.
Do you need anything?

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.187
I want black coffee.

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.897
I want plenty of sugar and creamer!

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:15.232
Okay.

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:18.443
<i>A hospital.</i>

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.821
<i>The dots are connected!</i>

<i>All that is left…</i>

<i>A human being that holds endless power</i>
<i>while retaining consciousness.</i>

<i>It's the masterpiece!</i>

00:21:35.585 --> 00:21:38.171
