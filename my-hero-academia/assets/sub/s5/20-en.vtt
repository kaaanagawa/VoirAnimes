<i>Well done, Tomura Shigaraki.</i>

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:10.510
<i>Everything is going so well!</i>
<i>It's better than we expected!</i>

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.556
<i>Tomura Shigaraki.</i>

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:19.477
Our organization is weak
after losing All For One.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.396
For our greater goal,

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.024
we must take our power to the next level.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.360
He left us with power.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.487
Please give me your order.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:33.658
I will help you acquire that power.

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:41.499
TWO MONTHS AGO
A DAY IN OCTOBER

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.303
After a long search,

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.306
I've finally found you.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:00.894
Are you All For One's heir?

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:34.863 line:20%
So this is it.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:39.826 line:20%
Is this the power All For One
left for me, Kurogiri?

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:53.715
Why, All For One? This is unacceptable!

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.718
Master! Why?

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.596
He is so puny!

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.057
<i>I think you ran</i>
<i>into some trouble, Shigaraki.</i>

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.184
Doctor.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.852
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:06.895
I'm fine for now.

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:09.480
But he might crush me
into a pulp at any second.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.274
No!

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.277
This is unacceptable to me!

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.155
<i>That big fellow is Gigantomachia.</i>

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:21.242
<i>He is the man who served</i>
<i>as All For One's bodyguard.</i>

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.621 line:20%
<i>His stamina is beyond extraordinary.</i>

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.583 line:20%
<i>The body can already hold multiple Quirks</i>
<i>without any modifications.</i>

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.377
<i>When All Might slowly weakened</i>
<i>the organization,</i>

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:35.465
<i>All For One realized his demise was nigh,</i>
<i>so he hid this man.</i>

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.133
<i>That was very prudent of him.</i>

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.678
<i>It happened years after he took you in.</i>

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:44.432
<i>This is a precaution against</i>
<i>the total annihilation of his legacy</i>

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:46.226
<i>after he's gone.</i>

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.810 line:20%
Is it just me

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.897 line:20%
or is this a long shot from being
a thoughtful present for his heir?

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.816
<i>You have sharp eyes, Dabi.</i>

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.446
<i>Gigantomachia is so desperate</i>
<i>because he is too loyal to All For One.</i>

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.408 line:20%
<i>Shigaraki shares almost nothing in common</i>
<i>with his former master.</i>

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.662 line:20%
Are we supposed to earn
his loyalty or something?

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:09.457
What?

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.961 line:20%
Your attack is not working, Dabi!

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.923
<i>Machia.</i>

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.759
<i>Machia.</i>

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.853
<i>That was All For One's audio recording.</i>

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.855
<i>This should calm him down a little.</i>

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.733
I don't need this junk.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:36.985
<i>Are you sure?</i>

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.946
<i>Do you still think you can get</i>
<i>whatever you want at this point?</i>

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.409
<i>You spent too much time being pampered</i>
<i>by Kurogiri, it's time to wake up.</i>

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.287
What's wrong with you, Doctor?
That was a little harsh.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:50.623
<i>Excuse me for a moment.</i>

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.792
What is he doing?

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.628
This old man
is really not good with words.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.173
It's disgusting when you burp.
Can you please…

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.094
What is this?

00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:06.055 line:20%
This is the Quirk
All For One used in Kamino.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.849
Why…

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.393 line:20%
What is going on right now?

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.813
<i>All right, let's sit down and talk.</i>

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.155
That stinks!

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:24.907
What is this place?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.660
What are these things?

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.086
They are Nomus, but somewhat different.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.464
Can you tell the difference?

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.175
You really are very observant.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.469
You are right. They are different.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.679
These children are different.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:52.101
They are High-Ends, the closest
to being masterpieces, Super Nomus.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:55.146
We need your help

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.315
with cloning something.

00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:59.901
Your hair has grown longer, Shigaraki.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.111
How are your dad and the others?

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.071
What?

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:05.365
Not bad.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:10.370
I used the portal to transport you here
so my location wouldn't be compromised.

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.956
Except for Shigaraki,
I've never met the rest of you.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.378
Just like Gigantomachia,
I am All For One's right-hand man.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:23.049
I am Daruma Ujiko.
It's the name I just made up.

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:24.842
All right, Shigaraki.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:29.639
I brought you here
because of All For One's grace.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:32.934
My life, skills, and these children

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:37.146
will all be presented
to the Great All For One.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.065
For the longest time ever,

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.276
you were nothing
but a stain that attached to him.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.239
I don't hate you.
I simply want to protect my own interests.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:50.493
I want to know if you are worth my time.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.287
So far, you are nothing.

00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:59.710
What can a loser in his 20s
have to show for me?

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.879
Tomura Shigaraki…

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:04.090
<i>Stop it, Tenko!</i>

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:11.514
I don't remember anything
from before I met you and Master.

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:14.267
Yes, I'm aware of that.

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:16.352
But why?

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:21.315
Ever since the others were placed on me,
the rage kept pouring in.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.277
<i>Ever since that day…</i>

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.781 line:20%
I've been pondering on
what the cause could be.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:37.248
It seems like no one is willing
to give you a hand.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:40.001
You must be in a lot of pain.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.171
Little Tenko Shimura,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.425
you must be scared and in a lot of pain.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.887
You've been longing
for someone to help you.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.890
Such a cruel world.

00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:59.187
"The hero will come.
They always come to our rescue."

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:03.524
That's what everyone says,
yet they choose to ignore you.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.528
Who turned our world
into this sorry state?

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.990
But fear not,

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.534
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:18.414
I only started to have my own memories
after Master hugged me.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.792 line:20%
Before that,
I was nothing but a mindless husk.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.296
I'm sorry this wasn't more spacious.

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.840
From now on, this is your room.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.801
Starting now, I am your master.

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:35.139
Master, what are you going to teach me?

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.140
Doctor.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.099
I'm coming.

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:41.771
These are the remains of your family.

00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:44.565
You are a mutant.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:50.404
You took the lives of your family
after manifesting an unknown Quirk.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.160
Can't you remember?

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:03.251
<i>I had nothing but fragmented flashbacks</i>

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:07.338
<i>and the unknown frustrations</i>
<i>that made me sick.</i>

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:08.673
Should we start now?

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:09.966
No.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.093
He may not remember it,

00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:15.972
but the feelings
are embedded in his heart.

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.807
What I'm going to show you

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.562
is how to release
those feelings and frustrations.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:29.068 line:20%
The moment I placed them on me,

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.615
the retching sensation receded
and my heart felt calm.

00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:36.659
It was unbelievable.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.329
I could only remember some flashbacks,

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:45.167
but the weight in my heart
was suffocating.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.462
The only thing that came out of it
was endless rage.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.673
I hate that feeling.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:55.303
<i>If the hero society crumbled,</i>

00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:58.264
<i>if I became the underground conqueror,</i>

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:01.809
that weight in my heart would not perish.

00:10:01.892 --> 00:10:06.022
Yes. I hate everything in this world.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:09.233
<i>All living creatures</i>
<i>make me feel flustered.</i>

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.904
What I should do
is lay waste to everything.

00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:18.117
Then you will have a perfectly clear
and magnificent horizon in your view.

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:21.370
So, Doctor, give me your talent.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.373
I will show you
what hell and heaven truly look like!

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:30.880
You're speaking like a child in his dream!

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:33.341
I was hoping
for something more substantial.

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:34.884
Very well.

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:38.304
I will assist you, Tomura Shigaraki.
Give it a shot if you can.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:42.808 line:20%
Villains are supposed to make
wild ideas into reality.

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:46.937
I never knew Tomura's plan
would be so sinister.

00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:48.814 line:20%
Hey.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.400 line:20%
Are you going to destroy
the things I like too?

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.111
My comrades' wishes
are a different matter.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.946
Live however you want.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.947
Yes!

00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:02.203
You are more unhinged
than I expected, Shigaraki.

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:04.580
Old man, are you mocking me?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:09.043 line:20%
I have already planned to assist you.

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:12.171
For you, I've refined the power.

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:13.089
What?

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:16.342
But you can't have it just yet.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:17.885
You are too weak.

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.722
I want you to hit
the minimum requirements.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.226
<i>He's simple, unlike me.</i>

00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:28.562
<i>He sincerely disapproves of you.</i>

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:34.151
Try to convince Gigantomachia
to follow you.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:37.655
When you succeed,
I will give you all I have.

00:11:37.738 --> 00:11:40.783 line:20%
If you want something,
grab it with your own hands.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:45.788 line:20%
Fine. Your lecturing is long and boring.

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.832
I'm staying out of this.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:50.251
The flame guy never beats around the bush.

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:52.586
Shut it, you crazy woman.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.091
I have a potential ally waiting.
I'll work on that instead.

00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:58.467
Is that fine with you?

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.011
Sure. I look forward
to seeing your results.

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:05.808
In that case, I hope Dabi could help me
run some tests with my High-Ends.

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.477
Our interests
and sense of aesthetic align.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.729
We should get along well.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.814
You weren't listening to me.

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:16.193
You're sending us back already?
I suddenly feel excited.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:20.698
Contact me with these devices from now on.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:27.705
All right, Johnny.
Send them back to Gigantomachia.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.669
Master…

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:38.007
Hi.

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:43.512 line:20%
Your future king is here.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.681
TOMURA SHIGARAKI
QUIRK: DECAY

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.558
CORRUPTING ANYTHING HE TOUCHES
WITH HIS FIVE FINGERS

00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.060 line:20%
DECEMBER

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.066
You are too weak!

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:02.239
He is vulnerable while airborne!

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.659
You are too weak!

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.873
Our future king is in a tight spot.

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.792
This isn't the first time.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.796
<i>To get the full support of Doctor Ujiko,</i>

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:21.258
<i>he must tame that giant, Gigantomachia.</i>

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.969
<i>But it's been half a month.</i>

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:25.596
<i>Gigantomachia is not showing</i>

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.516
<i>the slightest intention</i>
<i>of following Shigaraki,</i>

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:36.774
<i>That guy will not stop attacking</i>
<i>for the next 48 hours and 44 minutes.</i>

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:42.154
<i>After taking a three-hour nap,</i>
<i>he will start attacking again.</i>

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.664
<i>His body size increases when he fights.</i>

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:56.377
<i>He can find Shigaraki</i>
<i>no matter where he hides.</i>

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.301
<i>During that time,</i>
<i>Shigaraki barely had any sleep.</i>

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.971
<i>His very life can be crushed</i>
<i>by that giant's hands,</i>

00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:09.223
<i>but somehow he is still smiling.</i>

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.435
<i>We are not within the fighting zone now,</i>

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:17.523
<i>but since his target</i>
<i>is his master's heir, Shigaraki,</i>

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.567
<i>he's not going to come after us.</i>

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:24.071
<i>So everyone is taking turns</i>
<i>to rest except Shigaraki</i>

00:14:24.154 --> 00:14:26.073
<i>in order to tame this giant.</i>

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.203
<i>As for monetary support,</i>
<i>we got minimal help from the Doctor.</i>

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:35.833
<i>Toga used the meager money</i>
<i>for her new fur coat.</i>

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:36.834
This is warm.

00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:41.088
My movements become slowed
when it's too cold.

00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:42.214
I see.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.092
I like the design of this coat.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.637
You only came because you like Stain.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:52.099
But he is no longer
in the League of Villains,

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:53.601
so why are you still around?

00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:59.356
I like Stain. I like Izuku.
I also like Ochaco.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.526
I can feel content as long as I like them.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:05.112
That's a lot of freedom.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.246
He's finally asleep.
But what does that thing eat anyway?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.332
Tomura, are you still alive?

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:20.002
Of course. That giant is slow.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:23.047
I already managed
to close in a little on him.

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:27.051
That giant will certainly bow down
before me.

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:31.430
<i>The fire in his eyes looks like that</i>
<i>of a young man pursuing his dream.</i>

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.559
Giran is calling.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.646
He didn't pick up my calls.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:40.564
Ask him whether
we can get insurance or not.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:44.652
He still cares about me
even after he signed me up for the league.

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.153
He's such a nice person.

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:49.365
Hey, you! Why didn't you pick up
Mr. Compress' calls?

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.200
You are the worst!

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:55.537
<i>That's our fault. Please don't blame him.</i>

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:59.375
<i>You must be Twice, aka Jin Bubaigawara.</i>

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.709
A voice changer?

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.586
Who are you? Where is Giran?

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.798
<i>Is there a way for you</i>
<i>to watch the news now?</i>

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.549
<i>Breaking news.</i>

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.552
<i>Continuing yesterday's pattern,</i>
<i>another finger has been found.</i>

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.470
A finger?

00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:14.890 line:20%
<i>Several fingers have been found</i>
<i>at locations such as the doorstep</i>

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:18.435 line:20%
<i>of the Shie Hassaikai's Chief, between</i>
<i>Hosu City Terminal and Central Highway,</i>

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.981
<i>and the Ground Zero of Kamino Ward.</i>

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:25.734
<i>A little finger was found today</i>
<i>in the central area of Fukuoka.</i>

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:29.029
-We've been to all of these places.
<i>-The fingers appear to belong to the same…</i>

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.490
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:37.037
I am the Grand Commander
of Meta Liberation Army, Re-Destro.

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:40.040
<i>The Yakuza is gone,</i>
<i>but the Liberation Army came in.</i>

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:42.584
<i>Are you people trying to make retro</i>
<i>the new trend?</i>

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:45.295
<i>A book has been selling like hotcakes.</i>

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:48.173
Don't get caught up in the trend.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:51.218
<i>No, I am the person who created the trend.</i>

00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:53.929
What did you do to Giran?
What do you want?

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.848
He's a nice person!

00:16:55.931 --> 00:17:00.352
He's right here, alive and well.

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:04.189
Our goal is to liberate the Meta-Humans,

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:08.694
so everyone in this world can use
their powers to the fullest.

00:17:08.777 --> 00:17:12.031
We'll break down the existing system
and rebuild upon its ruin.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:16.035
Does that mean he's not our enemy?

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.495
Should we help them
as we helped the Yakuza?

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:23.000
Let the broker go. I'm busy right now.

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:26.754
I'll hear you out when my work here
is done, revolution fanatic.

00:17:27.337 --> 00:17:30.549
Then take a break and hear me out.

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:33.093 line:20%
First of all, I'm not letting him go.

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:35.012 line:20%
He is my hostage now.

00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:38.140 line:20%
I was told that unity
was your strong point.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.684 line:20%
He's an impressive guy.

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:43.228 line:20%
He's professional
when it comes to working.

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:44.688 line:20%
I bet he's made it this far

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:49.443 line:20%
because he has always avoided
the police's attention.

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:54.406 line:20%
<i>Perhaps that was why he fell short</i>
<i>when people like us went after him.</i>

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.408
I applaud his professionalism.

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:59.411
He deleted the client list
without any traces.

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:01.955
He even refused
to disclose any information

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.625
while we chopped off his fingers.

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:08.587
But it was all for nothing
because we recovered the data.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:12.091
I applaud his futile resistance.

00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:17.096
<i>My warriors are ready for the day</i>
<i>that will soon be upon us.</i>

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:22.392
<i>It took generations of effort</i>
<i>to spread our roots wide and far!</i>

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.686
<i>Liberation fanatics?</i>

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.814
<i>I'm not fond of that name.</i>

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:32.319
<i>I have 116,516 sleeper warriors</i>
<i>waiting to strike.</i>

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.448
They are prepared
for an all-out revolution.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.158
He's just bluffing.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.660
<i>I see.</i>

00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:42.079
<i>You are deep</i>
<i>within the mountainside of Niigata.</i>

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.290
It's too late.

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:48.127
Our satellite camera
has already locked onto you.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.879
<i>We can find you in the blink of an eye,</i>
<i>no matter where you hide,</i>

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.549
<i>the loathsome League of Villains.</i>

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:58.387
<i>Endeavor, Hawks, Edgeshot,</i>
<i>and Mirko, and Crust,</i>

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.680
<i>as soon as I call the police,</i>

00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:02.683
<i>the whole team will show up</i>
<i>to take you down.</i>

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:04.977
I appreciate your kind warning.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.728
What is it that you want?

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:11.400
The pioneer of our liberation
needs to be Destro.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.486
You and your people
are stealing the spotlight.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.072
I must annihilate you with my own hands

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:20.534
and use the victory as the harbinger
of the Liberation Army's second coming.

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:22.953
<i>Those fingers are our declaration of war.</i>

00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:25.706
Scheming is pointless.

00:19:26.206 --> 00:19:30.169
Let's have a real battle instead.

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:34.298
You have one hour
to reach Deika City in Aichi.

00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.717 line:20%
Be there, and I will release Giran.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.552 line:20%
Now, you must decide.

00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:41.263 line:20%
You can either be defeated by us,

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:43.974 line:20%
or you could be arrested by the heroes.

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:45.726 line:20%
Well, Tomura Shigaraki?

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:50.022
<i>Reaching Aichi in an hour?</i>

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:53.150
If he's really using
his private satellite camera to track us,

00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:55.360
then there is nowhere to hide.

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.237
Do we even have a choice here?

00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:58.280
Not really.

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:00.866
The scarf that looks like a giant noodle
and his round sunglasses,

00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:03.202
only he has that kind
of lousy sense of fashion.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:05.787
<i>Giran took me in.</i>

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:08.040
We must rescue him now!

00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:10.042
He might already be dead.

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.336
The other guy might be tricking us.

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:13.837
He was just bluffing.

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:17.132
If there is a chance he's alive,
we must save him!

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.676
We can't just charge into the building.
Calm down a little.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.388
Since when were you so loyal
to your friends?

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:25.349
That's because I was always sidelined!

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.436
I have a plan.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.022
Doctor, can you read me?

00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:33.023
<i>Yes.</i>

00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:36.026 line:20%
<i>I never thought the Meta Liberation Army</i>
<i>was still around.</i>

00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:37.236 line:20%
<i>I was surprised too.</i>

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.364
<i>You people have raised</i>
<i>the villains' popularity.</i>

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:41.323
My head is splitting!

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:44.409
That giant won't wake up
for several hours.

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:48.705
If no one disturbs him up,
he'll wake up in 2 hours and 35 minutes.

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:51.500
Doctor, where is Dabi now?

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:55.504
<i>He's somewhere around</i>
<i>the border of Mie and Shiga prefectures.</i>

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.631
I couldn't have asked
for a better location.

00:20:57.714 --> 00:21:01.093
Very well. Transport us there.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:02.594
-Are you going to attack?
-Oh, no…

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:05.472
If he really has 110,000 soldiers,
do we even stand a chance?

00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:08.433
That man isn't invincible.

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:11.478
After fighting him for over a month,

00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:13.814
I realized he's strong
because he has too much HP to spare.

00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:18.151
That giant will hunt me down
no matter where I go.

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:25.033
I'll send Gigantomachia to his army
and let them fight.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:28.620
That giant may be incredibly strong,
but he still gets tired.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.580
<i>That is too sneaky!</i>

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:33.542
<i>If it turns out everything he said</i>
<i>was a bluff, what then?</i>

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.335
Then the world will lose some idiots.

00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:37.629
Are we really going in?

00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:39.715
I've told you my plan.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:43.260
I am complete when I have the mask.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.638
I will vanquish them.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:18.313
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:21.358
<i>Their goal is to crumble</i>

00:23:41.294 --> 00:23:43.171
<i>It's a showdown between the villains.</i>

<i>Go beyond!</i>
