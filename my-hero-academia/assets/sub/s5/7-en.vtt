00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.586
Hey.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.424
You all seem very relaxed.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.552
Bring it on, Class A!

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.013
Let's settle the score today!

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.764
CLASS A VS CLASS B

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:23.273
<i>The Hero Course of U.A. High</i>
<i>Class A and Class B</i>

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.150
<i>are in a joint training battle.</i>

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:27.777
<i>In the first battle,</i>

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.865
<i>Shinso's participation secured</i>
<i>a victory for Class A.</i>

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:36.661
<i>In the second battle,</i>

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.123 line:20%
<i>Kendo's tactic even the field</i>

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.834
<i>as Yaoyorozu employed</i>
<i>her sharp analysis of the battle.</i>

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.962
<i>But after a fierce battle, Class B won.</i>

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:50.216
<i>The score is now 1-1.</i>

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.313 line:20%
KINOKO KOMORI
FUMIKAGE TOKOYAMI

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.065 line:20%
I'm sorry, Tokoyami.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.358 line:20%
Do you need some cough drops?

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:31.901
You shouldn't show me sympathy.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:32.944
I have an idea.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:35.864
I'll get some medicine from Recovery Girl.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:38.825 line:20%
ITSUKA KENDO
MOMO YAOYOROZU

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:41.619 line:20%
<i>You can't improve without training.</i>

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.705
<i>Humans are so pathetic.</i>

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.249
<i>Why should we carry the wounded?</i>

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.917
<i>Just ask for your school nurse.</i>

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.420
The damage sure is extensive.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.214
It's on a different level
compared to the first battle.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.842
This is normal for Hero Course training.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:00.180
<i>But the destruction they caused</i>
<i>is a little too much.</i>

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.141 line:20%
Fukidashi and Kendo!

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:06.186 line:20%
You should know better!
Reduce the damage to a minimum!

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.979
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Sorry.</i>

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:08.897
MANGA FUKIDASHI

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.858
Vlad, how long will it take
for the mushrooms to disappear?

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.194
It should take another two hours or so.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.071 line:20%
Then we should use the other arena.

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:20.575
<i>Let's take a break.</i>

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:30.752 line:20%
It's a total victory for Class B!

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:35.715 line:20%
I bet we are going to win just as we did
during the school festival!

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:38.968
But, Class A, don't feel disheartened.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:42.972
The difference in our strength
is simply too obvious!

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.226
Sorry about that.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.354
That guy is always so full of himself.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.982
Why would he provoke us
if he knew Kendo would knock him out?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.154 line:20%
By the way, don't you think Class B
has quite some unique characters?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.781
Not at all. Your class is much cooler.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.659
Fukidashi, I can't believe
you can make something so huge!

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.702
But my throat will become dry and itchy.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.579
I'll just have to put up with it.

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:09.958
I know this is expected, but aside
from their improvements in Quirks,

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.962
their mental development makes
their Quirks even stronger.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.213
There he goes again.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.507
Deku, you've become much stronger too.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.716
I wish that were true.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.802
You have a long way to go
to catch up to me.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.095
No way.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.389
I'm not talking about my height!

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.395 line:20%
I have quietly arrived.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:31.854
All Might?

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.773
Young Midoriya, may I have a word?

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.024
Sure.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.484
How lovey-dovey!

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:40.989 line:20%
Midoriya seems to have grown closer
with All Might lately.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:45.576 line:20%
He's been asking All Might to supervise
his training since the school festival.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.997
Nice job, Uraraka.
You know Deku like the back of your hand.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.500
I've only heard rumors about it,
that's all!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.003
Sorry!

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.338 line:20%
Don't use your Quirk before the battle!

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.132 line:20%
Save your strength for later!

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.259
I feel like I'm breakdancing!

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:03.845
Young Midoriya.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.973
Has there been any anomaly
with your Quirk since then?

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:09.475
No, nothing in particular.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.727
I see.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.231
My master never told me anything
about the Quirk going berserk.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.026
I'm going to find out more
from Gran Torino.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:20.194
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.281
You must be cautious.

00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:25.158
The fifth battle is…

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.955
You saw One For All's real appearance
when you first fought Shinso.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.124 line:20%
HITOSHI SHINSO
QUIRK: BRAINWASH

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.460
Very well, I'll be careful.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:38.504 line:20%
-Hey.
-Kacchan, I didn't hear you coming.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.551
If you want me to keep your secret,
then stop whispering behind me!

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:44.844
It will only draw suspicion!

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:45.887
What?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.513
Don't "what" at me!

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.517
What's wrong with One For All?

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.103
The truth is…

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.901
Quirk trigger?

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.697
I'm not sure if you've improved
or the other way around!

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.908
I'm not sure either.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.829
When will the Quirk truly become yours?

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:15.375
I'm much stronger now than we last fought.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.753
I can't wait to know myself.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:26.344
<i>Is Young Bakugo showing his concerns</i>
<i>in his own way?</i>

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.429
What's with the smirk?

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:32.350
You're getting on my nerves!
Cut it out, you fool!

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:33.601
<i>Or maybe I'm mistaken.</i>

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.481
<i>Young Midoriya saw the true face</i>
<i>of One For All.</i>

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:43.027
<i>His fight with Shinso was the trigger.</i>

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:46.155
<i>I still think the two incidents</i>
<i>are linked.</i>

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:52.245
<i>Master, what are you</i>
<i>and the previous users trying to convey?</i>

00:06:55.123 --> 00:07:00.253 line:20%
Your injury should heal
in 30 minutes or so.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:03.714
Be grateful that your body
is still young and strong.

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:07.135
You have really soft and delicate skin.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.721
<i>For the third battle,</i>

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:15.726
<i>the arena will be changed</i>
<i>to the east side of Block 2.</i>

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.396
Let's proceed to the next battle!

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.231
Third battle, get ready!

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.737
-It's finally Iida's turn.
-Yes.

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:31.451
Todoroki has fire and ice
for a wide-range attack.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.077
Iida has overwhelming speed.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.580
Shoji has his sharp senses.

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:38.082
Ojiro is skilled in close-quarter combat.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.751
This team is well-balanced in all aspects.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.546
Todoroki is on this team.
That should make the fight a lot easier.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.090
Underestimating your foe
will bring you to defeat.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.383
I know that!

00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:48.759 line:20%
SHOTO TODOROKI

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:49.802 line:20%
Todoroki.

00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:53.306
Tokoyami, how is your throat?

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.641
I took some medicine.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:56.934
I'm feeling well.

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.561
I see.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.980
I'm sorry you had to see
my humiliating defeat.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.398
I'm counting on you next.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.193
Why me?

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.737
Hawks and Endeavor

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.908 line:20%
were both in that fierce battle with Nomu,
and they are both our mentors.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.411 line:20%
We must live up to the expectations
of the No. 1 and No. 2 Heroes.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.581
I see.

00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:22.627
<i>That last battle…</i>

00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.047 line:20%
Plus Ultra!

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:32.303
Prominence Burn!

00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:37.058
<i>Shoto.</i>

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:41.312
You must master this move.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.316
Do not run away from me or yourself!

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:49.403
Stand up! Don't show any weakness!

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.698
It's a shame Toya didn't cut it.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.993
His flame surpasses even mine.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:58.454
But his body couldn't handle the cold.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.375
It's such a shame.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.502
You're my last hope, Shoto!

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:06.546
It's finally your turn!

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.798
Only you can master this move!

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:12.593
<i>Only you can realize my ambition!</i>

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.428
Todoroki.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.389
Todoroki!

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.851 line:20%
Are you all right? You seem odd just now.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.395
-Really?
-Yes.

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:23.980
Is something bothering you?

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.857
It's nothing. Thank you for asking.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:30.653 line:20%
You barely show any expression,
so it was hard to tell.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.280
I'm impressed you actually noticed.

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:37.410
As the class rep, I must pay attention
to everyone and offer them my help!

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.246
He seems hyped somehow.
But he's always excited about something.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:43.374
My brother is recovering well.

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:44.875
I'm glad to hear that.

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:49.839
I think Pro Hero Ingenium

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.175
might have to retire from now on.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.677
No!

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.264
People still need your leadership
and guidance!

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:02.977
If you are willing,

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:07.106
could you please take on my hero name?

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:13.362
I must live up to the name of my brother,
the previous Ingenium!

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:18.326
As I'm watching everyone,
they are watching me as well.

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:21.412
I was in third place
during the sports day.

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:25.249
I'll show everyone
my determination as the heir of his name!

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:29.670
Determination of an heir…

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:40.973
<i>I know people see me as an oaf.</i>

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.809
But at least I made it into U.A. High.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.562
I'm not living on an empty brain!

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.938
Why are you bringing this up now?

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.815
It's about our team!

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:53.361
We don't know how to utilize
the element of surprise to our advantage!

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:54.278
That is true enough.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.821
What should we do then?

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:56.739
Everyone!

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.366
We talked about this just now--

00:10:58.449 --> 00:10:59.784
That's for sure!

00:10:59.867 --> 00:11:01.202
What?

00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:03.371
We'll raze this place to the ground!

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:04.914
That's what a fool would do!

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.458
Take this!

00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:11.379
Vlad King just told us
to minimize the damage!

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.547
<i>Take that!</i>

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:18.177
What? He wasn't even listening just now.

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.137
What is that?

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:23.182
I can hear the constant hitting of metals.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.977
That is likely Tetsutetsu's doing.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.771
Take this!

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.273 line:20%
<i>Class B, Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu.</i>

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.317 line:20%

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.079 line:20%
No more petty tricks.

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:47.873 line:20%
Come on and face me head-on!

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:51.043
Tetsutetsu, they have Todoroki
on their team!

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.294
I don't care!

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.380
You really are living on an empty brain.

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:57.383
Forget it.
This is not entirely a bad thing.

00:11:58.008 --> 00:11:59.552
Juzo, how can you be so calm?

00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:02.680 line:20%
Jeez! Don't keep us in the dark like that!

00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:04.682
See? Pony is speaking
in her mother tongue!

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:05.808
She is really upset!

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.394 line:20%
Tetsutetsu doesn't mean any harm.

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:11.439 line:20%
In fact, his approach plays
to our strength.

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:13.691
Juzo, your approach is too gentle!

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.986
Bring it on!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.864
The sound of metals is not stopping.

00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:23.701
Judging by the noises,
he is destroying the surroundings.

00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:27.288
They are planning a frontal assault.

00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:29.665
Are they serious?

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.667
In that case, we must retaliate.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.918
Agreed.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:34.545
Great.

00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:38.758
Let's go, Class A, Team Three!

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.509
TENYA IIDA
QUIRK: ENGINE

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.304
ENGINES ON HIS LEGS ALLOW HIM
TO MOVE AROUND SWIFTLY

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:44.513
MASHIRAO OJIRO
QUIRK: TAIL

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.308
HE CAN USE HIS TAIL
FOR ATTACKS OR MOBILITY

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.610
The villain is headed toward Line No. 5.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:05.159
The villain is headed
to the port as expected.

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:07.620
I have to escape them.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.960
What? Endeavor!

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.338
You're not getting away.

00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:19.757
What?

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.760
I'll use them as my hostage.

00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:30.893
Run! Now!

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.648
Curse you! Let me go!

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.817 line:20%
That is not possible.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.740
Fine! I get it! Let me go!
I'll do as you say!

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.328
Thank you, Endeavor.

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:51.121
How is the damage to the street?

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:52.456
There is barely any damage.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.751
It was right to isolate him
from the crowd.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:56.961
Indeed.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.046
Excuse me.

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:00.798
What is it?

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:03.092
You saved us.

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:04.552
Thank you!

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:06.470
Are you hurt?

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:09.265
-No!
-No!

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:10.975
Stay safe on your way home.

00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:12.893 line:20%
-Okay!
-Okay!

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:19.024
Endeavor, there is another request
to team up.

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:21.110
Should we do the usual?

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:24.613
Yes. Make a list of the requests.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.993
<i>Thanks to Fuyumi,</i>

00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:30.578
<i>I can finally…</i>

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.081
<i>add Shoto's number to my contact list!</i>

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:38.752
<i>Shoto, I have a message for you.</i>

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.046 line:20%
HOW ARE YOU?
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.382 line:20%
<i>Start replying to my messages, Shoto!</i>

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:47.219 line:20%
<i>I'm not the same guy</i>
<i>who used to ignore your feelings.</i>

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.807
Do not run away from me or yourself!

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:55.895
Stand up! Don't show any weakness!

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:02.151
<i>Now that I've taken</i>
<i>a step towards my ideal self,</i>

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.737
<i>I believe I can teach you</i>
<i>that move as your father.</i>

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.946
Which is why…

00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:09.742
Which is why you should
start replying to my messages.

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:13.162
Shoto!

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.372
I think he is in class right now.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:18.626
His obsession with Shoto
is getting worse every day.

00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:25.424
Are you all right? Did you catch a cold?

00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:28.093
It's nothing. I'll be fine.

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.220
We're almost there.

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.306
Follow the plan. Let's split up.

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:33.766
Understood.

00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.559
We're counting on you, Todoroki.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:40.773
Tetsutetsu!

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:43.734
Our opponents won't be stupid enough
to charge right at us!

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:45.027
This must be their trap!

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.780
No, I would come here if I were them.

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:52.785
After Shoji reads the situation,
Todoroki will be their main force.

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.372
Assuming that they are together
in such an open space…

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:06.298
He always starts with his ice attack!

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.424
That is too sneaky!

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:11.220 line:20%
But the ice won't block their view.
He's made some improvements.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:14.390
Todoroki is behind the ice!
Where are the rest of them?

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.349
I can't see them.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:19.478
<i>Even if Honenuki makes the ground soft,</i>

00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:22.690
<i>it won't matter as long as there is ice!</i>

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:26.694
<i>As soon as they slow down,</i>
<i>we'll take them all out.</i>

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.492
Recipro Burst!

00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:35.160
Bring it on!

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:37.746
-What?
-What?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.502
Using a large-scale ice attack
is too predictable.

00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:48.257
We would be doomed
had you used your flame instead.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.551 line:20%
<i>Class B, Juzo Honenuki.</i>

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.344 line:20%
<i>Hero name: Mudman.</i>

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:53.929 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Softening.</i>

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.931 line:20%
<i>He can turn any object he touches soft.</i>

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.433 line:20%
<i>But it doesn't work on creatures.</i>

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:59.768 line:20%
<i>A second touch will undo the effect.</i>

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.645
Thank you, Juzo!

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.480
Your reaction was flexible indeed!

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:07.609
<i>He got in</i>
<i>through official recommendations too!</i>

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.405
He activated his Quirk
before the ice pinned them down.

00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:13.032
His response was incredible.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.700
We should retreat and regroup--

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:15.993
I found you.

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:21.248
I softened random objects in the area,
don't let your guard down.

00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:26.754
Class B countered
Todoroki's ice attack flawlessly!

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.505
Now retaliate!

00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:32.342
Honenuki foresaw the ice attack?

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.595
Even so, he merely improvised.

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:37.306 line:20%
Honenuki is very intelligent.

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:40.017 line:20%
His flexibility is formidable.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.936
Nice job, Juzo! Leave Ojiro to me!

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.313
That hurts!

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:47.191
<i>I can't guard against this attack!</i>

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.486 line:20%
<i>Class B, Sen Kaibara.</i>

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:51.987 line:20%
<i>Hero name: Spiral.</i>

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.447 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Gyrate.</i>

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.700 line:20%
<i>His body can spin like a drill!</i>

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:00.913
Ojiro!

00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:03.248
Not again!

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:07.169
Your legs can only run on hard surfaces.

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:09.922
The ice you stepped on was soft.

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.424
I knew you would be a threat.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.676
I'll sink you and trap you in there.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.138
You plan to stop our coordinated attack.

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.974
<i>Cursed villain! How treacherous!</i>

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.143
He's really into his role-playing.

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.521
They dealt with Iida's mobility.

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:28.273
Class B has no scouting members,

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:30.609
but they won't be at a disadvantage

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.444
as long as all combatants
are in the vicinity.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.238
If it turns into a battle royale,

00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:36.740
Todoroki's efficiency
will be greatly reduced.

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.117
Indeed.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.577
Now they simply have to
see it through the end.

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:43.497
<i>Under these circumstances,</i>

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:47.000
<i>I can't use my flame or ice freely.</i>

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.836
<i>Should I go to the front line?</i>

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.880
<i>But then I wouldn't be able</i>
<i>to guard Shoji.</i>

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:54.591
Shoji!

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:59.805
They thought Shoji would be hiding
in a safe spot and act as a scout.

00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:03.308
I bet it's safe to hide behind Todoroki!

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.644 line:20%
<i>Class B, Pony Tsunotori.</i>

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:07.396 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Horn Canon.</i>

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.022 line:20%
<i>She can shoot her horns as projectiles.</i>

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:13.152 line:20%
<i>She can currently control</i>
<i>four horns at once.</i>

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:15.612
<i>She always makes sure</i>
<i>to keep her horns polished!</i>

00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:18.532
This is surprisingly powerful!

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:19.700
Tetsutetsu!

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:21.618
Here I come!

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:25.455
Horn Dash Hammer!

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:30.919
You sure are freezing cold, you jerk!

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:34.590
I can barely feel my metal, Todoroki!

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.884
But can you win a fight

00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:39.845
if you have to fight me with bare hands?

00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:40.971
Eat this!

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.640 line:20%
Tetsutetsu…

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:46.602 line:20%
He learned from my mistake so quickly.

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:49.104
No, I don't think that was his intention.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.815
Honenuki created this advantage for them.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:54.735
Can you do nothing except dodging?

00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:56.945
Stay there and stay still.

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:02.242
Curse it.

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:03.493
Sorry.

00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:06.121
There is a time limit
to your Recipro Burst.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.373
Using it at the start wasn't a great idea.

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:11.084
Anyway, I have to go help Tetsutetsu now.

00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:15.130
Time limit?

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:18.008
That was a long time ago, Mudman.

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:24.223
Ingenium will never be absent
from a fight.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.434
My legs exist for that sole purpose!

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.896
Right now,

00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:33.232
I'm always going full throttle!

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:38.570
New Style: Recipro Turbo!

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:41.740
Are you kidding me?

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:46.745
<i>Tenya, congratulations on getting</i>
<i>your provisional license.</i>

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:48.664
Thank you, Tensei.

00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:51.333
Aren't you working your engines too hard?

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:52.918
By the way, Mom,

00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:56.129
he's grown a lot.

00:20:56.213 --> 00:21:00.300
I know, but I think it's still too soon.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.263
<i>Tuning my engines?</i>

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:08.225
Yes, you must start training
without your mufflers.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:12.271
Then you'll be able to grow mufflers
with greater tolerance.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:16.149 line:20%
<i>It's a technique passed down</i>
<i>by our grandfather</i>

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.029 line:20%
<i>so we can make it in time</i>
<i>to anyone that needs our help.</i>

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.824
<i>Removing the mufflers</i>

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:26.952
<i>will bring you great pain.</i>

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:30.455
<i>But to obtain greater speed…</i>

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.836
This increases
the base horsepower of Recipro.

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:38.964
The fuel depletion is minimized.

00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:41.091
Ten minutes…

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.013
For the next ten minutes,

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.223
I am unstoppable!

00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:22.984
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:28.073 line:20%
