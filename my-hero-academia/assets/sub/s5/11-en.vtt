00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.509
<i>Why? What is this?</i>

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.184
Aizawa! Vlad!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.437
We should stop him now.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.272
Something is not right.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.488 line:20%
Deku! Calm down!

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:34.993
Shinso!

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:36.661
Brainwash him now!

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.247
Help me stop Deku's rampage!

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.134
Midoriya!

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.012
Fight me!

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.479
Very well!

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.162
-Release.
-Fire!

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.585
Nice timing!

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.337
Are you all right?

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.465
I found you! Eat this!

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:32.759
Midoriya! Uraraka! Are you all right?

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.511 line:20%
Everyone is here!

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.387
Let's get ready to rumble!

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.848
<i>Eat this!</i>

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.352
What?

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.688
<i>I can't let anyone else get hurt.</i>

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.732
<i>What should I do now?</i>

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.361
<i>I feel like my mind is going to explode!</i>

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.413
Eraser Head, how should we proceed?

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.832 line:20%
SHOTA AIZAWA
QUIRK: ERASURE

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.292 line:20%
ALL MIGHT
QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.044 line:20%
-All Might.
-Yes?

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.838
Let's observe for a little while.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.381
Aizawa, what do you mean?

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.508
The fifth battle…

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.761
should proceed.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.095 line:20%
Continue?

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.805 line:20%
VLAD KING
QUIRK: BLOOD CONTROL

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:46.100 line:20%
No matter how you see it,
Midoriya was acting very strange.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.732
If it happens again,
I will put a stop to him.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:55.652
Shinso managed to stop him
with brainwashing.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:59.572
If it's still part of Midoriya's Quirk,
I can stop it.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.575
Aizawa, why?

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:05.578
They want to continue the battle.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.538
Both Midoriya…

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:09.499
and Shinso.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.211
No, not just the two of them.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.005
All of them desire…

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:18.091
to win this battle.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.596
You are surprisingly optimistic.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.640
I guess I am.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.900 line:20%
Deku's strength was outmatched!

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.026 line:20%
IZUKU MIDORIYA

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.029 line:20%
I can't use my Quirk right now.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:43.449
I might put everyone else in danger.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.119
We should retreat and regroup.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.830
If we fall back, we lose.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.292
Shinso is right before us.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.502 line:20%
This is our chance to win!

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.298
But wouldn't that mean you have to fight

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.508
without using your Quirk?

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:02.677
No.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.723
Uraraka, I need a favor from you.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:15.732
Acid Shot!

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.651 line:20%
-Enlarge!
-We can't keep taking damages.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.528
Twin Impact!

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:22.739
Fire!

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.244 line:20%
Grape Buckler!

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:30.663
Mineta!

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:35.084 line:20%
<i>The ball can stick to any surface,</i>
<i>but only I can bounce off them!</i>

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:39.172
<i>The balls I laid down</i>
<i>are traps for everyone else,</i>

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.174
<i>but they are platforms for me!</i>

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.551 line:20%
<i>I calculated everything.</i>

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:47.055 line:20%
<i>I knew I couldn't withstand</i>
<i>Twin Impact's power.</i>

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.974
<i>I knew this would happen too!</i>

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.309
Stop messing around!

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.519
Give me a break!

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.146
Acid Layback!

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.733
Grape-Pinky Combo…

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.694
Mineta-Bounce!

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.446 line:20%
This is bad!

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.366
Stop dodging!

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.368 line:20%
We have to retreat.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.453 line:20%
But he is moving too quickly!

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.830
We have no chance
to devise a counterattack!

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.082
That's right.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.125
Mineta and the others are doing well!

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.628
Ashido can be in range if they close in!

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.004
She is amazing!

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:24.384 line:20%
Shoda alone must protect the other two
who can handle close combat.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.969
The number advantage
became their disadvantage.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.056 line:20%
Should the teachers stop them?

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.683
Midoriya and Uraraka are…

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.986 line:20%
<i>You can't become stronger on your own.</i>

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:47.198 line:20%
<i>I can only copy others' Quirks.</i>

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:49.826 line:20%
<i>I don't have the qualities</i>
<i>to be in the spotlight.</i>

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.330
<i>But I never hated my Quirk.</i>

00:06:54.831 --> 00:07:00.920
<i>Every masterpiece has a side character</i>
<i>that can outshine the main protagonist!</i>

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.464
<i>Your power…</i>

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:06.843
<i>Could it be…</i>

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:08.970
I'm taking it!

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.722
<i>Is he copying One For All?</i>

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:14.475
A weak body can't support it all,

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.645 line:20%
<i>so you may explode into pieces.</i>

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.397
No, Monoma! Don't do it!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.690 line:20%
You're too late!

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:25.027
Gunhead Martial Arts!

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.614
It's not your Quirk!
He was tricking you! Run!

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.575 line:20%
<i>I couldn't activate it.</i>

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.912 line:20%
-Curse it! It was a bluff!
-What?

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.038
Monoma!

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:41.210
Release.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.632 line:20%
This is my first fight with you
after the sports day!

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.134
Isn't that right, Midoriya?

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.887 line:20%
<i>If Shinso gets away,</i>

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.890 line:20%
<i>the enemy will have</i>
<i>the upper hand later on.</i>

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.976
<i>You're a great threat, Shinso!</i>

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.647
Eraser Head, Midoriya is on the move.

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.734
I'm watching him.

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:09.906
That hurts.

00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:13.659
If you took six years to master it,

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:17.288
can I really use it at will?

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.208
I had to learn from scratch on my own.

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:23.336
Having these tips makes a huge difference.

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:26.214
People like you and me,

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.383 line:20%
if we can't defend ourselves
during critical moments,

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:30.593
we'll die for sure.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.012
Practice as I say.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:37.934
I am not going to waste my time
on useless matters.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.066
<i>I'm different now.</i>

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:49.195
I should have acted faster
with my binding.

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:50.488
Sorry.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:54.659
I will become a pro hero
with my own strength.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.540 line:20%
Midoriya!

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.171
<i>He is different from earlier.</i>

00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:10.174
<i>My doubts and insecurities are gone.</i>

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.637
So your priority is to control your heart.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:19.433
<i>His aura and voice…</i>

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:24.063 line:20%
<i>He shared so many resemblances</i>
<i>to All Might.</i>

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.274
<i>Learn to master your heart.</i>

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.114
<i>Use these abilities as yours.</i>

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.701
IZUKU MIDORIYA
CRUSHING HIS ENEMIES WITH HIS POWER

00:09:36.784 --> 00:09:37.743
HITOSHI SHINSO

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.996
TAKING CONTROL OF ANYONE
WHO REPLIES TO HIM

00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:51.215
<i>My doubts and insecurities</i>
<i>for the power are gone.</i>

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.552
<i>This new power is my comrade.</i>

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:57.555
<i>I must control my heart.</i>

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.727
You can become a hero.

00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:06.689
<i>All Might said that to me.</i>

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.818
<i>My training with him at the bay park…</i>

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:15.656
<i>My starting line…</i>

00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:18.326 line:20%
<i>Just remembering these…</i>

00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:20.620
<i>Whenever it is,</i>

00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:24.081
<i>I feel invincible.</i>

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.459
Wait.

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:27.501
Why?

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:30.379
He seems different now.

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:36.844
He relies on Young Uraraka's Quirk
to focus on his own power.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:41.140 line:20%
<i>What happened in the last few minutes?</i>

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:42.683
<i>Young Midoriya…</i>

00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:48.314 line:20%
Come on. What was it just now?

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:51.025
Was your rampage just an act?

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.903
You've disrespected my spirit!

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:58.991
It's gone.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.246
That power…

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:07.333
<i>It disappeared in an instant.</i>

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.795
<i>It's a pain that comes from within.</i>

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:16.342
Due to the accumulated power
of One For All,

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.261
this Quirk is much stronger
than when I wielded it.

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:23.349
<i>The new power is too much</i>
<i>for my body to withstand.</i>

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:28.020
<i>This isn't a power that I can control</i>
<i>with 20% of my max output.</i>

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.147
<i>I can feel it deeply.</i>

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:34.110
<i>This power exists before One For All.</i>

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:39.490
<i>It's a power I can only master after</i>
<i>having total control over One For All.</i>

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:45.663
<i>But even so, using inaccurate air blasts</i>
<i>might trigger another rampage.</i>

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.750
<i>If I use One For All at 8%…</i>

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:55.548
<i>Under these circumstances,</i>
<i>Midoriya won't be brainwashed.</i>

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.216
<i>Sorry, Monoma.</i>

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.387
I feel resentment towards Midoriya.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.599
If we make the slightest mistake,
we'll be decimated as the last team.

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.893
Midoriya will break through our defense.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:11.105
Then let's make Midoriya our priority.

00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:15.151 line:20%
Well, we must stop him if we want to win.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.486 line:20%
We're counting on you, Shinso.

00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:25.453
<i>I wasted the opening you created for me.</i>

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.039
<i>But I won't let this be game over for us!</i>

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:34.795
It seems like the Poltergeist missed.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.673
<i>It's been around five minutes</i>
<i>since the battle started.</i>

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.092
<i>Monoma can only copy a Quirk</i>
<i>for five minutes.</i>

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.220
Maybe my Quirk can last for ten minutes.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:46.891
If I attack now,
can you beat me on your own?

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.562
Oh, my. You thought of everything.

00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:55.399
<i>She is wary of Shinso's Quirk.</i>

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:59.737
Do you know how many Quirks
I can copy at a time?

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:05.868
<i>I can confirm that he copied</i>
<i>Yanagi's Poltergeist and Kodai's Size.</i>

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:09.830
<i>Finally, he will need Shinso's Brainwash</i>
<i>to execute their plan.</i>

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.749
Three Quirks at a time?

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.960
Is it because I have three timers on me?

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.129
If I pretended to only copy three Quirks,

00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:19.840
what would you do
if I started using a fourth Quirk?

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.802
I can copy different Quirks.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:28.098
I can't activate them all at once,
but there's residue power I can use.

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:32.728
Except for powers that affect the body,
most Quirk effects can last.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.147
Such as Kodai's Size.

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:39.360
<i>Even after activating other Quirks</i>
<i>after I enlarged the bolt,</i>

00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:41.362
<i>its size remains.</i>

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:44.281
Do you not get what I mean?

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.742
This is the "fire."

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.039
This is the last struggle
of a side character.

00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:55.584
<i>What did Monoma do to Deku?</i>

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:01.298
<i>But…</i>

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:04.343
<i>Uraraka, I need a favor from you.</i>

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.555
I need you to make me weightless.

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.640
I'll close in on Shinso.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.934
I leave Monoma to you.

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:14.270
Afterwards, regroup
with Ashido and Mineta.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.438
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:25.656
<i>I can't win against him in direct combat.</i>

00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:29.034
<i>Then I must lure him into my field!</i>

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:33.873
What?

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:38.085
<i>He's too fast! He's catching up!</i>

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:39.587
Fire.

00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:44.049
Twin Impact.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:49.388 line:20%
It creates a second impact
on the point of impact.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.310
Shinso, I apologize
for getting caught so soon.

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.729
Did I manage to create an opening?

00:14:58.397 --> 00:14:59.523
<i>Monoma…</i>

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.775
<i>Could it be…</i>

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.069
<i>He used Shoda's Quirk in that instant!</i>

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:10.242
-Oh, god!
-And they say I have a dexterous physique.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:13.829
Things should be easier
after we take one of them down!

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:16.790 line:20%
It's not looking good for Ashido.

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:17.875 line:20%
Good job, Shoda!

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.003 line:20%
You can turn the battle around!

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.759
<i>Remember…</i>

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.512 line:20%
<i>Remember the starting line…</i>

00:15:34.558 --> 00:15:35.935
<i>at all times!</i>

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.438
Reiko!

00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:40.481
What?

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.112
Kodai! Yanagi!

00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:56.038
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:58.874
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.002 line:20%
<i>We can win!</i>

00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:09.134
<i>Curse it.</i>

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.054
<i>I've been looking forward to this fight.</i>

00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:15.307 line:20%
<i>I wanted to show you</i>
<i>how strong I've become.</i>

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:20.938 line:20%
<i>But everyone has moved forward.</i>

00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:23.148
<i>They never stop moving forward.</i>

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.150 line:20%
<i>They go beyond!</i>

00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:30.197
<i>Plus Ultra?</i>

00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:31.824
<i>Curse it.</i>

00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:36.870
<i>The Hero Course is amazing.</i>

00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.167 line:20%
WELCOME

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.005
<i>There were come close calls</i>
<i>during the battle,</i>

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:48.757
<i>but the fifth battle is over.</i>

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.885
<i>The match is over.</i>

00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:56.181 line:20%
All of you managed
to anticipate the enemies' attacks.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.058 line:20%
You performed well.

00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:00.602 line:20%
We'll announce the results now.

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:02.896
Class A won the first battle.

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:04.982
Class B won the second battle.

00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:06.817
The third battle ended in a tie.

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:08.819
Class A won the fourth battle.

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:11.113
Class A also won the fifth battle.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.699
The victor of this joint training…

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.869
is Class 1-A!

00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:19.246
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.833
I wasn't feeling that competitive, but…

00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:25.836 line:20%
I know. This feels bad.

00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:29.006 line:20%
Almost everyone was very tactful
in battles.

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:32.259
Mr. Aizawa.

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:36.305
I can't achieve anything on my own.

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.141
I still have a long way to go.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.520 line:20%
This joint training also serves
as my entrance test, right?

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.105
You knew all along?

00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:46.565
Did you tell him?

00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:47.483
No.

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:51.653
But I could tell based on the timing
and form of this training.

00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:55.991
The lack of communication devices
makes it easier to test my skill.

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.619
Not to mention only I joined both teams.

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:03.040
Either way, we still have a postmortem.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.875
You should get ready.

00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:09.171
<i>The postmortem starts now.</i>

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.508
First of all, Midoriya,

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.427
what happened to you just now?

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:17.763
Oh, well…

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:20.599 line:20%
You showed some dark manifestations.

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:23.227
You lost control, but the maneuver was…

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.395
Was it a new move?

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:27.773
It was way beyond the limit
of raw strength.

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.025
Honestly,

00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:32.945
I still don't quite understand
what it was.

00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:36.115
The power was surging,
and I couldn't control it.

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:41.662
It was as though the very thing I trusted
had backfired at me.

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:46.041
I was terrified too.

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:50.587
But Uraraka and Shinso stopped my rampage.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:54.216
That helped me realize it wasn't
what I thought.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.595
<i>If Shinso hadn't brainwashed me,</i>

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:00.764 line:20%
<i>things would have been worse.</i>

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.059
<i>Shinso, you asked</i>
<i>whether it was a trick or not.</i>

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.979 line:20%
<i>But at that moment, I had no idea either.</i>

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.482
Thank you, both of you.

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:14.361
<i>I only said that</i>
<i>because I wanted to brainwash him.</i>

00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:16.238
<i>But he's still concerned about it.</i>

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:19.533
<i>It was clear to everyone</i>
<i>that you weren't acting.</i>

00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:20.909
Indeed!

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.996
Shinso was amazing
when Midoriya lost control.

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:27.541 line:20%
<i>Uraraka deserves praise</i>
<i>for her quick reflexes and reaction!</i>

00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:31.253 line:20%
<i>She risked her life</i>
<i>to calm down her friend!</i>

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:35.382
Yes, that's the way to do it! I like it!

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:38.427
Uraraka, you flew to him right away!

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.262
You were so fast!

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:43.223 line:20%
You hugged him with your arms.

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:51.815
I charged out without thinking too much.
I should have reacted with more caution.

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:57.237
But it's better than doing nothing
and ending up with regrets afterward.

00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:02.034
<i>I want to…</i>

00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:04.328
save people.

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.665 line:20%
You are showing
great improvement, Uraraka.

00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:11.001 line:20%
Yes.

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:15.047
I didn't use my Quirk for Midoriya alone.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.758
I merely followed Uraraka's instruction.

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:19.718
More precisely speaking,

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:22.721
<i>I saw those black whips</i>
<i>attacking Monoma and the others.</i>

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.140
<i>In any case,</i>

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:28.894
<i>our chances of winning would dwindle</i>
<i>unless we could subdue the rampage.</i>

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:33.899 line:20%
I only stopped Midoriya
because I wanted to fight and beat him.

00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:36.485 line:20%
What happened back then
was merely a coincidence.

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:40.864 line:20%
I could barely handle everything
that was going on--

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:46.578
No one asked you to go out
of your way to do such a thing.

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:48.914
Everyone here

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:53.627
is training hard to become a hero
that saves lives from danger.

00:20:54.294 --> 00:20:59.508
Only a genius like All Might
can catch up so quickly to all of them.

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:05.222
You can't save anyone if you're obsessed
with what people think of you.

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:10.727
If you can't save yourself, you don't have
the strength to save others.

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:14.231 line:20%
On this point alone,
your performance just now

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:16.275 line:20%
was enough to pass the test.

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.778 line:20%
But I still have much to learn.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.531 line:20%
One thing I've learned after real combat…

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.702
is how amazing the Hero Course can be.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:30.038
I will not be satisfied
with just passing the test.

00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:34.376
I will work even harder
to achieve greater heights!

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.920
That's good to know.

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:41.133
Fight on with your Plus Ultra spirit.

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:42.634
Yes!

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.520
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:20.816
<i>One For All's new power has awakened.</i>

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.568
<i>That power is the Quirk</i>
<i>of the previous wielder.</i>

00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:25.195
<i>That mysterious man told me</i>

00:23:25.278 --> 00:23:29.491 line:20%
<i>there would be six other Quirks</i>
<i>manifesting inside of me.</i>

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:33.412
<i>Wouldn't that be similar</i>
<i>to All For One's power?</i>

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:36.665
<i>Next episode,</i>
<i>"The New Power And All For One."</i>

00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:38.417
<i>Control your heart.</i>

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.669
<i>Wield One For All like your own extension!</i>

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.087
<i>Go Beyond!</i>

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.213
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
