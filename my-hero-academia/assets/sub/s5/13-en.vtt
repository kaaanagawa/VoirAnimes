9 DAYS AGO

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.587 line:20%
AICHI PREFECTURE, DEIKA CITY

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.799 line:20%
<i>The disaster unveils here.</i>

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:10.885 line:20%
<i>Without even realizing it,</i>

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.347
<i>the seed of disaster
is always taking root.</i>

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.440
Have you lost your resolve?

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.694
Who would want that?

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.364
Flashfreeze Heatwave!

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.454 line:20%
Pro-level work just 30 minutes
after getting their provisional licenses.

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.207
I have some questions for the students
who defeated the villains.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.960
They are from Class 1-A of U.A. High,

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:54.132 line:20%
Shoto Todoroki and Katsuki Bakugo.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:59.721
Do you two always receive training
as a team?

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:01.347
If that's what you see,

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.516
you should get your eyes
and brain checked by a doctor.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.143
We get along very well.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:09.647
Don't be absurd!
When did we ever get along?

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.734 line:20%
We were always together while taking
lessons for the provisional license test.

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.485
Your logic is totally off base!

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.863 line:20%
Time and friendship
aren't always proportional!

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.114 line:20%
What do you mean by my logic?

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:21.242 line:20%
How should I know?
You should get your brain checked as well!

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:27.790
<i>It's the end of December.</i>

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:31.794
<i>The second semester will soon end
in a few days.</i>

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.840
<i>Do you two always receive training
as a team?</i>

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.592
<i>We get along very well.</i>

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.552
<i>Don't you feel any fear?</i>

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:43.640
<i>No, I felt no fear.
I just did what I usually do in training.</i>

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.643 line:20%
<i>I have a question for Todoroki.</i>

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.270
The interview lasted for one hour!

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.980
But Bakugo's part was completely cut out!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.024
There was only a glimpse of his head!

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.486
This isn't fair.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.947 line:20%
He is somehow being protected, in a way.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.491 line:20%
That was the third station
to interview them.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.451 line:20%
It was a disgrace
to all the positive feedback

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:04.661 line:20%
from their heroic feat.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:09.457 line:20%
<i>The provisional license holders are young,
but we can surely count on them.</i>

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.836 line:20%
<i>I hope they can start their career
as pro heroes as soon as possible.</i>

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.215 line:20%
<i>We wouldn't want another disaster
in Deika City.</i>

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.218 line:20%
<i>It's been nine days since the incident.</i>

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.720 line:20%
<i>A riot by a group of 20</i>

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.722 line:20%
<i>caused great destruction
to Deika City in mere 50…</i>

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.683 line:20%
The scale of this disaster
was even greater

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.393 line:20%
than the one from Kamino Ward.

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:31.396 line:20%
The place was too remote,
so the casualty number was very low.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.107
<i>It's been widely regarded
as a planned operation</i>

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.484
<i>that took advantage
of pro heroes' low morale.</i>

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.403
<i>But the people on the streets
think otherwise.</i>

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:41.656
<i>I think the pro heroes in Deika
lack experience.</i>

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:44.409
<i>The loosening of restrictions
should be discussed.</i>

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.744
<i>A thorough assessment
on the deployment application?</i>

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.663
<i>It's nothing but a belated attempt.</i>

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:50.999
<i>We hope the heroes work harder.</i>

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.876
<i>We will do our best too, I think.</i>

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.630
<i>Mr. Kuraishisu, what is your take
on the incident?</i>

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:01.509 line:20%
<i>When we faced destruction of this scale,</i>

00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:04.512 line:20%
<i>people always bashed
the heroes for their failure.</i>

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:08.725 line:20%
<i>But now, we are at a turning point
of a new era.</i>

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:12.562
<i>We went from criticizing them
to yelling words of motivation for them.</i>

00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:16.566
Everything changed
when the "look carefully" kid

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:17.859
cheered for Endeavor.

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.360
<i>Look carefully!</i>

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:24.615 line:20%
<i>Who's the man standing up
and fighting for us right now?</i>

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.201
Maybe Endeavor was really doing his best.

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:30.788
Don't be too optimistic.

00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:33.416 line:20%
The public's opinion may be taking
the heroes' side,

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.378 line:20%
but that also means people have a fear
of an imminent threat that is yet to come.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.465
Are the cheers for those
who should come out on top

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:43.926
actually prayers for victories?

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.430 line:20%
Pretentious heroes
should be closely inspected

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:50.016
because people need real heroes!

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.726
Mt. Lady!

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.355 line:20%
I invited her to give you
a special lesson.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.733
After all, you are getting more exposure
on the media.

00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:00.735
Midnight is here to help her out.

00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:02.820
I'm not getting any exposure!

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.572
Work harder next time.

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:08.451 line:20%
I am in no place to say it, but you are
the most pretentious of them all!

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.911 line:20%
Shut it!

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.955 line:20%
Today's lesson is about the media drill.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.750 line:20%
As the beauty who is in the spotlight,

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:19.796 line:20%
I, Mt. Lady, will show you
the proper manner a hero should have.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.173
I have no idea what I should do,

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:23.257
but everyone,

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.593
let's overcome every problem
with the spirit of Plus Ultra!

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:26.844
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.056
<i>The lesson will be about</i>

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.517
practicing for your hero interviews!

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.810
This is easy.

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:36.562
Shoto, please come forward.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:37.855
Okay.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.362
Shoto, you did an incredible job.

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:45.738
What are you talking about?

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.616
Just pretend you've finished a job.
Now start talking.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:49.826
Okay.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.579
What kind of hero do you aim
to become, Shoto?

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:57.125
I want everyone to feel safe
when I'm around.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.376
Outstanding!

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.753
My heartbeat would be elevated

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.256
if I were rescued
by a handsome hero like you.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.842
Do you have any heart condition?

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.510
<i>What is wrong with this kid?</i>

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.846
<i>He is cute! I want him!</i>

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.140
What special moves do you use?

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:21.399
Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:26.737
A wide-ranged attack that subdues enemies
and provides platforms to stand on.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:27.822
Also…

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.784
<i>There is a slightly more violent move
known as Flashfreeze Heatwave.</i>

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:37.290
It was the move he used against Class B.

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:41.252
<i>-That was Endeavor's…
-Flashfire Fist!</i>

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:44.297 line:20%
Flashfire Fist is my father's move.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.256
What?

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:46.549
Flashfire Fist.

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.259
Jetburn!

00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:52.847 line:20%
I still have much to learn
before I catch up to him.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.394
I must work to improve myself.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.397
I won't deny that you touched on
a more personal matter in this part.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.899
But if you want people to feel safe,

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.859
it's better to learn
how to smile at people.

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:08.654
Your smile would murder the girls
in an instant.

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:11.199
Girls die when I smile?

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:12.658
Forget it!

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.912 line:20%
Should I show my moves
during my interview?

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.498
Come on, students of U.A. High.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.459
Not everyone knows you that well.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.712
Your ultimate move is your symbol.

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:28.174
<i>You must let people know
what you're capable of with it.</i>

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:30.801
It promotes teamwork in a pinch

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.012
and also serves as a warning
to the villains.

00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:36.015
It helps people to trust you
and count on you to save the day.

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:40.228
The ultimate moves heroes shout
carry significant meaning.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:45.650
Her brain was all about looking good
on cameras not that long ago.

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.528
-It's not just Mt. Lady.
-What?

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:52.949
<i>All the heroes are inspired</i>

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.826
<i>by the No.1 Hero.</i>

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:00.331
All right. Let's speed up the interview.

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:02.458
My hero name is Ingenium!

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.752
I inherited the will
of the previous Ingenium, my brother,

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:06.087
to keep moving forward!

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.547
I can feel your enthusiasm!

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.382
I am Creati.

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:12.468
I read all kinds of books.
You can count on me for anything!

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.595
Your confidence makes you reliable!

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:20.309
I am Uravity! My Quirk is Zero Gravity!
I can remove gravity from any object!

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.728
It takes skill to present a speech
that eases the atmosphere!

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.939 line:20%
Jet-Black Hero: Tsukuyomi!

00:09:25.022 --> 00:09:27.900 line:20%
Those who do not know darkness
will never know glory!

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.944 line:20%
Great! You sound so cool!

00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:32.530
Sturdy Hero: Red Riot!

00:09:32.613 --> 00:09:34.824
No one will get hurt
as long as I'm shielding them!

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.826
How reliable!

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:38.703 line:20%
I am Pinky and I can melt anything!

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:42.039 line:20%
I can electrify anything!
Stun Gun Hero: Chargebolt!

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.792 line:20%
What was that?
Did I worry too much earlier?

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.086 line:20%
You are doing a terrific job
introducing yourselves!

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:51.340
I don't just talk! Shut up and follow me!

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:54.260
You sound better
when you get a solo interview.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.014
I get it now.
You don't get along with human beings.

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.682
Sorry, Bakugo.

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.934
They cut out your interview
because I was there.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.519
Don't be so full of yourself!

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:07.189
A lousy jerk like you isn't enough
to make me look bad!

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.190
I see.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:14.322
I think Bakugo should learn from Aizawa
about how to avoid the media.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:19.368
No. I think that kid has other things
to learn before that.

00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:22.913 line:20%
You must be Deku.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.624
I saw your amazing performance.

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:27.084
That is very good.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.502
I'm glad you saw it.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:31.505
What do you think
about your performance just now?

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.425
It was good.

00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:37.136
That guy can harden up, just like me!

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:38.471
He is too nervous.

00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:42.183
Speaking of which,
he never got interviewed in the past.

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:46.520
I can tell many of your attack moves
are paying homage to All Might.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.022
You must have great respect for him.

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:49.148
Yes!

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.025
<i>This is the only time he speaks up.</i>

00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:54.111
But I thought that wasn't enough.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:58.032
So I modified his attack
with my own style.

00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:00.326
Take Delaware Smash for example.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.204 line:20%
I took that name because All Might didn't
use it for his attacks.

00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:06.582
I've been practicing to change
this attack into another form.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.751
-I call it Delaware Airforce.
-This is getting tedious.

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.837
Speaking of which,
his Quirk went on a rampage the other day.

00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:19.303
I heard he had better control over it now.
Is he really okay?

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.185
<i>It's not a Quirk of dominating strength.</i>

00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:30.272
<i>One For All's new power.</i>

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.572
It's not coming out.

00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:42.243
I can no longer sense it.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.579
<i>It's been two weeks since then.</i>

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:49.250
<i>I have been practicing how to construct
the image every day.</i>

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:54.296
<i>It's not gone. Even the other guy said so.</i>

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:56.465
<i>I must use the power as my own extension.</i>

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.801
<i>That power is right before me.</i>

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.721
<i>It's been sealed away,
but it's still there.</i>

00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:05.099
<i>If it's locked away,</i>

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:07.893
<i>that means I can either unleash it
or store its energy.</i>

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:11.439
<i>I've moved past the stage
where I couldn't use it.</i>

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.315
<i>Next,</i>

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.777
<i>just as I can control
the output of One For All,</i>

00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:22.241
<i>all I need to do is to unleash that power
within my controllable output.</i>

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.545
Yes!

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.344
I can only use it for a little, but this
is the first step of controlling it.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:43.637
I can slowly…

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.389
-What was that thing?
-What was that thing?

00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:48.434 line:20%
<i>Don't get so excited
over this little thing.</i>

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:55.691
Shouldn't you get some rest?

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.651 line:20%
Principal.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.237 line:20%
Sleep deprivation damages your hair too.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.947
No, I still get enough sleep.

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.574
There is nothing to worry about.

00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:08.037
You have a very different definition
for fatigue compared to normal people.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:10.998
SUCCESOR
INDIVIDUALITY

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:14.084
It's been too long,
so I couldn't get a complete record.

00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:16.670
Is there anything I can help you with?

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.672
I received a report.

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:22.384
The hero internship
will be restarted soon.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:23.385 line:20%
What?

00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:27.973
<i>They are restarting the hero internship?</i>

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:30.601
SHOTO TODOROKI
QUIRK: HALF-COLD HALF-HOT

00:13:30.684 --> 00:13:32.603
GENERATES ICE FROM HIS RIGHT
FLAME FROM HIS LEFT

00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:33.938
EIJIRO KIRISHIMA
QUIRK: HARDENING

00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:35.648
HARDENS HIS BODY FOR DEFENSE AND OFFENSE

00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:38.651
What is this about?

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:41.737
Why are they restarting
the internship program?

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.073
Principal, you could use a chair.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:47.159
I think this is the best way to stay warm.

00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:51.872 line:20%
The agencies and our school decided
not to dabble with hero activities.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.041 line:20%
It's clear they were
taking the side of public opinion.

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:56.544
The Hero Public Safety Commission

00:13:56.627 --> 00:14:00.589 line:20%
demands all students
have practical field training.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:01.882 line:20%
"Demands"?

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.134 line:20%
So they want the kids
to have an internship.

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:06.053
-Yes.
-Which means…

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:08.931
They think there aren't enough heroes.

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:11.392
But it's apparent to us that
this line of work is saturated.

00:14:11.475 --> 00:14:17.314 line:20%
This is to learn the best way
to react to organized villain activities.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.109
Something must have gone horribly wrong
with the Deika City incident.

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:25.030 line:20%
Is this linked to the League of Villains?
Why can't they make things clearer?

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:29.785 line:20%
I think the Commission already sensed
an imminent threat coming our way.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.997
<i>They don't make the information public</i>

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.668
<i>and used ambiguous wordings to prevent us
from knowing too much secrets.</i>

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:39.920
<i>Just as Kayama said,</i>

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:44.967 line:20%
<i>the restarting of the internship program
is like a message sent by the Commission.</i>

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:51.557
Well, they can't just
publicly deploy the students.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.310
Something is not right.
It has never happened before.

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.061
Whatever the case is,

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.898 line:20%
it's a hero's job
to always be ready for any crisis.

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:02.318 line:20%
We should contact heroes
with good track records.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.778
This will be the homework
for their winter break.

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.948
Please relay this message to your classes.

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:09.700
-Understood.
-Understood.

00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:11.327 line:20%
By the way, Aizawa,

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.538 line:20%
about the program we mentioned before…

00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:17.333 line:20%
A FEW DAYS LATER

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:20.628 line:20%
<i>It's been four months since U.A. High
mandated the students to live in dorms.</i>

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.213
We have found nothing suspicious so far.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:27.760
<i>So there isn't any mole planted
by the League of Villains.</i>

00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:31.055
From now on, if we detect any movement
from the League of Villains,

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:33.265 line:20%
and nothing from the students,
we can confirm that.

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:39.313 line:20%
Principal, everyone from the Hero Course
has a heart of a hero.

00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:41.815
Yes, I am aware of that.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:46.111
<i>Are you coming back today?</i>

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:48.405
It might be difficult
to make it in time today.

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:50.449
Is Young Midoriya in trouble?

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:54.787
<i>Oh, my. Did you forget today's date?</i>

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.831
<i>Ready…</i>

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.272
They want us on internship again.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.859
We must be the busiest first-year students
in the history of U.A. High!

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:28.237
Are you returning to Ryukyu's agency?

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.948
Yes. What about you, Jiro?

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.493
Christmas is the best!

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:36.495 line:20%
Midoriya, do you have any plans?

00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:38.831 line:20%
Since Nighteye's agency was…

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:42.209
I thought Centipeder took over the agency.

00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:43.919
You haven't met in a long time!

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:47.131
Yes, I thought so at first.

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:50.175 line:20%
Sorry, Midoriya.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.846 line:20%
I'm sorry to say this,
but I got my hands full at the moment.

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:57.016
It's been a long time, Deku!
Sir Nighteye was unbelievable!

00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:00.811
He always did everything on his own,
so this transition has been hard.

00:17:01.937 --> 00:17:05.524
Even my mentor Gran Torino
from the workplace experience can't do it.

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:07.359
So I don't know where I should go.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:08.444
I see.

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:11.488
But it's different from the last time
where we chose to participate.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:13.407
Since it's a school assignment
this time around,

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.075
the school will contact agencies for us.

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.994
-I see…
-Why are you sneaking around me?

00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:19.079
-Well…
-I have no idea what you're saying.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.622
Bakugo, will you go to Best Jeanist?

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.874
What?

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.752 line:20%
BEST JEANIST: MISSING

00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:30.132
I haven't decided yet.

00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:34.887
Bakugo? Don't you have a hero name?

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.682
They rejected all of them!
All my ideas were shut down!

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:39.683
Really?

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.268
Tell me about them.

00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:42.352
Explosion Warlord!

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:43.562
Explosion Duke!

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:44.813
Explosion Killer!

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.482
What are you? A fifth-grader?

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.151
Your hero name carries hope.

00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:52.654
It decides the way you work
and how you should work.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:56.033
You haven't had a good look at this world.

00:17:56.617 --> 00:18:00.454 line:20%
So I want you to look at this world.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.832
Come back to me
once you're in your second year

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.417
and you have your provisional license.

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.378
<i>Then I'll ask you about your hero name.</i>

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:13.258
But plenty of agencies are asking for you
because of the sports day!

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:14.885
You can go wherever you want.

00:18:14.968 --> 00:18:18.388
I don't want to learn
from some second-rated heroes.

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:20.808
I'm not wearing that!

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:25.270
Come on, put it on. Be part of the clan.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.189
Internship…

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.359
It's Holy Night!

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.529
How long are you going to talk
about this boring assignment?

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.447
Your stance is a breath of fresh air.

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:39.243
Well, Mineta has a point.

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.245
Let's enjoy the feast!

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:43.914
-Sugarman, the fantastic chef!
-Sugarman, the fantastic chef!

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.291
Sorry for being late.

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:48.669
Has the party started yet?

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:54.925 line:20%
ERI

00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:58.345 line:20%
Trick or treat?

00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:00.430
No, you got it all wrong.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:02.850
-It's Eri in a Santa dress!
-It's Eri in a Santa dress!

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.560
She looks so adorable!

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.061
This outfit looks great on you.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.897
Devils out! Fortune in!

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.108
No, that's two months from now.

00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:13.360
Is Togata here too?

00:19:13.443 --> 00:19:16.488
Togata is having a party
with his classmates.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.323
All right, join them.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:19.741
Okay.

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:22.411 line:20%
She is so cute!

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.372
I drew on the eggs.

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:26.832
We do that for Easter.

00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:28.876
Eri, do you want some juice?

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:29.793
Yes.

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:33.672
The horn has grown bigger.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.008
Yes.

00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:38.510
She is very optimistic.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.681
<i>Your words the other day
meant a lot to her.</i>

<i>we knew nothing at all.</i>

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:11.228
<i>We thought we could celebrate Christmas
the next year as we did that day.</i>

00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:14.690
<i>We honestly thought so.</i>

00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:53.163 line:20%
<i>The Christmas party ended
with fun and joy.</i>

<i>After the party,</i>

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:57.918
<i>we started to worry about
where to get our internship done.</i>

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:03.632
Midoriya. Bakugo.

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:08.303
If you don't have a place to go,

00:23:09.137 --> 00:23:10.430
would you like to join me

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.140
and work for the No.1 Hero,

00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:14.976
Endeavor, as interns?

<i>This is your chance, Izuku Midoriya.</i>

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:32.077
<i>What kind of hero activities
is the No.1 Hero dabbling in?</i>

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.496
<i>I must do my best to learn
and remember everything I can.</i>

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.248
<i>I must make the best of this experience!</i>

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:40.001
