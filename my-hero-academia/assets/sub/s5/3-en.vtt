00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.524
My silly yet lovable brother.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.860
Why do you resist?

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:28.737
<i>That voice…</i>

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.739
<i>I will never forget that voice!</i>

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.490
<i>All For One!</i>

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.497
If you're willing to help my cause,

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.292
I'll give you what you desire.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.712
A choice for those without power,

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.464
forgiveness for the sinners!

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.885
Did you refuse to eat?

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.971
You can barely stand up.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.476
I won't let you do as you please.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.984
In reality, even the best-laid plans
sometimes go wrong.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:13.823
Now I'll wipe away the reality
where you refuse to bow down to me.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.159
You mean the world to me.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.702 line:20%
Stop!

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:22.999 line:20%
I found a power
even a weakling like you could use.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.751
Join my cause.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.420 line:20%
Stop it!

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.509
You must be the ninth wielder.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.179
I was hoping to show you more,

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.557
but 20% is the best I can do
at this moment.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.934
Be cautious.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.270
The singularity has passed.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.818
Fear not.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.946
<i>You're not alone.</i>

IZUKU MIDORIYA
QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.649 line:20%
<i>I couldn't sleep after that dream.</i>

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.277
Midoriya?

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.696
What was that ruckus?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.073
No, it's nothing!

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.034
It's nothing serious.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.704 line:20%
Are you under a lot of stress lately?

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.623 line:20%
Did you not have enough cheese?

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:10.166
I think so.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.834
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:15.421
<i>It was clearly a dream.</i>

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.966
<i>But I remember every detail.</i>

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:21.803
<i>That moment when his hand touched mine…</i>

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.184
<i>When the dream came to an end,</i>

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.895
<i>I saw the previous wielders.</i>

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.959 line:20%
You saw the memories
of the previous wielders?

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:55.128
Yes, I think so.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.964
It was also All For One's memory.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.471
One For All's look…

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.100
You must have seen him
when you were younger.

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:10.226
Indeed.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.187
After I saw my master,

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:17.275
my predecessor told me about
the existence of that vestige.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:22.030 line:20%
I was able to tell you the ins and outs
of their past because I saw it too.

00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:25.867
I only saw the memory
up until he was given the power.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:30.330
Then the first wielder told me
he could only show me 20% of it.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.416
He also mentioned a singularity.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.919
-That's all he told me.
-What?

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:42.383
All Might, you said the memory I saw
during the sports day borne no meaning,

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.844
but I think it did.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.099
<i>He talked to the first wielder?</i>

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.936
I never experienced that.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.064
My master said the same thing.

00:05:56.647 --> 00:06:00.818
As far as I know,
the first wielder only talked to you.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.072
That wasn't a dream.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.866
It was a vestige.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:12.371
Master, what do you mean by that?

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:17.502
That Quirk must have accumulated
many thoughts over time.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:20.505
"I want to do it." "I must do it."

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.466
"I want to become this."
"I must become that."

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:26.427
When it concerns power,

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:29.222
people will have
their own thoughts about it.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.767
People who cultivated that power
all this time,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.603
their thoughts became part of the power
and are embedded as memories.

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.315
That's what I think.

00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:42.360
Is this considered supernatural?

00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:44.779
It's romantic.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.200
Even if we fall,

00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:52.328
we can still reunite in One For All.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.914
<i>Isn't that romantic?</i>

00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.459
All Might.

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:00.545
All Might?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.092
So you woke up after the surge of energy?

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:07.135
Were you hurt?

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.386
Not at all.

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:10.596
I'm glad to hear that.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.098
Judging by the circumstances,

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:14.851
we only have details
I can't understand so far.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.769
That's all there is for now.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.856
But about that singularity…

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:24.861
Could this have something to do
with Quirk Singularity Theory?

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.155
The Quirks are inherited from parents,

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:31.617
and continue to mix, growing in complexity
with every new generation.

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:35.997 line:20%
<i>Quirks will develop to a point
where it becomes too complex</i>

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.084
<i>for anyone to have control over them.</i>

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.919
<i>That's what the theory says.</i>

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.839
We have no way
to prove this for the time being.

00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:47.925
We don't know for sure
if you were the cause,

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.344
or was there any external factor.

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:52.889
Was there anything noticeable?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.098
Well…

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.310
<i>There were two wielders
I couldn't see clearly.</i>

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.396
<i>Even your silhouette was blurry.</i>

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:06.611
Was it because you were considered
one of the latest wielders?

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.321
I'm sorry.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.324
I can't be sure about this either.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:15.077
But that power is siding with you.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.622
Let's find the answer together.

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:19.582
Yes, I won't give up so easily.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.792
And, by the way,

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.461
your master…

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.380
<i>She reminds me of my master,
my predecessor.</i>

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.299
What? You mean my mother?

00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:30.510
Yes. Her hairstyle and stuff, you know?

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:31.969
Her hair, huh?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.096
She was very beautiful!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.223
Right?

00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:37.808
<i>The drill starts this afternoon.</i>

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.435
<i>You should get going.</i>

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.478
<i>Yes!</i>

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.482
I'll be watching the whole time.

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:46.108
I feel so happy today.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.652
You do look happy.

00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:49.237
You two.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.906 line:20%
You still look closer than ever.

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:53.032 line:20%
Aizawa!

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.826
He dragged me here and…

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.121
Don't make it sound like
you were cheating on me.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.331
It's so lame.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.793
That was a little harsh.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:05.711
Shinso!

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:09.382 line:20%
As I recall, you were with Mr. Aizawa too.

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:10.841 line:20%
Yes.

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:14.345
Midoriya, you should be
doing your warm-ups.

00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:16.305
It's going to be a busy day.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.348
Yes!

Hagakure, don't you feel cold?

00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:31.612 line:20%
It's so cold out here!

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.613
I admire your spirit.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.741 line:20%
I put on my winter outfit.
It looks so cool!

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.909 line:20%
Yes!

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.203 line:20%
The weather has gone cold lately.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:44.041 line:20%
Our costumes have changed a lot
since we first came to U.A. High.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:47.753 line:20%
I'm surprised you managed to wear this
during the hot summer.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.463 line:20%
Kacchan's outfit looks different too.

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.548 line:20%
What?

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:53.593 line:20%
Say it to my face!

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.094
You stupid nerd!

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:58.598
Does your battle suit help
to keep you warm?

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:00.182
Your sweat is your weapon,

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:03.060 line:20%
so the mobility this suit grants you
is very beneficial.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.937
I didn't ask for your compliment!

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:08.316
But your suit has gone through
the most changes.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.984
You added some new devices lately.

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:12.570
I can pull off more moves now.

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:14.655
These gloves are amazing.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:17.158 line:20%
This is the second iteration already.

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:19.827 line:20%
Hatsume adjusted
the strength output for me.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.495
I see. It's Hatsume's work.

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:28.044
Get lost!

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.420
Uraraka!

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.839
-Hey!
-What?

00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:35.176
You all seem very relaxed.

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:37.470
Are we not worthy enough for you?

00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:38.721
You're here.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.806
We're just getting fired up.

00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:43.017
Is that so?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.314
Unfortunately for you,
we clearly have the upper hand.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:51.275
Bring it on, Class A!

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.527

Look at this questionnaire!

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.572 line:20%
I prepared this
during the School Festival!

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:41.992 line:20%
The difference between Class A's live band
and our high-end drama!

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.703
Can't you see
which got the better reviews?

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.998
We came out on top
with two more votes than you!

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.166
Ever since school started,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.669
you kept drawing attention
by constantly inviting bad news!

00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:53.337
But things have changed now!

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:56.590
For real? I didn't watch their performance
so I can't say much about it.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:57.925 line:20%
The day has come!

00:11:58.008 --> 00:11:59.802 line:20%
Class A versus Class B!

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.179 line:20%
This is our first battle drill!

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.556 line:20%
We--

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.557
Shut it.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.058
Monoma!

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.686 line:20%
We have a special guest today.

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:11.564 line:20%
So please stop embarrassing yourselves.

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:13.023
A special guest?

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:14.191
I'll crush them!

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:15.151
Is it a girl?

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.819
Let's give it our best!

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:20.698
He plans to transfer to the Hero Course.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.075
-Hey!
-What?

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.036
He's from General Department, Class C.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.913
Hitoshi Shinso.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.332
-Hey!
-What?

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.334
PRO HERO SHOTA AIZAWA
QUIRK: ERASURE

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.336
STOP ANYONE WITHIN HIS SIGHT
FROM USING QUIRKS

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.088
TSUYU ASUI
QUIRK: FROG

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.299
GIVES HER A FROG'S PHYSIOLOGY
AND DO ANYTHING A FROG CAN

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.926
We have a special guest today.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.512
He plans to transfer to Hero Course.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.306
Hitoshi Shinso.

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:48.100
He wants to transfer to Hero Course.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:51.145
Isn't that Mr. Aizawa's bandage?

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.022
Is that his original mask?

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.273
Nice to meet you!

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:57.276 line:20%
He can brainwash you
by talking to you, right?

00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:58.611 line:20%
It's a kill at first sight.

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:03.032 line:20%
However, Midoriya fell for his Quirk
but managed to break free.

00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:09.830
It was only a fluke.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.919
<i>I saw One For All's vestiges</i>

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:17.588
<i>because Shinso was controlling me.</i>

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.012
<i>It was the timing.</i>

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.597
<i>Or was it?</i>

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:30.142
Shinso, do you have anything to say?

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:35.147
<i>Shinso, your Quirk is brainwashing?</i>

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.275
To be able to control anyone…

00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:40.611
You can do all the bad things.

00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:42.780
And you won't get caught.

00:13:42.863 --> 00:13:45.574
Don't control us, okay?

00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:49.912
That's what everyone says.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.332
I'm Hitoshi Shinso.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:57.253
Some of you have met me
during the sports day.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.964
They say a fight helps you
know someone better.

00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:05.261
But sadly, I'm not one who upholds
sportsmanship nor do I have friendliness.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:08.430
I'm already falling behind all of you.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.432
Sorry, but I must do my best.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:14.311
Blessed ones can't understand.

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:18.983 line:20%
Someone that can go wherever they wish
with their ideal Quirk.

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.236
I want to be an outstanding hero.

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:25.239
I want to help people with my Quirk.

00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:29.243
Each of you
is a challenge I must overcome.

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.370
I don't plan to become your friend.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.790
That's all from me.

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.421
I can feel his aura from here.

00:14:40.504 --> 00:14:41.505 line:20%
This is getting intense.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.799 line:20%
He reminds me of you, Todoroki.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.509 line:20%
-Really?
-Yes.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:46.969
He seems interesting.

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:49.221
Without further ado, let's begin.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.973
Battle drill, commence!

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.685
<i>It's Class A against Class B.</i>

00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:58.188
<i>It takes place somewhere in Ground Gamma.</i>

00:14:58.272 --> 00:15:01.817
<i>There must be four students in each team,
and you take turns to battle.</i>

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.527
Four students in one team?

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.820
That sounds fun.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.030
I know!

00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:08.866
But there will be 41 of us
including Shinso.

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:11.702
What do we do with the remainder?

00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:14.747
Shinso will participate in two battles.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.957
One as Class A, and another as Class B.

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.667
<i>He will battle against both classes.</i>

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:22.713
<i>Which means, there will be two battles
where one team will have five students.</i>

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.715
<i>But the other team
will be at a disadvantage.</i>

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:29.136
Having the inexperienced Shinso
on their team is a disadvantage.

00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:33.349
That should balance
the advantage in numbers.

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:39.772 line:20%
The objective is to surround
and capture the enemies as heroes.

00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:42.524 line:20%
Both teams
must see each other as villains.

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.527 line:20%
The first team
to capture four people wins.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.280 line:20%
Well, the villains are getting
more organized after all.

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:49.865
It's simple. I like it.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.953
We are both the heroes and villains!

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:55.871
Which role should I play?

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.581
I think we can see ourselves as heroes.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:02.252
There are very cute prisons
for both teams.

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:05.756
As soon as the opponents are in it,
they will be disqualified.

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.341
It doesn't match the atmosphere!

00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:08.968
It's most effective

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.554
to render our opponents unable to battle
on their own base.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.474
But I doubt it would be that simple.

00:16:15.557 --> 00:16:17.935
The first to capture four wins.

00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:20.688
-So this is the balance they mentioned?
-What?

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:24.233
Yes. With an unfamiliar member
on your team,

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:26.110
you'll have five members.

00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:28.862
But as long as four
are captured, you lose.

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.657
You want us to carry a dead weight around?

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.866
This is lame.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.743
Don't be so rude.

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.787
I'm fine with that. It's true.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.915
His politeness is way beyond our reach!

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.291 line:20%
Well…

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:42.626 line:20%
Let's draw straws.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.962
CLASS A VS CLASS B

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.898 line:20%
Shinso, it's your turn to draw.

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.735 line:20%
The number will decide
which team you join.

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:11.321
We heard what you said earlier,

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:12.698
but let's work as a team.

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:13.741
Nice to meet you!

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:15.659
Could you tell us more about your Quirk?

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.870 line:20%
You have a handsome look.
The girls must like you a lot.

00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:18.912
I can tell as much.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:19.830
Nice to meet you.

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:22.207
Hey, you! Not bad!

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.002
Let's crush the cursed Class A together!

00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:27.880
Please ignore his outrageous manner.

00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:28.839
Nice to meet you.

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:31.633
Same goes for you!

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.052
Team five of Class B.

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.345
You and Shinso have matched
against each other again

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:37.473
for the first time after the sports event.

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:38.432
Yes.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:42.144
<i>The vestige of One For All still bugs me,</i>

00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:43.979
<i>but for now…</i>

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.023
I look forward to his improvements.

00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:48.150
What is he going to show us this time?

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.443
Where did you pull that out?

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.406
<i>The day has come.</i>

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.867
<i>I'm finally on the starting line.</i>

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.329 line:20%
The starting point is your base.

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:01.997 line:20%
The time limit is 20 minutes.

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:05.042 line:20%
If you can't settle the score in time,

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.836 line:20%
the team with more remaining members wins.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.839
All Might and Midnight are here!

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:11.882
Are they dating?

00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:14.843
Give me a break. I don't like older guys.

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:17.012 line:20%
Which team do you think will win?

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.514 line:20%
It's hard to tell.

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:22.810
Class A has become much more experienced
after so many crises.

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:24.061
However,

00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:28.649
Class B shows more growth
when it comes to results.

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:33.028
They could focus more on their lessons
without much trouble going on.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.572
They steadily grow over time.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:38.492 line:20%
<i>Would it be Class A that shows
true potential in the face of danger?</i>

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:42.079 line:20%
<i>Or would it be Class B that shows
better overall improvement?</i>

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.581 line:20%
This is exciting.

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.458
First battle!

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.626
You're all fired up.

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:49.753 line:20%
Start!

00:18:56.969 --> 00:19:00.139
We all know each other's abilities,

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:03.642
but to maintain life advantage,
we should stick together.

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:06.311
<i>Asui's camouflage.</i>

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.522
<i>I can spot her if I know where to look.</i>

00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.817
So I should keep my distance from you

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.486
to shoot my one-million-volt lightning.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.947
What if we got separated?

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.282
You'll be isolated.

00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:19.783
You have a point.

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.286
Shiozaki can be quite the handful.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.457
<i>Her Quirk is so powerful.</i>

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:30.794
The attack range is huge,
and she annihilated me.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.047
We should start with
the most challenging Quirk to deal with.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.216
That's brilliant, Shinso.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.676
That's just common sense.

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:38.802
What?

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:42.890
Just like we want to take out Ibara first,

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:47.394
they will try to get rid of Kaminari too.

00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:50.397
Then we have to deal
with our lack of experience.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.774
Shinso's Brainwashing is very powerful.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.444
I'm counting on all of you!

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:59.323
I hope we get to see Kaminari
and Shinso unleash their true strength.

00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:04.661
Thank you.

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:06.330
Have you found them already?

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.665
Shiozaki is coming from the left side.

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:09.833
She seems to be alone.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:13.420
<i>She is spreading her vines
to search for us while heading our way.</i>

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.257
Attacking a girl all at once leaves
a bad taste in my mouth.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.970
Roaring Rage!

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:26.642
Kirishima! Tsuyu!

00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:32.356
We knew Koda
could track us down with ease.

00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:36.151
Of course, we expected you
to be wary of Shiozaki.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:39.363
We used her as a decoy
and closed in on you.

00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:44.701
We isolated you to leave you
to your own device.

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:47.412
So I seized the opening to attack!

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:50.791 line:20%
My nose can sense anything!

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.044 line:20%
<i>Jurota Shishida.</i>

00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:55.545 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Beast.</i>

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:59.383 line:20%
<i>Monster form drastically augments
his strength, speed, and durability,</i>

00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:00.926 line:20%
<i>as well as his senses.</i>

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:03.929 line:20%
<i>He also becomes wilder,
making him reckless.</i>

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:09.601
Now you can't electrocute us without
hurting your friends, Denki Kaminari!

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:14.231
Check out the new move I developed!

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:15.857
Air Prison!

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.735
Not even sound can escape this space!

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:23.448
Okay, let's finish them off!

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.993
Leave it to me!

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.704
Are you kidding me?

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:34.334
He's been brainwashed.

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:35.752
That guy…
