00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:01.835
CLASS A VS CLASS B

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:08.883
<i>The Hero Course of U.A. High</i>
<i>Class A and Class B</i>

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.428 line:20%
<i>are in a joint training battle.</i>

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.222 line:20%
<i>The third match began</i>
<i>after each class'd won one battle.</i>

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:15.140
THAT HURTS

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.768
<i>Class A managed to launch</i>
<i>a preemptive strike on Class B</i>

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:19.853
<i>with Todoroki's attack.</i>

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:23.148 line:20%
<i>But Honenuki's Quirk turned the match</i>
<i>to their advantage.</i>

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:28.153 line:20%
<i>Class B is slowly gaining the upper hand.</i>

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.532
Curse it.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:33.867
Sorry.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.536
There's a time limit
to your Recipro Burst.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.747
Using it at the start wasn't a great idea.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.583
Anyway, I have to go help Tetsutetsu now.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.794
Time limit?

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.672
That was a long time ago, Mudman.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:53.678
Ingenium will never be absent
from a fight.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:57.057
My legs exist for that sole purpose!

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.393
Right now,

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.812
I'm always going full throttle!

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:07.400
New Style: Recipro Turbo!

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.380
Ten minutes…

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.674
Within the next ten minutes,

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:57.177
I am unstoppable!

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.599
You trying to take me down
with your new move?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.143
However…

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.939
<i>He's too fast!</i>

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:14.027
It's so fast that I still don't have
full control over it.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.156
No, this is bad.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.283
There is no way to fight him.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.873
Surrender yourself, Mudman!

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:28.541
What?

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.629 line:20%
<i>Sorry.</i>

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.674 line:20%
<i>I'm not foolish enough to fight</i>
<i>my opponent while I'm at a disadvantage.</i>

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:41.846
<i>It's not safe to leave Iida rampaging,</i>
<i>but I can't fight him right now.</i>

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.601
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>I should hurry to aid Tetsutetsu.</i>

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:52.607 line:20%
<i>He undid the effect on the ice.</i>

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.484 line:20%
<i>He hiding to start a retaliation?</i>

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:58.404
<i>He should know by now</i>
<i>how futile that would be.</i>

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.241
<i>Did he leave to aid his teammates?</i>

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:07.789
Oh, my God!

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.457 line:20%
Iida is moving so fast!

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.167 line:20%
Recipro Turbo…

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.419 line:20%
He is even faster than Gran Torino.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:19.259 line:20%
Your Shoot Style somehow inspired Iida
to figure out his own fighting style.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.302 line:20%
I should ask him for advice on kicking.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.596 line:20%
Enough! Look at Ojiro!

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:37.235 line:20%
Ojiro is fighting as usual.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:41.281 line:20%
He may be at a disadvantage,
but he has learned much over time!

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.532
Go for it!

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.327
<i>My chest hurts!</i>

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.330
You can't win a fight by simply dodging.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.541 line:20%
<i>He can easily reflect my attacks.</i>

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.876 line:20%
<i>I can try guarding it,</i>

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.921
<i>but his support item is too sharp</i>
<i>and tough to withstand.</i>

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.799
<i>You're a mean one, Kaibara!</i>

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.057
Eat this!

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.354
-Iida?
-I'll put Spiral into the prison now!

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.356
I'll be gone, but it won't take long!

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.818
Ojiro, help the others!
I think Mudman's already on his way!

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:20.028
I'll be right back!

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.154
Understood!

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.241
<i>Even the speed of his speech</i>
<i>has become faster.</i>

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:29.370
Let me go! It should be my turn to shine!

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:31.205
Stay still!

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.791
I won't let my opponent have any chance
to defeat me!

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:35.835
Did you let Honenuki get away?

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.378
You know how troublesome he can be.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.798
Anyone else would have
gone after him instead.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:44.552 line:20%
You shouldn't interrupt
my fight, Ingenium!

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.679
My brother'd do the same.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.556
He is the hero I must become!

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.186
If I stray from my standard
during training,

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.480
the same thing will happen
in a real battle.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.232
You're so stubborn.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.985
Indeed. People tell me that a lot.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.038
Steel Fist!

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.875 line:20%
He hardened his entire body,

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.960 line:20%
so being partly frozen won't hinder
his performance.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.505 line:20%
His hardened skin doesn't even peel off.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.091 line:20%
Tetsutetsu, I will learn so much from you.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.635 line:20%
Stop using your ice.
It's not working on them.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.178 line:20%
You're acting like a wimp.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.764 line:20%
Your ice wall means nothing to me!

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:32.767 line:20%
I will crush it with my fists of justice!

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.185 line:20%
In that case…

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:37.855
I'll put up a wall of flame for you!

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:41.567
That hurt!

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.612
Shoji! Take care of Tsunotori!

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:45.530
All right!

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.241
<i>Back down! Put some distance between us!</i>

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.578
Why am I fighting you?

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.164
I bet you didn't know.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.917
Your attacks won't work on me at all!

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.461
<i>He's turning red from the heat.</i>

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.798
My steel is burning red!

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.425
Hey!

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.301 line:20%
Fight, Real Fist!

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:11.431
This is how my Quirk has improved!

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:15.184
<i>Have you ever lived</i>
<i>inside a burning furnace?</i>

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:20.606
<i>Tetsutetsu is restraining Todoroki!</i>

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.692
He's engaging him in close combat

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:25.445
and stopping him
from using any wide-range attacks!

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.905
Half-Cold, Half-Hot…

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.575 line:20%
Your Quirk won't work on me!

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.326 line:20%
This is…

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.788
the fruition of my hard work

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.540
for going beyond my limits!

00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:43.504
<i>Push your heat to its limit!</i>

00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:46.799
Then go beyond that limit!

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.177
There is no way you can't do it.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.471
You're not trying hard enough!

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:56.184
I'll keep punching you
until I knock you out.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.687
<i>Feel it.</i>

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:03.816
The power within you
is stronger than anyone!

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.278
<i>Why now?</i>

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.864
<i>Why am I thinking of him now?</i>

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.033
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:15.703
Prepare to lose!

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:20.666
<i>If my ice and fire can't hurt him…</i>

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:25.213
Now you've become
the perfect improvement of myself.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.967 line:20%
Isn't it… your power?

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.430
<i>Back down.</i>

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.182
That burns!

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.059
<i>More flame…</i>

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:41.896
<i>More flame…</i>

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.777 line:20%
The camera broke down from the heat.

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.697
<i>More flame…</i>

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.367
<i>I can still generate more heat.</i>

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.577
<i>Burn on!</i>

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.084
<i>I must become the hero I want to be!</i>

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.254
TETSUTETSU TETSUTETSU
QUIRK: STEEL

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:08.381
HE CAN TURN HIS BODY INTO METAL
AND STILL MOVE FREELY

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:09.966
SHOTO TODOROKI
QUIRK: HALF-COLD HALF-HOT

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.926
GENERATES ICE FROM HIS RIGHT
FLAME FROM HIS LEFT

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:18.266 line:20%
<i>Young Todoroki…</i>

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.689
<i>He is using Endeavor's flame.</i>

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.733
<i>It's burning me!</i>

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.528
<i>This heat is insane!</i>

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:33.990
<i>I can understand your feeling, Todoroki.</i>

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:37.201
<i>I keep burning metal inside my body.</i>

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:40.663
<i>I know you're suffering.</i>

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:45.418
<i>I doubt you could last long in this state.</i>

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:46.877
<i>Well, then…</i>

00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:54.844
Endurance is my specialty!

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.139
Go beyond!

00:09:58.222 --> 00:09:59.807
You…

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.060
I won't let you get away
with just some burn marks.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:08.065 line:20%
If you can't risk your life in training,
you won't risk your life in real battles!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:12.695
Superiority and limits
are meant to be broken!

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.865
You are talking too loud.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.749
<i>I can still feel the heat</i>
<i>at this distance.</i>

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.756 line:20%
<i>I should go support Real Steel now.</i>

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.883 line:20%
Sorry, Tentacole.

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.802 line:20%
I always skip the octopus
when I go to a public aquarium.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.095 line:20%
I don't like it.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.556 line:20%
I'm used to being feared by everyone.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.476 line:20%
I'll send you to the prison.

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.227 line:20%
Let's settle the score now.

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:47.980
That's more like it.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.524
Thunder Horn!

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.152
Octoblow!

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.160
-I'm winning.
-No!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.581
Thanks, Ojiro.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.751
Tornado Tail Dance!

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:15.174 line:20%
You won't be a threat to us
if you can't fire your horns.

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:17.593 line:20%
Oh, the way you got me…

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.470 line:20%
It's so darn ordinary!

00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:21.347
I'll take her to the prison.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.265
Help Todoroki now--

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.603 line:20%
Honenuki?

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.898
I'm taking Tsunotori back.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.652
I'm a surprisingly loyal friend.

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:39.323
<i>When he struggles to break out,</i>
<i>his tail will loosen up.</i>

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.034
Curse it!

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:45.830
Fist of the Tail: Swamp Smack Spin!

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:53.671
I got you.

00:11:53.754 --> 00:11:54.922
Thanks.

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:57.591
He put so much power into shaking me off.

00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:00.636
Please step aside, Honenuki.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.640 line:20%
I won't let go even if you stab me!

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.726 line:20%
I don't need you to loosen up!

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.604
Ojiro!

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:15.776
I'll use my horns to send you
into the prison!

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.157
Under any circumstances,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.909
you're disqualified
when you step into the prison.

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:26.245
The score is 1-1.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.878
What's wrong? Your flame has gone weaker.

00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:36.797 line:20%
Todoroki!

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:39.633 line:20%
Your movement is getting slower too.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.845
<i>I feel dizzy.</i>

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:46.724
<i>I can't move my body.</i>

00:12:46.807 --> 00:12:48.517
<i>If I want to cool down,</i>

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:52.021
<i>I must first knock this guy out.</i>

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.403
<i>Go beyond.</i>

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.710
Tetsutetsu, you're going to melt.

00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:18.172
Honenuki…

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:24.720
<i>This is bad. I'm losing consciousness.</i>

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:26.639
Solidify.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:32.937
I won't miss again, Mudman!

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.065
That burns…

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:37.149
Hey, you…

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.068
Don't run away from me.

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.863
<i>Then save him first.</i>

00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:47.827
<i>I think someone that can help</i>
<i>a lost child when they see one</i>

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.121 line:20%
<i>is the coolest person ever.</i>

00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:53.791 line:20%
Mind your tongue, villain!

00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:59.004
Saving lives must always be the priority!

00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:02.007
<i>I'm going to pass out.</i>

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.843
<i>If he lands that attack…</i>

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:08.055
<i>To think that he said he couldn't</i>
<i>control this power yet.</i>

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.685
<i>It's a fatal mistake</i>
<i>to leave Iida rampaging.</i>

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.646
<i>We're going to lose.</i>

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.525
<i>When I pass out,</i>
<i>the Quirk's effect will be gone.</i>

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:24.154 line:20%
<i>I can't leave items to help my team</i>
<i>like Yaoyorozu did.</i>

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.241 line:20%
<i>I don't feel frustrated.</i>

00:14:27.324 --> 00:14:29.785
<i>I feel defeated.</i>

00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:32.663
<i>However…</i>

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:38.127
<i>I can't let my mistake</i>
<i>be the cause of our defeat!</i>

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.588
Tetsutetsu! Push this!

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.824
What was that?

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.213
<i>All combatants are down!</i>

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:26.759
<i>But they are still in the battle</i>
<i>until they are sent to the prison!</i>

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:28.427
<i>What will happen now?</i>

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:32.848
<i>That hurts…</i>

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.683
<i>My left arm and leg…</i>

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.644
<i>It's too heavy.</i>

00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:39.939
<i>I can't move with just one leg.</i>

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:43.692
<i>Todoroki, I've failed you.</i>

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.778
<i>If I could just move faster…</i>

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:49.239
<i>Had I reached you sooner back then…</i>

00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:54.036
Iida is still conscious,
but he's unable to battle!

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.165
<i>I think Kaibara's struggle</i>
<i>has taken a toll on him.</i>

00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:02.670 line:20%
<i>He struggled hard after being captured,</i>
<i>contributing to Iida's demise!</i>

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:03.921 line:20%
Well done, Kaibara!

00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:06.507
You're the MVP of the day, Kaibara!

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.594
<i>Mr. Vlad King is starting</i>
<i>his bias broadcast again.</i>

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:13.931
Class A and Class B
each have one prisoner.

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:16.433
Four combatants are down.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:18.227
All that's left is…

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.732
METAL

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:25.734
Todoroki!

00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:30.489
<i>I can't let Shoji toss them</i>
<i>into the prison.</i>

00:16:30.572 --> 00:16:32.116 line:20%
<i>But what should I do now?</i>

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:35.953 line:20%
<i>I can't defeat Shoji</i>
<i>even with all my horns attacking.</i>

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:39.456
<i>I will lose for sure</i>
<i>if I fight him head-on.</i>

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:43.002
<i>We'll be in the lead</i>
<i>if I send Todoroki to the prison first.</i>

00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:46.005
<i>But I have three unconscious teammates.</i>

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:49.425 line:20%
<i>He might catch up to me</i>
<i>before I can even reach the prison.</i>

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.511 line:20%
<i>It's over if I lose.</i>

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.555
I got you!

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.058
<i>Well, then…</i>

00:16:58.892 --> 00:16:59.893
Is she…

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:05.357
<i>I'll wait for my chance</i>
<i>somewhere you can never reach.</i>

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.902
<i>I can't win, but I won't lose either.</i>

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.739
Sorry, Tentacole!

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:15.743
I don't want my team to lose.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.747
She took her teammates
and Todoroki to the sky.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.374
Shoji can't fly even with his Quirk.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:25.085
She got away.

00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:28.672
Deku, what is Class B up to now?

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:31.467
My guess is they are playing it safe.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.095
Shoji would put her teammates
into the prison if she put them down.

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.889
Why's she taking Todoroki with her?

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:38.682
If Todoroki woke up,

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:43.187
it would be impossible to dodge
his ice and flame, even while flying.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.939
She is taking him as a precaution.

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:50.444
But she can't win
unless she puts him into the prison.

00:17:50.527 --> 00:17:53.489
It can't be helped,
but the outcome is almost certain.

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:56.158
They are running out of time!

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:09.254
Time's up!

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.715
The third battle ends!

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:15.260
Both teams got one prisoner! It's a tie!

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:18.263
This doesn't feel good at all! It sucks!

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:20.140 line:20%
If this was a real battle,

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:23.352 line:20%
the best way is to retreat
and wait for backup.

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:27.856
Iida…

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.317
Must be hard for him to accept this.

00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:31.860
However…

00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:40.494
<i>He was awesome.</i>

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:42.830
Too many combatants are unconscious.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:46.166
Like the second battle,
we'll start the post mortem meeting later.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.335
Get ready for the fourth battle!

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:51.588

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:06.937
I know the battle ended with a draw,
but I feel defeated!

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.940
Your flame was insane!
We should fight again!

00:19:10.023 --> 00:19:11.441
You are too loud.

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:13.819
<i>A draw…</i>

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:16.446
Had I moved faster,

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.407
we could have won.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.575
Iida…

00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:22.661 line:20%
I wasn't fast enough.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:27.291 line:20%
I couldn't overcome
Honenuki's flexibility in battle.

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:29.251
But you saved me.

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.128
I can remember as much.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.549
Not to mention I made the first mistake.

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:41.180
We would be doomed
had you used your flame instead.

00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:45.642
I'm used to striking preemptively
with my ice.

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:49.396
No, that mindset
had been planted into my muscles.

00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:52.566
You were fast enough.

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.152
But I couldn't react in time.

00:19:56.904 --> 00:20:00.365
I made you worry because I was too slow.

00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:17.007 line:20%
I must make it in time for everyone
no matter what danger awaits.

<i>This is the spirit I inherited</i>

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.934
Your flame and his Recipro…

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:29.144
I have some problems to deal with too.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.022
Could we train together sometime?

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:33.690
-Of course.
-Of course.

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:37.361
<i>Go back there if you're feeling all right.</i>

00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:38.862
<i>Stop chitchatting in my infirmary!</i>

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:41.198
<i>Yes! We're so sorry!</i>

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:46.036
There is no way out of this.

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:48.497
Class A and Class B have the same score.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.251
We can win if we lose

After all, we have Tokage with us!

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.849
Isn't that right, Bakugo?

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.476
All right, let's go.

Are you kidding me? Your strategy…

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:28.245
That's right.

00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:31.707
<i>Wait and see, you stupid Deku.</i>

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.877
<i>We'll start after everyone is in position!</i>

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:39.715

00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:27.739
<i>But Class B has Tokage on their team.</i>

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:31.910
