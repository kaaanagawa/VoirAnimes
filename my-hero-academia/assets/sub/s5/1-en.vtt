00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.639
Endeavor was so awesome yesterday!

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:15.682
I know!

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.726
I broke out in a cold sweat

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.602 line:20%
<i>when Nomu struck him down.</i>

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.778
How boring.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:33.283
Isn't there a stronger hero here?

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.124
You're too slow!

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.924
Do you possess regenerative ability?

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.384
Can you regenerate too?

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.303
<i>Don't group me together with you.</i>

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.389
<i>I couldn't move my body a while ago.</i>

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.978
<i>I can only push an immobile body</i>

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.814
<i>with firepower!</i>

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.699
<i>My feathers don't possess</i>
<i>enough destructive powers.</i>

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.785
<i>But I can match him in terms of speed.</i>

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.334
<i>I let my feathers fly over in advance.</i>

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:32.467
<i>Your aggressive firepower and my speed.</i>

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.179
<i>Let me give you a push,</i>

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.014
<i>No. 1!</i>

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.317

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.402
You're

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.238
me.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.825

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:25.687

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.913
<i>He ended the battle</i>
<i>with his imposing victory pose.</i>

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.000 line:20%
That was so awesome.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.127
The No. 1 Hero never ceases to amaze us.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.004
Hawks was amazing too.

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:52.589
Not to mention he's so handsome!

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.717
The man who's a bit too fast
lives up to his name.

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:58.303
Todoroki.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.138
How is Endeavor?

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.266
He is no longer in critical condition.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.351
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.062
He's a father
you can be proud of, Todoroki!

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.984
Yes, you're right.

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:20.116
The lesson started…

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.534
SILENCE…

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:22.785
Good.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.457
Don't get excited over everything.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.335
It's time to take initiative.
I know it's only the provisional license,

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:33.546
but you can participate
in heroes' activities

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.924
and must carry out the respective duties.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.884
Keep that in mind.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.137
So far, there are still two of you

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.724
who are still taking
the provisional license training course.

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.811
The lessons from now on
will only get more challenging.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.146
You should get ready.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.941
Now we proceed to our homeroom.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.154
<i>Emergency training!</i>

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:02.533

<i>Please change into your battle suits.</i>

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.920 line:20%
<i>Head to the battle as fast as you can.</i>

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:16.047

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.008
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:25.765
<i>It is estimated that 80%</i>
<i>of the world population has a Quirk.</i>

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.686
<i>These Quirks molded</i>
<i>the current superhuman society.</i>

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:37.402
<i>To fight against the villains</i>
<i>who use Quirks,</i>

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:40.029
<i>heroes become a profession.</i>

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.826
<i>I, Izuku Midoriya,</i>

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.536
<i>longed to be a hero</i>

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.580
<i>and enrolled in the U.A. High School's</i>
<i>Department of Heroes</i>

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.585
<i>as I move towards my dream.</i>

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.089
<i>Moving forward with like-minded comrades,</i>

00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:03.553

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:09.976
<i>Everything is to become the best hero.</i>

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:13.604

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.749
Enemies have infiltrated Ground Beta.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.919
That's all we know for now.

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:01.712
Whether this is training,

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.674
we must complete our mission flawlessly.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.343
We need more information on the situation.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.929

00:07:10.012 --> 00:07:11.347
-Right.
-Leave it to us.

I can hear noises of destruction.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.217

Did you forget about me?

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.446
The villain is still around.

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:01.822
Are you aware of that?

00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:05.075
Hado is our enemy?

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:06.869
There's another one!

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.871
There's another villain!

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.626
It's Amajiki!

00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:22.510
Why am I playing the villain?

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.012
Everyone is staring at me.

00:13:25.387 --> 00:13:27.181
Yes, they are nothing but potatoes.

00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:30.100
They are not watching me.
They are vegetables.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.354
I want to go home.

00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:35.272 line:20%
<i>He is leaving already?</i>

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:37.733
IZUKU MIDORIYA
QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.361
CRUSHING THE ENEMIES WITH THE POWER
INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSORS

00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:41.612
KATSUKI BAKUGO
QUIRK: EXPLOSION

00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:44.365
SECRETION OF NITROGLYCERIN-LIKE SWEAT
FROM HIS PALMS

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:50.204
Amajiki is really leaving.

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:52.122
Is it really all right for him to leave?

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:54.667
Stop, Amajiki!

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.255
You can't go. You must play your role.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.216
Stay still, or you might get hurt.

00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:05.511
After all, I'm a villain now.

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:09.139
The Big Three are the villains.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.100
They have Pinky as hostage.

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.686
We can flank them from behind.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:14.895
Right.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.063
Let's go.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.068
I told you to stay still.
Didn't you hear me?

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.738
Bad children should be punished!

00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:25.990
That's…

00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:28.868
Charge complete, 30% output.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:45.759
What?

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:49.889
I'm being washed away again.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:51.515
We must save him.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.351
I bet he did it on purpose!

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:56.979
Ingenium.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:59.315
The rescue mission is our priority.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.775
Leave Hado to Midoriya and the others.

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.486
-We must rescue the civilians.
-Understood.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.621
The sounds are too distorted
to make anything out of them.

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:15.080
What is going on?

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:17.124
Pinky is being held hostage.

00:15:17.207 --> 00:15:18.125
What?

00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:19.501
We must save her.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.544
No.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.922
Our mission is to remain here
and investigate the situation.

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:23.839
What?

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:27.217
There are more than just two villains
in the vicinity.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:32.139
Villains, what is your motive?

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:37.686
I want to go home!

00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:40.940
Go ahead.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:44.276
But if I did that,
Hado would be mad at me.

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.820
Mirio said…

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:52.785
<i>he would do everything he could</i>
<i>to hone your skills</i>

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:55.245
<i>so you could become real heroes.</i>

00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:59.083
So I can't leave just yet!

00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:03.462
The Big Three are doing this for us.

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:04.713
I appreciate their effort,

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.007
but this is too challenging!

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.096
<i>Someone is missing.</i>

00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:14.014
<i>Where is that invisible girl?</i>

00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:15.307
Uraraka!

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.101
Release!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.565
I get it now. It's Hagakure!

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:26.151

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.422

Please surrender.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.881
Why didn't you strike me down?

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:31.550
I couldn't do it.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.096
Your naivety could cost you your life.

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:42.770
As of now,

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:45.355
I'm a villain.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:46.440

We're going in for real this time.

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:13.217
The charging is too slow, fool.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.636

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:46.750
That's awesome, Bakugo.

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:48.752
He took down Amajiki.

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:50.796
Did we clear the training?

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:53.257
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.675
I think it's over.

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:56.385
This is great.

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.930
I was hoping to play
a more significant role in this.

00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:03.892
You saved me again. Thanks.

I think so.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.192
Not so fast!

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.277
What?

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.238
You were pulling punches!

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.198
But the look on your face--

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.826
Don't you dare look down on me!

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.580
I don't care if this is training.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:28.417
I don't care if you are my senior!
A villain is a villain nonetheless!

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.420 line:20%
You are my enemy!

00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:34.923

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:38.510
<i>Now die!</i>

00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:50.439
I want Bakugo in my office.

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.316
<i>Understood.</i>

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:57.779

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:03.577
<i>We'll become the greatest heroes!</i>

00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:08.160
Your pose was just like All Might's.

00:22:09.077 --> 00:22:11.371
I used a different arm.

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.666
He raises his left arm.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.335 line:20%
How should I know that?

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:18.587
Either way,

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.506
thank you for winning this battle.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.968
I failed miserably.

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.763
I performed so badly at the beginning.

00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:30.557
Sorry.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.268
But this victory we secured

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:35.562
must be meaningful!

00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:38.648
Hold on a moment.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.028
We had some dramatic turn of events.

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:51.203
But anyway,

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:53.038
