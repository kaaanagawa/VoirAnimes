Midoriya. Bakugo.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.267
If you don't have a place to go,

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.394
would you like to join me

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.813
and work for the No. 1 Hero,

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.232
Endeavor, as interns?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.033
<i>Every student of U.A. High's Hero Course</i>

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:37.620
<i>must spend their winter break</i>

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.416 line:20%
<i>Kacchan, Todoroki, and I went</i>

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.127 line:20%
<i>to the No. 1 Hero Endeavor's agency</i>
<i>as interns.</i>

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:48.840
<i>Mineta, Kaminari, Sero, and Shiozaki</i>
<i>are having their internship</i>

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.884
<i>at The Lurkers' agency.</i>

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:56.556
<i>Kirishima, Tetsutetsu, and Amajiki</i>
<i>are working with Fat Gum.</i>

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.351
<i>While everyone is busy</i>
<i>with their internships</i>

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.979
<i>at the pro heroes' agencies, we…</i>

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.401
<i>are exhausted just by catching up</i>
<i>to Endeavor's speed.</i>

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.071
<i>And with that,</i>
<i>the first day of our internship ends.</i>

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.576
<i>Uraraka and Asui are having</i>
<i>their internship at Ryukyu's agency.</i>

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.370
<i>I bet they are having a tough time there.</i>

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.798
My new costume has arrived!

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.758
It looks nice on you, Ochaco.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.593
It suits you well, Uravity.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:35.637
Thank you.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.099
Why do you need a new costume?

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.850
Is there a reason for it? Please tell me.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.894
Well…

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.358
What?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.026
That's a secret!

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.571
A secret? Why? You sound so mysterious.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:57.033
Everyone, you did well
on your first day of internship.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.327
We're throwing you
a small welcoming party.

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.371
It looks delicious.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.124
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.047
<i>The day is surprisingly delightful!</i>

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.436 line:20%
<i>We'll proceed with the next news piece.</i>

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.397 line:20%
<i>It's been a week</i>
<i>since the large-scale wildfire</i>

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.982 line:20%
<i>started in Kaflin.</i>

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.777 line:20%
<i>The wildfire is finally under control.</i>

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:57.111 line:20%
<i>It's now known that</i>

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.114 line:20%
<i>a fire broke out from a factory that</i>
<i>manufactured the illegal drug, Trigger,</i>

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.283 line:20%
<i>during an accidental explosion.</i>

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.493 line:20%
"Trigger"?

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.620 line:20%
I know about Trigger.

00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:07.288 line:20%
Do you mind if I explain?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:11.084 line:20%
Trigger is an illegal drug
that functions similar to Boost.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.001
Yes.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:16.464 line:20%
<i>It can amplify the power of Quirks</i>
<i>several times.</i>

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.300
Just like Boost,

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.886
Trigger is widely available
in the Japanese market.

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.390
I hope the number goes down
with this accident.

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:28.017
As for the explosion,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.729
the ingredients needed
to manufacture Trigger

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.023
were stolen from the warehouse.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:38.569
Rumor has it, they were stolen
before the explosion.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:40.488
So the factory explosion

00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.700
was meant to sabotage any traces
and mislead the investigation.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:48.121
Well, it's only a rumor.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:55.837
<i>Unregistered vessel, stop right there!</i>

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.797
<i>This is the Japanese territorial sea.</i>

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.550
Foreign vessels
are not allowed to trespass!

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:01.884
Leave or get smashed!

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.429
Captain, you are provoking them.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.806 line:20%
I see.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.893
<i>Well, unregistered vessel,</i>
<i>please stop right there.</i>

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.228
<i>If you don't…</i>

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:14.397
I'll be upset!

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.984
You're far from being cute.
They aren't looking at you either.

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:20.528
Captain, I spotted people on that ship.

00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:21.738
What?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.794
<i>It's a smoke screen!</i>

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.004
<i>They blocked our view!</i>

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.756
Multiple radar pings!

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.758
The smoke screen is mixed with chaffs.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.177
Oki Mariner, full throttle!

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.636
Break through the smoke screen!

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.013
<i>Aye, sir!</i>

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:52.643
The man on that unregistered vessel
must have been using Trigger.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:53.686
Yes.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.689
Judging by the route they took,

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.734
it's likely they set out
from a port in Kaflin.

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:02.779
There are rumors about the explosion
at a Trigger factory.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.531
Someone took the ingredients.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.701
Could it be that ship is carrying them?

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:12.038
I caught the scent.
I can smell them from here.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.083
We're almost out of the smoke screen.

00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:22.548
<i>The unregistered vessel is gone.</i>

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.259
-There's no radar ping either.
-Damn.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.261
It only took them seconds to escape.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.764
Judging from their escape route…

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:33.017 line:20%
They must be hiding somewhere
in the Verize Islands.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.727 line:20%
That could be a problem.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.230
They have their Trigger.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.315
But we also have cards up our sleeve.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.151
The terrain of the Verize Islands
is complex.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:46.948
<i>We'll need to search from above too.</i>

00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:48.699
<i>In that case…</i>

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.619
Sirius, send the team-up request.

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:53.454
Which team should we send it to?

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:56.249
Number ten on the Billboard Chart,

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:59.710 line:20%
<i>Dragoon Hero: Ryukyu.</i>

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.256
We have a team-up request, Ryukyu.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:04.340
From whom?

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.384
It's from Sea Rescue Hero: Selkie.

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:08.177
A request from Mr. Selkie?

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:12.557
You used to work with him
during the workplace training, right?

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.559
What happened?

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:18.354
Uravity, Froppy, and Nejire Chan,
get ready.

00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:21.357
Team Ryukyu is deploying.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.567
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:29.657 line:20%
VERIZE ISLANDS, PACIFIC OCEAN

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.868 line:20%
<i>Thank you for coming, Ryukyu.</i>

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.246
Since the escaped vessel
could be smuggling Trigger,

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:36.873
I can't just sit out.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:40.168
I'm happy to offer any assistance, Selkie.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.961
I knew I could count on you.

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:44.088
Selkie feels happy!

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.090
<i>He's not cute at all.</i>

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.592
<i>He's cute!</i>

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:50.386
You haven't changed at all,
Captain Selkie.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.473
How have you been, Froppy?

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.268
I'm doing great.
Thank you for the workplace training.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.902
<i>We're following the captain's orders.</i>

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:09.030
<i>Because we believe that</i>
<i>his order is the best course to take.</i>

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.616
<i>Believe in him, Froppy.</i>

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:14.076
<i>Believe the captain, and us!</i>

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:21.918
Captain, Miss Sirius, you taught me
what's the most important value to a hero.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.878
You've learned a lot since then.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.964
I'm so…

00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:28.925
I'm so touched!

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.510
<i>He's not cute at all.</i>

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.220 line:20%
<i>He's so cute.</i>

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:35.097
By the way,
you got your provisional license.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.350
-Congratulations.
-Thank you!

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:39.393
You can now hold your own
in this line of work.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.438
I look forward to seeing
your performance, Froppy.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.606
Yes, sir!

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.068
Now I'm sorry to say this.

00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:49.278
Please head to the beach now.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.542 line:20%
Head to the beach and lift your spirit!

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.627
-Over here!
-I'm coming!

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.672
-What is this for?
-What's wrong with it?

00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:11.676
The vessel smuggling Trigger
will only set out at night.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:17.390
Being on high alert won't do us any good.

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:19.308
Take this!

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:47.628
They sure are having fun.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.755
Everything feels so peaceful.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:53.092
-I see what this is about now.
-What?

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:56.762
Heroes like ourselves
are always fighting against the villains

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.056
and fending off their evil schemes.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.393
So you want them to know
the value of peace

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:05.730
and have the will to maintain peace.

00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:07.690
Isn't that right?

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.986
This is the mental preparation
for our battle against evil.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:24.290
The heroes and coast guards
have tightened security around here.

00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:27.627
What should we do?
Should we contact our client?

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.586
No.

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:32.423
We must assume that all our communication
is being monitored.

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:34.508
They might see us with the satellite too.

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.678
So we will proceed as planned.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:38.929
That's right.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:40.556
We'll start after nightfall.

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.434
Get the Trigger ready.

00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:47.688
It will come in handy
when things get intense.

Nejire Chan and I will search from above.

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:07.625
Selkie, I leave Uravity and Froppy to you.

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:09.752
All right!

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.462
Get ready to set sail!

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:12.755
-Aye, sir!
-Aye, sir!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.471
Docking line, retracted!

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:22.223
Dead slow ahead.

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:24.350
Rear side, clear!

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.143
Right rudder!

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:29.814
All right! Oki Mariner, set sail!

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.869
-Let's get to work, Nejire Chan.
-Yes.

<i>By controlling the output of her blast,</i>

00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:20.322

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:23.951

00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:25.035
Aye, sir!

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:27.538

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.613
<i>No anomaly was spotted</i>
<i>at the skerry ahead.</i>

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:03.073
Nothing on the heat sensor either.

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:05.159
Proceed to the next location.

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.410
Aye, sir.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:09.205
Ryukyu, how is it from the sky?

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:12.249 line:20%
<i>This is Ryukyu. Nothing unusual so far.</i>

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.919
Please point me to the next location.

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:18.088
<i>Roger. Proceed to Point 43 next.</i>

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:19.632 line:20%
Roger.

00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:31.268
It's time. Get ready to set sail.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:34.230
<i>As soon as you spot the enemy,</i>
<i>unleash the smoke screen.</i>

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.940
I know what to do.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.293
Here it comes. A message from the captain.

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:59.046 line:20%
<i>Sirius. Quirk: Good Ear.</i>

00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:01.882 line:20%
<i>She can hear high-frequency sounds</i>
<i>a normal human can't hear.</i>

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:06.220
The smuggler's ship is at Point 57!

00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:07.930
The captain is right after them.

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.807
To the left!

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.059
Point 57, roger.

00:14:12.142 --> 00:14:13.477
-Nejire Chan.
-Yes.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:14.895
Don't fall behind.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.315
What?

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:22.611
<i>We've been spotted!</i>

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.531
<i>What? Where?</i>
<i>I don't see a ship on the radar.</i>

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:26.532
<i>They are in the sky!</i>

00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:27.741
The sky?

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:29.159
There's a radar ping!

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:30.953
The patrol ship is right ahead!

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.512
That's a large smoke screen.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.264
Target is using a smoke screen!

00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:51.891
Multiple radar pings!

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:52.892
It's the chaffs!

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.102
Just as we had planned.

00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:03.819
What is this?

00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:13.787
Are they on our ship?

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:15.789
But where?

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:17.666
No. How did they get on here?

00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:22.421
That's because I'm a seal!

00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:26.884
Froppy, stay here and standby.

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:27.885
Yes, sir.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.653
What was that noise? What's going on?

00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:49.698
Damn you! How did you get in?

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:58.457
Selkie Punch!

00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:02.044
<i>I've taken control of the wheelhouse.</i>

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.504
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:05.756
Ryukyu, do you roger?

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:06.799
<i>Roger.</i>

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.426
I can see the target from here.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.179
I'll provide Selkie with cover from above.

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:16.767
Ryukyu, look! Behind the ship!

00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:24.566 line:20%
Is that the main vessel?

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.527
They are getting away.

00:16:27.027 --> 00:16:29.655
We mistook it for the cargo!

00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:35.536
Froppy!

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.376
Pursue the aircraft, Ryukyu!

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:43.627
Froppy!

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:45.879
I'm all right.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.095
That plane is flying too fast.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:56.974
Curse it! Is there nothing we can do?

00:16:57.057 --> 00:16:58.142
<i>Captain.</i>

00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:00.894
<i>It's not your style to give up so easily.</i>

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:03.063
There is another way

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:04.648
to catch up to them!

00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:07.776
Uravity, are you ready?

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.819
Yes.

00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:12.156
Let's have fun at the beach again
when the mission is over.

00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:14.283
I would love to have more BBQ!

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:15.451
Roger!

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:18.203
Let's go!

00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:25.919
<i>Not like the other day…</i>

00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:29.298
<i>I can't charge recklessly.</i>

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.385
<i>I must think it through.</i>

00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:37.181
<i>I must make myself useful!</i>

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.433
<i>I must…</i>

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:42.728
<i>I must…</i>

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:48.650
What?

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:53.697
Gunhead Martial Arts!

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:55.824
Gravity Plus!

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.295
Well…

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:09.755
What should I do now?

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.174
Okay!

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:22.476
What's going on?

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:28.899
Uravity!

00:18:28.982 --> 00:18:30.526
<i>Pull the steering!</i>

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:36.490
No! The plane is losing altitude!

00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:38.325
Ochaco, get out of there!

00:18:38.408 --> 00:18:39.618
<i>Ochaco!</i>

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.370
I can't!

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:45.833
If this plane crashes into the sea,
the cargo will contaminate the sea.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:50.754 line:20%
These drugs will destroy the ecosystem!

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.009
Uravity! Make the plane weightless!

00:18:56.093 --> 00:19:01.807
But it's too heavy!
I can't make it completely weightless!

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.350
<i>Are you going to give up now?</i>

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:08.147
No, I won't give up!

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:13.861
-Nejire Chan!
-Right!

00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:23.245
Full-charge, output: 90%!

00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:26.248
Gring Wave!

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.677
Uravity, now!

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:46.476 line:20%
I'm not giving up so easily!

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:05.162
Great! She made it!

00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:08.248
<i>The plane landed safely.</i>
<i>Ryukyu is safe too.</i>

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:11.335
<i>But Uravity is a little sick.</i>

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.379
<i>Ryukyu secured the cargo.</i>

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.341
<i>They really are ingredients used</i>
<i>to make drugs.</i>

00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:20.052
<i>That concludes our mission.</i>

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.346
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:33.649
<i>According to the police's investigation,</i>

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.818
<i>the vessel was only responsible</i>
<i>for the transportation.</i>

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:40.405
<i>The smuggler had no idea</i>
<i>what the materials were for.</i>

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:43.533
Their client used a fake name.

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:45.744
They don't know
where the client is either.

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.079
I see.

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:50.040
But there's one thing we know for sure.

00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:53.877
The smugglers only knew
the destination was Otheon.

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:57.756
Otheon? That country in Europe?

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:01.051
We don't know what they planned
to do in Otheon,

00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:03.345
but we intercepted their operation.

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:04.888
I guess we have to say…

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:06.765
That's good enough!

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.602
You're not cute at all.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:13.772
I know. I've noticed that lately.

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.483
But there's nothing wrong with that.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.950
<i>Let's enjoy the temporary peace</i>
<i>we have here.</i>

00:22:58.418 --> 00:23:02.714
I see. The heroes interrupted our plan.

00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.633
What should we do?

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:06.093
It doesn't matter.

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:09.513
I have enough for our operation.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.351
Well, let's put it to work.

00:23:14.434 --> 00:23:16.895
Get ready to save humanity.

00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:22.734
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:26.696
