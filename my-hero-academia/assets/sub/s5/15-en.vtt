00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.978
Do you need a debrief right now?

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:25.483
I'm trying my best to preach
the idea of liberation across the country.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:29.612
About this book you've been
giving out to pro heroes…

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.327 line:20%
You must have read it very thoroughly.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.246 line:20%
You marked all the lines
with Destro in them.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.749
You're one of a handful of people
who understand it.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.000
Thank you.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:45.170
Honestly, I don't understand
the book at all.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:46.671
Please enlighten me.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.090
Sure. It's not as hard as you think.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.760
The spreading of our ideology
will be hastened

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.262
with you working on its publicity.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:59.434
We would be glad if you could talk
some teenagers into joining your cause.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:01.144
I'll keep up the work.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.438
Hawks, you are really devoted.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.398
You're such a good guy. He's a villain!

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.108
I wish I could have you as my sidekick.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.568
Thanks for the compliment.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.198
The Commission hasn't noticed
the existence of the Liberation Front.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.492
They are investigating
whether the incident in Deika

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.077
was the work of the League of Villains.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.537
The heroes did a great job
resolving the problem.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:23.124
They are taking their sweet time
to train new heroes.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.085
It's Izuku!

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:26.920
For real? What are the odds!

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:32.467
Judging by the performance,
they haven't learned much since then.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.430
Well, they are still students.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.224
You did well.

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.768
Hawks, you are dismissed now.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.901
<i>I worked myself hard</i>
<i>so I wouldn't give out any SOS signal.</i>

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:52.821
<i>My feathers can analyze</i>
<i>the types of sounds</i>

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.781
<i>based on their vibrations.</i>

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:57.158
<i>I can hear everything.</i>

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.327
Are you sure about this, Spinner?

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.330
Yes, keep the warriors' morale high.

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:04.374
We're finally making a move.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.210
Four months from now…

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.173
Everything will be razed by Tomura.

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.933
<i>Four months from now…</i>

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.153 line:20%

<i>How many heroes are working in the dark?</i>

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.520
<i>What is Shigaraki trying to achieve?</i>

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.024 line:20%
<i>I can't move freely.</i>

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.612
<i>Retracting my wings will greatly reduce</i>
<i>the hearing range.</i>

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:43.533
<i>I still can't get hold</i>
<i>of the key information.</i>

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.661
<i>It will be too late when I do.</i>

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:51.207
<i>"Before that,</i>

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.132
<i>Is Hawks working as an undercover</i>
<i>within the enemy's rank?</i>

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.342
You cannot go in there.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.512
But I want to check out the cafeteria.

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.763
You cannot go in there.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.057
Okay, I got it.

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:12.395
<i>If the heroes have this place surrounded…</i>

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.190 line:20%
<i>No, I need the quickest plan possible.</i>

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:20.486
<i>I need to know their exact number</i>
<i>and their hideouts across the country.</i>

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:27.160
<i>All the heroes siding with them</i>
<i>will be taken out once and for all.</i>

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.831
<i>If I failed,</i>
<i>some villains might slip away,</i>

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:34.125

<i>"If I fail,</i>

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.467

<i>their number…"</i>

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:54.062
Is this why you asked us to come here?

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.104
Yes.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.399
Please give the students
more opportunities to fight the enemies.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.527
That should help
with your self-development as well.

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:06.115
Hone their skills to the limits
with this internship, Endeavor.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:10.495
<i>The Commission and Hawks</i>

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:15.083
<i>got a glimpse at the enemy</i>
<i>and the covert operation is now ongoing.</i>

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:16.584
<i>Which means…</i>

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.338
<i>They are using this internship</i>
<i>as a precaution.</i>

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.384
<i>Seriously, I question</i>
<i>the morality of this.</i>

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.346 line:20%
<i>How could they use the students</i>
<i>as insurance for our failure?</i>

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.350
However,

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:35.686 line:20%
Endeavor is only interested
in mentoring Shoto.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.648
So you two will be following me.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.274 line:20%
What was that?

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.527 line:20%
I only came here to see
the No. 1 Hero in action!

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.569 line:20%
You still can!

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.071 line:20%
Kacchan, calm down a little.

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:47.782 line:20%
This is different from what I expected.

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:49.450
I'll talk to him.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.039 line:20%
<i>This internship serves as a precaution.</i>

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.918
<i>Give me a break.</i>
<i>I can't really agree with this.</i>

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.170
<i>But for the time being…</i>

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.380
Shoto.

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:03.464
Deku.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:04.799
Bakugo.

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:08.052 line:20%
I'll be your mentor.

00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:15.476
Judging by the performance,
they haven't learned much since then.

00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:19.355
<i>I'm glad you're underestimating them.</i>

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.733
<i>It was worth it to steal that takedown.</i>

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.069
<i>Even without me,</i>

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.822
<i>they would have handled it just fine.</i>

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:32.618
I never wanted to be a mentor.

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:37.206
<i>But his determination to catch up</i>
<i>has inspired me and changed my mind.</i>

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:41.878 line:20%
<i>Tsukuyomi, thank you for coming here.</i>

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.089
<i>You're a strong one.</i>

00:07:45.673 --> 00:07:47.842
<i>Your friends are just as strong.</i>

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.219
<i>They are still growing by the day.</i>

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.722
RAMEN SHOP

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.099

<i>The villains will never get away</i>
<i>with their scheme.</i>

00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:26.214
<i>I'll make sure everyone</i>
<i>has a smile on their face</i>

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.177

<i>of cherry blossoms ends!</i>

CONTROLS THE FLAME OF HER HAIR

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.358
I'll be your mentor.

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:46.901
But before we start…

00:08:46.984 --> 00:08:50.446
Deku, Bakugo,
I need to know more about you.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.448
What are your thoughts
about the current issues

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.784
and what do you expect to learn?

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:57.954
I want to have total control
over my power.

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:01.040
I hope to have
the best performance in mobility.

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:06.087
Your Quirk is powerful enough
to destroy your own body, am I right?

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.630
Yes.

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:11.092
But I've found a way to use it
without causing damage to myself.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.219
However…

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.180
Well, as of now…

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.015
How should I put it?

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.476
There seems to be some additional…

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.563
Some sort of power
has manifested in a different form.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:24.605
Show me.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.820
With my full concentration,
this is the most I can conjure

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.947
without losing control.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:36.909
With the slightest error,
it goes on a rampage.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.079
What do you mean,
it's the best you can do with it?

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:41.998
How do you plan to use it?

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.792
It's a power that acts
like a flexible whip.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.753
I want to use it as a weapon
and not treat it as a threat.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:52.717
I'm thinking of some way
to integrate it with my Air Force.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.969
Air Force is a ranged attack.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.805
<i>I use it by creating air blasts.</i>

00:09:57.888 --> 00:10:02.351
<i>But the attack itself exerts more strain</i>
<i>than what my body can take on.</i>

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:08.983 line:20%
If my current output without any strain
was around 10% to 15%,

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:11.569 line:20%
Air Force would require an output of 20%.

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:12.862 line:20%
It's a little too much for me.

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.572 line:20%
I may not get any injuries in that state,

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:16.365 line:20%
but it would hurt
as if I got hit by a truck.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.658 line:20%
That would affect my mobility.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:21.787 line:20%
I've been training so I can make
instant adjustments to put it to a halt.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.081 line:20%
If I could use the same method
to control the whips,

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.000 line:20%
I could use them in battles.

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:28.544 line:20%
But I am already adjusting as I fight,

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:32.256 line:20%
with another thing to monitor,
my brain can't handle the calculations.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.635 line:20%
So I trained to monitor
all aspects as I fight.

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:36.802 line:20%
It hasn't gone too well.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.472
It's so lengthy and boring,
I don't understand it at all!

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:41.098
Was that a self-analysis?

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.808
You're too loud.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.644
Which means you hope to learn

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:48.064
how to make instantaneous
and nuanced adjustments during battles.

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:48.981
Yes.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.984 line:20%
He actually understood!
The No. 1 Hero sure is amazing!

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:55.780
I've seen your success.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.074
That's a wonderful Quirk.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.369
A strong blast
with just the flick of a finger.

00:11:01.952 --> 00:11:07.083 line:20%
Just the power alone
could rival All Might.

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:16.008
You have quite a troublesome Quirk.

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.512
It seems like you're just like us.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.514
What?

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.099
Now what about you?

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:26.936
Unlike him,
I came here to learn what I can't do.

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.397
I like your hubris!

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.564
Shut it.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.441
Don't you have a better place to be?

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.318
I'm on standby.

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.445
I meant what I said.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:42.576
I can do anything I want
with my explosions.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:47.540
<i>I can be incredible with only this Quirk.</i>

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:55.548
<i>But I realized it took more than</i>
<i>sheer might to become powerful.</i>

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:04.807
I'm here to find out what I lack
to surpass the No. 1 Hero.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.354
<i>This kid…</i>

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.232
Very well.

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:14.650
Let's get working.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.235
May I say something?

00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:19.029
Shoto, you're here
to master Flashfire Fist!

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:26.454
I've been using my right side to practice
my Quirk like the way you had taught me.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.167
It all seems so boring now.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.545
All I ever thought about
was going against you.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.131
But after I met them at U.A. High,

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:41.177
after we had spent time living together
and competing against each other,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.595
my eyes were open.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:49.268
Endeavor, in the end, I'm still following
the method you intended.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.605
<i>That attack might still work now,</i>

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:54.690
<i>but it will soon reach its limit.</i>

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.735
Come to me after you graduate.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.405
I'll let you walk
down the road of the mighty.

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:04.158
But I want you to keep this in mind.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:06.452
<i>The person I look up to</i>

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:10.623
<i>is the man who showed up on the screen</i>
<i>when Mom and I were watching TV.</i>

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:16.545
As a future hero and to become a hero,

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.423
I've made it this far with my will.

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:22.885 line:20%
I'm only here for myself.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:26.096 line:20%
I'm sorry you have
to hear that, No. 1 Hero.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.558
So please stop acting like
you're my father in front of my friends.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:35.272
I'll admit Endeavor is a spectacular hero.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.441
There's no doubt about it.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:42.530
<i>Even now, I still can't forgive you</i>
<i>for what you did to Mom.</i>

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.950
I want to see what steps

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:49.119
you'll take as a father.

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:58.212
<i>Because he requested</i>
<i>to have his internship here,</i>

00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:00.881
<i>I thought he finally opened up to me.</i>

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.551
<i>How could I make such a foolish mistake?</i>

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:06.679
Fine. I get it.

00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:11.308
From now on,
I'll start treating you as heroes.

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:18.023
<i>Rescue missions, evacuations,</i>
<i>and fending off enemies.</i>

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:21.443
<i>These are the three main duties of a hero.</i>

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:25.239 line:20%
<i>We normally choose either</i>
<i>rescue or defense as the main objective</i>

00:14:25.322 --> 00:14:26.782 line:20%
<i>and let the agency handle it.</i>

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.952
But my objective is to complete
all of the three aspects.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.954
I know my area of jurisdiction in and out.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:34.415
Not a single suspicious noise
escapes my ears.

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:37.877
I'll arrive at the scene
wherever there is an emergency.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.214
To keep the situation from escalating,
I use my heat to ward off any crowds.

00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:44.466
Those are the basics.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.219
It's parallel thinking and swift actions.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.221
I must be able to do it on demand.

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.640
<i>Parallel thinking.</i>

00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:54.643
The point is accumulation.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.271
<i>You accumulate your training at U.A. High.</i>

00:14:57.354 --> 00:15:00.190
<i>You come here to accumulate experience.</i>

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:02.318 line:20%
Every bit matters.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:06.113 line:20%
All three of you will get your answers
through experience.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.908
Before the winter ends,

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:11.702
try to take down a villain before I do.

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.331
Hold on!

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.999
The reaction time is too short.

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.086
<i>It's not that I don't feel anxious.</i>

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.882
<i>I only got One For All when I was 15.</i>

00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:29.428 line:20%
<i>When everyone</i>
<i>was figuring out their future,</i>

00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.431
<i>I had just taken my first step.</i>

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:36.310
<i>After I learned to control</i>
<i>One For All: Full Cowl,</i>

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:39.438
<i>I managed to make my body use</i>
<i>this power subconsciously.</i>

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:43.359
Listen closely, young man.

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:47.029
Six more Quirks will manifest
in you in the future.

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:50.324
<i>I must learn the way to use it</i>
<i>as my extension.</i>

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:54.078
<i>The culprit passed the crossroad</i>
<i>and is now heading east.</i>

00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:55.079
Roger.

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:58.374
He's still accelerating!

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.376
He made a turn.

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:12.805
Oh, god!

00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:16.517
That hurts!

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.102
We apprehended the culprit.

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:19.728
You're too slow!

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:23.273
It takes more time
to fly the gear in winter.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:25.484
Bakugo, did you notice it?

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:26.402 line:20%
FRUSTRATION

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.947 line:20%
There's no way you noticed it
and I didn't.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.740 line:20%
Come on. Let's hear it.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.575
<i>He's so petty.</i>

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:37.538
He releases flame from under his feet
when he thrusts forward.

00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:40.416 line:20%
<i>He used Jet Burn</i>
<i>against that Nomu in Kyushu.</i>

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.836
<i>I think he compressed the flame</i>
<i>and used it as a thruster.</i>

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:49.091
<i>I would know because I have his Quirk.</i>

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:52.094
<i>The speed in which he heated up,</i>

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:55.097
<i>and the fine control he had over it…</i>

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.558
That's just a carbon copy of my explosion.

00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:59.935
What took you so long to notice it?

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:03.355
Indeed. It took me quite a while.

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.315
There's one more thing you should know.

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.484
This is the main road.

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:08.694
He's right.

00:17:08.777 --> 00:17:13.073 line:20%
He used his flame to intimidate
the culprit and cut off the escape route.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.576
Hurry up.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:17.036
We can handle it here.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.874
You rarely see him mentor
anyone other than Shoto.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.919 line:20%
We'll catch up later.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.006
<i>Using my flame as thruster…</i>

00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:32.384
<i>I lost control!</i>

00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:36.055
Aren't you going to work
with the sidekicks?

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:40.100
I let Hawks handle
some of the fighting in Kyushu.

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:45.439
But a hero should be able to accomplish
anything with their own strength.

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:47.316
By the way,

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:51.612 line:20%
I noticed the crow guy's henchman as well!

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:52.780
Don't be so petty!

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:54.073
<i>Kacchan!</i>

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:55.616
Bakugo.

00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:58.452 line:20%
You want to know what you lack,
am I right?

00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:02.581
You have excellent
and near-perfect mobility

00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:04.416
for a rookie.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.962
But you should realize by now
that you can never outrun me.

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.506
I need some preparation in winter.

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:13.675
Are you going to use the same excuse
when you fall behind?

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:16.678
You're not here for a lesson.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:21.183 line:20%
If you don't make it in time,
you don't lose points,

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.353
people might lose their lives.

00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:27.773
Are you hurt?

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:29.483
I'm all right.

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:31.693
Shoto. Bakugo.

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:34.822
I have a question for both of you.

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:37.783
Why do you keep setting me up with him?

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.577
Is this about the Flashfire Fist?

00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:42.704
Charge up before releasing.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.540
Condense the power.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:47.459
Unleash your maximum output in an instant

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.212
and tap-release the thrust.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:55.134
Choose either one and keep practicing
until you manage to do it subconsciously.

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:57.761 line:20%
Kacchan, it's just like your AP Shot!

00:18:57.845 --> 00:19:00.097 line:20%
How did you know so much?

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.141 line:20%
Stay away from me!

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:04.351
Shoto is still developing
these two skills.

00:19:04.434 --> 00:19:06.436
Practice the tap-release first.

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.566 line:20%
<i>You can control</i>
<i>the shape of the ice you make.</i>

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:14.111
Use the same concept
on your flame as well.

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:20.325
Deku, you're able to increase
your power instantaneously.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:21.243
Am I right?

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.161
Yes.

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.663
Can you do it subconsciously?

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:25.914
Sure.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.583
I can do it with Full Cowl.

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:30.252 line:20%
But I have to concentrate
while using it with Air Force.

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:34.381 line:20%
So first, you must learn how to use
your Air Force subconsciously.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.009 line:20%
Leave the secondary power aside for now.

00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:41.180
What about the parallel thinking?

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:42.639
All and all,

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:48.228
people can subconsciously manage
several tasks at the same time.

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.773
Look at the man who's driving his car.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.693
He wasn't born with the skill to drive.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.988
He controls the steering wheel,
brake, and throttle.

00:19:58.071 --> 00:20:00.115
He checks the car behind
and in front of him.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.492
<i>He learned the skill one step at a time.</i>

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.829
And eventually,
he can do it subconsciously.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.168 line:20%
First, try to do two tasks subconsciously.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.588 line:20%
For the next stage,
you must do three at the same time.

00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:17.966
Whatever formidable power you have,

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.969 line:20%
you need constant and steady effort
to master the basics.

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.557
There is always an exception.

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:30.729
<i>But unless you're a prodigy,</i>
<i>you must go one step at a time.</i>

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.899
<i>At least that's the way I know.</i>

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.610 line:20%
The same training

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:40.739 line:20%
gives you different results
when you're in school and a real battle.

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.533
Now you have
the best learning environment.

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:47.663
Make your body adjust to the skills
you've learned in school.

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:50.999
<i>I…</i>

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:55.545 line:20%
<i>I've learned so much from All Might.</i>

00:20:57.005 --> 00:21:00.717 line:20%
<i>I've gained much experience</i>
<i>since I went to U.A. High.</i>

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:06.682
<i>The blazing speed almost got</i>
<i>the better of me.</i>

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:10.978
<i>But I must…</i>

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:15.274
Don't worry and feel free
to embrace any defeat.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:18.151
With the strength you three possess,
whatever result you deliver

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:22.364
won't get in the way
of the mighty Endeavor's job!

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.827
<i>That's right. Keep moving forward.</i>

00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:31.081
<i>With the greatest speed I have,</i>

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:34.543
<i>I must go beyond.</i>

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:37.212
<i>One step at a time.</i>

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.839
<i>Onward!</i>

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:18.855
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:25.070
<i>Uraraka and Asui have received</i>
<i>a co-op request from Ryukyu's agency.</i>

00:23:25.153 --> 00:23:28.323
<i>The request came</i>
<i>from Sea Rescue Hero: Selkie.</i>

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:31.743
<i>The objective is to capture</i>
<i>the smuggling ship.</i>

00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:35.205
<i>Stay frosty, Uraraka and Asui.</i>

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:38.333 line:20%
<i>Next episode, "Long Time No See, Selkie."</i>

00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:41.294
<i>A hero will never give up.</i>

00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:42.879
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:44.423
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
