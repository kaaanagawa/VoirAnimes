WEBVTT

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:04.504
-Hey!
-What?

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:08.341
You all seem very relaxed.

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.760
Are we not worthy enough for you?

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.763
Bring it on, Class A!

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.974
Let's settle the score today!

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.726
CLASS A VS CLASS B

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:26.276
<i>The Hero Course of U.A. High</i>
<i>Class A and Class B</i>

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.528
<i>are in a joint training battle.</i>

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.864
<i>In the first battle,</i>

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.661
<i>Shinso's Quirk successfully disrupted</i>
<i>the coordination of Class B,</i>

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.122
<i>securing victory for Class A.</i>

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.503
Very well, let's go!

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:46.504
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.259
Please scout ahead for us, Tokoyami.

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:53.344 line:20%
Roger. Dark Shadow.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:54.846
Yes!

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.765
Report back
as soon as you spot the enemies.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:57.891
Leave it to me!

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.354
<i>The second battle has begun.</i>

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.526 line:20%
I'll be right back.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:10.737
Everyone, scatter!

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:17.243 line:20%
<i>The surprise attack from Kuroiro</i>
<i>of Class B caught Class A off guard.</i>

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:22.082
Help!

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:27.462
<i>But Tokoyami countered with his new move,</i>
<i>"Black Fallen Angel."</i>

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.384
<i>The battle is now seesawing</i>
<i>between the two teams.</i>

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.136 line:20%
Navel Buffet!

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:13.902 line:20%
I found him, Hagakure!

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.821
Yes, I'll get him this time!

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:20.200
-That's as far as you can get.
-There is nowhere to run.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.119 line:20%
We didn't expect you to operate solo.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.206 line:20%
But every unexpected outcome

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.667 line:20%
is already within my expectation!

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.212 line:20%
You saw this coming.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.379 line:20%
Stop right there!

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.839
Surrender!

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:39.344
Mushrooms!

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.430 line:20%
I knew it.

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.391
<i>Kendo anticipated your expectations!</i>

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.145 line:20%
<i>Just as Kendo foresaw.</i>

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.815
If I see the light,
that means Kuroiro's plan A failed.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.153
Plan B commences.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.698
You'll all be covered in mushrooms.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.250
No!

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.461
People can see me with these mushrooms!
This is embarrassing!

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.552 line:20%
The reproductive power is incredible!

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.764 line:20%
Mushrooms have covered the whole field.

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:26.516
I can't see Kuroiro.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.558
This is…

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.602
It must be Class B's tactic.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.940
Black wood cauliflower mushrooms!

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.984
Yellow knight mushrooms!

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.655
Enoki mushrooms.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:42.490
Inky cap mushrooms!

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:44.617
Grow!

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.704
Mesmerize the world with your charm!

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:48.997 line:20%
<i>Kinoko Komori.</i>

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.040 line:20%
<i>Hero name: Shemage.</i>

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.542 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Mushroom.</i>

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:56.713 line:20%
<i>She can spread fungus spores</i>
<i>from her body.</i>

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:59.590 line:20%
<i>The spores spread better</i>
<i>in humid environments!</i>

00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:03.594
The mushrooms can even grow on people?

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.596 line:20%
This is like a horror movie!

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.516 line:20%
Her mushrooms will disappear
after two to three hours.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.226
There won't be any side effects.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.896
<i>This is also why she has a bad habit</i>
<i>of spreading the spores everywhere.</i>

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.566 line:20%
The mushrooms are growing on the cameras!

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:17.692 line:20%
This is so gross.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.369
Our Plan A is to take control
of Dark Shadow

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:29.662
to launch a surprise attack.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:34.459
Our opponents will definitely
send Dark Shadow after us.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.919
The is a low-risk
yet highly efficient tactic.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:42.175
<i>They would never expect Kuroiro's improved</i>
<i>Quirk can take control of Dark Shadow.</i>

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.677
<i>That will be our chance</i>
<i>to capture one of them.</i>

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.346
Help!

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.681
It's easier said than done.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.058
Nice speech.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.726
What if I failed?

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.311
Wouldn't that put us at risk?

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:58.524 line:20%
The opponent must use light
to counter your Quirk.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:02.111
<i>We can locate them</i>
<i>with the light they emit.</i>

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.865
<i>When they unleash the light,</i>
<i>Dark Shadow can't attack violently.</i>

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.700 line:20%
<i>Even if Kuroiro failed,</i>

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.244 line:20%
<i>we would be able to surround</i>
<i>and take them out.</i>

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.456
<i>Plan A failed.</i>

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.501
<i>It's time to retreat for now.</i>

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.879
<i>Let's put Plan B into motion.</i>

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.382
<i>I'm counting on you, Kinoko!</i>

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.553
The mushrooms keep popping up!

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.514
This is driving me crazy!

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.475
<i>Judging by their two-phase combo,</i>

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:34.936
<i>they anticipated our tactic</i>
<i>to counter Kuroiro.</i>

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.729
<i>Impressive, Kendo.</i>

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.856
Everyone, calm down.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.400
Let's regroup for now.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.154
Ka-boom! Bang! Blam! Bonk!

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.075
What?

00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:50.159
This is…

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.498
Something is coming out!

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.959
I'm so amazing.

00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:00.962
The impact of that effect
manifested perfectly!

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:03.339
My spirit is all fired up!

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.465
Burp!

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.384 line:20%
<i>Class B, Manga Fukidashi.</i>

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:08.219 line:20%
<i>Hero Name: Comicman.</i>

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:09.720 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Comic.</i>

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:12.765 line:20%
<i>He can materialize words</i>
<i>used in speech bubbles in midair</i>

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.475 line:20%
<i>simply by speaking them.</i>

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:18.479 line:20%
<i>He can even manipulate the effect</i>
<i>by using different onomatopoeia.</i>

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.567
Pop! Thud!

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.407
What is going on?

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.618
Yao-Momo! Where are you?

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.707
My laser has no effect on it.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:43.004
Jimejime…

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:44.672
What is this?

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:46.340
Jimejime?

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:50.428
No! It's a humidifier!

00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:52.388
More mushrooms are growing on me!

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.599
They are everywhere!

00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:56.100
Invisible Girl!

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.351
This is disgusting.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:02.565
Komori and Fukidashi
saved Kuroiro from his predicament.

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:06.903
Their continuous long-range attack
is putting Class A in a tight spot!

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.405 line:20%
This is Class B's true potential!

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.782
Stop your bias broadcast!

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.117 line:20%
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.953 line:20%
They must deal with two opponents
with long-range attacks.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.205 line:20%
Not to mention…

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.416
Can Fukidashi use his Quirk
in foreign languages?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.501
Who knows?

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.127 line:20%
Deku, look!

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:28.090 line:20%
That wall isolated Yaoyorozu
from her teammates.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.134
Could it be…

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.094
This is what they have been after!

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:35.264
<i>I'm isolated.</i>

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:39.477
<i>Their true target is…</i>

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.856
<i>We cornered the master strategist.</i>

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.275
Now is the time
to fight with all we've got!

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.037
<i>She crushed the tungsten shield so easily.</i>

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.499 line:20%
<i>Class B, Itsuka Kendo.</i>

00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:03.668 line:20%
<i>Hero Name: Battle Fist.</i>

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.169 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Big Fist.</i>

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.004 line:20%
<i>She can change the size of her fists.</i>

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:10.383 line:20%
<i>The bigger they become,</i>
<i>the more powerful they are!</i>

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:13.135
You won't even have time to react!

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:19.308
I can do this all day!

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:23.229
You can only create with matter
inside your body.

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:26.857
So you'll be the first to fall!

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:31.862
<i>I can't stop.</i>

00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:34.574
<i>It was the same during the sports day.</i>

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.326
<i>I must not give her the opening to think.</i>

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:40.371
<i>I'll overwhelm her with my raw might!</i>

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.877
<i>She gained the upper hand</i>
<i>in the blink of an eye!</i>

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.963 line:20%
She has the perfect strategy!

00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:53.092 line:20%
I told you! She is brilliant
and she makes calm judgments!

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.219
That's our beloved Kendo!

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.180 line:20%
We don't know that yet.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.515
What?

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:02.685
If they are restraining Yaoyorozu
by isolating her from the team,

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.145
it might be a miscalculation.

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:05.521
What?

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.482 line:20%
Yaoyorozu, you have something, right?

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.238
But even your plan didn't work,
so mine wouldn't…

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.032
Don't worry, and just say it!

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:19.660
I'm saying that
you're more qualified to do this!

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.830
When we voted on the class representative,
you had two votes, right?

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:25.291
<i>One of them was me!</i>

00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:28.419
Because I thought you would be
capable of things like that!

00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:35.092
I have it, Todoroki.

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:37.011
I have one.

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.431
A special operation to win!

00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:45.436
I had thought of this from the beginning.

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:48.564
If they want to restrain Yaoyorozu,

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:52.068
they should have taken her out
with an all-out attack.

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:56.614
<i>Maybe she had foreseen</i>
<i>the situation she is facing right now.</i>

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:07.249 line:20%
Yaoyorozu has the better Quirk and grades.
But people are comparing me to her.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.001
That really gets on my nerves.

00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:15.716 line:20%
<i>That is not true, Kendo.</i>
<i>That's far from being true.</i>

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.718 line:20%
<i>Even now, I'm still inexperienced.</i>

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:21.931
<i>But since you think so highly of me,</i>

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:25.017
<i>I can't show you</i>
<i>the vulnerable side of me.</i>

00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:28.187
Since she anticipated the situation,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.315 line:20%
she will have a way
to turn the battle around.

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.276
That's what she specializes in.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:41.075
<i>Momo.</i>

00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.494
<i>Show them the results of your training.</i>

00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:46.956 line:20%
<i>I'll show them how strong I've become!</i>

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.332
Are you kidding me?

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.835
She has a canon!

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.007
It takes quite a while
to build a weapon this massive!

00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.260
MOMO YAOYOROZU
QUIRK: CREATION

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:01.804
SHE CAN CREATE ANY OBJECT FROM HER BODY

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.055
ITSUKA KENDO
QUIRK: BIG FIST

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.808
SHE CAN WRAP A PERSON WITH BOTH HER HANDS

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:15.067 line:20%
I don't see Kuroiro anywhere.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.903 line:20%
I lost visuals on Hagakure too.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:21.115 line:20%
Should we regroup with Yaoyorozu
on the other side?

00:12:21.198 --> 00:12:22.491
Or should we…

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.455 line:20%
Can't Stop Twinkling!

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.875
Help!

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:34.587
Mushrooms…

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.339
What? Cursed fungi!

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.674
They got me!

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:39.800
Go!

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:40.885
BOUNCE
SWING

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.769
AHEM

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.521
My throat is starting to hurt.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.363
Invisible Girl!

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.201
<i>Not only did they isolate Yaoyorozu,</i>

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.077
<i>but they can also hide themselves</i>

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:10.498
<i>while using large-scale attacks</i>
<i>to surround us.</i>

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:12.041
<i>They are strong.</i>

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:14.168
<i>Strong and annoying.</i>

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:16.712
<i>Komori.</i>

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.714
<i>Fukidashi.</i>

00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:20.716
<i>Kuroiro.</i>

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:24.386 line:20%
<i>If we don't find out</i>
<i>where they are hiding,</i>

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.138
<i>the battle is basically over.</i>

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.849
<i>I must find a way to break through this.</i>

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:33.604
Are you kidding me?

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.273
She has a canon!

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:41.153 line:20%
It takes quite a while
to build a weapon this massive!

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:48.494 line:20%
Hey! She could kill someone
with that thing!

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.996 line:20%
She seems to like canons a lot.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.249
Is she really going to fire that thing?

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:54.917
No.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.215
<i>Is she bluffing?</i>

00:14:02.716 --> 00:14:04.635
<i>Will she tear down Fukidashi's wall?</i>

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.393
<i>I'm sorry if I startled you.</i>

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.312
That was too close!

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:18.816
<i>I have to expand my fists</i>
<i>before she fires the canon.</i>

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.901 line:20%
Double Jumbo Fist!

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.116
<i>She didn't use it on the wall.</i>

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:29.326
<i>What did she fire?</i>

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:33.914
<i>From the moment you closed in on us</i>
<i>for close-range combat,</i>

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:36.709
<i>perhaps I was already losing.</i>

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:42.339
<i>However, to secure our victory…</i>

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:47.803
<i>That sound…</i>

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.597
<i>It wasn't from Fukidashi.</i>

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.599
<i>It's from the other side of this wall.</i>

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.059
<i>That was…</i>

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:55.603
<i>Yaoyorozu!</i>

00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:57.313
Dark Shadow!

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:58.689
Roger!

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.029
<i>This is…</i>

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.700
Hi, Komori.

00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:11.911
What was that? I didn't catch that.

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:15.706
I caught him.

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:17.541
<i>I caught Aoyama.</i>

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:21.086
Nicely done, Kuroiro!

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.756
I'm counting on you
to capture the rest of them.

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.174
Yes.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.260
Well done, Kuroiro.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:31.597
Our enemies have no idea where we are.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.183
We'll keep pushing with my mushrooms.

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.101
Okay.

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:41.607
Hey, Komori.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.484
Mushroom?

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.448
Class A shouldn't know
where we are, right?

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.541
<i>Night-vision goggles.</i>

00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:04.213
<i>I can see how they are spying on us.</i>

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:07.049
<i>When you stare into the abyss,</i>

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:10.177
<i>it's staring right back at you!</i>

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.014
Lucky Bag?

00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:15.891
Like a gift bag?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.184
I can hold this.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.187
These are…

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.649
Goggles and ethanol?

00:16:23.732 --> 00:16:25.609
And a disinfectant spray?

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:29.822
Judging by the design of these goggles,
I think they are meant for you.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.493
<i>She sent a message</i>
<i>without using a single word.</i>

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:36.578
Everyone, calm down.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.288
<i>Let's regroup for now.</i>

00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:42.584
<i>Yaoyorozu, did you foresee this…</i>

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.545
<i>all the way back then?</i>

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:48.090
Oh, no!

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:51.927
Tokoyami is coming this way!

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.679
I'm right here for you.

00:16:53.762 --> 00:16:54.888 line:20%
STARTLED

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:59.143
I was curious why the mushrooms
don't grow on your team.

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:01.145
So you have already
disinfected yourselves.

00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:03.355
Where is she?

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:06.108
I'm not going to tell you!

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:09.319
WHERE IS SHE?

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:12.448
STOP IT

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.200
<i>There will be an opening</i>
<i>as long as I can locate them.</i>

00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:22.082
He is headed this way!

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:26.837
You will not escape the gust of wrath!

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:32.593
Just as Hawks taught me,

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.597 line:20%
speed will outshine raw power!

00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:42.478
Black Ankh!

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:44.813
Sabbath!

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.316
BLACK ANKH: SABBATH

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:49.401
Mushroom!

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:50.611
Komori!

00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:52.362
<i>He's fast!</i>

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.656
<i>No, I must hide in the shadows!</i>

00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:57.493 line:20%
Are you looking for darkness?

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:07.753
Why don't you use my cloak?

00:18:07.836 --> 00:18:09.797
Hey…

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.258
You're not a threat if you can't move.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.344
Fumikage, I got the girl!

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:19.389
Incredible!

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:21.141
He captured two of them at once.

00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:23.018
This is a comeback!

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.229
This is all thanks to Yao-Momo's items.

00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:26.188
Yes!

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:30.818
Hagakure has the upper hand as well.
They can win by outnumbering Kendo!

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:33.904
Dark Shadow, put them into jail…

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:39.034
Fumikage.

00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:42.037
Sorry.

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.873
I don't like this move,
so I've kept it a secret.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:48.919
But seeing our victory is at stake,
I have no choice but to use it.

00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:51.296 line:20%
<i>My throat…</i>

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:57.094
These are split gill mushrooms.
They attack your lungs.

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.764
<i>Komori is not a powerful combatant,</i>

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.850 line:20%
but she is a force to be reckoned with.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:06.687 line:20%
You got sloppy thinking
this is merely training, Tokoyami.

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.690
<i>You should have knocked her out first.</i>

00:19:10.357 --> 00:19:13.110
Eat this!

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:16.113
I can't see anything!
This is so confusing!

00:19:16.196 --> 00:19:20.242
<i>I must defeat Fukidashi,</i>
<i>so I can aid my friends!</i>

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:23.954
<i>Tokoyami and Yao-Momo might be in danger!</i>

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:28.667
<i>Invisible Girl, you're invincible!</i>

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.003
THAT HURT

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.885
I'm sorry for being late.

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:41.847
Kendo, you saved me.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.893
What's with that?

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:49.730
Don't worry. I knocked her out.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.690
But she got the better of me.

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:55.986
She tied herself to me
along with the canon.

00:19:56.653 --> 00:19:58.947
That makes it hard for me to move.

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:04.411
Everything she creates
is based on her foresight.

00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:06.580
I just can't defeat her.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.464 line:20%
You saved us both, Komori.

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:18.217 line:20%
It's only natural to help a friend.

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:21.887 line:20%
Kendo, Fukidashi, are you all right?

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.847
I think so.

00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:29.770 line:20%
Fumikage!

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.023
Komori, you used that spore?

00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:35.359
We would have lost had I not used it.

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.361
Indeed.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.531
Class A is formidable indeed.

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.742
They are very strong.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:48.872
You bring honor to Class B, Kendo!

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.457
Great!

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:54.461
Yaoyorozu, I hope you don't
get depressed over this.

00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:58.632 line:20%
Yaoyorozu could make a great leader.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:02.719
I feel so satisfied with their display
of Plus Ultra spirit.

00:21:03.553 --> 00:21:05.264
<i>They lost the battle,</i>

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:11.478
<i>but with Tokoyami's new move</i>
<i>and Yaoyorozu's foresight for battle,</i>

00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:15.190
<i>I can see you've grown much over time.</i>

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.860 line:20%
<i>You've taken another step forward.</i>

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.321
<i>One step closer to your dream…</i>

00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:24.574
<i>One step closer…</i>

00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:28.620
<i>-…of becoming a hero!</i>
<i>-to becoming a hero!</i>

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.002 line:20%
WELCOME

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:36.253 line:20%
<i>In the second battle,</i>

00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:39.673
<i>Class B won with a score of 4-0!</i>

00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:42.551
Well done, Class B! Congratulations!

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:44.469
Stop your bias broadcast!

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:45.804
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:49.182 line:20%
Congratulations!

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.359
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:25.862
<i>It's the battle</i>
<i>between Class A and Class B.</i>

00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:29.449 line:20%
<i>With both teams winning one battle,</i>
<i>the third battle is about to begin.</i>

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:33.286 line:20%
<i>With Iida's speed</i>
<i>and Todoroki's powerful Quirk,</i>

00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:36.123 line:20%
<i>they should have the advantage</i>
<i>in this battle.</i>

00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:38.667
<i>Fight on, Class A.</i>

00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:41.545
<i>Next episode, "Match 3!"</i>

00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:45.340 line:20%
<i>Class B will shine even brighter</i>
<i>with Honenuki's flexibility.</i>

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:47.092
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:47.175 --> 00:23:48.760
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
