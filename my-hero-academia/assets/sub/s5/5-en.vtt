WEBVTT

00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:01.960
CLASS A VS CLASS B

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:08.174
<i>The Hero Course of U.A. High</i>
<i>Class A and Class B</i>

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.760 line:20%
<i>are in a joint training battle.</i>

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.350
<i>In the first battle,</i>

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:21.354
<i>Shinso's Quirk successfully disrupted</i>
<i>the coordination of Class B.</i>

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.025
<i>The battle ended with Class A victorious.</i>

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:32.866
WELCOME

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:03.748 line:20%
SHOTA AIZAWA

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.209 line:20%
What have you learned
from the first battle?

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.545
If the opponents
are avoiding a fight with me,

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.797
my Quirk is basically useless
in the battle.

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.133
<i>If that were a real battle with villains,</i>

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:16.427 line:20%
Shiozaki would have
finished me off instantly.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.223 line:20%
I must learn how to order insects
with greater precision.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.308 line:20%
I did a great job, didn't I?

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.602 line:20%
I bet you are all awestruck,
but that's okay!

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:29.023
I know it's hard to control the urge
to fall in love with me.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.525
No sweat!

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:34.737 line:20%
I lost Koda and Kirishima
when the battle began.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.448 line:20%
I wanted to win
without losing any teammates.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:38.783 line:20%
But I messed up so badly.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.034 line:20%
The binding cloth…

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.161 line:20%
What?

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.164 line:20%
I failed to put the tool Mr. Aizawa
gave me to good use.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.040 line:20%
That was unacceptable.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.751
It wouldn't be so challenging
if it were easy to use.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.463
It took me six years
to finally master this tool.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.924
Don't be sorry, just be better.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.552
Yes.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:01.222 line:20%
The two who went to the internship
are very strict with themselves.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.141 line:20%
That is only natural.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.518 line:20%
Shie Hassaikai, wasn't it?

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.189
<i>I heard it was</i>
<i>an impossible battle to win.</i>

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.274
<i>They actually pulled through that fight.</i>

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.152
Even if this is only a training battle,

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.988 line:20%
their attitude and motivation
are undoubtedly different.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.115
Compared to that,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.785
Jamming-way's outstanding performance
was a genuine surprise.

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.579
Listen up!

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:29.334
Kirishima, you must learn how to bait
your opponent into battling you head-on.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.376
Yes.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.003
Koda, it's as you said earlier,

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:34.756
you need more precision
in controlling the animals.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.218
Aside from a direct attack,
you must learn to take them by surprise.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.095
Kaminari, you got too complacent at first!

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.848 line:20%
Does this mean you can't do well
unless you lose your teammates?

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:44.849
Well…

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:45.934 line:20%
Asui.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:49.687 line:20%
Remember not to dwell on mistakes.
Instead, learn to recover from it quickly.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:50.730 line:20%
Yes, sir.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.733
Reflect on your mistake and utilize
the lesson for future training.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:54.692
That's all!

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:55.860
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:10.833
They won, but came to realize
their lack of experience.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.211
But they are not disheartened.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:19.008
They are already figuring out ways
to improve for the upcoming battles.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.593 line:20%
This is inspiring!

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.805 line:20%
Shinso's freshness is awesome!

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.473 line:20%
Hey, you…

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.892 line:20%
I'm pretty sure you are well aware of

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.728
why you failed.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.357 line:20%
Whether you played to Shishida's strength

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.818 line:20%
or played to Shiozaki's strength,

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.571
had you coordinated better,
you would have won easily!

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.324
Your glare is scaring us, Mr. Vlad King.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.494 line:20%
Shiozaki is too honest.

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:49.372 line:20%
Shishida, expecting her to lie
was your failure.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.165
Monoma…

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:55.003
It's true we allowed our opponents
too much time to get ready.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.255
Sorry, Shiozaki.

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:59.048
May the inferno incinerate you.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.885
However, that was
a great battle you put on.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.971
I couldn't wait to fight by his side.

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:06.681
Hey, Shinso!

00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:09.434
Let's compose a strategy that will
annihilate Class A and their pride!

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.145 line:20%
We'll make them shut up for good!

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:13.771 line:20%
We'll instill despair into their hearts!

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.648 line:20%
-He is so excited by himself.
-They will kneel…

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:19.193 line:20%
-We should come up with a strategy too.
-before Class B and surrender!

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:22.864
Let's list out the ideas
and tactics we have.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:23.781
Okay.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.242
Let's design a combo,
like an ultimate move!

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.244
We should brainstorm together.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.246
Todoroki should be
our main offensive strength.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.205
Me?

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.373
That's a sound plan.

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.584
Bakugo, we should discuss
our strategy as well.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.420 line:20%
You! Don't you dare slow me down!

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.464
He's loud as usual.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:43.843 line:20%
-We'll face Shinso in the fifth battle.
-Yes!

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:45.428
His voice is a threat to us all.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:50.058 line:20%
-Sticky Acid Flying Kick!
-What kind of ultimate move is that?

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.435
The field is full of obstacles,
making it easy to hide.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.062
Which means I can search more easily.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.146
You can count on me.

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.900
I'll come up with the plan!
I'll come up with a plan for my fight!

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:02.111 line:20%
Ida can be our trump card
during an emergency.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.363 line:20%
But before that,

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.407 line:20%
I must tell you about my Recipro moves.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.159
Instant Kill Swimming Orb!

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:09.994 line:20%
What kind of an attack is that?

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.372
<i>Injured combatants,</i>
<i>proceed to the infirmary.</i>

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.833
<i>Puny humans can't change</i>
<i>their damaged parts.</i>

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.753
This is it!

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:22.048
-The younglings' spring of freshness!
-But it's winter right now.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:26.719 line:20%
<i>It's already the end of the year.</i>

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:32.016 line:20%
<i>Everyone is doing their best to develop</i>
<i>their Quirks and ultimate moves.</i>

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.520 line:20%
<i>Young Midoriya has learned the ways</i>
<i>to use One For All.</i>

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:40.441 line:20%
<i>He can use Shoot Style and Air Force</i>
<i>for his attacks.</i>

00:06:41.275 --> 00:06:43.486
<i>He's earned his provisional license.</i>

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:47.156
<i>He's battled the villains</i>
<i>of Shie Hassaikai.</i>

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:51.244
<i>And the school festival as well.</i>

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:59.293 line:20%
<i>With every event and obstacle</i>
<i>that came to pass, he grows stronger.</i>

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:06.008
<i>This is his chance to test</i>
<i>his strength against others'.</i>

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.511
<i>He will learn what his place is as of now.</i>

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.392
<i>This training will serve as a lesson</i>
<i>that covers all aspects.</i>

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:17.103
All Might.

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.397
How was Shinso's performance?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.481
Not bad.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.276
He doesn't falter at all.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.989
The fact it's hard for him to accept
his defeat deserves a compliment.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:32.660
This is the entrance exam for him
to transfer to Hero Course.

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:36.164
I believe he will give his best
for the next battle.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.708
Vlad, commence the next battle.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.668
Well…

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:45.965
Second battle,

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:48.259
get ready!

00:07:58.102 --> 00:07:59.520
Yaoyorozu.

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.230
What is it, Kendo?

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.317
Why didn't you join the pageant contest
during the school festival?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.027
I thought you would join for sure.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.823 line:20%
That was because Mr. Aizawa
didn't tell me about the contest.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:14.660
We were too busy practicing
our band performance too.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:19.165
Perhaps Mr. Aizawa
didn't think I needed to participate.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:21.167 line:20%
I see.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.170 line:20%
After we filmed the advertisement
during that workplace training,

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:28.257 line:20%
<i>we've always been seen as a pair.</i>

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.968
<i>This must be the "pair pushing."</i>

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:32.929
Pair pushing?

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.015
Pair pushing means

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:38.643
everyone likes it no matter what.

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:40.728 line:20%
During the school festival,

00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:44.232 line:20%
people kept saying your names together,
"Yaoyorozu-Kendo!"

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.484
That did happen.

00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:49.695 line:20%
Idol worshiping.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.614
How should I put it?

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:56.452
Yaoyorozu has the better Quirk and grades.
But people are comparing me to her.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.287
That really gets on my nerves.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:02.083
I've personally been looking forward
to fighting you.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.378
I humbly…

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:07.463
accept your challenge.

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:09.423
Tokoyami.

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:13.261
You and I are the same.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.137
Shihai Kuroiro.

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:18.057
Your Quirk is Black,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.477
you can move freely
in dark objects, am I right?

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:28.150
Our rivalry is destined.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.527
Really?

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.196
I see. You can read the abyss as well.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.991
Stay in eternal darkness.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.244
They really don't shine at all.

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:42.999
Both teams are ready.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.251
Well then…

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.045 line:20%
All the best, Team Kendo!

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.131
Second battle, start!

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:52.091 line:20%
Please stop this bias broadcast!

00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:53.759 line:20%
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.220
Very well, let's go!

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:57.388 line:20%
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:01.392
What is Kendo's role in Class B?

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.686
Kendo is amazing!

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.146
You're speaking too loud!

00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:07.690 line:20%
After all,
she is our class representative!

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:11.068 line:20%
Her mind works fast and she keeps calm
when she makes judgments!

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.739
<i>She has the courage to step forward</i>
<i>when time calls for it!</i>

00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:18.075
<i>Her cheerful demeanor brings</i>
<i>our class together!</i>

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:22.496 line:20%
Without her, the entire Class B
would have sided with Monoma!

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.914 line:20%
Hey, don't say that so loudly.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.374
<i>The big sister of Class B!</i>

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.753
<i>That's right. It's Itsuka Kendo!</i>

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.757 line:20%
Can Yaoyorozu's operation be
executed successfully in this battle?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.300
What operation?

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:39.055
Please scout ahead for us, Tokoyami.

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:41.140 line:20%
Roger. Dark Shadow.

00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:42.600
Yes!

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:44.518
Report back
as soon as you spot the enemies.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:45.603
Leave it to me!

00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:55.363
I basically know all about their Quirks.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:58.491
But I have no idea what new moves
they have come up with.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:00.534
That might lead to our defeat.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.411
Which is why…

00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:05.414
we'll have to see how it goes first.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.710
Dark Shadow seems
to have found our enemies.

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:11.921
It's right under that chimney.

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.464
Let's head over there.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:19.053
You're getting no time to think!

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.806
I'll deal with the weak ones first!

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:24.266
I'm counting on you, Kuroiro!

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.731 line:20%
I'll be right back.

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.737
Dark Shadow went really far.

00:11:37.571 --> 00:11:39.990
Did you level up during your internship?

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:41.450
That's hard to tell.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.370 line:20%
The further Dark Shadow goes,
the harder it is to maintain its form.

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:45.955
He's back.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.040
What?

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.210
Everyone, scatter!

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:52.920
Tokoyami!

00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:55.047
What is going on?

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.842
Fumikage!

00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:02.388
We fell for their trap!

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.015
What's going on with Dark Shadow?

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.183
Did it go berserk?

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.143
No.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:10.938 line:20%
The field is bright enough for Tokoyami
to keep Dark Shadow under control.

00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:14.108
Is something else controlling Dark Shadow?

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:16.736
<i>It must be the Quirk</i>
<i>of someone from Class B!</i>

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.449
Wait!

00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.619
Hagakure, release your beam!

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:26.746
Yes!

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:30.541
Warp Refraction: Say Cheese!

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.340
Return, Dark Shadow!

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.219
Kuroiro came out from Dark Shadow!

00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:49.727
He disappeared!

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.771
He merged with the shadow.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.190
That's Kuroiro's Quirk.

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:58.402
<i>Class B, Shihai Kuroiro.</i>

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.029
<i>Quirk: Black.</i>

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.114
<i>He can merge with darkness,</i>

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.911
<i>and even move the object upon possession,</i>

00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:09.288
<i>but only if the object is movable.</i>

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.958
Fumikage Tokoyami.

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:16.712
I will take you out.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:21.967
You and I are destined to be rivals.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:24.345
I see, my rival.

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.472
Very well!

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:28.974
I will use the move I invented
when I worked with Hawks.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:30.976
Black Fallen Angel.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.729
Black Fallen Angel?

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.356 line:20%
Yes.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.983 line:20%
Black Fallen Angel.

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:41.862
FUMIKAGE TOKOYAMI

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.865
HE MANIFESTS A SHADOW INSIDE HIS BODY
THAT IS FLEXIBLE AND FIGHT HIS ENEMIES

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.033
HAWKS
QUIRK: FIERCE WINGS

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:48.869
ABLE TO MANIPULATE HIS FEATHERS
AND SHOOT THEM AS PROJECTILES

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.914 line:20%
A FEW MONTHS AGO IN KYUSHU

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:54.333 line:20%
<i>He always settles everything on his own.</i>

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:58.212
This is the real deal!

00:13:58.295 --> 00:13:59.588
Real diamonds!

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:03.175
These should fetch me
at least 300 million!

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.387
What? Oh, god!

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.847
I got you.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.306
Hawks!

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.349
HAWKS
QUIRK: FIERCE WINGS

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.310
You are too slow for me.

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:16.438
I heard that someone
is causing trouble at a bar in Cantina.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:17.731
I have to go there next.

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:21.694
I'll leave the cleaning up to you.

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.030
Tsukuyomi.

00:14:25.906 --> 00:14:28.951
I have to deal with this criminal.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:31.120
Hawks is simply too fast.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:34.665
This is the most efficient way to operate.

00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:35.749
I'll go after him.

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:36.917
Tsukuyomi!

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.503
He sure is full of spirit.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.301
<i>It was the first time Hawks took part</i>
<i>in nominating a student.</i>

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.140
<i>I was always running after him</i>
<i>during the workplace training,</i>

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.435
<i>constantly cleaning up</i>
<i>after he had completed the job.</i>

00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:58.981
<i>That raised a question for me.</i>

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.110
<i>If the damage spread</i>
<i>while my sidekicks were catching up,</i>

00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:04.361
<i>wouldn't that be unacceptable?</i>

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:05.404
<i>But…</i>

00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:08.532
Why did you nominate me?

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.200
Because we're both birds.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:13.287
You're joking, right?

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.456
No, there's a little truth in that.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:19.209
I need some information
from those in Class 1-A.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:22.630
<i>It's about the thugs</i>
<i>from League of Villains</i>

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.089
<i>that attacked your class.</i>

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.508
Since I've been looking for information,

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:30.095
I should get it from an outstanding
student who can catch up to me.

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:33.557
<i>So I chose the bird guy</i>

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.977 line:20%
<i>who has a fairly high ranking</i>
<i>during the sports festival.</i>

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:41.899 line:20%
I need to know more
about the USJ incident.

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:43.192 line:20%
What can you tell me?

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:48.656 line:20%
<i>When I was about to tell him</i>
<i>the details about the USJ attack,</i>

00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:51.325
<i>the unwillingness almost took over me.</i>

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:55.621
<i>I'm not a pigeon.</i>

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:01.251
<i>The workplace training ended</i>
<i>with me learning nothing at all.</i>

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.630
Hey. How was your time in Kyushu?

00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:06.715
Nothing special.

00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:09.093
Nothing at all.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.512
<i>For my internship,</i>

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.556
<i>he accepted me once again.</i>

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:20.187
<i>Much had happened between the time</i>
<i>of my workplace training and internship.</i>

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.523
<i>He must be after more information.</i>

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:23.607
<i>Hawks…</i>

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.694
<i>Don't look down on me, the No. 3 Hero.</i>

00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:27.611
<i>No.</i>

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.279
<i>He's the No. 2 Hero now.</i>

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.783
Tsukuyomi is so determined.

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:34.326
He has a bright future ahead.

00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:38.038
What?

00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:41.417
<i>-Great work today.</i>
<i>-Great work today.</i>

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.877
Tokoyami, may I have a word with you?

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.715
What is it you want this time?

00:16:48.298 --> 00:16:50.426
I'm not going to ask questions.

00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:53.053
Hawks!

00:16:59.476 --> 00:17:01.270
We are flying like the wind!

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.564
You've never learned how to fly?

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:07.276
I would say 20% of my reason
for choosing you

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.777
was because we're both birds,

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.321
50% because I wanted to know more
about the League of Villains,

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:17.369
and the rest was because
you're wasting your time.

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:21.749
The sky is great.

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:24.418
You can see everything from above.

00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:27.921
What do you mean I was wasting my time?

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:33.427
It's a sound plan to strengthen
your skills in close-quarter combat.

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:36.513
But never forget to develop
what you're already good at.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.475
You can move more freely.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.063
I never wanted to be a mentor.

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.982
But since we're both birds,
I guess it must be fate.

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:53.989
You belong in the sky if you can fly.

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:01.038
Don't limit yourself to the ground.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:07.127
I will use the move I invented
when I worked with Hawks.

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:09.338
Black Fallen Angel.

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.758
Black Fallen Angel?

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.427
That sounds fun.

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:16.887
Let's see what you've got!

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.391
He is moving in the shadows!

00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:24.853
I would never have expected them
to launch a solo assault.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.523
It's the same situation
as the first battle.

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:30.317
It's time to improvise.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.612
<i>But the place is full of pipelines.</i>

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:35.572
<i>There is no way to tell his location.</i>

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.699
Tokoyami, are you all right?

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:38.826
Yes.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.786
<i>Fumikage Tokoyami.</i>

00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:43.330
I will take you out.

00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:45.332
<i>I'm his target.</i>

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:48.836 line:20%
<i>I bet that's what you think, Class A.</i>

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:52.714
Our rivalry is destined.

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:58.011
<i>I started psychological warfare</i>
<i>before the battle even began.</i>

00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.848
<i>I made them think Tokoyami was my target.</i>

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.934
<i>They are certain of it,</i>
<i>but they are wrong.</i>

00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:07.312
<i>Scheming Hero: Vantablack.</i>

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:10.315
<i>That's how I roll!</i>

00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:13.485 line:20%
-What?
-Aoyama!

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:17.781
Help!

00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:20.117
<i>His scheme…</i>

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.119
This is despicable.

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.622
Repent with the purest intent.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:30.043
<i>With my speed</i>
<i>and the complex layout of this arena,</i>

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:32.713
<i>Dark Shadow and its master are connected,</i>

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:34.715
<i>which makes it hard</i>
<i>to navigate this place.</i>

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:36.008
<i>In that case,</i>

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:39.136
<i>they will never catch up to me!</i>

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:41.013
Is that so?

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:44.933
Dark Shadow!

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:46.768
Black Fallen Angel!

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:48.937 line:20%
-He is flying!
-He is flying!

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.480 line:20%
Tokoyami…

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:51.773
That is his new move!

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.442 line:20%
How can he fly?

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:55.527
The principle is simple.

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.988
<i>Dark Shadow is always floating in the air.</i>

00:19:58.071 --> 00:20:01.533
<i>It can carry Tokoyami as it moves around!</i>

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.493
<i>Thanks to the mantle,</i>

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:07.331
<i>sunlight is blocked out,</i>
<i>allowing it to stay active even longer!</i>

00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:10.667
<i>The way Dark Shadow carries him</i>
<i>also allows for the use of his hands!</i>

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.669
Dark Shadow is floating!

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:16.840
Everyone takes that feature for granted
and overlooks its potential!

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.301
It's simple yet hard to imagine!

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:20.344
Awesome!

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.471
You're awesome, Tokoyami!

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:26.308
<i>But never forget to develop</i>
<i>what you're already good at.</i>

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.102
<i>Hawks, you have my thanks.</i>

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:35.400
<i>I'll take it up a notch!</i>

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:38.278
Twinkling Laser Date!

00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:40.781
<i>Plan A failed.</i>

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.033
Aoyama, use your Navel Laser!

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.160
Tokoyami, keep flying.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.204
Dark Shadow, grab the jacket!

00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:48.205
All right!

00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:50.832 line:20%
I just need to disrupt the shadows!

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.751
Navel Buffet!

00:20:58.882 --> 00:21:00.550 line:20%
I found him, Hagakure!

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:02.844
Yes, I'll get him this time!

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:07.015
-That's as far as you can get.
-There is nowhere to run.

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:09.893
We didn't expect you to operate solo.

00:21:09.977 --> 00:21:12.854
But every unexpected outcome

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:16.483 line:20%
is already within my expectation!

00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:18.986
You saw this coming.

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.195
Stop right there!

Mushrooms!

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.246 line:20%
I knew it.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.165

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:35.497

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.750
