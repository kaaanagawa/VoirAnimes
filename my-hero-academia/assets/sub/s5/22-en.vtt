00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.129
Stop it! It's so cold!

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:06.840
Why is my hand so cold?

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.718 line:20%
Who are you? Damn it! Are you my clones?

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:12.512 line:20%
You have my face. Who are you people?

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.931
<i>Yes, press his head down.</i>

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.560
C, press him down. E, Bubaigawara…

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.104
Bubaigawara? What are they doing?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:26.067
Do not interrupt him.
He's dealing with Toga and Bubaigawara.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.362
He has the power to create puppets.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.907 line:20%
<i>He's controlling puppets</i>
<i>that share Bubaigawara's face.</i>

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.995 line:20%
<i>Via the microdevices we developed</i>
<i>and the comm links he set up,</i>

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:40.331 line:20%
<i>he can control the puppets</i>
<i>with high precision.</i>

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:46.337
I only learned about Bubaigawara's trauma
from your clientele data.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.507
It must be frustrating
to hear that, Broker.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.177
I will eliminate Toga and recruit Twice.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.098
<i>That's double the pain for Bubaigawara.</i>

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.811
I need to cover my face
before it's too late!

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:06.232
Damn it! Stop! Toga!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.402
I am killing her right now!

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:12.280
I'm killing the very girl
who covered me with her handkerchief!

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.658
Am I really doing this? Is that me?

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.661 line:20%
What about me? Which is the real me?

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:22.582 line:20%
Did I get it wrong? My head is splitting!

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.585
Am I different from the clones?
Am I the real me?

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.337
I'm…

00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:00.346
<i>Even as a child,</i>
<i>my scary face had terrified many.</i>

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.349
I was alone and without a family.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.643
I see. Life must be very tough for you.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:09.147
<i>The turning point of my life took place</i>
<i>when I was 16 years old.</i>

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.526
The man hit by your bike got a broken arm.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.653
That's only because
he charged onto the road.

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.947
I was following the speed limit.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:21.117
Either way,
this might stay on your record.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.995
Don't dwell on it. Such is life.

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:26.206
You can always start over after falling.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.920
<i>But sometimes, you fall so hard</i>
<i>you never stand back up again.</i>

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:35.715
Jin!

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:39.969
The man you hit was an employee
of our regular client!

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.597
They just called!

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.226
They are considering terminating
all business partnerships with us.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.604
I gave you shelter and food,
but this is how you repay me?

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:53.691
This is absurd! Don't show up again!
You've brought me nothing but bad luck!

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:58.363
<i>My parents passed away</i>
<i>during a villain attack</i>

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.698
<i>when I was still in middle school.</i>

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:07.038
<i>I was never close with my relatives,</i>
<i>so I ended up all alone.</i>

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.624
<i>I wish I could have someone to talk to.</i>

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.128
What did I do wrong?

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.798
Maybe you did make a mistake.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.260
Perhaps you were born
without any good luck.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.180
<i>I needed someone to rely on.</i>

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.476
<i>I was so happy.</i>

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.397
<i>A man who has forfeited his life</i>
<i>has only one thing on his mind.</i>

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:34.524
<i>"To make life easier."</i>

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.526
<i>Yes.</i>

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:41.030
<i>When the thought filled my mind, I kept</i>
<i>making one wrong decision after another.</i>

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.868
<i>I only realized the error of my way</i>
<i>when I hit rock bottom.</i>

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.793
<i>In the end, I couldn't even trust myself.</i>

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.462
<i>I see.</i>

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:00.508
<i>You saw your clones kill each other</i>
<i>and lost your mind because of the horror.</i>

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.553
<i>What's the deal with your head?</i>

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.929
Are you hyperventilating?

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.098
I will start splitting again
unless my head is covered.

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.266
You're not going to split!

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.183
VILLAIN: GIRAN

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.102
I get it now.

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:15.064
My clones will disintegrate
when they receive enough damage.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.399
Let's see.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:19.402
The damage is about the same
as breaking an adult's bone.

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:21.321
I feel insecure.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:22.822
I feel relieved.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.533
You've been robbing with your clones

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:28.578
and managed to make yourself
a wanted criminal.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.996
When utilized properly,

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:32.040
you can take down an entire nation
with your Quirk.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.834
I can't imagine anyone being so powerful
yet also so down and out.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.545
What do I do when my life is in ruin?

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.799
You must earn people's trust.

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.134
Who?

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:44.927
From your comrades.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.681
A group of people
has been quite active lately.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:52.393
I believe you will be
of great use to them.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.021
Don't worry.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:59.859
There are plenty of people
that share your experience.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.904 line:20%
VILLAIN: TWICE
QUIRK: DOUBLE

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.322
Toga!

00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:07.033
F, G, beat him up.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.080
That hurts!

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.664
I'm fine. It hurts!

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.375
Grab his arms.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.085
Break it.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.632
You would have been fine
had you stayed still.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.759
Stop struggling.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.679
That freaking hurt, you jerk.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:32.058
Damn it. Toga regained consciousness.

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:34.310 line:20%
I need to turn up the output.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.478 line:20%
That hurts.

00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:39.941
That hurts.

00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:43.027
It hurts so much
but I'm not disintegrating!

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.825 line:20%
<i>I've been cautious not to get myself hurt.</i>

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.828 line:20%
<i>I was so scared that I might disappear.</i>

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.415
<i>It's always been that way.</i>

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.834
<i>I kept making mistakes.</i>

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.337
<i>I could have found out</i>
<i>just by hurting myself.</i>

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.298
<i>But I chose to run away.</i>
<i>So I fell hard and threw my life away.</i>

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:07.385
<i>I only found my place</i>
<i>after hitting rock bottom.</i>

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.721
<i>Toga, I will save your life!</i>

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.020
<i>Get out of my way, impostors.</i>

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:21.899
I will never hurt my friends.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.240
Quirk: Double.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.494
Liberation Army, witness its terror.

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:42.670 line:20%
<i>Using my Quirk, Double,</i>
<i>I can clone any object.</i>

00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:44.672 line:20%
<i>I can only make two clones at a time.</i>

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:47.967
<i>The clones are also much weaker.</i>

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.511
<i>The second clone is weaker than the first.</i>

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.848
<i>Before the first clone disintegrates,</i>
<i>I can't make more clones.</i>

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:57.518
It didn't work. I'm sorry, Shigaraki.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.312
It can be done, certainly.

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:02.064
My Quirk, Double,
requires data and imagination.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.817
I don't have the data to imagine this.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:08.112
I can't clone the mafia's ammo.

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:12.992
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't be more useful.</i>
<i>I'm sorry for being a liability.</i>

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:17.914
<i>But I really want to repay</i>
<i>your acceptance for me.</i>

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.666
<i>I've always wanted that.</i>

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:24.003
Let's go, Twice!

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.756
-It's slaughtering time!
-It's slaughtering time!

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:30.468
We must help Skeptic!

00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:32.178
We can't kill Bubaigawara…

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:37.099
INFINITE DOUBLES

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.100
Damn it!

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.479
The march of sorrow!

00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:44.398 line:20%
Sad Man's Parade!

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:48.694
I must protect my friend.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.201
This is a surprise.
He overcame his traumatic past.

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:58.871
Mr. Skeptic, your plan failed.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.457
This is probably one
of your very few mistakes.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.584
I failed?

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:06.462
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Re-Destro.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:10.091
I have only failed once in my entire life.

00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:12.843
I've only made one single mistake.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.555
So make sure you get it right.
This is not a failure.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.557
I merely have to proceed to the next step.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:21.269
Yes. You are correct, Skeptic.

00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:25.273
He overcame his trauma.

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.525
Well done, Doctor.
This must be embarrassing.

00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:30.486
Twice has endless potential
once he is freed from the shackles.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.156
At least now we are equal in numbers.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.576
Then quality shall outshine the quantity.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.661
Isn't that right, Geten?

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:48.129
You don't seem to be doing very well,
given your spirit.

00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:51.215 line:20%
Your ice is almost gone.

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:55.678
Give me a hand if it's so easy for you.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.347
Why should I save your skin?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.141
Don't be so mean!

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.435
Just ask the other guys.

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:05.396
Dabi, Mr. Compress!
The cavalry of Twice has arrived!

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.773
-Dabi, Mr. Compress!
-Damn it, that hurts! Get lost!

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.444
-Toga is dying!
-Are you breathing? I'm here to help!

00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.446
-Stop stepping on my foot!
-Shut it!

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:15.406
What about your trauma?

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:17.408
I conquered it with love and courage.

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:19.910
Who cares what's going on?

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:22.246
It's like the first chapter
of a heroic deed.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.414
But we are villains.

00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:26.208
How is it wrong for villains
to help their friends?

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.877
-He's right!
-You are precious to me.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.253
That sounds awesome.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:32.131
There are only a handful of us,
so you are even more precious to me!

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.966
Hey, am I an idiot?

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.884
I don't deny that.

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.845 line:20%
-The fighting skill is even…
-I see. You must be a smarty-pants.

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:40.389 line:20%
A punch over here!
No! I'll give him 20,000 punches!

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.391
I should help you multiply!

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.977 line:20%
Forget about forming a league!
We can have a whole prefecture!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.104 line:20%
Let's go! Prefecture of Villains!

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.564
Hold on, Twice!

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.358
If you wiped them out,

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:53.444
there would be nothing left
to stop Gigantomachia.

00:10:53.527 --> 00:10:55.571
-We're pulling punches?
-Let's not clone Dabi for now.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.782
-His fire burns everywhere.
-Kill them all!

00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:59.825
That big guy will be awake soon.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.410
Another 75 minutes.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:04.121
Leave it to me! But Toga is in danger.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.374
Get the location from me and head for her.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:13.172
-Ourselves!
-Ourselves!

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.342
Is ice the specialty product of this town?

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:17.885
This is almost ridiculous.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.222
I told you I could manipulate ice.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.975
I see.

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:27.895
I can also control
the temperature of my ice.

00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:30.981
I can send my ice into the pipelines

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:34.235
to freeze the water
and use the ice as my extension.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.863
You could have started with that.
This is getting on my nerves.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.533
We envision a future

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:43.869
where social status is decided
by the strength of Meta Abilities.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:48.207
Strengthening one's power
is the means of survival!

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.502
-Ourselves!
-Ourselves!

00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:53.212
Without powerful Meta Abilities,

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:55.589
one is not worth living.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:58.300
Wouldn't that be pathetic?

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.136 line:20%
Just die already.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.680
Blueflame, I could say the same to you.

00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:06.142
Your body reeks of burning stink.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:10.020
Evaluating an opponent's power
is the most basic skill.

00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:12.815
Your skin is decaying
and slowly falling apart.

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:16.569
I bet you can't fight
for a prolonged period

00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:19.321
because you will be consumed
by your own flame.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.285
Wouldn't his wide-range attack
put his allies in harm's way as well?

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:28.914
Whatever the case is,
this ice-man is beyond our league.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.876
<i>It's best for Gigantomachia</i>
<i>to take care of him, but…</i>

00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:35.379
Serves you right for trying
to pull off a sneaky trick.

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:40.134
But if they all died now,
I would feel sorry for All For One.

00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:41.177
<i>Machia.</i>

00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:47.558
VILLAIN: GIGANTOMACHIA

00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:51.562
<i>The heir of your master is fighting</i>
<i>while being deprived of sleep.</i>

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.192
The heir of my master…

TWICE
QUIRK: DOUBLE

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.489 line:20%

UNKNOWN

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.833
Shigaraki, are you all right?

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.836
What about you?
You could have just stood by.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.838
Even if I didn't come here,

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:21.425
they would just report it to the heroes
and have me hunted down.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.594
I was going to die either way.

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:26.806 line:20%
You have a point. They set us up.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.098
Look, Spinner.

00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:30.059
We're almost at the tower.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.355
More of them are coming this way.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.691 line:20%
There are even more of them now!

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:40.444
Eat this!

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.446
Twice? There are so many of you!

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.531
Hey, Spinner.

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:44.949
The ice took out many of us.

00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:46.033
My knee hurts!

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:47.368
Shigaraki!

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:50.204
For real? You made this many clones?

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:51.539
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:53.123
I can somehow

00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:56.544
be useful to you, Leader!

00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:00.840
Awesome, Twice.

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:04.218
Can you clear a path to the tower for me?

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:07.805
Their boss and Giran are there.

00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:09.974
But, of course, it could just be a bluff.

00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:15.312
There are more of them around the tower,
as if they are guarding someone.

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:21.068
Forget about Gigantomachia,
I am going to take down their boss.

00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:25.489
I got it, Leader.
Sleep soundly in my embrace.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.700
Maybe we might wipe out
the Liberation Army

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:29.201
before we even know it!

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.578
I'll leave it to you!

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.496
Just wait, Giran!
I'll be there to save you!

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.875
Seriously? Twice alone can handle
the whole battle for us.

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.003
No. He is too obsessed with Giran.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.464
How dare you toy with his feelings?

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:46.760
I will make you pay, Liberation Army.

00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:50.681
The League of Villains and its mastermind,

00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:54.059
I feel sorry to have let you
wreak havoc in this town.

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.812
That politician.
I almost forgot about him.

00:14:57.396 --> 00:15:01.859
Human beings are not powerless.
Everyone is capable of greatness.

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.778
What you've displayed
in this revival party

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.323
is the victory you secure
with Meta Abilities

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.533
and the bodies that have earned
the right of survival.

00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:13.621
We must dismantle the League of Villains!

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:16.832
Now liberate yourselves!
Gather your strength!

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.293
Let's pave the way to a new era!

00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:22.504
Show them that anyone can be a hero!

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:25.299
Show them that no one can be a real hero!

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.886
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:31.263
<i>He's Hanabata.</i>

00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:35.059
<i>As soon as his speech started,</i>
<i>the enemy's morale rose tremendously.</i>

00:15:35.142 --> 00:15:39.021
<i>What do I do now?</i>
<i>I can't let Shigaraki exhaust himself.</i>

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:41.690 line:20%
<i>What should I do now?</i>

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:45.527
So it's you!

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.572
You're the scoundrel
who destroyed our home!

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.533
You actually made it here.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:55.245
I didn't expect you to be bald!
You're a bald leader!

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:56.455
Pardon my manners!

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:57.915
Bubaigawara…

00:15:57.998 --> 00:15:59.291
I knew it.

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.628
I can clone myself faster
than I clone anything!

00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:05.547
That's because I know myself inside out!

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.133
You can start begging for mercy
while wetting yourself, baldy!

00:16:08.717 --> 00:16:11.971
There are plenty of soldiers down there.

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:15.349
Skeptic was right about your power.
It's astounding.

00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:18.102
Listen up! You people are my copies!

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:20.688
Your existence remains even after you die!

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:23.607
Don't worry. I'll dig you guys a grave!

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.985
Don't clone your leader after jinxing him.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:29.905
I'll say it again! We are clones!
So fight to death without any concern!

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.699
That should give you some relief.

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.742
No, it doesn't. Who are these people?

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.537 line:20%
The baldy before you
is the boss of the Liberation Army!

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.331
Hold on! How did you manage
to make so many clones?

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.541
Right.

00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:43.043
I didn't talk to you and Dabi
on the way here.

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:44.420
I overcame my trauma.

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:46.296
So you're a clone too?

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.424
Don't be silly. I am the real deal.

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.050
I'm the real one.

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.260
Forget that!

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.513
What matters now
is to risk your lives for our friends.

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:56.432
That's how we all feel.

00:16:58.308 --> 00:16:59.226
What?

00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:01.395
See? I knew he was a fake.

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:03.480
How feeble.

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:07.651
By the way, do you even know
the meaning of the word "hostage"?

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.528
Did you see what he did?

00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.571
Don't ask me.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:15.075
Bubaigawara, stop cloning yourself
if you want Giran to live.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:17.453
After all, I have no reason

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.621
to kill an unofficial member
of the League of Villains.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:22.541
Don't worry, Twice.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:27.755
As of now, we outnumber him.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:29.506
We have the upper hand!

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.216
We'll just need to get him back.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.217
-Wait!
-Wait!

00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.064
You people are obnoxious.

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:48.901
It was silly to even think about
fighting you on a level playing field.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.320
-Giran.
-What?

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:53.155
Giran!

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.198
That hurts.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:18:00.037
You lost your fingers. Damn it.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.791
You lost the fingers on your right hand!

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:07.753
You used to smoke American Spirit with it.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:13.258 line:20%
I'm so sorry.
They got the information from me.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.427 line:20%
I can't be a businessman anymore.

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:18.722
Don't apologize!
You've done nothing wrong!

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:20.516
So don't you dare apologize!

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:23.143
You haven't been taking this seriously.

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:28.023
When an organization has an objective,
unnecessary emotions are but shackles.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:31.693
Now crumble before our resolve.

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:34.613
You must have a very grand ambition!

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.158
He survived?

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.413
A grand ambition?

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:47.042
Very well. I'll assess qualities.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:48.502
What?

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:53.257 line:20%
A woman once gave birth to a girl
who possessed Meta Abilities.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:57.594
<i>But it was a time of discrimination</i>
<i>against all forms of Meta Abilities.</i>

00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:00.514
<i>Endless bickering</i>
<i>and overflowing prejudices.</i>

00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:03.851
<i>The girl she loved was loathed</i>
<i>by everyone around her.</i>

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:07.604
The woman responded to the world
with her whispering voice,

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:09.940
"This is my daughter's Quirk!"

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:16.071
"I want society to be a world
where she can live with freedom."

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:19.491
But her words were faced with mocking.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:23.120
She never responded afterward.

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:24.246
Why?

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.457
She was murdered by the anti-Meta mobs.

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:30.669
Isn't that the Mother of Quirks?
Do you take me as a fool?

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:34.756
Sorry. I thought you never received
any formal education.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.885
But the heroes and self-proclaimed
enforcers of justice were prospering.

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.220
The government and the heroes
were correcting that notion.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:44.099
They revived the woman's words
for their political campaigning,

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:46.643
so the Quirks were accepted.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:50.272
The Quirks came in many forms,
and awareness correction must take place!

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:56.612
However, they began to establish laws
that restrain the use of Meta Abilities.

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.656 line:20%
Changing the title won't change a thing.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.160
<i>They wanted the use</i>
<i>of Meta Abilities to be in check.</i>

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:07.789 line:20%
<i>True freedom will never be a reality</i>
<i>unless people can use their powers freely.</i>

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.791
<i>Destro believed that.</i>

00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:14.046
"That is not the future
our Mother wanted."

00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:17.424
"Let's make the world a place
where we can use our Quirks freely!"

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.343
"Mother"?

00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:22.262
That was working against their interest.

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:25.849
<i>Do you know why Destro's note</i>
<i>was selling like hotcakes?</i>

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:28.518
<i>Rise up against the government</i>
<i>for the sake of true freedom.</i>

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:32.147
<i>That's the legacy I must take on</i>
<i>to finish what Destro started.</i>

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:39.279 line:20%
The descendant of Destro,
his bloodline, I am Re-Destro.

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:43.408
Do you think a brat with no background
whose sole purpose is destruction

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:47.287 line:20%
is more important than our cause?

00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:50.207
Twice.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.876
If you want to keep Giran safe,
start making a cushion.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.169
A cushion?

00:20:56.463 --> 00:21:00.175
<i>When I was hanging by the window</i>
<i>after his first attack,</i>

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:03.095
<i>I met the eyes of the guy from down below.</i>

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:04.596
He's here.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.349
He will crumble this tower.

00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:09.643
<i>That's what I would do.</i>

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:36.086
Any human being would have died
after falling from that height.

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:40.132
Are you the boss?

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:44.344
I doubt I would have the chance
to get your answer.
