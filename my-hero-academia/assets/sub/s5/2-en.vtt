WEBVTT

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.518
No one told me you would be here.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.650
League of Villains…

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.152
Dabi.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.992
Was it you who killed Snatch?

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.493
Snatch…

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.745
Who was that?

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.539
Forget about him. Let's talk.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.416
We don't get the chance very often now.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.252
Endeavor!

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:48.089
Take a rest. Leave him to me.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.050
I'm almost out of feathers.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.927
But I can still stall him.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.388
Give me a break.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.266
I'm only here to retrieve Nomu.

00:00:58.349 --> 00:01:00.351
It's not like I could defeat…

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:04.397
two wounded heroes!

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.283
I jumped over here after seeing the news.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.452
You must be from the League of Villains.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:21.039
-I'll crush you!
-Come on, we were having a good time.

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.083
Mr. Daruma.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.253
Until we meet again, No. 1 Hero.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.256
We will have a chance to talk.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.841
But before that,

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.344
don't stop fighting.

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:38.473 line:20%
Don't you die on me, Enji Todoroki!

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.767 line:20%
Speak now if you want to talk!

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:45.730
Wasn't that…

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.191
Wasn't he the guy from Kamino?

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.445
Anyway, the battle is finally over.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:53.780
No.

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:55.698
This is only…

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.742
the beginning.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.093
That wasn't our deal.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.137
Is that so?

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.724 line:20%
Can't we be friends, Dabi?

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:47.894
You barely have any feathers left.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:51.898
I wouldn't dare negotiate
with a liar unarmed.

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:55.985
We should be executing our plan tomorrow
at the factory on the coast.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.404
<i>But it came into the city.</i>

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.448
<i>And there was the Nomu…</i>

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:03.201
<i>It was on a different level
compared to what we had seen.</i>

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.496 line:20%
You could have warned us beforehand.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.082 line:20%
I have a change of heart.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:13.086 line:20%
Didn't I tell you it was
to test Nomu's performance?

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:16.798
If things didn't turn out as we agreed,
I could say the same about you too.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.259
You told me
you would get "someone decent."

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.928
But you got me the No. 1 Hero instead.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.763
He was too much for Nomu.

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.307
The No. 1 Hero is covered in wounds.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.977
That should put a smile on your face.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.689
I held up to my end of the promise,
but you didn't.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:37.485
You can't possibly ask me
to trust the No. 2 Hero so easily.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.697
Not to mention
Nomu didn't kill anyone today.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.490
Your actions didn't seem like

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:45.952
someone who would help our cause
over aligned interests.

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:49.747
I still need my identity as a hero.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:53.543
The better other heroes trust me,
the more intel I get.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.087
Try to see the big picture.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.718
I'm doing this
for the League of Villains, Dabi.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.802
Whatever.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.596
But it's too soon to let you meet my boss.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.058
See you, Hawks.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.232
<i>We need you to infiltrate
the League of Villains.</i>

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.944
Hold on. What do you mean?

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.030
I thought you were forming
an investigation team

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.698
with Grand Torino and the others.

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.408
Who told you that?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.119
That's all we have to say, Hawks.

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:31.039
You're a smart one.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:34.125
The hostages' safety was on the line
during the battle at Kamino.

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:35.543
So we made a rash decision.

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:40.048 line:20%
But we underestimated our enemies
due to the lack of information.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.008
<i>To quell the evil forces,</i>

00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.926
<i>we need more information,</i>

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.054
<i>particularly on the artificial human.</i>

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:49.849 line:20%
<i>Did they make those things solely
with All For One's power?</i>

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.519
Without sufficient intel
on the League of Villains,

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.230
we are bound to repeat the same mistake.

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.149
You want me to turn a blind eye

00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:00.735
to the destruction
and casualties they caused?

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.614
We assigned you this mission
because we're aware of your resolve.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.575
You don't care for image or fame.

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:10.787
You fix your eyes on
the greater good and strive for it.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:14.207
<i>There is no other hero
better suited for this mission.</i>

<i>I…</i>

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.350
I see. So that was Snatch.

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:36.854 line:20%
What about the sorrow you've brought
to the victim's family?

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.985 line:20%
You only lose your mind
because you let the thoughts get to you.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:49.909
This is great.

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:51.869
You got discharged already.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:56.457
I'm glad your left eye didn't go blind.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:01.003
It was my fault. I apologize.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.463
Don't be so full of yourself.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.841
I'm responsible for my own injuries.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.302
Can I use that line
when I get hurt next time?

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:10.179
That aside, I must ask,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.016
that Nomu charged straight at us back then

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.978
<i>on the day we arrived.</i>

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.273
Was that really a coincidence?

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:21.899
Right.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:25.111
Two heroes walking by the station
could draw a lot of attention.

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:28.406
That's why the enemies
got their eyes on us.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.033 line:20%
<i>This is disheartening.</i>

00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:36.372
<i>We walked on the street, drawing attention
so I could have a good excuse.</i>

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:42.837 line:20%
Anyway, the rumor about Nomu
was probably meant to bait us out.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.965
We should contact the investigation team.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.842
Be cautious.

00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:51.429
If you plan
to continue your investigation,

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:54.348
as a precaution to deal with more Nomu
like the previous one,

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.434
you will need help.

00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:00.855
Endeavor would never be so thoughtful!

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:02.106
Isn't that right?

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.816
I'll burn you to a crisp!

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.945
I'll continue my mission
when my feathers are fully grown.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.490
It will take another day or so.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.827
Endeavor, don't you need some rest?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:15.953
I'll think about it.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.121
See you!

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.380
<i>Is this really necessary?</i>

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:28.174
It's merely a proposition.

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:30.593
We must operate on both fronts

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:33.471
to cut off any escape route
for the League of Villains.

00:08:33.554 --> 00:08:34.805
You call this a proposition?

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:39.352
You only said that because you knew
I wouldn't turn it down.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.020
You're a cunning bunch.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.689
I won't deny that claim, Hawks.

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:47.944
You should be glad you didn't make it
in time to Kamino that day.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.738
<i>A kid?</i>

00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:52.865
<i>Are you saying a kid saved you?</i>

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:55.576
<i>Everyone survived that horrible accident.</i>

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.119
<i>It's hard to believe.</i>

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.163
<i>Find the kid now!</i>

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:00.206
<i>Move out!</i>

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.459
<i>The kid has gifts.</i>

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.087
<i>He should become a hero.</i>

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.633
<i>Please allow us to supply
all the necessities of your family.</i>

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.680
By working as an undercover
in the League of Villains,

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.642
if I must become a sinner to ensure
to make the world a better place,

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.811
then I gladly accept this mission.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.981
<i>I'm Hawks.</i>

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.525
<i>I'm the man who's a little bit too fast.</i>

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.444
<i>A society where heroes
can enjoy a little boredom…</i>

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.447
<i>I'll make it happen.</i>

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:38.536

Fuyumi and Mom somehow forgave you,

but you've always been

You may look different,
but you never changed.

00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:07.500

you had done to us.

Mom's screams, Shoto's cries,

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:16.634

Shoto started to visit Mom again.

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:17.820 line:20%
<i>He was covered in blood when he fought.</i>

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:20.364 line:20%
<i>He let the villain slip away again.</i>

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.200
<i>I thought they had already caught
a bunch of Nomu.</i>

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.870
<i>If one Nomu is enough
to put him in a pinch…</i>

00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:27.621
<i>People are still questioning
his capability.</i>

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.290
-Turn it off!
-No.

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:34.295
<i>Who's the man standing up
and fighting for us right now?</i>

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:35.671
<i>Look carefully!</i>

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:37.923 line:20%
<i>I used to be Edgeshot's fan.</i>

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.509 line:20%
<i>How can I not be Endeavor's fan
after witnessing his epic battle?</i>

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.219 line:20%
<i>I can use flame as well.</i>

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.054 line:20%
<i>So I feel glad about his performance.</i>

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:46.182 line:20%
<i>This is all thanks to that kid on the TV.</i>

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.100 line:20%
<i>"Look carefully!"</i>

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.352
<i>The young man who made a wave
on the news has been dubbed</i>

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.312
<i>"Look carefully!"</i>

00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:55.316
<i>His outcry has brought Endeavor
more popularity.</i>

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.985
-It's the kid from the other day.
<i>-Endeavor fought gallantly,</i>

00:12:58.068 --> 00:12:59.862
<i>but Hawks played a huge role
in the battle too.</i>

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.739
I heard

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:04.575 line:20%
that something intangible
you single-handedly built

00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:08.704 line:20%
is slowly crumbling away.

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:09.997
<i>Endeavor is the latest trend.</i>

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.918
I'll admit Endeavor is a spectacular hero.

00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.379
There is no doubt about it.

00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:18.923
However,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.885
<i>I don't think Natsuo is wrong.</i>

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:27.389
<i>Even now, I still can't forgive you
for what you did to Mom.</i>

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:30.851
I want to see what steps

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.772
you'll take as a father.

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:39.109
From my experience,
it takes merely a single moment

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:40.945
to make people change.

00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:46.742
<i>I became the No. 1 Hero
in an unexpected way.</i>

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.621
<i>The confusion and frustration in my heart
never stop haunting me.</i>

00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:52.706
<i>What is the purpose of my power?</i>

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.627
What is your reason to remain strong?

00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:03.092 line:20%
Endeavor, the answer to that question
is a simple one.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:08.847 line:20%
<i>His words reminded me
of the simple and natural thought.</i>

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.851
<i>I must protect their future.</i>

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.689
<i>If that is my duty for being at the top,</i>

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:21.402 line:20%
<i>what about the future I've ruined
with my own hands?</i>

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:25.698
<i>I don't expect forgiveness from them.</i>

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.118
Dad, why are you leaving too?

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.035
Fuyumi.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.247
I'm sorry for what I did in the past.

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:37.209
What I said to Natsuo was wrong.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.172
<i>I can only atone for my mistakes</i>

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:45.634
<i>and give them a future they deserve.</i>

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.268
<i>That day,</i>

00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:56.687 line:20%
<i>after the fitness exercise,</i>

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.023 line:20%
<i>I continued with my training
to master One For All.</i>

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.234 line:20%
<i>I was so tired I fell asleep
without taking a shower.</i>

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:13.996
<i>Then I had a dream.</i>

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:20.419
<i>Standing next to me was a beautiful lady
who looked like a veteran.</i>

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.380
<i>Next to her are people I didn't know.</i>

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.050
<i>That's…</i>

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.428
<i>I had seen this in the past.</i>

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.849
<i>No, the image is much clearer this time.</i>

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:37.353
<i>They are the predecessors of One For All.</i>

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.773
<i>I can't speak.</i>

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:43.108
<i>I can only move my right hand.</i>

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:44.777
<i>My legs are gone.</i>

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.780
<i>The last two people in the line…</i>

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:50.532
<i>One person gains power</i>

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.535 line:20%
and passes it to another,

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.913
<i>who gains it and passes it again.</i>

00:15:55.996 --> 00:16:00.876
This power is the fruit
of the many voices seeking help

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.544
and heroic hearts.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:05.005
<i>There are seven of them.</i>

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:07.049
<i>There are eight, including me.</i>

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:10.260
<i>They are the predecessors of One For All.</i>

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:12.137
<i>I'm the ninth wielder.</i>

00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:14.098
<i>The one remaining is…</i>

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.808
Join us.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.771
My silly yet lovable brother.

00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:23.107
Why do you resist?

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.984
<i>That voice…</i>

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.986
<i>I will never forget that voice!</i>

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:28.487
<i>All For One!</i>

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:31.490
Your way is wrong.

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:33.784
It should be forbidden!

00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:35.202
Everything you've done is wrong!

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:37.162
<i>A younger brother?</i>

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.706
<i>His brother?</i>

00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:41.959
<i>He is the first wielder!</i>

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:45.170
That was a little too harsh.

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.631
I've come for you, after all.

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:52.886
Is tolerance not part
of your moral compass?

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.098
The world is in chaos.

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:58.892
You shouldn't abuse your power
for personal gain.

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:02.021
All you ever wanted
is satisfying your selfish desires!

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:04.606
<i>They haven't noticed my presence.</i>

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.276
<i>Is this only a memory?</i>

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.194
Come to me.

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:14.283
His jaw has mutated.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:17.036
His tusks will only grow longer.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.498
He is a gentle soul who takes great care
of his elderly parents.

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:25.836
But people shunned him,
saying he's a monster or ill.

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:29.089
They quarantined him
so he can't visit his parents.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.259
This man has no special power.

00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:36.513
He was attacked by a group of ability
users on his way back home at dusk.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:39.516 line:20%
The stun gun failed him.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.771 line:20%
Hair moving like tentacles kept him bound.

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:46.231
No! You're only making it worse--

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.445
Please.

00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:52.446
Hurry.

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:09.546
If ever I require your assistance,
would you be willing to lend me a hand?

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:11.673
Certainly.

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:14.593
Father, Mother…

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:16.595
Thanks.

00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:18.597
I will never forget your kindness.

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:23.310
What is this world you speak of,
my little brother?

00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:28.148
People are using their power
for themselves.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.316
Don't twist the meaning!

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:32.945
You merely made those two your goons.

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.490
People need something they can rely on.

00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:41.954
Denying my act of kindness
would be denying their right to happiness.

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:45.499
Humans come in many forms nowadays.

00:18:45.582 --> 00:18:48.794
I have the power
to bring balance to this world.

00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:52.756
So who is the one trying
to prove his point?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.759
You took advantage
of the weakness in their hearts!

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:58.679
I bet you wouldn't care
to remember the names

00:18:58.762 --> 00:19:00.889
of those you abandoned like trash!

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:05.185
I won't allow you to disrespect him!

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.396
Hey, watch it.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.481
My brother is very frail.

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.441
Poor thing.

00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:14.778
You were born without any power.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.948
But without power,
you can't convince anyone.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:21.952
Even so, I still love you.

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:24.329
My poor brother…

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:26.999
My only family.

00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:32.087
If you're willing to help my cause,

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.923
I'll give you what you desire.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:38.302
A choice for those without power,

00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:40.095
forgiveness for the sinners!

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.227
Did you refuse to eat?

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:50.063
You can barely stand up.

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:54.401
I won't let you do as you please.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:58.280
A group of people is abusing their powers.

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:01.533
<i>They ganged up and refused
to join my cause,</i>

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.744
<i>denying the balance of this world.</i>

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.497
<i>That brought them to their demise.</i>

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.418
I never gave any order to kill them.

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:17.466
Those who admire me simply acted
on my thoughts.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.718
It's a sight to behold!

00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:22.971
I told them my vision,
and they took action!

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.682
One could only dream for this to happen!

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.978 line:20%
It's like the world we read about
in a comic book.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:33.565
You gave up after three chapters.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:34.900
But the story goes on.

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:37.778
<i>In a world reigned by a demon lord,</i>

00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:40.322
<i>heroes of justice are battling evil.</i>

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.367
<i>They manage to save everyone's life.</i>

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.993
<i>Brother, don't you know?</i>

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:48.747
<i>Evil will always fall.</i>

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.459
My dream is now the reality.

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:55.504
In reality, even the best-laid plans
sometimes go wrong.

00:20:55.587 --> 00:21:01.301
Now I'll wipe away the reality
where you refuse to bow down to me.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:03.387
You mean the world to me.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.930 line:20%
Stop!

00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:10.727 line:20%
I found a power
even a weakling like you could use.

00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:11.979
Join my cause.

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:14.648 line:20%
Stop it!

00:21:18.026 --> 00:21:19.736
You must be the ninth wielder.

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:23.407
I was hoping to show you more,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.743
but 20% is the best I can do
at this moment.

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.870
Be cautious.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.373
The singularity has passed.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.335
Fear not.

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.088
<i>You're not alone.</i>

00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:23.151
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.113
<i>The changes of One For All
still confuses me,</i>

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:28.698
<i>but I still undergo
combat training as usual.</i>

00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:32.702
<i>It's a clash between Class A and Class B.</i>

00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:36.540
<i>I must master the power of One For All
and seize victory.</i>

00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:40.585
<i>Next, "Clash! Class A vs. Class B!"</i>

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:45.674 line:20%
<i>What? So you're the special guest?</i>

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:47.551
<i>Onward!</i>

00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:49.511
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
