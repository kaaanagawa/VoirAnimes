00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:04.713
<i>It's a new year.</i>

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:08.800
<i>Kacchan and I accepted</i>
<i>Todoroki's invitation</i>

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:12.137
<i>and went to Endeavor Agency</i>
<i>for our internship.</i>

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:19.602
<i>As soon as we got there,</i>

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:25.650
<i>we witnessed the overwhelming strength</i>
<i>of the No. 1 Hero.</i>

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.655
You accumulate your training at U.A. High.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.866
You come here to accumulate experience.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.160 line:20%
Every bit matters.

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.788
All three of you will get your answers
through experience.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.666
Before the winter ends,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.461
try to take down a villain before I do.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.089 line:20%
<i>If we follow in Endeavor's steps</i>

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.967
<i>and manage to close the gap</i>
<i>ever so slightly,</i>

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:53.970
<i>then I know that one day,</i>

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.433
<i>I will realize my dream of becoming</i>
<i>the best hero out there.</i>

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.109
<i>It's modern-day Japan.</i>

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.946
<i>I've spent a week working</i>
<i>in the top agency of the hero industry.</i>

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.130
Thief!

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.548
Someone, get a hero!

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:01.347
<i>Every action we take will directly</i>
<i>determine the scale of the emergency.</i>

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.517
<i>We can only catch up to Endeavor's pace.</i>

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:09.105
<i>Hone the skill you focus on doing</i>
<i>so can be done even while you're asleep!</i>

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.023 line:20%
What?

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.650
<i>Before your mind decides</i>
<i>the best course of action,</i>

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.236
<i>your body must make it happen first!</i>

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.575 line:20%
I spotted it first.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.535 line:20%
He got it again.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.661 line:20%
IZUKU MIDORIYA

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.455 line:20%
<i>He really is amazing.</i>

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.417 line:20%
<i>-He managed to get ahead of us again.</i>
-Thank you for the help, Endeavor.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.503
Why would anyone carry cash nowadays?
Be more cautious.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:33.421
Yes.

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:36.466
<i>Endeavor, there's been a hit-and-run</i>
<i>at Area 23.</i>

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.884
I'm on my way.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.510
-Curse it!
-Let's go.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:40.428
Yes.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.600
Thank you.

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.018
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.564
That's all for today.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.608
Return to your rooms and get some rest.

00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:54.817
I can still fight!

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.985
Kacchan.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.987
What about you? Aren't you going home?

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.490
I'll patrol for another while.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.991
We'll start early tomorrow.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.993
Don't let the fatigue get to you.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.252
Whatever formidable power you have,

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.630
you need constant and steady effort
to master the basics.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.548 line:20%
The same training

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:21.636 line:20%
gives you different results
when you're in school and a real battle.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.430
Now you have
the best learning environment.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:28.559
Make your body adjust to the skills
you've learned in school.

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:32.522
<i>I doubt I can catch up to him</i>
<i>in such a short time.</i>

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.608
<i>But I'm not going to give up.</i>

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.987
<i>Every little bit matters.</i>

00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:41.406
<i>One step at a time.</i>

00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:45.493 line:20%
Nice job, Endeavor.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.537
I'll take a break.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:49.872
Let me know if there is any problem.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.296
PARANORMAL LIBERATION FRONT

00:04:57.755 --> 00:05:00.842
<i>"Our enemy is the Liberation Front."</i>

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.594
<i>"They have over 100,000 people."</i>

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:12.145
Hello? Dad?

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.731
I was told Shoto is working with you now.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:15.982
<i>Fuyumi.</i>

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:17.984
<i>He's with his friends, am I right?</i>

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:19.736
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.032 line:20%
When I learned about it,
I was so touched that I almost cried.

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.452
<i>School is reopening soon.</i>

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.288
<i>It will be hard to have any free time.</i>

00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.499
<i>It's Saturday tomorrow.</i>
<i>Invite them over to our home if you could.</i>

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.752
I'll prepare a delicious dinner
for all of you.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.014
<i>What more can I do</i>
<i>for my family at this point?</i>

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:48.973
FUYUMI
CALL ENDED

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.100
<i>This is the question I ask myself</i>
<i>every night.</i>

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.146
<i>I've been having the same dream.</i>

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.692
<i>My wife and the kids are having</i>
<i>a delightful time at the dinner table.</i>

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:02.779
<i>They talk about trivial matters</i>
<i>in everyday life.</i>

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.699
<i>They appreciated every moment</i>

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.827
<i>of this sliver of happiness.</i>

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:15.041
<i>But I am never at the dinner table myself.</i>

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.627
<i>I'm well aware of the answer.</i>

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.046
<i>I know it all too well.</i>

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:27.178
They don't belong
in the same world as you.

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.391
Stand up.

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.434
If something like this knocks you down,

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.562
you won't be able to take down
any villains, let alone All Might.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.399
Please stop. He's only five.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.193
He's already five. Don't interrupt!

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.379
It's your fault.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:02.839 line:20%
What?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.134 line:20%
Because you did that to Mom…

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:17.186
<i>Is this all you can say?</i>

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:23.401
I'll win using only my mother's power.

00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:26.362
<i>I'll never use your power in a fight.</i>

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.617
Shoto has been visiting Rei
at the hospital?

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:33.369
Yes.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.288
What about Rei?

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.958
Shoto said Mom was willing
to see him again.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.295
They even talked to each other.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.883
I see. Rei is opening up to Shoto.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.178
I think Shoto plans to write her letters

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.889
when he's too busy
to visit her at the hospital.

00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:57.310
Shoto is trying his best
to overcome his past.

00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:01.230
Someday,

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.774
our family…

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:05.651
will be whole again.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:12.783
<i>I only found out that</i>
<i>Shoto likes soba noodles today.</i>

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.746
<i>That's because you forbade failure like us</i>
<i>to even talk to him.</i>

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.210
Fuyumi and Mom somehow forgave you,

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:26.255
but you've always been
the same madman to me.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.925
You may look different,
but you never changed.

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.635
You never care about us.

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:32.762
You may be the No. 1 Hero
and defeated powerful foes,

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.139
but I'll never forget the things
you had done to us.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:38.184
Mom's screams, Shoto's cries,

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.769
and it was the same for Toya!

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.104 line:20%
You're so selfishly trying
to turn over a new leaf

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.942 line:20%
to make up for the terrible things
you had done, it's disgusting!

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.445
Shoto started to visit Mom again.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:54.033
We've become closer with you.
Mom is smiling again too.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:58.663
I thought we could have a chance
to be a family.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:03.334
I'll admit Endeavor is a spectacular hero.

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:05.211
There is no doubt about it.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:06.963
However,

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:10.424
<i>I don't think Natsuo is wrong.</i>

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:15.513
<i>Even now, I still can't forgive you</i>
<i>for what you did to Mom.</i>

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:18.558
I want to see what steps

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.852
you'll take as a father.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.690
<i>From my experience,</i>
<i>it takes merely a single moment</i>

00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:27.108
<i>to make people change.</i>

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.863
<i>The former No. 1 Hero.</i>

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.202
<i>What is the symbol of peace?</i>

00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:43.749
To be honest, I don't know either.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.254
<i>For a long time,</i>

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:51.299
<i>I believed that this country</i>
<i>needed a symbol.</i>

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:52.842
<i>So I trust forward.</i>

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.847
<i>The bright ray is hope and a warning.</i>

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.766
<i>I swore to align myself</i>
<i>with such an implication.</i>

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.059
<i>That was what sustained me.</i>

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.061
Endeavor.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.023
I understand the situation you're in.

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.400
I hear what people are saying.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.404
They keep comparing you to me.

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.949
<i>But you're different.</i>

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:21.871
<i>You have no need to pursue</i>
<i>the symbol I created.</i>

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:26.959
<i>You just need to carve your own path.</i>

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.588
<i>Why do you want to remain strong?</i>

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:32.548
Endeavor.

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:34.967
The answer

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.470
is very simple.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.518
<i>Endeavor, there's been an emergency!</i>

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:54.362

Good morning, Burnin.

Don't make too much noise!

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.808
What about your target of taking down
a villain before Endeavor does?

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.644
Oh, no!
I apologize for my lack of delicacy.

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:30.314
I know it's not an easy goal to reach.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.024
Good morning, Burnin.

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:33.526
Good morning, Shoto.

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:37.071
Midoriya, Bakugo,
it was such a shame yesterday.

00:11:37.571 --> 00:11:40.199
Remember that feeling from yesterday.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.160
We must beat Endeavor to it today.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.415
It was such a shame for me, you jerk!

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:50.459
You were too slow! So I'm better than you!

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.795
I'm still not used to tap firing.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.089
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:56.716
-I see.
-Don't ignore me!

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.803
Charging up the attack
is quite a challenge too.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:05.641
It takes some time
to reach the maximum output.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.477
Fools! Just charge up
whenever you're awake!

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.478
You're right!

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:12.815
<i>I think they've had enough motivation.</i>

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:13.858
Let's move out.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.402
Come with me.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:22.241
More! You still have more to learn!

00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:24.744
Your thoughts, actions,
and control over your power,

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.662
shorten the time you need for every task!

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:44.430
<i>Every second counts.</i>

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.932
<i>Stop the disaster from ever happening.</i>

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:50.519
<i>And to do so, you need keen observation.</i>

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.232
<i>Uproot the evil that lurks</i>
<i>in everyday life.</i>

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:59.361
<i>Learn to overcome any person</i>
<i>and situation.</i>

00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:02.531
<i>This is not something</i>
<i>you master overnight.</i>

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.660
<i>But with experience,</i>
<i>you gain better precision.</i>

00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:13.834
<i>Keep moving forward!</i>

00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:16.921
<i>Become a better version</i>
<i>of yourselves every day!</i>

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.674 line:20%
<i>Having no improvement</i>
<i>is just as bad as regression!</i>

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:25.179 line:20%
<i>A hero must never stop reaching</i>
<i>for greater heights!</i>

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.482
We didn't catch up to him today.

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:37.983
Damn it.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:42.321
But we're doing much better
than we were on the first day.

00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:48.702
<i>Invite them over to our home if you could.</i>

00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:53.874
<i>I'm only here for myself.</i>

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.336
I'm sorry you have
to hear that, No. 1 Hero.

00:13:57.419 --> 00:14:00.798 line:20%
So please stop acting like
you're my father in front of my friends.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.219
<i>Fuyumi.</i>

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:08.931
<i>You have no idea of the redemption</i>
<i>you've given me.</i>

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:12.852 line:20%
Let's go!

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:14.061
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:14.979 line:20%
BANG!

00:14:15.062 --> 00:14:16.564 line:20%
Why?

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.732
My sister invited you over for dinner.

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:19.859
Why?

00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:22.236
She wants me to introduce
my friends to her.

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:25.781
Tell her we're not your friends!
Is that clear?

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.324
Kacchan…

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.077
Welcome.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.371
Thank you for taking out
some time to come here

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:33.914
despite your busy schedule.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.834
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for looking after Shoto for me.

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.544
I'm his elder sister, Fuyumi.

00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:43.215
Thank you for the invitation.
We appreciate it.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.593
I'm in the same class as Todoroki.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:47.386
My name is Izuku Midoriya.

00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:48.387
I know about you!

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.724
I watched your match against Shoto
during the sports day on TV!

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.642
About that…

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.644
I'm sorry I had put your brother
in danger.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.104
I'm terribly sorry.

00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:59.523
It was just a match.
Don't worry, Midoriya.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.610
Why…

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:10.951
I apologize for the sudden invite.
I kind of did it on a whim.

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:12.161
I'm having fun!

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.747
I rarely get invited to my friend's home.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.917
Is Natsuo here as well?
I saw his shoes at the entryway.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.170
I want the whole family
to know about Shoto's stories.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:25.799
Allow me to introduce myself again.

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:28.385
I'm Fuyumi Todoroki, Shoto's elder sister.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.554
I'm a teacher at an elementary school.

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:33.891 line:20%
This is Natsuo, Shoto's elder brother.
He's still in college.

00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:35.059 line:20%
Nice to meet you.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.312
Shoto, could you introduce
your friends to us?

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:39.396
Sure.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.190
They are my classmates at U.A. High.

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:42.691
Midoriya and Bakugo.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.568
Nice to meet you!

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.908
What?

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:55.245
Anyway, let's not wait
for the food to get cold.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:58.457
Don't force yourself
if you can't handle the food.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.542
Yes! I'm digging in!

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.545
<i>-I'm digging.</i>
<i>-Me too.</i>

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.007
It's delicious.

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:09.510
The Ryuta fried chicken is incredible.

00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:10.552
I'm glad you like it.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:13.931
The meat is flavorful,
but the outer coat is still crispy.

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:16.475
The delicate texture
makes my taste buds dance!

00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:21.230
Stop analyzing the food!
You're making the Mapo tofu unbearable!

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:29.113 line:20%
The filling is so rich and juicy!

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.198
Of course.

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:33.701
After the maid retired
because of her hip injury,

00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:36.120
my sister has been making meals
for our family.

00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.162
I see.

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.832
Natsuo is a good cook too.
We take turns making dinner.

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:42.418
So I've tried his cooking before?

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.169
I'm not sure.

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:45.963
I usually like heavy food.

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.757 line:20%
Endeavor wouldn't let you put it
in your stomach.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.801 line:20%
I bet he would stop you
from even trying it.

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:57.516
I never noticed it.

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:04.732
What do you usually eat at school, Shoto?

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.608
I eat the food from our cafeteria.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.902
I should try Natsuo's cooking…

00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:11.363
I'm full.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.034
Now that you've seen me,
it's time for me to go.

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:15.951
Natsuo!

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:21.331
Sorry, Fuyumi.
I still can't bring myself to do this.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.645
Where should we put the plates?

00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:46.190
Okay.

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:53.989
Kacchan, do you know
about Todoroki's family issues?

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:58.077
What? You guys were the ones
who talked about it where I could hear.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.495
You overheard the conversation?

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:08.420
I feel sorry to ask for their help
with the chores.

00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:11.882
They would feel bad if you didn't ask.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:18.097
It's not that
I don't share Natsuo's feelings.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.768
But this is our chance.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:28.273
Shoto, what do you think of our father?

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.863
I always thought he was the one
who gave me this scar.

00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:37.783
Shoto!

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:39.409
I'm so sorry, Shoto!

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:42.830
This can't be happening!

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:48.293
Mom lost it because
she had reached the breaking point.

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:53.590
I can't forgive him for pushing Mom
to the point of a mental breakdown.

00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:59.888
But she is doing her best
to overcome this trauma.

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:04.560
<i>Dear Shoto,</i>

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:07.521 line:20%
<i>how have you been lately?</i>

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:13.235 line:20%
<i>The weather has turned very cold.</i>
<i>I'm worried you might catch a cold.</i>

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:18.782
<i>I often go out for walks nowadays.</i>

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:24.538
<i>According to the doctor,</i>
<i>I could be discharged if things go well.</i>

00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:30.794
<i>I want to live with you,</i>
<i>Natsuo, and Fuyumi.</i>

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:37.134 line:20%
<i>I'll do whatever I can to stop myself</i>
<i>from making the same mistake.</i>

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.308 line:20%
Honestly, I'm at a loss
as to what I should do.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.935
What should I think of my father now?

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.522
As of now, I am totally lost.

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:54.276
Hey.

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:57.321
Don't show us this kind of touching moment
after you invited us over!

00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:58.989
We have dishes to wash!

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:01.200
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:05.204
Well, Todoroki told me the story.

00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:09.124
Normal people would think you're close
when you ask them over for dinner.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.627
You totally ruined the Mapo tofu for me!

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.254
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:20.677
Todoroki.

00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:26.516
I'm sure you're preparing
to forgive him at some point.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.268
What?

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:33.649
If you really hated him that much,
it wouldn't be wrong not to forgive him.

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:38.153
But because you have a kind heart…

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.617
it seems like you're waiting
for the right moment.

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:50.207
Perhaps, it's not the right time yet.

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:03.178
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>what more can I do for my family?</i>

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.807
<i>I've been having the same dream.</i>

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:11.186
<i>My wife and the kids are having</i>
<i>a delightful time at the dinner table.</i>

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.358
<i>I wish…</i>

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:19.152
<i>you were there too,</i>

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:21.947
<i>Toya.</i>

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:55.248 line:20%
A FEW DAYS AGO

00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:58.126 line:20%
STOP

A NEW SYMBOL
ENDEAVOR AS THE NEW NO. 1 HERO

<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:18.313 --> 00:23:20.607
<i>Kacchan and I learned about</i>

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.194 line:20%
<i>Endeavor's wish to make up to his family.</i>

00:23:24.277 --> 00:23:26.530
<i>But his enemies seem</i>
<i>to mock that very thought</i>

00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:29.783 line:20%
<i>and are planning to launch an assault.</i>

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:32.327 line:20%
<i>Let's go, Todoroki, Kacchan.</i>

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:35.080 line:20%
<i>We can't allow the villain</i>

00:23:35.163 --> 00:23:37.374
<i>Next episode, "The Unforgiven."</i>

00:23:37.457 --> 00:23:38.750
<i>We can't change the past,</i>

00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:41.670
<i>but with the determination to make amend…</i>

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:42.838
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.047
