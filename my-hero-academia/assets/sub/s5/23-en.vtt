<i>Toga is an amazing teenager.</i>

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:08.299
Your data from back at the Hassaikai
is nowhere near your performance now.

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:10.343
-I almost forgot how fast you grow.
-Puberty.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.637
-She lost too much blood.
-We don't know her blood type.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.141
To clone you,
I must take your measurements again.

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:19.060
I will do a blood transfusion
after cloning you.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:20.520
Let me do it.

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:21.980
No, I should do it.

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:25.442
No, I should do it.
I need you to check Toga's syringe.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.694
You've each made two copies.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.571 line:20%
But I can still make clones.
So I should do it.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:30.947 line:20%
There is no time for chitchat!

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.659
Toga is dying. We should do it together!

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.080
I was hoping to clone
a healthy version of her,

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.083
but she was already badly wounded
when we took the measurements.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.712
Her lovely face is almost ruined.
Can we still fix her?

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.882
Dabi can find a plastic surgeon for her.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.260 line:20%
I will save you!

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.728
<i>I must take some burden off
Shigaraki's shoulder.</i>

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:26.980
Let's go!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.567 line:20%
The guy in charge of buffing the rest
shouldn't be on the front line!

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.279
You'll get blocked from the match
if you don't know your character!

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.990
Is that some kind of teenager slang?

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:41.244
Meaning aside,
your judgment of the situation is astute.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:45.206
But I doubt a weak Meta Ability User
can withstand this.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:14.777
What now?

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.907
-It's a walk in the park!
-Back down!

The most you can do is climb the walls.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.339
If I remember correctly,
you were a shut-in.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.965
People bullied you.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.385
Are you here because you harbor hatred
toward them?

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.638
How unfortunate.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:45.892
I don't see
how you can amount to anything.

00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:53.024
Has he reached that far?
Why didn't our men stop him?

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:57.695 line:20%
I got you!

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.408

Our enemies are trying

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:18.883
I don't see

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.139
I know that better than anyone.

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:29.185
But don't you know?

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.938
Unlike Toga, I don't have anything I like.

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.065
I don't have anything I like to do.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:40.697
<i>But at that moment,
my heart was burning with passion!</i>

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.825
I will lay waste to everything.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:48.746
<i>At that moment, I wanted to witness</i>

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.165
the future he envisioned!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.004
A freeloader who is good for nothing…

00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:58.464 line:20%
Yes, that's me!

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.508 line:20%
What's wrong with that?

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:01.968
Do you have a problem with that?

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.470
You people are just like me!

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.931
Isn't that right, Mr. Politician?

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:11.102

I'm still alive.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.494
I knew Shigaraki would do that.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:29.495
TWICE
QUIRK: DOUBLE

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.377

How do you feel right now?

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.178
So you have 110,000 soldiers with you.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.512
It's been your plan all along

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.057
to just watch while using them
for human wave attacks.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.977
You set up a field to toy with people
weaker than yourself.

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:57.065
You looked down on us,
saying we wouldn't make it here.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.818
But we still got the better of you anyway.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.530
So how do you feel now?

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.244
What do I feel now?

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:17.418
I am furious.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.838
I'm the kind of person who allows anger
to pile up inside of me.

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:24.092 line:20%
That's how I got this forehead.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:29.013
I bet you've killed quite a lot
of my men to reach here.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:33.810
Did you use your hands to destroy them?

<i>The more he gathers,

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:51.410
"Never judge a person
based on their Quirks."

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:55.414
That is a sound adage.
I learned that same lesson myself.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.502
But Meta Abilities are tied
to personalities.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:04.715
What will it be for someone
who can destroy anything his hands touch?

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:10.012
I haven't gotten an answer
from you yet, Little Shigaraki.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.182
What is the burden you carry?
What are you trying to create?

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:18.187 line:20%
Or are you just a void
that creates nothing?

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.190 line:20%

The composition of your heart
is rather unique.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.089
Rage and sorrow will heal over time.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:48.843
Carry them with you wherever you go.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:52.096
Do not let the bond fade away.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.100
Did you get scolded again?

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.563
<i>Hana was my elder sister.</i>

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:03.441
Come on. You could have just kept quiet.

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:07.528
I always tell Dad I want to be his bride.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.113
Okay, let's go.

<i>There was only Hana at that time.
Although it was just her innocent words…</i>

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:27.715
<i>My head is spinning.
Everything is turning around.</i>

00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:30.676
<i>Memories are pouring in.
They are awakened.</i>

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:37.558 line:20%
You are nothing compared to me.

<i>I was told he needed all five fingers
to make contact to use the Quirk.</i>

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.754
<i>Was the information about him mistaken?</i>

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:08.756
<i>Or could it be…</i>

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.850 line:20%
My head is splitting!

<i>If his body was so strong,</i>

<i>he could have decayed a hero or two

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:58.764
<i>Could it be that he has honed his Quirk?</i>

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.642
<i>And this movement…</i>

<i>Only someone who strives to survive

<i>That's not possible.</i>

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.842

I don't need a future.

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.062
Rules are rules.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.523
Do not let him in unless he apologizes.

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.733
Aren't you a little too strict?

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.152
He hasn't manifested any Quirk
at this age.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:43.989
We must make him realize the situation
before he gets hurt.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:47.952 line:20%
His wish to become a hero
will only be his demise.

00:13:48.452 --> 00:13:51.163
Father, Mother, are you against it?

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:56.710
<i>My dad was a businessman.
He became rich despite his young age.</i>

00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:59.338
<i>It was my dad who had this house built,</i>

00:13:59.421 --> 00:14:02.341
<i>so the three generations
could live together.</i>

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.969
<i>All right, stop scratching.</i>

00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:06.512
But it's itchy.

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:07.596
It's difficult to treat it

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.848
since we don't know
what you're allergic to.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.017
I feel itchy when I'm inside the house.

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:17.356
Tenko, do you still want to be a hero?

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:18.357
Yes.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.069
Mi was being rejected by everyone.
The same goes for Tomo.

00:14:22.152 --> 00:14:26.448
So I told them we could play together.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:29.910
We played as heroes and were having fun,

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:34.456
but then Mi told me
I should play as All Might.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.375
They said I was very kind
to play with them

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.918
even though everyone rejected them.

00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:42.923
Why won't Dad let me become a hero?

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:47.303
Is it because he hates me?
Would he agree if I could have a Quirk?

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:53.517
Your dad doesn't hate you.

00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:56.645
But he knows how hard it is to be a hero.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.233 line:20%
<i>The adults' decisions were absolute.</i>

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.196 line:20%
<i>That was why I had hoped</i>

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.285 line:20%
<i>you could come to my defense,
even just for once.</i>

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:17.917
<i>The house my dad built had rejected me
in a rather gentle way.</i>

00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:21.378
-This is a secret.
-What?

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:24.548 line:20%
<i>The kid was surprisingly sneaky
yet innocent.</i>

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:29.845
I think this woman was our grandma.
They said she was a hero.

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:33.057
Hana, why are you showing me this?

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.727
I know what Dad said to you.
But it's all right.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:39.980
I'll always root for you, Tenko.

00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:43.776
Let's become heroes
but keep it a secret from Dad.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.111
Yes.

00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:49.949
<i>My grandma was a hero!</i>

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:53.369
<i>There was a hero in my family!</i>

00:15:55.996 --> 00:16:01.043
<i>Mon, I feel like I can take on
any challenges.</i>

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:07.800
<i>The weather was so hot that day.</i>

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.221
Tenko!

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.306
Did you sneak into my study?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.225
<i>The humidity after the rain</i>

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.395
<i>was piercing my dried skin like needles.</i>

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.438
You saw it.

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:25.359
<i>Gosh. Kids are unbelievable.</i>

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:30.489
Tenko said he wanted to see it!

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.201 line:20%
<i>I could feel the itch
from the bottom of my stomach.</i>

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:36.328 line:20%
Kotaro!

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.456 line:20%
That woman wasn't your grandma.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:41.834
<i>She left her child behind.</i>

00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:44.086 line:20%
She was a demon.

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:46.422
<i>Save me.</i>

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:48.215 line:20%
<i>Don't just stand there.</i>

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:51.301
<i>Please save me!</i>

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:53.053 line:20%
<i>Help!</i>

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.471 line:20%
Listen up.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.307
A hero is the kind of person
who would abandon her family

00:16:57.391 --> 00:16:59.977 line:20%
<i>just to save others' lives!</i>

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:05.482
<i>This is the house my father had built.</i>

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:13.073
<i>I am sorry to have left you
without a word.</i>

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:18.120
<i>I have to battle this very bad guy
and settle the score.</i>

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:22.916
<i>That bad guy might hurt you
when he finds you.</i>

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:27.921
<i>That's why I had to leave you, Kotaro.</i>

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:35.095
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't be
a good mother for you.</i>

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:39.391
<i>I know you might hate me because of this.</i>

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:43.520
<i>But I love you so much, Kotaro.</i>

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.023
<i>I love you so much.</i>

00:17:47.357 --> 00:17:52.279
<i>I hope you live a happy life with a smile.</i>

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:58.786
<i>I'll always watch over you
from above, Kotaro.</i>

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.706
I wish you had just hated me instead.

00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:04.541
I can't take it.

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:08.045
I overdid it this time. The kids…

00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:11.715
If you want to use violence again,
then don't expect us to follow your rules.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.927
You said you wanted
to have a happy family.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.680
This isn't how it should be.

00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:21.892
No.

00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:25.479
I've had enough of this.

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.273
Mon, I can't…

00:18:28.982 --> 00:18:30.651
I can't take it anymore.

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:34.488
I hate…

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.866
<i>I hate everyone!</i>

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.499
What?

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.417
Mon?

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:51.004 line:20%
What?

00:18:52.714 --> 00:18:54.007 line:20%
Tenko.

00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:58.804
Well, I'm sorry. It was my fault.

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:02.224
It was me who told you the secret
and showed you the picture.

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:05.477 line:20%
Mon…

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.230
What's wrong?

00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:12.776
No!

00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:16.697 line:20%
<i>Wait! Don't go!</i>

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.158 line:20%
<i>My voice won't come out! Hana!</i>

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.952
<i>Aren't you here to apologize?</i>

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:24.246
<i>Then keep me safe this time!</i>

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:25.998
<i>Help me!</i>

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:31.211
<i>I thought some kind of supervillain
had come after our family.</i>

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:34.006 line:20%
<i>Whether it was Mon's decay</i>

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:37.634
<i>or Hana's…</i>

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:41.471
<i>It was all his doing.</i>

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.647
<i>No…</i>

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:54.902
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

00:19:55.527 --> 00:20:00.449
<i>perhaps I had already realized the truth.</i>

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.703
<i>Why would you defend Dad
after what he did?</i>

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:08.165
<i>Why did you keep telling me not to cry?</i>

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.501
<i>I've had enough of this.</i>

00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:14.588
<i>The tiny bits of pain piled up.</i>

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:17.341 line:20%
<i>I hate everyone!</i>

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:21.261
Tenko…

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.413
<i>I hope you live a happy life</i>

00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:51.333
<i>with a smile.</i>

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:57.214
Dad.

00:20:57.297 --> 00:21:00.008
I'm sorry.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.143
Dad.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:11.937
Dad.

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:16.650
Stop it, Tenko!

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:21.113
<i>At that very moment,
I clearly had the intention to kill.</i>

00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:24.783 line:20%
<i>When I touched my dad…</i>

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.119
Die!

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:32.207 line:20%
<i>An unspeakable exhilaration filled
my limbs and ran in my veins.</i>

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:36.628
<i>Perhaps deep down, I had hoped for this</i>

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.131
<i>to happen.</i>

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:46.722 line:20%
<i>Ever since then, the itch has stopped.</i>

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:19.064
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:23.610 line:20%
<i>He had lost everything,
including the purpose to keep living.</i>

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:26.696
<i>It was at this time
a hand reached out to him.</i>

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.449
<i>Tenko Shimura's life took
a 180-degree turn.</i>

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.746
<i>An heir of the demon lord was born.</i>

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.749
<i>Next episode, "Tomura Shigaraki: Origin."</i>

00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:42.379 line:20%
<i>Do not suppress or fear
the impulse in your heart.</i>

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.131
<i>Go beyond.</i>

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:45.632
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
