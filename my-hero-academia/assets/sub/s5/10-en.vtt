00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:01.751
CLASS A VS CLASS B

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:08.091 line:20%
<i>Class A and Class B of U.A. High</i>
<i>are in a joint training battle.</i>

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.681 line:20%
<i>In the fourth battle,</i>

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.101
<i>Class A displayed great teamwork</i>
<i>with Kacchan as their main force</i>

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.186
<i>and secured an overwhelming victory.</i>

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.235 line:20%
All right! It's the fifth battle!

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.779
<i>This is the last round.</i>

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.740
<i>Are you ready?</i>

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.951 line:20%
<i>Never let your guard down! All the best!</i>

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:38.788
<i>Start!</i>

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.553
It's No. 1541.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.804
He's on the move again.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.098
It's happened so many times
since yesterday.

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.643
I hope the verdict and execution
can be done as soon as possible.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.854
At this rate, we won't be able to keep up.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.106
It's not like,
"One murder makes a villain."

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.817
"Millions a hero."

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.278
Is that a line from Chaplin's movie?

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.238
It just happened recently.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.531
Gigantomachia.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.826
<i>He served All For One directly.</i>

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:43.872
<i>It's not just</i>
<i>Shigaraki's League of Villains.</i>

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:48.585
Who knows how many are sharing
the same ideal with this guy?

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.838
It's best not to provoke them for now.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.593
<i>Oh, my!</i>
<i>I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.</i>

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.931
<i>The nostalgia is giving me an itch.</i>

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.439
I can hear my little brother's voice.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:21.242 line:20%
<i>-You have a phone call!</i>
-Excuse me.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:25.121 line:20%
<i>-You have a phone call!</i>
-Please turn that off. Jeez.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.708 line:20%
<i>-You have a phone call…</i>
-Sorry, but I have to answer this call.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.878
I appreciate you calling me so soon.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:34.505
But I'm in the middle of a lesson.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.884
<i>-It's about Izuku Midoriya's dream.</i>
-What?

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.802
Could you explain what it is?

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.262
GRAN TORINO
QUIRK: JET

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:46.059
You asked me whether Shimura said
anything about One For All's visage.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.896 line:20%
<i>Since you asked,</i>
<i>it actually jogged my memory.</i>

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.899 line:20%
<i>But it's from a time so long ago.</i>

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.651 line:20%
<i>So don't expect too much from me.</i>

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:59.739
It happened soon after
Shimura inherited One For All.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.535
Listen to me, Gran Torino.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.537
I had a weird dream last night.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.373
-A dream?
-Yes.

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:11.459
A dark and misty guy
appeared right before me.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.754
That guy looked at me and said,

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.800
"It's not the right time yet."

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:23.596 line:20%
<i>Well, that's about it.</i>

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:26.766
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.561
Excuse me,
but I'm still in the middle of a class.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:31.604
I must hang up now.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.194
<i>"It's not the right time yet."</i>

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:42.198
<i>That means the time</i>
<i>will come sooner or later.</i>

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.369 line:20%
<i>Has One For All's heir</i>
<i>inherited something else?</i>

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.998
<i>Class B has Shinso on their team.</i>

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.875
<i>I must not talk to him when we meet.</i>

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:57.380
<i>I'm still wary</i>
<i>about One For All's secrets.</i>

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:01.050 line:20%
<i>I can't afford</i>
<i>to be brainwashed by Shinso.</i>

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.972
Ever since I was a kid,
people have been telling me…

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.810
<i>I could never become a superhero</i>
<i>with my Quirk.</i>

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:12.645 line:20%
HITOSHI SHINSO
QUIRK: BRAINWASH

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.147 line:20%
Why are you telling us now?

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:17.025
I mean I know I can't do it by myself.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.902
I won't last long
if their Quirks aren't compatible.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.739
I do admire you.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.907 line:20%
We share quite the similarities.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:28.244
I don't like that.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.163
But that's a fact.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:35.460
How did you manage to brainwash Midoriya?
How did you make him talk to you?

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.712
I didn't know what kind of person he was,

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.422
so I mocked his classmates.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.215
Really?

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:46.262
In order to become a hero,
one must speak and act like one.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:50.391
Otherwise, we won't be able to overcome
the power that can do anything.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.144
Our goal will become unclear.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.230
Have you felt this way before?

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:59.650
Your childhood dreams and hopes

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.528
are slowly becoming your burden
as you grow older.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.947
It's like a curse.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:16.084 line:20%
The formation of Midoriya's team
is similar to Bakugo's team.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.127
They share the same team balance.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.504
But Jiro's role…

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.839
I was the scout of my team.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.341
They don't have a scout.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:26.511
They must be more cautious
so the enemies don't decimate them.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:27.804 line:20%
You have a point.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.515 line:20%
If they want to bait the enemies
to locate them,

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:34.185 line:20%
Midoriya has to take more risk
than Bakugo did.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.648 line:20%
<i>I need to draw their attention</i>
<i>and act as a decoy.</i>

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:43.403
<i>I doubt Class B can overlook my speed.</i>

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.370
<i>I will draw their attacks.</i>
<i>That should help me locate them.</i>

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:54.747
<i>Then our team can proceed</i>
<i>with the capturing.</i>

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.082 line:20%
<i>They are here!</i>

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.211 line:20%
<i>It's Yanagi's Quirk, Poltergeist!</i>

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.465
<i>Monoma is here!</i>

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.595
Oh, my! You found me.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:12.598
After seeing Bakugo's coordination,

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.725
we're going to just ignore you.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:18.980
Being wary of a strong and agile opponent

00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:21.607
is what normally the smart would think.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:26.362
But anyone smart enough
would also think otherwise.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:32.452 line:20%
<i>Bakugo did so well</i>
<i>because of their excellent teamwork.</i>

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.830
<i>This is why we should take down</i>
<i>the other three first.</i>

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:40.084
I bet you drew our attention to locate us.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.961
But on the other hand,

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:44.630
my teammates are almost
in range to attack yours.

00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:46.299
<i>He is provoking me.</i>

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.760
<i>Perhaps he already copied Shinso's Quirk.</i>

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:53.598
It's three against four.
Are you sure they can hold up?

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:57.226
We also have Shinso on our team.
You can get into contact unnoticed.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.230
Perhaps you should go
to your teammates now.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.565
Wait.

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:06.110
What if the screaming was Shinso's voice?

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:11.782
Then you had already exposed
the location of your team.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.368
This must be troubling for you.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.080
That was cold.

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:21.000
You didn't bother to look
in your teammates' direction!

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:23.544
<i>He is trying to locate them</i>
<i>with my line of sight.</i>

00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:25.004
<i>I won't fall for it!</i>

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.423
Such a nuisance.

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.634
<i>Class B, Neito Monoma.</i>

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:31.844
<i>Hero name: Phantom Thief.</i>

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.346
<i>Quirk: Copy.</i>

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:37.141
<i>Once he touches the target, he can use</i>
<i>their Quirk freely for five minutes.</i>

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.477
<i>But he can't use two Quirks</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.021
<i>He is using Yanagi's Quirk!</i>

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:47.860
Release.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.989 line:20%
The noises just now…

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.241 line:20%
It wasn't me.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.868
Was it Shinso? He's closing in.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:59.205 line:20%
I would love to see his dull face
when he starts yelling for help!

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:01.582
Please look at us when you talk.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:04.877 line:20%
I got something.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.966
Acid Veil!

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:13.803
It's gone.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.682
Did they block it? Or was it a trap?

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.603
It's Yanagi's Poltergeist!

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.105
She is attacking blindly!

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.608 line:20%
<i>Class B, Reiko Yanagi.</i>

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.360 line:20%
<i>Hero name: Emily.</i>

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:31.320 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Poltergeist.</i>

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.656 line:20%
<i>She can control objects around her,</i>

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:37.368 line:20%
<i>but the maximum load</i>
<i>is about the weight of a person.</i>

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.085 line:20%
<i>Class B, Yui Kodai.</i>

00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:47.628 line:20%
<i>Hero name: Rule.</i>

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.005 line:20%
<i>Quirk: Size.</i>

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:51.591 line:20%
<i>It's the ability to manipulate</i>
<i>the size of objects.</i>

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.801 line:20%
<i>But she can't use the Quirk on creatures.</i>

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:55.219
Release.

00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:05.271
Twin Impact!

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:06.480
Fire!

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.449
I can roughly tell where they are heading.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.119
<i>Class B, Nirengeki Shoda.</i>

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:21.787
<i>Hero name: Mines.</i>

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.873
<i>Quirk: Twin Impact.</i>

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:26.000
<i>His Quirk allows him to strike a target</i>

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:28.669
<i>and inflict a second impact</i>
<i>on the point of contact.</i>

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:32.048
<i>The second impact is several times</i>
<i>stronger than the initial blow.</i>

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.924
Split up. Don't let them spot you.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.801
I am reloading the second batch.

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:38.929
That was scary.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:43.184
Where is Midoriya?
He's supposed to be our decoy.

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:46.312
They might have caught our location
from the attack just now.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.730
Where is Deku?

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.526
I talked to Shinso.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:56.280
The privileged will bring
the world to ruins.

00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:59.116
Since you're his friend, then tell me.

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:05.331
How can Bakugo laugh
as if nothing is happening?

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.001
<i>He was captured by the villains.</i>

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.088
Wasn't he the one who destroyed

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.840 line:20%
our symbol of peace?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.815
<i>That guy looked at me and said,</i>

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.276
<i>"It's not the right time yet."</i>

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.780
<i>The right time. But when is it?</i>

00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:40.574
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:49.417
He has more abilities I didn't know.
This is getting annoying.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.962
<i>Why? What is this?</i>

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:55.589
<i>Everything was normal up until just now.</i>

00:11:58.634 --> 00:11:59.844
Run!

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.601
Shinso!

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:15.276
Shinso…

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.153
Run!

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.946
I can't…

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:21.073
control this power!

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:28.372
I can't hold it anymore!

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:35.171
What is that?

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.308
Deku!

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.062 line:20%
What is going on? Stop it!

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.773 line:20%
What is this? Stop it!

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.524
<i>It hurts!</i>

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.735
<i>Why?</i>

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.406 line:20%
Midoriya has a new attack.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.617
Aizawa! Vlad!

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.869
We should stop him now.

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.454 line:20%
Something is not right.

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:09.955 line:20%
SHOTA AIZAWA
QUIRK: ERASURE

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.666
<i>Why?</i>

00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:17.129
<i>Ever since I inherited the Quirk</i>
<i>from All Might,</i>

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.507 line:20%
<i>there are too many things</i>
<i>I don't understand</i>

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.050
<i>while I was badly injured.</i>

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.470
Stop it now!

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:25.638 line:20%
<i>Even so…</i>

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.060
<i>I finally learned to control this power!</i>

00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:35.397
<i>Stop it now! One For All!</i>

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:39.568
<i>I don't want to make anyone worry again!</i>

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.576 line:20%
Deku! Calm down!

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:51.622
NEITO MONOMA
QUIRK: COPY

00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:53.916
CAN COPY THE QUIRK
OF THE TARGET HE TOUCHES

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.876
OCHACO URARAKA
QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.087
REMOVES THE GRAVITY
OF ANYTHING SHE TOUCHES

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.756
<i>My parents always looked so exhausted.</i>

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.217
<i>It pains me to see them so tired.</i>

00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:07.638
<i>When I first witnessed</i>
<i>the mission of a Pro Hero…</i>

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.353
<i>Compared to the hero that saved the day,</i>

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:17.273
<i>I was more attracted</i>
<i>to the cheers of the crowd.</i>

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:24.655 line:20%
<i>I liked seeing the happiness</i>
<i>on their faces.</i>

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:31.120
<i>In my eyes,</i>
<i>helping those in need is my duty.</i>

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:34.707
<i>And that duty…</i>

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.751 line:20%
<i>could come with great risks</i>
<i>and challenges.</i>

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:43.340
<i>Even if I try my best,</i>

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:47.261
<i>he never stops helping those in danger,</i>
<i>and that inspires me.</i>

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:50.848 line:20%
Deku!

00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:56.228 line:20%
<i>Who is there to protect the heroes</i>
<i>when they are in need?</i>

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.112 line:20%
I can't control it at all!

00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:06.864
<i>This isn't Deku's doing.</i>

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.911
Shinso!

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.079
Brainwash him now!

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.707
Help me stop Deku's rampage!

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.211
<i>She wants me to brainwash Midoriya.</i>

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.172
<i>But what should I say?</i>

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.721
<i>You defeated me on sports day.</i>

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.142
<i>I've been excited since then.</i>

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.646
<i>I want you to see how much I've grown.</i>

00:15:40.522 --> 00:15:42.983
<i>I've looked forward</i>
<i>to meeting you in a battle.</i>

00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:49.031 line:20%
<i>I want to become a true hero</i>
<i>that saves lives with my Quirk!</i>

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.619
Midoriya!

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.749
Fight me!

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.758
Very well!

00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:26.568
<i>I'm here again.</i>

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.572
Hey, you!

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:33.325 line:20%
You've got it wrong!

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:34.827 line:20%
Wrong!

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.578
Didn't I tell you?

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.206 line:20%
I told you that you weren't alone!

00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:40.749 line:20%
I told you the time had come.

00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:42.209 line:20%
Haven't you noticed?

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.711
However,

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.046
this power…

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.092
is not something you can control
while your mind is full of distractions.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.887
<i>He was one of the heirs.</i>

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.306 line:20%
You need to work harder!

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.561
If you work hard enough,
you can figure out most of the problems!

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:03.814
Can't you talk?

00:17:03.897 --> 00:17:05.190
Don't mind!

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:07.276
<i>I can see him very clearly.</i>

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.988
<i>This is more than just a blurry visage.</i>

00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:12.948
<i>It's not a dream either.</i>

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.950
<i>This man…</i>

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.119
<i>These people…</i>

00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:22.458
<i>Are they all living inside One For All?</i>

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.377
What?

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:28.255
It seems like we're running out of time.

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:29.757
Hey, young man.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.926
The power you wield right now is my Quirk.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.969
<i>What?</i>

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:38.348 line:20%
Our Quirk factors are mixed up
inside the core of this power.

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:42.186
<i>They exist inside One For All's tiny core.</i>

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:45.355
<i>It's like a flickering flame.</i>

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:48.734
<i>Or you could say,</i>
<i>it's like a dot on the glittering water.</i>

00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.945
<i>It's been buried under the power</i>
<i>you've cultivated so far.</i>

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:53.489
<i>This is its primal state.</i>

00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:56.867
<i>That core is now expanding.</i>

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.952
<i>It's begun to move.</i>

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.998
<i>Like a flickering image in the crevice,</i>

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:06.001
the power of One For All…

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.128
is growing.

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:11.340
<i>What is going on?</i>

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.800
Hey.

00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:18.806
<i>Were you trying to capture</i>
<i>or grab that target?</i>

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.892
I bet that was your plan.

00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:24.603
<i>I wanted to capture Monoma.</i>

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:29.233
The best Quirk that responds
to that thought is my Quirk, Blackwhip.

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:33.695
You should be grateful
I'm the first one you've ever met.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.781
This is a wonderful Quirk.

00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:38.075
However,

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:43.205
due to the accumulated power
of One For All,

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:46.125
this Quirk is much stronger
than when I wielded it.

00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:49.753
Well, I'm disappearing now.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.256
I used to float around like a specter.

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:56.051
That's because my consciousness
is what's left of me.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.595
Listen closely.

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:02.432
If you use the power with rage,
it answers your call.

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:03.642
So your priority…

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:05.978
is to control your heart.

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:11.859 line:20%
Having rage is a good thing.
It's the source of power.

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:17.030
That's all the more reason
to focus on controlling your rage.

00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:19.992
After being held by eight users,

00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:23.495
One For All is powerful
beyond imagination.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.330
Listen closely, young man.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:29.334
Six more Quirks will manifest
in you in the future.

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:33.338
Learn to master your heart.
Use these abilities as yours.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.259
All the best, young man!
We're watching over you!

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:39.970
The only one who can make
One For All whole…

00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:41.263
is you!

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:46.977
Deku!

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.479
Deku!

00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:51.690
Deku!

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:53.317
Did that hurt?

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.776
Uraraka…

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.820
Stay away from me! It's too dangerous!

00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:58.197
Don't worry.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.407
Shinso's brainwash calmed you down.

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.326
Shinso…

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.539
Are you all right?

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.918
Uraraka, you're hurt!

00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:14.671
My goodness! What have I done?

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:20.886
<i>Gunhead Martial Arts!</i>

00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:26.016
The match is not over yet!

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:26.934
Release.

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:28.060
Fire!

00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:37.444
Those rampaging black tentacles
ruined our attack plan.

00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:40.072
-Yes.
-Nice timing!

00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:41.740
Are you all right?

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:43.367
What was that just now?

00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:46.536
I found you! Eat this!

00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:49.915
Midoriya! Uraraka! Are you all right?

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:51.708 line:20%
Everyone is here!

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.752
Let's get ready to rumble!

00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:56.004
<i>Eat this!</i>

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:01.385
<i>If you use the power with rage,</i>
<i>it answers your call.</i>

00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:05.347
<i>So your priority is to control your heart.</i>

00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:08.809
<i>I can't let anyone else get hurt.</i>

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:14.982
What?

00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:17.484
<i>What should I do now?</i>

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.237
<i>I feel like my mind is going to explode!</i>

00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:26.076
Eraser Head, how should we proceed?

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:31.540
-All Might.
-Yes?

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.126
Let's observe for a little while.

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:35.877
Aizawa, what do you mean?

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:37.963
The fifth battle…

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.590
should proceed.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.812
<i>Next episode…</i>

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:20.315
<i>One For All went on a rampage.</i>

00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:23.235
<i>It's too risky to use the Quirk again.</i>

00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:25.404
<i>But I'm not giving up on the battle.</i>

00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:28.949 line:20%
<i>Shinso and Monoma</i>
<i>aren't going to give up either.</i>

00:23:29.032 --> 00:23:30.826 line:20%
<i>I must give it my all,</i>

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.162
<i>for my team, and to secure our victory!</i>

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.873
<i>Next episode, "Our Brawl!"</i>

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:40.293
<i>Remember why you took this path!</i>

00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:42.003
<i>Go beyond!</i>

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:43.380
<i>Plus Ultra!</i>
