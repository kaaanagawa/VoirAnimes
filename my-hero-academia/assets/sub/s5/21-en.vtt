00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:05.171
<i>At the dawn of the Meta Abilities</i>
<i>and the troubles that ensued,</i>

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:10.593
<i>people were hoping to coexist with those</i>
<i>who possessed Meta Abilities.</i>

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:14.180
<i>Then among the Meta Ability Users,</i>
<i>an ideology started to emerge.</i>

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.225 line:20%
<i>They wanted liberation</i>
<i>instead of suppression.</i>

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.602 line:20%
<i>They preached the freedom</i>

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.188 line:20%
<i>to use their powers</i>
<i>and consider it a basic human right.</i>

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.233
<i>His name was Chikara Yotsubashi.</i>

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:29.279
<i>He gave himself the name "Destro,"</i>
<i>the man who would bring down the system.</i>

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.535
<i>Destro mustered those</i>
<i>who shared his ideals</i>

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.954
<i>and founded the "Meta Liberation Army."</i>

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.915
<i>He and his organization</i>
<i>opposed the country,</i>

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.417
<i>but the campaign failed years later.</i>

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:46.963
<i>Most of the members were arrested.</i>
<i>The organization was disbanded.</i>

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.089
PARANORMAL LIBERATION FRONT

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:51.718
<i>After he finished writing his book</i>
<i>in prison, Destro took his own life.</i>

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.476
<i>But Destro wasn't aware</i>
<i>of the child he had.</i>

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.772
How is the progress?

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:07.400
We've found several people who could be
linked to the League of Villains.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.028
We must hurry if we want to approach him.

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:12.864
They are the enemies of our organization.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:18.328 line:20%
The government's hands are tied.
So we must resolve this threat.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:23.249
I will dismantle the League of Villains
as Re-Destro.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.718 line:20%
DEIKA CITY

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.636 line:20%
This place is pretty remote.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.181
The town is not that impressive.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.682
I like the vibe here.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.017
That angers me!

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.562
The Liberation Army
has over 110,000 members here.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:08.813 line:20%
MR. COMPRESS
QUIRK: COMPRESS

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.774 line:20%
Gigantomachia will be awake
in 1 hour and 40 minutes.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:15.570
If he pursues Shigaraki to this place,
he will clash with the Liberation Army.

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:18.448
After they've killed each other off,
we'll come out on top.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:21.910
But can we even hold on for that long?

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:22.869 line:20%
Come on.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.538 line:20%
Why am I dragged into this mess as well?

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.790
You only joined because Giran
introduced you to us.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.292 line:20%
These are two different matters.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.211 line:20%
You jerk…

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.420
Someone is coming.

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:37.300
Stop!

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:40.220
I was ordered to be your guide.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.430 line:20%
If you wish to see the commander,

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:44.182 line:20%
then come with me.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.516 line:20%
A pro hero?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.769 line:20%
But I'm not sure if I know him.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.191
The streets are empty.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.325 line:20%
I see what's going on here.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.118
-You got that right.
-What?

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.497
This is Deika City.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.543
It's a liberation zone where over 90%
of the residents are sleeper agents.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.506
I appreciate your long journey
to the city.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.468
It's a day to remember,
and you are our special guests.

00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:23.346
Isn't that Hanabata,
from the Hearts and Mind Party?

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.514
Is he famous?

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.308
Now let's begin.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.644 line:20%
The Meta Liberation Army's

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.188 line:20%
revival party!

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.316
They really have over 110,000 fighters.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.860 line:20%
Whatever.
We're here now, so where is Giran?

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:42.615
The broker is waiting over there
with our Grand Commander.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.827
You promised you would let him go!
You pointy fringe!

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.079
A medium-level boss.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.416
Tomura Shigaraki!

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.836
Anyway, press on to the tower.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.171
This is what I'm good at.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.096
The ground exploded.

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.724 line:20%
The real culprit of a series
of blood loss-related deaths,

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.269
the villain, Himiko Toga.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.605
Why would a high school student
become a fanatic?

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.942
This interview about the culprit's life
will be impactful.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.028
Do I have the honor to interview you?

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.529
What?

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.364
No way.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:30.079
<i>You made two mistakes.</i>

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.789
First of all,

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:35.835
no one would want a middle-aged guy
to play the damsel in distress.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:39.505 line:20%
Your second mistake, as long as they send
an endless wave of Nomu,

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.467 line:20%
this rusty small town will be razed.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.384 line:20%
VILLAIN: RE-DESTRO

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.511 line:20%
They won't send the Nomu.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.599
There are three reasons.
That's more points than your take.

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:51.851
<i>First of all,</i>

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:55.229
<i>League of Villains' every operation</i>
<i>was accompanied by Nomu.</i>

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:59.025
<i>But after the battle at Kamino Ward,</i>
<i>they became a myth no one ever sees again</i>

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.528
<i>despite the League of Villains'</i>
<i>operations never ceasing.</i>

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:07.492
<i>The second reason is the high-performance</i>
<i>Nomu that showed up in Kyushu.</i>

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:11.412
<i>The main point being the white Nomus</i>
<i>that were ejected from the dark Nomu.</i>

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.044
<i>There were signs of modifications,</i>
<i>but their performances were mediocre.</i>

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.463
Now the third reason…

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.841
I'm only here to retrieve Nomu.

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:26.677
<i>Dabi claimed to have come</i>
<i>to retrieve the Nomu.</i>

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:33.309
<i>That indicated they had no other</i>
<i>functioning Nomu that could be used.</i>

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:38.022
All the aforementioned reasons
lead to the conclusion that

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.025
the Nomus were nothing but a utility
from their sponsor All For One.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.568
So it's logical to assume

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:46.030
they have no Nomu left
to send into battles.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.534
Without the Nomu, the League of Villains

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.037
<i>is nothing but a bunch</i>
<i>of low-grade grunts.</i>

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.044 line:20%
Every one of them is strong!

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:04.715
Our sleeper agents spent
every day honing their skills.

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:09.178
<i>They trained the body</i>
<i>and mind to the limits</i>

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.181
<i>for the sake of living</i>
<i>like a proper human being.</i>

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:15.810
Young people like you
are a pain in the neck.

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:19.522
A bunch of people without any grand vision
stole the spotlight.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:24.819
Himiko Toga,
you seem to despise interviews.

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:26.070
But, I'm sorry,

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:30.450
I stopped caring for my interviewees
in the first year of my career.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.495
Himiko Toga, everything about you
will be known to the world.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:39.083
I have very little interest in the League,
but you are special.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.878
<i>"What Was The Young Girl's Reason</i>
<i>To Hurt People?"</i>

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.838
<i>I bet that will be a juicy article.</i>

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:47.300
The reporter in me is so eager to…

00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:48.885
<i>She's gone.</i>

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.888
<i>So this is why she has never been caught.</i>

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:52.847
<i>Where is she?</i>

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:02.356
She has no hesitation
in taking another person's life!

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.025
This is so exciting!

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:06.777
What have you gone through in your life?

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.324
Be careful over there.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.662
The warriors have no mercy.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:20.291
If you don't wish to die so soon,
then behave and let me interview you.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.794
<i>Chitose Kizuki. Code name: "Curious."</i>

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.254
<i>Quirk: Landmine.</i>

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.423
<i>Anything she touches can be turned</i>
<i>into explosives.</i>

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.051
<i>It's not lethal, but it can be devastating</i>
<i>in great numbers.</i>

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:42.396
A syringe. I get it now.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.982
<i>She can transform by consuming</i>
<i>another person's blood.</i>

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:49.237
<i>She consumed the blood of several people</i>
<i>so I can't pinpoint her location.</i>

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.781
She has remarkable reflexes.

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:55.910
You possess the survival skill an ordinary
killer can only dream of having.

00:08:55.993 --> 00:08:58.746 line:20%
What happened in your life
that made you learn such skills?

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.586
<i>The blood exploded?</i>

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.218
Forget about blending in by transforming.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:16.264
I have warriors who sacrificed their lives
to become my explosive devices.

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.643
The first child of the Toga family,
born on August 7th, 17 years old.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.937
You went missing after graduating
from middle school.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.482
Have you watched those interviews
with your parents?

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.402
What about the interviews
with your middle school classmates?

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.028
They all said the same thing.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.823
They said you were a cheerful
and kind little girl.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:38.160
What could have made you do
those horrible things?

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.665
Why did you forfeit your normal life?

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.503
I know.

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.464 line:20%
I know your pain.

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:54.510
I would love to hear it from you.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:56.721
<i>Kizuki.</i>

00:09:58.055 --> 00:10:01.517
This kind of article is never going
to interest the public.

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:05.479
Documentaries and rumors
are not enough to inspire people.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.983
You need to interview the person
and look at their face.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.736
The scoop that will fan
the public's opinion

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:14.614
is hidden within the human heart.

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:17.908 line:20%
Use your heart to redirect
the public's opinion.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.077 line:20%
This is for the sake
of the Liberation Army!

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.331 line:20%
Tell us the story
of how you became a lunatic!

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:25.708 line:20%
"A normal life," you said.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.085
What is that?

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:35.217
<i>The expression on her face</i>
<i>is like a puppet.</i>

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:38.012
You finally talked.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:44.018
The Liberation Army is going to create
a wonderful world.

00:10:44.518 --> 00:10:47.271
That's why I like you people.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.447 line:20%
This is very normal to me!

00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:58.574
HIMIKO TOGA
QUIRK: TRANSFORM

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.035
SHE CAN TURN INTO ANYONE
BY CONSUMING THEIR BLOOD

00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:02.536
WHY THE GRADUATION CEREMONY?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.996
<i>The girl who is responsible</i>

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.583 line:20%
<i>for cutting and heavily wounding</i>
<i>her classmate is still at large.</i>

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.877 line:20%
<i>The police are still searching for her.</i>

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.463 line:20%
<i>Toga always had a smile on her face.</i>

00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:13.798 line:20%
<i>She had a kind heart.</i>

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:15.508 line:20%
<i>I still can't believe what she did.</i>

00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:17.927 line:20%
<i>I saw it back then.</i>

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.179 line:20%
<i>Toga was drinking Saito's blood.</i>

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:23.182
<i>She put a straw into his wound.</i>

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.061
<i>She seemed to enjoy the taste of it.</i>

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.314 line:20%
<i>It was terrifying to watch.</i>

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.068
<i>I don't know what we could do to repent.</i>

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.404
<i>We tried our best but to no avail.</i>

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:39.782
<i>That child was a demon.</i>

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:44.620
Mom, Dad, the little birdie is so cute.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.163
Isn't it cute?

00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.999
"This is very normal to me"?

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.627
How interesting.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.630
So that's your true nature.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.760
I knew I still had a knack
for sniffing out a scoop like this.

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:04.098
You are the embodiment
of the superhuman society's darker side.

00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:10.062
Poor thing.
Your body is covered in wounds.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.814
You are the unfortunate young girl

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.567
who became lost
after suppressing her abilities.

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:19.196
That's who you are, Himiko Toga.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:25.828
The ability you were born with
gave you a strong yearning for blood.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:30.833
So cute, so pretty.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.710
<i>But the true misfortune of it all</i>

00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:36.505
<i>was the simple yearning</i>
<i>that is normal for everyone,</i>

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:42.094
<i>which eventually fused</i>
<i>with your interest in blood.</i>

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:46.348
<i>All and all, your behavior would never</i>
<i>be accepted in the superhuman society.</i>

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:49.685
<i>So you put on a disguise</i>

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.855
<i>to mask your true nature.</i>

00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:54.565
Stop it!

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:55.941
Are you out of your mind?

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.943
Stop smiling like that!

00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.528
<i>Your face gives me the creep.</i>

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.238
<i>You're a lunatic.</i>

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:04.575
<i>Why can't you just be normal?</i>

00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:06.494
<i>Can you please be a normal child?</i>

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:10.664
You're getting on my nerve!

00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:14.084
Detnerat Custom-made Chain Ring!

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.089 line:20%
Curious Flattener!

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.802
The normal life you seek
is not unlike the world envisioned

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.220
by the Liberation Army.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.596
And because of that,

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:30.100
you will be the martyr to show the world
the cause of the Meta Liberation Army!

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.148
<i>Your life story will be preached</i>
<i>and sung like a legend.</i>

00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:40.361
If my assumption was wrong,
I would need you to correct me.

00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:42.696
Please let me hear it from you.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:46.742
That is the only way
to complete the interview.

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:48.911
No!

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.581
You're not going anywhere! You came to us!

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.626
<i>She is annoying.</i>

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:57.962
<i>I've never thought it was a misfortune.</i>

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.758
<i>I laugh when I feel happy.</i>

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.138
<i>Just as you would kiss</i>
<i>the people you like,</i>

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:11.100
<i>I drink the blood of people I like.</i>

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:14.603
<i>How is that misfortune?</i>

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.480
I see! She's been keeping stock!

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.232
Come on, you're making me tear up!

00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:23.988
I know your ability
can only transform your look.

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:26.574
"At least die with a cute look."

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.367
Poor girl.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.995
<i>This is the last drop of blood</i>
<i>from that day.</i>

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:35.124
<i>Izuku trusted Ochaco a lot.</i>

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:39.003
<i>That feels so great!</i>

00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:41.755
<i>I wish I could be so close</i>
<i>to the people I like.</i>

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:47.344
Please tell me what you have to say!

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:51.724 line:20%
No!

00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:58.856 line:20%
<i>I want to be like you.</i>

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:07.239
<i>I've been hunted down by police</i>
<i>and pro heroes every day.</i>

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:10.784
<i>That sharpened my awareness</i>
<i>of the surroundings.</i>

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.204
<i>People would think I'm friendly</i>

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.457
<i>as long as</i>
<i>I dress like a high school girl.</i>

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:21.921
<i>I can't let them catch me.</i>

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:26.216
<i>I can use Ochaco's Quirk!</i>

00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:29.303
How is this happening?

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:32.973
The file says she can only
transform her appearance!

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.099
Could this be

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:36.685
a developed form of her power?

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:40.314
Her fear of death has made her grow!

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.608
No.

00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:46.445
I will fall in love.
I'll live a life and die a normal person.

00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:50.908
I will definitely

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:53.160
like it even more!

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:56.246
This will be an incredible headline.

00:15:57.581 --> 00:15:59.083
It will be the best article out there!

00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:09.802
More of them just keep coming!

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.721
You barely took anyone down.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.307
Toga went missing! Where is she now?

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:19.311
<i>What a mess…</i>

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.647
<i>I'm just like Izuku from that day.</i>

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:26.318
<i>For the sake of that big, old man,</i>
<i>it was best not to kill her.</i>

00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:30.406
<i>But it couldn't be helped.</i>

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:37.454
<i>I should destroy anything</i>
<i>that gets on my nerve.</i>

00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:39.957
<i>Tomura…</i>

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.420
<i>I can really use some sleep now.</i>

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.298
Shigaraki!

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:51.510
<i>It happens when I feel sleepy.</i>

00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:55.014
<i>Still things look like they are moving.</i>

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:57.891
<i>I even hear sounds that aren't real.</i>

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:01.937
<i>Useless information</i>
<i>keeps flooding into my brain.</i>

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:05.774
<i>I'm certain my body functions</i>
<i>are bugging out.</i>

00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:09.153
<i>What is happening to me?</i>

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.740
<i>Yet another flashback.</i>

00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:18.537
<i>My memory is blank, but somehow</i>
<i>I still remember the emotions.</i>

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.831
<i>At this moment,</i>

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.168
<i>I feel oddly happy.</i>

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:27.796 line:20%
<i>But why?</i>

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:30.632 line:20%
Fear not. I am…

00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:34.720
<i>Just show me the whole picture already.</i>

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.515
I'll be there to root for you, Tenko.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.935
<i>This feels like a broken record.</i>

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:44.813
<i>I'm tired of this.</i>

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:48.192
<i>It's disgusting me!</i>

00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:04.374 line:20%
<i>Was I delusional, or did he…</i>

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:08.921
<i>Did he destroy those people</i>
<i>without making physical contact?</i>

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.591
Shigaraki, are you…

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:17.304 line:20%
Our leader has shown his trick.
It's time to show mine.

00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:19.807
Showing mercy and sparing lives
was never my style.

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:26.814
I see. It's ice.

00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:30.400
That's a huge chunk of ice.
How did I miss that?

00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:34.071
Maybe I've become stronger since then.

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:36.073
I understand now.

00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:38.534
You must be very powerful.

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:44.039
Blueflame Dabi, the only man in
the League who uses wide-range attacks.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.416
Why didn't you unleash
your flame right away?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.046
Were you waiting for something?
Is your Quirk still working at all?

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.133
Oh, dear. It seems like you don't know.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:57.344
I guess I'll make an exception
and tell you the answer!

00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:59.096
Ice melts!

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.684
I see. That could be troublesome.

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:07.229
It seems like you don't know,
but I'll let you in on a secret.

00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:09.940
I can control ice.

00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:14.319
I've been honing my Quirk.

00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:19.158
I skipped school and trained so much more
than those heroes.

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:23.078
The Grand Commander made me stronger.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:27.040 line:20%
So you had a wonderful life. How pitiful!

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:30.711
Your half-hearted flame can't melt my ice.

00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:35.841
Dabi, don't overdo it!

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.218
The team is scattered.

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:39.553
Let's see.

00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:41.096
Dabi is over there.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.515
Shigaraki is with Spinner.

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:46.435
Toga went ahead of us but is now missing.

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.980
Where is Twice? He was here earlier.

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:53.358
No way.

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:54.276
It's true.

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:57.529
I was worried about her
and wondering where she could be.

00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:58.697
I don't care about her.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.117
No way! This can't be happening! Toga!

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.411
This can't be happening! It's happened!

00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:06.914
Her skin is cold to the touch.

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.749
Damn it! Why is it so hot?

00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:09.666
Shut it!

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.377
I can't calm down! She's covered in blood!

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.379
Is she breathing? No, she's not!

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.465
What happened to her face?
Is that the enemy's blood?

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:17.424
It's her blood!

00:20:17.507 --> 00:20:19.801
Let me clean you up a little.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.179
Don't you remember?
I got this handkerchief from you.

00:20:22.262 --> 00:20:24.389
Just give up. The girl is already dying.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.099
No! You must live!

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:30.062
You and everyone
from the League are my family.

00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:34.149
Only you would need an outcast like me.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:38.570
Damn it! I'm going to kill them all!

00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:41.657
<i>Twice has met up with Toga.</i>

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.825
<i>They are in Mr. Ikeda's storeroom.</i>

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.869
Toga is still alive.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:49.665
For Curious' sake, Toga must die.

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:53.669
<i>Jin Bubaigawara, "Twice."</i>
<i>His Quirk is Double.</i>

<i>His personality</i>

00:20:57.464 --> 00:21:00.759
