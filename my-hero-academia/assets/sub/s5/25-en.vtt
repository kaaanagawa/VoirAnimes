A MONTH AGO

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:03.837 line:20%
<i>The Liberation Army will be reborn</i>

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.841
with Tomura Shigaraki
as the grand commander!

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.511
Anyway, do as you wish with it.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:15.432
<i>I was too late.</i>

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.350
<i>That's why I failed…</i>

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.355
Was the incident at Deika your doing?

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.816
If you had taken down
the League of Villains sooner,

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.652
perhaps no civilian would have died.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.366
Whether this is the real deal or not,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.037
at least I know you've killed someone.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.087
<i>An army under the command of one man</i>

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:50.759
<i>and the control over Feel Good Inc.,
which basically owns the internet,</i>

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:54.095
<i>not to mention Detnerat,
which has ties with almost every industry.</i>

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.225 line:20%
<i>They might even have several
High-End Nomus ready to deploy.</i>

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.937
<i>As long as he wills it,
he can do as he pleases.</i>

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.358
<i>In this society saturated with heroes,</i>

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:12.697
<i>Shigaraki possesses the power on par
with the heroes or even surpasses theirs.</i>

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.162
Let's liberate the world.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.830
I can't believe Hawks is here.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.208
Hey. What are you doing, No. 2 Hero?

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:24.751
You seem happy.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.504
Yes. Introduce me to your people.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:28.922 line:20%
<i>There's more.</i>

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.299 line:20%
<i>Someone else is supporting their cause.</i>

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:36.262
<i>I must get to the bottom of it
and inform Endeavor and the heroes.</i>

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.723
<i>All right, Hawks.</i>

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.600
<i>If you get even one step behind,</i>

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:42.101
<i>the entire Japan will be doomed.</i>

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.401
<i>The previous battle has unleashed
the full potential of your Quirk.</i>

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.488
It's not just the object that you touch,

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.699
but anything in contact with it
will decay.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:00.370
You have become
the embodiment of destruction.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:04.833
Tell me.
Why do you seek this greater power?

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:08.378
Well, since you're offering it,
I see no reason to turn it down.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.674
I have no use for petty tricks anymore.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:15.135
But look at my arms.

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.679
One single maximum output
almost ruined it.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:20.181
Do you know
how many enemies are out there?

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:24.185 line:20%
I will never underestimate
the heroes again.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.690 line:20%
I will use everything I have
to crush the remnants of All Might.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.276 line:20%
The next time will also be their last.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.779
You want to give it your best
to do what your enemies hate the most.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:37.574
I can see your master in you.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:43.830
This experiment was originally meant
for All For One.

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.291
The Quirks have been mixed up
over the generations.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:52.297
They became more complex, ambiguous,
powerful, and ever-expanding.

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:57.218
When the body's evolution fails
to catch up to the rate of expansion,

00:02:57.302 --> 00:03:00.013
the user will lose control.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:04.809
I dubbed this concept
the "Quirk Singularity."

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:10.398
But no one took my word for it
except for All For One.

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.110
Humanity will be doomed

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.696
if we don't find a way
to increase adaptivity.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.698
There have been symptoms

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:21.701
since the fourth generation
of Quirk users.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:24.621
The capacity was always an issue

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.665
for someone
who can control multiple Quirks.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.668
How long is this topic going to drag on?

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:34.464
You're just as eager as a kid
who loves Christmas.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:38.718
Yes. I'm full of dreams and hopes.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.431
<i>Starting today, for four months,</i>

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.892
<i>you will feel hellish pain
throughout your body.</i>

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:51.648
<i>But after you've pulled through,
you will have control over everything,</i>

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:55.109
<i>even One For All.</i>

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:57.362
One For All?

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.573 line:20%
It's what All For One desires the most.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.786 line:20%
It's the one power he can never master.

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:40.131 line:20%
PRESENT DAY

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.135
<i>Perish, humans!</i>

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:46.888
<i>We are the Skynet of this era!</i>

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.561
Navel Saber!

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.229
It's a new move!

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.106
It's a sword! Awesome!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.027
All right. Are you ready, Aoyama?

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.238
The beam turned!

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:06.282
This is exhilarating to watch.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:10.078 line:20%
I can now alter the trajectory of light.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.664
<i>Curse it! Get them!
Today is judgment day for all of you!</i>

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.416
Max viscosity!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.126
Acidman!

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.964
<i>Humans are scary.</i>

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:26.219 line:20%
Oh, well, that feels about right.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.386 line:20%
ALL MIGHT
QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.138 line:20%
Excellent performance.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:34.227
Young Ashido, you interned
under Equipped Hero: Yoroi Musha, right?

00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:36.813
He has plenty of combo moves.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:40.566
We came up with our own combos
so we can catch up to him.

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:42.151
Hey!

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:46.197
My Acidman was inspired
by your Unbreakable!

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.115
What?

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:51.244
Nice!

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.162
Follow their examples

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.498
and show me
the fruition of your internship.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.125
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:59.919

<i>I doubt you'll come to me

<i>But that's fine by me.</i>

00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:49.797
<i>Go, Young Midoriya!</i>

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:10.860
Bakugo, you finally overcame
your weakness for winter.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.279
No way, you fool.
That was a compressed shot.

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:16.866
Todoroki, you've become so fast
and astonishing.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.952
No, I still haven't reached
Endeavor's level.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.455
Midoriya, you can finally
control your tentacles at will.

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:24.957
Yes. Sorry for the trouble last time.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.208
That's great.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:30.171
Your Quirk looks so much cooler than mine.

00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:31.922
Uraraka!

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:33.132
Yes?

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.011
-I can control my Quirk now.
-Yes.

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:43.225
Thank you for what you did that day.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.520
You don't have to bring that up again.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:50.524
Well, I decided to install wires
on my gauntlets because of that incident.

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:54.195
But I still can't control them
like Sero can.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:00.117
I've turned my experience into strength,
which means we've both grown stronger.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:06.666
I charged out without thinking too much.
I should have reacted with more caution.

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:09.210
Thank you.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:15.758

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:20.805
Listen to me.

00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:22.556
Since they restarted
the internship program,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.642
the Commission
must know something we don't.

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:25.893
I figured as much.

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:29.063 line:20%
Once we learn
where Nomus are being created,

00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:30.564
what will you do?

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.610 line:20%
Charge in and start a karaoke party.

00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:37.405
My rage is at its boiling point.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.156
What about you?

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:40.825
Me?

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:41.867
Sir!

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:45.037
Sorry for the intrusion.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.708

Don't worry.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.808
You are in U.A. High.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.644

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:10.354

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:11.981
Thank you.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.899
You too, Young Bakugo.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.610
You've grown so much,
I can't imagine what you can become.

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.154
What did you say?

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:22.116
In the end,
we couldn't get all the answers.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.327
But it's time to start moving forward.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.829
SUCCESSOR
INDIVIDUALITY

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.290
Proceed to the next step.

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.877
IZUKU MIDORIYA, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.587
CRUSHING HIS ENEMIES WITH HIS POWER

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:36.964
One For All…

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.215
I used all the resources I had

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.926
to gather information
about the Quirks of our predecessors.

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:46.557
But sadly, I couldn't find anything
about the second and third wielder.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:50.811 line:20%
Because of the era they lived in
and One For All's property,

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.397 line:20%
there is no way
to find anything from the archive.

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.233 line:20%
But we know their Quirks
are living in there,

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.862 line:20%
which means they will manifest
in some forms.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.698
Whatever. Just get on with it.

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:06.118
Stop wasting my precious time.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:10.623
Regarding the whips,
I can only maintain them for one second.

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:13.834
I can't control them
the way Sero and Mr. Aizawa do.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:18.088
But as a support skill,
I think it's fairly powerful.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.883
Have you met the other predecessors
after that day?

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:21.967
Not at all.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.096
The fifth user, Lariat.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.476
<i>Real name: Daigoro Banjo.
Quirk: Blackwhip.</i>

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:36.482
<i>He can create tendrils of black energy
to capture enemies or to boost mobility.</i>

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:41.904
It's the same for this guy.
Their Quirks aren't very powerful.

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.365
These are just some nobodies.

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:47.493
What? But I think
their Quirks are amazing.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:51.539
Any Quirks can be amazing in your eyes.
That's the scrub mentality!

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:54.333
That sounds mean
no matter how you view it.

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:57.253
Young Bakugo has a point.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.049
All For One was obsessed with One For All.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.221
<i>It's hard to imagine the dark time
where evil was left unchecked.</i>

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:11.392
<i>All For One defeated powerful foes.</i>

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:16.313
<i>His unstoppable might and desire
for domination made him invincible.</i>

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:21.902
<i>While they were struggling in hell,
during their dying moments,</i>

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.989
<i>the wielders entrusted their power
to the future</i>

00:14:25.072 --> 00:14:26.407
<i>and paved the path to this moment.</i>

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:31.203
<i>They weren't chosen by destiny.</i>

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:36.417
<i>They were simply entrusted with this power
and passed it on to others</i>

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.586
<i>during the countless battles.</i>

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:45.259
It's no wonder all of them died young.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.680
Indeed.

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:53.809
Well? What is it you want
this stinking nerd to learn next?

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.439
The next step is to learn Float.

00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:03.235
<i>It was my master's Quirk.</i>

00:15:04.194 --> 00:15:05.988
<i>All Might's master.</i>

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:09.116
<i>Nana Shimura's Quirk. A new power…</i>

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.701 line:20%
I won!

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.456
I can already do that with my explosion!

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:19.418
But I knew you would have
to waste your time just to learn that!

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:20.794 line:20%
While you're at it,

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:23.797 line:20%
I will make use of this internship
to become even stronger!

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:26.425 line:20%
That means I got ahead of you!

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:28.093 line:20%
QED!

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:31.722 line:20%
That doesn't sound good.
I'll give it my best and catch up to you.

00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:34.350 line:20%
You'll just land on your face
because you always get nervous!

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.936
No! Now that I can control the Blackwhip--

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:37.853
Go to hell!

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.605
You're not listening.

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:48.739 line:20%
What are you doing?
Took you long enough, Reflecting Boys.

00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:52.368
Hurry up and give us a hand
if you want to have meat later.

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.161
Right away!

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:58.290
You're stopping me from having meat?
Are you out of your mind?

00:15:58.374 --> 00:15:59.416
What?

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.918
He's a scary one.

00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:03.003
Then come and help us out.

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:06.590
This cuisine is amazing.
We can use anything we like in it.

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.801
Let's not put any tea leaves in it.

00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:11.553
Who cut the garlic chives?

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.806
-I did.
-Your sister would be disappointed!

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:16.433
Damn it.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:17.393
Great knife skills.

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.770
You're just too lame! Go to hell!

00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:22.147
Does anyone want some orange juice?

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:24.608
Class B is coming here, right?

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.777
Kodai is bringing a sofa.

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:30.906
Now the Hero Internship Sharing Session

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.201
and our New Semester
Motivational Hot Pot Party

00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:35.869
begin!

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.372
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:42.084
The food is not ready yet.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.461
Did you do it on purpose?

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:48.716
Hot pot is perfect for cold days.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:52.511
We'll be entering the second year
when the weather becomes warmer.

00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:53.971
Time flies.

00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:55.556
It's been an eventful year.

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:57.683
We'll have juniors soon.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:00.978
Hero Course students can't join any clubs,
so we won't see them very often.

00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:02.938
There must be someone
with great potential.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.189
That won't be good.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:07.359
Listen up.
We still have three months left.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:09.695
On top of that, we have the finals!

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:12.448
Stop it, Iida.
You're spoiling the hot pot.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.199
I don't taste any differences.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:17.828
You can't seriously be that dense.

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:20.831
He's making fun of you.
He's not afraid of the finals.

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:22.041
Well played!

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.085
We're in the same boat, Mineta.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:33.552
<i>Sometimes, I'm surprised
that I made it this far.</i>

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.515
<i>I never thought All Might
would be my teacher.</i>

00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:44.063
<i>I never thought I could have
a normal conversation with Kacchan.</i>

00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:47.107
<i>The truth is…</i>

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:50.194 line:20%
Midoriya, could you pass me
the ponzu sauce?

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.821
How fortunate of me.

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:55.699
Midoriya.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.035
<i>I need the ponzu.</i>

00:17:58.118 --> 00:17:59.870
<i>Sorry, here you go.</i>

00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:01.413
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:05.084
I found you.

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:07.920
It's freezing outside.
What are you doing here?

00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:09.963
No, I was just thinking about something.

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.090
What is it?

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:13.926
Tsukauchi has a message for you.

00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:16.929
He was hoping you could postpone
your visit with Stain.

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:18.222
Thank you.

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:20.766
By the way, how is Young Eri?

00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:22.684
She's sleeping soundly.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.562
I'm planning
to start training her this week.

00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:27.981
You can count me in.

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:29.525
I appreciate it.

00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:37.449
Is something wrong?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.620
I've decided to keep living.

00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:42.830
What?

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:45.916
Well, how should I put it?

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:51.004
I feel this constant helplessness.

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:55.467
Every time I witness the students' growth,

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:59.138
I feel frustrated
because I can't do more for them.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.517
You are still a workaholic.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.601
"Work" what?

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.729
You've been supporting
this country for decades.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.941
You became addicted to the life you had.

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.986
That was a little harsh.

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:16.697
-You can do more for them.
-What?

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:19.032
Live on and stay here.

00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:24.413
By doing so, you will motivate countless
to strive for their future.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:38.802
Please raise your head
and stand tall like you used to.

00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:41.054
Sorry.

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.476
<i>Paranormal Liberation Front.</i>

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.811 line:20%
<i>No.</i>

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.147 line:20%
<i>Someone has Tomura Shigaraki's back.</i>

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.733
<i>The keyword is…</i>

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:54.985
<i>"hospital."</i>

00:19:55.819 --> 00:19:56.987
JAKU GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.447
<i>What a surprise.</i>

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.949
Good morning, Doctor.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.534
Good morning.

00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:04.870
How is your research going?

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:07.080
It's going well.

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:10.292
<i>All I need to do now is wait.</i>

00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:15.297
<i>I can't miss my timing to strike.</i>

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:22.095
<i>Before the heroes are ready,
I must gather more intel on them</i>

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.848
<i>and make sure
the Liberation Front has nowhere to hide.</i>

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:29.686
<i>The X-Day is nigh.</i>

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.866
But it's spring break right now.

00:22:05.949 --> 00:22:09.119
I can't even take a day off
because of the internship program.

00:22:09.202 --> 00:22:11.955
Spring is about to end soon.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:14.833 line:20%
I was told this internship
was an expedition.

00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:16.335
You're right.

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:17.961
You too, Tsuyu?

00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.838
You can't be serious.
It's the same for us too.

00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:22.215
We're going on an expedition that day too.

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:24.343
What? I wonder what it's for.

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:25.886
Wait. Me too.

00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:26.928
Same here.

00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:37.189
Dai, you're a first-year student now.
Will you be all right?

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:44.279
Yes.

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.533
The heroes are under that mountain.

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:52.454
We'll be in charge
of the civilian evacuation.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.082
<i>The League of Villains…</i>

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:56.875
<i>No.</i>

00:22:57.876 --> 00:23:00.712
<i>The battle with
the Paranormal Liberation Front…</i>

00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:05.175
<i>The event that will shake
the whole hero society…</i>

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.678
<i>is upon us.</i>
