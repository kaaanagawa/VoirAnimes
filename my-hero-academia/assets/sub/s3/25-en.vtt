WEBVTT

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.980
Now that Midoriya is back, we'll go
into more detail about the work studies.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.440
Please come in.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.070
We'll have people who
experienced it first hand

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.950
tell you about how these
are different from the internships.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.330
Listen carefully.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.170
The three third years at U.A. who stand
at the top of all current U.A. students--

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.380
Also known as the Big Three.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.680
The Big Three...

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.980
"Unrivaled"

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.940
"Pro Hero - Eraser Head - Quirk: Erasure"
"Mirio Togata" "Nejire Hado" "Tamaki Amajiki"

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.060
The top of all U.A. students...

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.650
The Big Three...

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.360
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.360
Big Three!

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.570
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.570
The crown among the splendid U.A. students...

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.620
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.620
The ones closest to pro heroes among us...

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.620
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.790
I heard that they're the ones
we're supposed to be like...

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.750
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.620
There's someone really pretty, too...
They don't really seem like it.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.880
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.880
Target acquired!

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.880
Acquired, acquired, acquired,
acquired, acquired, acquired...

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.760
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.760
That person...

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.760
He was from back then...

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.850
I only saw his face then,
so I didn't realize, but now I remember!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.850
At the sports festival
I watched on TV last year...

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.900
He didn't rank very well,
but he left a strange impression.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.150
If I remember correctly, the two next
to him didn't rank near the top, either,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.320
but they're the U.A. Big Three, huh...?

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.360
I wonder what kinds of heroes they are...

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.960
Okay, can you please
introduce yourselves briefly?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020
Let's start with Amajiki.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.430
What's with that look?!

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.300
All that intensity from just one glance!

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.310
It's no good.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.560
Mirio, Hado...

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.340
Even if I look out on them
imagining that they're potatoes,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.020
everything other than
their heads remain human.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.730
I still can't see them as anything but human.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.370
What should I do? I can't... say anything...

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.630
My mind's... blank...

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.830
I can't...

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.790
I want to go home...!

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.830
Huh?!

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.830
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.000
Um, you are the top
of U.A.'s hero course, right?

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.880
Oh, listen, Amajiki!
That's called having the heart of a flea!

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.260
Even though you're human! It's so strange!

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.160
This is the flea, Tamaki Amajiki.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.670
And then, I'm Nejire Hado.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.890
We were asked to talk
to you guys about work studies.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.150
But wait...

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.230
Hey, hey, why are you
wearing a mask? Are you sick?

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.110
Trying to look cool?

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.940
This is because in the past...

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.680
Oh, my! You must be Todoroki, right? Right?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.670
How did you get burned right there?

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.660
That's...

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.070
Ashido, if your horns break off,
will new ones grow in?

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.080
Can you move them? Well?

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.370
Mineta, are those balls of yours hair?

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.170
--B-Balls...?!
--How do you get a haircut?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.250
Asui, you're a tree frog--not a toad, right?

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.250
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.430
There's so much I want to know
about all of you! It's so strange!

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.970
She's got the natural
airhead thing going! It's cute.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.850
She's like a kindergartener...

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.770
She wants to know about my balls?

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.650
Wait a minute, that sexual
harassment, you know!

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.900
That's not what she meant.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.320
Hey, hey, Ojiro, can you support
your whole body with your tail?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.030
U-Um...

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.340
Hey, hey, tell me! I wanna know!

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.950
Isn't this lacking rationality?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.670
Don't worry, Eraser Head!

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.700
I'm going last to wrap things up, right?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.830
The future's gonna be...?

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.880
"silence"

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.650
Gonna be what?

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.550
Grim! That's what you
were s'posed to say, right?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.470
All right, my call-and-response
was a huge fail!

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.470
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.760
All three of them are weird.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.720
Even though they're
called the Big Three, it's like...

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.430
You can't feel it in their personalities.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.770
Well, you guys look like you're
not sure what's going on, right?

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.490
We're third years who suddenly appeared

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.600
to explain about work studies
that aren't even required.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.440
That's confusing, right?

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.990
You guys got your provisional
licenses as first years, right?

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.990
This year's first years
are really... energetic, right?

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.790
Besides, it looked like
my jokes didn't work earlier, right?

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.210
Mirio?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.290
Why don't you all fight me at once?

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.800
Wh... What?!

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.130
Fight you...?

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.550
Out of the blue?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.760
It's the most rational to have you all
experience our experience firsthand, right?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.900
How about it, Eraser Head?

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.580
Do what you want.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.940
Um... Are you serious?

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.150
Totally serious!

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.940
Mirio, you probably shouldn't.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.700
He's so far!

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.570
For the work studies,
it would've been enough for us to say,

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.160
"This is how it was,
and I learned a lot from it."

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.830
Not everyone is filled
to the brim with ambition.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.330
We can't end up with kids
who are unable to recover after this.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.380
Huh?

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.100
What does he mean by "unable to recover"...?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.260
Oh, listen! Did you know?

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.130
In the past there was a student
who got so frustrated

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.290
the student quit being a hero,
and that caused all sorts of problems.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.050
Did you know that?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.760
It's tough, isn't it, Togata?

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.150
If you don't think things through properly,
this'll be rough. Really rough.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.690
Please stop.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.310
Please wait.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.320
There's a handicap in place,
but we've fought we the pros before.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.110
And we've fought with villains before, too.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.070
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.080
Do we look like such weak small fry
to you that you need to worry about us?

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.870
Right, you can come at me
anytime, from anywhere.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.210
Who's first?

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.000
I'll...!

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.920
Here I come!

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.460
Unexpectedly, it's Midoriya?!

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.470
I'm going to catch up with everything
I fell behind in these past three days!

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.480
Deku...

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.350
This is a good chance for all of you.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.930
Make sure you get the
most out of this experience!

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.390
Problem child!

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.310
That's good! You really are energetic!

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.640
The person at the top of U.A.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.480
If I'm going to spar with someone,
this is the best I could ask for!

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.900
The top of U.A. and the me now.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.990
What's the distance between us?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.030
The close combat team
should surround him all at once!

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.120
All right!

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.250
Well then, sir, thanks
for showing us this kindness.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.540
I look forward to your teaching!

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.100
Your clothes fell off just now!

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.430
Oh, excuse me. The fine-tuning's tricky.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.890
You're full...

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.930
...of openings!

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.250
As I thought, he's got a Quirk
that lets him slip through things!

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.180
It's an amazing Quirk. What should I do?!

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.610
You went for the face, huh?

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.610
Wait!

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.580
He's gone!

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.450
I'll start with the long-distance fighters!

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.960
He warped?

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.870
His power isn't just slipping through things?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.340
What kind of strong Quirk is that?!

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.090
That's not it.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.840
Mirio's Quirk isn't one to be jealous of.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.090
What you should be jealous of

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.140
is his skill, first-year boy.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.810
After he was scouted and worked hard
at his work study with a certain hero,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.610
Mirio was built up.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.660
Power!

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.950
Mirio Togata...

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:30.290
As far as I know, he's the man
closest to being number one...

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.380
...including the pros.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.970
"Kyoka Jiro"
"Quirk: Earphone Jack"
"She can insert the plugs on her earlobes into her opponent and channel loud sounds into them."

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.970
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 8/1"
"Height: 154 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Rock Music"

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.970
"Denki Kaminari"
"Quirk: Electrification"
"He can discharge electricity and use it to attack or find enemies."

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.970
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 6/29"
"Height: 168 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Hamburgers"

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.720
He got more than half
of them in an instant...

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.020
He's the man closest to being number one...

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.750
You're not going?

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.560
It's not like you aren't interested
in being number one, right?

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.560
I didn't get my provisional license, so...

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.200
You've calmed down, huh?

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.080
That's it for the long-distance fighters.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.670
All that's left are the ones
who focus on close combat, right?

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.250
I have no idea what he just did!

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.960
He's strong enough being able to
slip through things, but he can even warp?

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.840
Doesn't that make him unrivaled?

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.430
Aw, stop that!

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.940
Unrivaled, huh?

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.810
I can guess your levels with that one word.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.190
For example, like how an ordinary person
can't tell what's so amazing

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.550
watching a pro's technique,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.940
if you can't tell how much
hard work Mirio has put in,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.200
then you won't even be able to retaliate.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.110
I think there's some kind of trick here!

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.330
Whether he's applying
his "slipping" power to warp,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.700
or applying his warp power
to slip through things,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.210
he's attacking us directly,

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.830
so as long as we go for the counter,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.170
there should be times when we can touch him!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.300
If we can't tell what he's doing,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.210
then we should figure out
assumptions with what we do know,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.840
and do whatever we can to find a way to win!

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.090
All right, thanks!

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.350
Midoriya right after
the house arrest is amazing!

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.970
Then come and try to figure it out!

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.270
He went under!

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.480
He'll probably come up...

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.450
...here!

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.490
He wasn't reacting.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.770
He predicted that I would come up here?!

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
But here's an ultimate move--

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.410
Blinder Touch Eyeball Crush!

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.260
Most people try to launch
a counterattack like that, right?

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.550
So then, of course,
I'll train to go after those guys!

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:43.930
Midoriya!

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.540
Damn it!

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.280
Power!

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.520
You know, about Togata... Hey, hey, listen
to this--Togata's gotten stronger, hasn't he?

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.660
Mirio's been strong ever
since we were kids. It's just...

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.840
...he should learn to hold back.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.760
I tried to make it so you
wouldn't be able to see my willy,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.470
but I'm sorry about that, girls.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.220
But anyway, you kind of get it now, right?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.080
We all just got punched in the stomach without
ever really figuring out what was going on...

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.930
Did you think my Quirk was strong?

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.440
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.190
It was too strong!

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.850
That's not fair! Think about me, too!

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.610
You could slip through things and warp!
Are you a hybrid like Todoroki?

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.360
Nope, I've only got one.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.860
Just one?

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.200
I know! I know what his Quirk is.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.410
Hey, hey, can I say it? Can I?

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.580
It's Permeation!

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.620
Hado, it's Mirio's turn right now.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.330
That's right! My Quirk's Permeation.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.540
"Permeation"

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:01.340
What you guys called a warp was,
as you guessed, an application of that.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.300
Sorry about that.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.550
How exactly do you warp?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.180
If I activate my Quirk
through my entire body,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.630
then my body can go through everything.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.220
Everything.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.890
That means, the ground, too.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.890
Oh, then that was...

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.770
...you falling into the ground?

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.860
That's right. I fell underground!

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.030
And then, when I release my Quirk
while I'm falling, something strange happens.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.280
"Quirk Activated"

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.280
Apparently, things that
have mass can't overlap,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.530
"Released"

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.530
so I get repelled!

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.540
In other words, I get repelled
to the surface in an instant.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.710
That's how my warp works.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.630
By changing the angle based on the
direction of my body or the pose I'm holding,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.460
I can aim for where I get repelled to!

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.300
Sounds like a buggy game.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.970
You could say that!

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.600
So you can avoid all attacks and
move wherever you like in an instant.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.930
It really is a very strong Quirk--

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.440
No, I made it into a strong Quirk.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.150
While my Quirk is activated,
my lungs can't take in oxygen.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.400
Even if I breathe in,
it'll just go through, right?

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.180
In the same way,
vibrations go through my eardrums,

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.990
and light goes through my retinas.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.080
I can go through everything.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.870
That means I can't feel anything.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:19.280
I just fall even while
I have mass. That's all it is.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.420
Does that make sense?

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.960
That's why, if I want to go through a wall,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.690
I activate everything but one leg,

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.760
then I release in the
other leg and land on it,

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.590
activate my other leg and go through.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.100
Even for a simple action like that,
there are a bunch of steps involved, right?

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.940
If it were me, I'd mess that up
if I were in a hurry...

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.440
Besides, if I can't feel anything,
I wouldn't be able to move.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.820
That's right, as expected,
I was always behind.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.360
In no time, I'd dropped to dead last.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.490
I dropped my clothes, too.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.370
In order to get to the top with this Quirk,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.370
I couldn't just stay behind.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.790
Predictions! I had to think
faster than those around me!

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.330
Sometimes I had to be tricky!

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.630
Above all, I had to be able
to predict what would happen!

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.420
And what made those
predictions possible was experience!

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.760
I built my predictions on what I knew!

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.970
It ended up being kind of long,
but that's why I wanted to fight you all!

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.180
I wanted to show you through
experience rather than words!

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.770
In our work studies, we're not guests--

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.310
We're treated as one of
the sidekicks and as pros!

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.770
That's really scary.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.150
Pros will sometimes end
up watching people die.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.660
But those scary and
painful things you'll go through--

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.080
All of them are first-rate experiences
you wouldn't be able to have at school!

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.370
I changed the experience I got
during my work study into power

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.790
and took the top spot!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.880
That's why I think it's something you
should do even if you're scared, first years!

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.870
Turn experience... into power!

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.590
Even his speech was like a pro's.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.600
I can't believe he did all this for us for
something he could have explained in a minute.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.470
"Guests" huh?

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.770
It's true that I felt like
that at my internship.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.230
They tried not to let us
do anything dangerous.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.980
So that means that's not how
it'll be during the work studies, huh?

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.750
Now that we've got our provisional licenses,

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.650
we'll be treated like pros
once we're on the scene.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.110
Yeah.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.070
We've gotta prepare ourselves for that.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.620
It's just what I wanted!

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.330
That's right. We came to U.A.
because we wanted to be pros!

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.250
That's true.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.580
C'est la vie.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.250
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.380
All we can do is go up.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.880
Plus Ultra.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.230
I need to get my provisional
license soon, or I'll be left behind.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.050
We'll be going back now. Say thank you.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.310
Thank you very much!

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.180
Hey, was there any point in us being there?

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.270
Do you know?

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.140
I'm glad I didn't have to do anything...

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.310
Let's be grateful to Mirio.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.740
Using it had too big of a minus.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.530
But he made the most of
the power he did have.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.270
In order to do that, he experienced
many things and learned prediction.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.210
It's not just someone strong
who's at the top of U.A.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.040
He's someone who worked hard
to take the top for himself.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.270
Mirio Togata, third year.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.430
Hey, hey, you didn't know that we thought
you'd hurt them for no reason, did you?

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.680
But no one was hurt,
so I thought you did a good job just now.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.690
It was close though, right? My willy--

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.110
Was there anyone interesting?
I wanna know! It's so strange.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.110
I defeat them from the back rows.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.860
That's my basic combat
strategy against opponents.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.950
That problem child analyzed my first moves

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.700
and moved like he predicted what I'd do.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.380
He's someone Sir would like!

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.710
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:53.210
Hey! If you've got trash, then bring it here!

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.210
"Trash"

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.590
Bakugo, thanks!

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.590
Right!

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.220
Please take this, too.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.260
Give it here!

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.890
--Mine, too!
--Mine, too!

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.010
And mine!

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.310
Thank you!

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:03.180
Merci!

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.270
Thanks!

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.270
You stashed too much away, you bastards!

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.610
Togata's story of how he went
from last to the top is great, isn't it?

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.570
Yeah!

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.040
I'm looking forward to
doing a work study now.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.160
I wonder how it'll turn out.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.870
He said they were still figuring out
what to do with the first years...

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.120
We're just waiting for Mr. Aizawa
to give us the go-sign, I suppose.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.460
You learned about what the
work study is from the Big Three,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.010
but it hasn't been decided yet whether
or not you'll be sent to work with a pro hero.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.350
We need to decide that at a faculty meeting,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.270
and if we're going to do it, we need to
think about how we'll handle the media, too.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.290
We'll see how it goes for now.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.120
Even if that's the case,
I need to do what I can.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.420
Yes, hello?

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.070
Huh? Work study? Who are you?

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.530
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.030
So anyway, I was wondering...

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.250
Will you be taking anyone
for the work study, Gran Torino?

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.200
You ignored me?
You've turned into a big shot, huh, kid?

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.460
Sorry, I'm working on something
else right now, so I can't take care of you.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840
Oh yeah!

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.910
You were a useless successor at the sports
festival who didn't get any other offers, huh?

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.740
All Might's power...

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.770
Even with that power...
even if you made that your own...

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.820
You still lost to me...

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.520
It's because I'm a useless successor

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.070
that I want to do everything I can
to get closer to the number one hero!

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.950
Don't try to sound cool
saying something obvious.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.370
Why don't you ask
your master directly about it, then?

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.870
He did say he would devote
himself to teaching, you know.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.840
But Mr. Aizawa said to use the connections
we got from the sports festival...

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.630
He meant that those who
have them should, right?

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.500
Don't you think All Might can
introduce you to a bunch of people?

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.550
For example, his former sidekick...

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.520
Sir! The perp's moving--

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.620
You're dull today, too, aren't you?

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.820
Report energetically in one breath.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:24.410
Yes, sir. The young master
of the villain group we're investigating,

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.140
villain name: Overhaul, is on the move!

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.870
It looks unsanitary.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.790
Is this your base?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.750
Huh? Like we'd bring you
to the main base right away!

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.670
This is like the interview location.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.800
Give me a break. It's so dusty.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.800
I feel like I'll get sick.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.810
Don't worry, the guys inside
have been sick for a while.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.740
What about the Shie Hassaikai?

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.510
It appears they have had contact
with the League of Villains!

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.820
Hey guys, I've brought him! I'm back!

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.130
He was a surprisingly good guy
after I talked to him.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.530
He said he wanted to talk to you.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.160
Isn't that disgusting?

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.270
You brought a crazy big fish, huh, Twice?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.010
Just like we were one step closer
to becoming real heroes,

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.520
malice also continued to
move forward in the darkness.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.940
The one who was entrusted
to be the successor,

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.940
and the one who was entrusted
and released into the wild

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.340
would meet in the not-so-distant future...

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.420
My Hero Academia is going beyond!

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.930
"I'll become your hero!!"

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.440
My Hero Academia, TV anime season four,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.800
is being made!

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.560
"Season 4"
"Coming Soon"
