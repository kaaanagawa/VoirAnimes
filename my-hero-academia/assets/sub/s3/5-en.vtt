00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.020
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.860
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.150
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.490
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840
Show me...

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.510
...your blood!

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.790
A hero...

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.860
...can always break out of a tough spot!

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.560
Sorry, Mom!

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.300
Mom, I'm sorry!

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.020
All Might! All Might!

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400
All Migh...

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.110
I'm gonna crush you!

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.000
What, water?

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.920
St... Stop it...!

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.130
Kota!

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.180
Later, 'kay? 'Kay?
I'll kill you later, so just wait--

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.280
In the instant I was distracted...

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.640
As if...

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.890
Wait, are you getting stronger?

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.940
...I'd let you kill him!

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.900
One For All, 1,000,000%!

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.820
Delaware...

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.200
...Detroit...

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:11.710
...Smash!

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.090
"Drive It Home, Iron Fist!!!"

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.080
Will they really be all right by themselves?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.680
Yeah.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.260
It's not my turn to be on stage right now.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.620
They're enough by themselves.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.020
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.020
In other words,
the game has changed.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.060
"The last boss has appeared!"

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.440
Up until now, it was a role-playing game

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.070
where we had all the equipment but
challenged the last boss while still at level 1.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.780
I should've thought of
it as a simulation game.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.290
"Villain - Kurogiri - Quirk: Warp Gate"

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.390
I should be the player, using all the pieces
I can to break through the higher ranks.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.890
In order to do that, I need to first
put cracks into the superhuman society.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.030
The Vanguard Action Squad
of the League of Villains.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.880
It doesn't matter
if those guys succeed or fail.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.150
Just the fact that they are
there will scare the heroes.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.260
Are they just sacrificial pawns?

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.470
Don't be ridiculous.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.190
Do I look that heartless?

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.900
Their strength is real.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.520
Even though they're
all facing different directions,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.400
they're comrades I can count on.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.030
In a society bound by rules,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.570
we're not the only ones being oppressed.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.020
I'm praying for their success.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.180
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.510
Hey!

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.510
It's all right.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.180
There's still something I must do.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.190
"Kota Izumi"

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.680
You're all beat up!
What do you still have to do?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.540
I knew that he would defend against it...

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.850
But that's also why I had to attack.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.740
Huh?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.150
Even taking that into consideration,
I thought I could inflict a lot of damage.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.040
But he's a much stronger villain
than I thought he was.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.250
If all the villains from
this night attack are this strong,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.710
then everyone is in danger.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.170
On top of that, they might
be after us students.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.220
I have to let Mr. Aizawa and
the Pussycats know about that.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.220
If I can save someone by moving,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.850
then I have to move, right?

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.580
We'll leave this villain here for now.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.650
"Villain - Muscular - Quirk:
Muscle Augmentation"

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.400
With my messed up arms,
it was probably weaker than usual,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.860
but it should have still
caused a lot of damage.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.450
I don't think he'll wake up anytime soon,

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.730
and even if he does, I don't
think he'll be able to move much.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.330
Above all, right now, I need to protect you.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.150
Huh?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.750
There's something that only you can do.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.410
The forest has been set on fire.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.000
With that, we'd be trapped no matter what.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.520
Do you understand?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.420
We need that Quirk of yours.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.760
Save us, the way you saved me earlier.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.520
Now, get on my back!

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.520
We need to get you back to camp first.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.860
You can move with those injuries?

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.110
It's fine!

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.360
That's why I left my legs!

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.990
Let's go! Hang on tight!

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.000
...where's the kid called Bakugo?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.770
I have a bad feeling about this...!

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.840
"A Few Minutes Earlier"

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
--Vlad, I'm leaving this place to you.
--Huh? Why are villains here...?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.280
--I'll go protect the other students!
--Wasn't this place supposed to be a secret?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.970
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.970
I don't want to think
about what could happen...

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.320
This is bad...

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.930
Letting your worry get ahead of you, Eraser?

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.480
Vla--

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.990
Well, I guess you are a pro, after all.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.490
Nothing's gonna come out.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.190
Tell me your purpose,
number, and positions.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.410
"Villain - Dabi"

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.290
Why?

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.970
Because otherwise this will happen.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.500
Your right arm's next.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.250
Let's do this logically.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.840
If we get to your legs,
it'll be annoying to transport you.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.840
Are you in a hurry, Eraser?

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.110
What's that?!

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.810
Mr. Aizawa!

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.860
You guys!

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.480
This is about as much
damage as I can take, huh?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.860
As expected of a U.A. teacher.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.360
Hey, hero.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.240
Are your students important?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.080
That fire earlier wasn't his Quirk?!

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.330
I hope you can protect them all till the end.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.420
See you later...

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.290
Mr. Aizawa!

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.250
What was that just now?!

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.590
Get inside! I'll be right back!

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.680
That's no good, Dabi!

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.430
"Villain - Twice"

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.140
You were beaten!

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.680
So weak! You small fry or something?

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.640
Already? I'm pretty weak.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.230
Huh? That's ridiculous.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.980
Don't be hasty. You're strong.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.270
You should think of this
as the pro being very strong.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.360
Make another one of me, Twice.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.400
We need something
to keep the pros from leaving.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.660
It doesn't matter how
many times a small fry goes in!

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.410
Leave it to me!

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.290
We're almost there!

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.870
Hey, look!

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.870
Mr. Aizawa!

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.040
Midori--

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.110
Mr. Aizawa...

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.000
I'm glad...

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.010
It's terrible! There are a
ton of things I need to tell you.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.260
--Hey...
--First, there's something
I need to tell Mandalay...

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:57.890
I said, "Hey"!

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.300
Please take care of Kota!

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.310
--He has a water Quirk.
You have to protect him!
--This guy's on a high...

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.310
Please!

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.140
Wait, Midoriya!

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.050
Those injuries... You did
it again, didn't you?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.400
Did you forget about
what happened in Hosu?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.740
For uncertified individuals
to cause injury with their Quirks

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.120
without specific instruction
from their guardians or supervisors

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.830
is a clear violation of the rules.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.040
No, but...

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.500
So tell Mandalay this...

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.470
"Pro Hero - Tiger - Quirk: Pliabody"
"Villain - Magne - Quirk: Magentism"

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.800
Oh dear, you're so close!

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.470
"Pro Hero - Pixie-Bob - Quirk: Earthflow"

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.470
Let me pick up my item!

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.560
Damn it, predicting
my Cat Combat moves, huh?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.320
You're not...

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.480
"Villain - Spinner"

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.650
...a real...

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.150
...hero at all!

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.200
Jeez, you're too persistent!

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.120
"Pro Hero - Mandalay - Quirk: Telepath"

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.660
So are you!

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.830
--Hurry up and be purged already!
--Smash!

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.290
Huh?!

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.290
Mandalay!

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.670
Kota's okay!

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.170
You...!

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.090
And here's a message from Mr. Aizawa!

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.670
Tell everyone with Telepath!

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.380
Hey, hero!

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.590
Are your students important?

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.970
I hope you can protect them all till the end.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.890
The way he said that makes it
clear the students are the targets.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.140
In that case, it's unavoidable.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.020
It's about raising the survival rate!

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.020
Use your self-defense skills!

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.780
I'll take responsibility for this, along
with whatever punishment is coming later.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.110
Everyone in Class A and Class B!

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.030
In the name of the pro hero, Eraser Head,

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.940
you are granted permission
to engage in combat!

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.830
Everyone in Class A and Class B!

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.830
In the name of the pro hero, Eraser Head,

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.540
you are granted permission
to engage in combat!

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.420
I repeat!

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.750
Everyone in Class A and Class B!

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.710
You are granted permission
to engage in combat!

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.970
This is what you want, right, Eraser?

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.260
Don't be defeated while we still
don't know what's going on, future heroes!

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.980
"Mezo Shoji"
"Quirk: Dupli-Arms"
"He can make copies of body parts like
 mouths or ears at the tips of his tentacles."

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 2/25"
"Height: 187 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Taiyaki"

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.980
"Fumikage Tokoyami"

"Birthday: 10/30"
"Height: 158 cm" "Blood Type: AB" "Likes: Apples"

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.820
I forgot to tell Midoriya
to come back right away.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.990
This is bad.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.160
This is worse than bad.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.240
The only reason he's able
to move with those injuries right now

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.660
is because of all the endorphins
pumping through him.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.310
Once he accomplishes his goal and calms
down a little, he won't be able to move at all.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.230
Mister...

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.170
Will he be okay?

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.050
Hm?

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.380
I...

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.980
I punched him...

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.260
But even so, he got all
beat up like that to rescue me...!

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:51.520
I haven't even told him "Sorry"...
or "Thank you" yet...

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.020
Will he... be okay...?

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.270
Don't worry.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.030
He got all beat up like that
because he has no intention of dying.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.530
But as a teacher, I have to scold
Midoriya for acting without permission...

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.780
No...

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.160
So once all this is over,
please tell him how you feel.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.990
If possible, put more effort
in the "Thank you" part.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.340
You, get back to camp immediately!

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.130
Those aren't normal injuries!

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.760
No... I'm sorry!

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.220
Please tell everyone one more thing!

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.190
The villains...
At least one of their targets is...

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.770
They're after Kacchan!

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.100
Please tell everyone with Telepath!

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.180
Who's "Kacchan"?

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.890
Wait a minute!

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.680
That rumble in the ground earlier...

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.610
There are two in our number
who can fight in a flashy power battle...

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.280
If one let something slip...

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.490
Then that bloodthirsty
Muscular was defeated...?

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.330
Does that mean he lost
in power to that little kid?

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.580
Oh my, this child...

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.460
He really does need to be killed!

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.950
Don't, Big Sis Mag!

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.290
What do you think you're doing?!

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.340
He was on the priority kill list!

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.670
That's just Shigaraki's personal desire!

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.930
Spinner! What did you come here to do?!

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.180
That child is someone Stain wished to save!

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.890
In other words, a person
worthy of being called a hero!

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.100
I will follow his wil--

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.150
I finally got a good hit in!

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.730
It can't be helped...

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.440
First, I have to tell everyone.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.070
We have discovered
one of the villains' targets.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.870
It is one of the students--"Kacchan"!

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.780
Bakugo?!

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.160
It's Bakugo?!

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.540
"Kacchan" should try to avoid
combat and acting independently.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.790
Bakugo...

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.750
Understand, "Kacchan"?!

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:43.420
Stop making so much noise in my head!

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.130
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.680
Don't go rushing carelessly into anything.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.720
I have to follow...

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.420
I have to do my job...

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.440
Did you hear that earlier?

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.060
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.060
She said you're being targeted!

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.820
That damn Deku did something,
I just know it.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.070
Saying "Fight" then "Don't fight"!

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.150
I don't give a damn what anyone says!

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.920
He's good at using
the terrain with his Quirk.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.800
Even though he just looks
like some scrawny small fry!

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.840
You bastard!

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.730
Looks like he's got a lot of experience.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.260
"Death Row Convict (Escaped) - Moonfish"

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.770
Show me... your flesh...

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.810
If you use any large flames
around here and the fire spreads,

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.020
we'll be surrounded by flames,
and everyone will die.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:40.940
Do you get it?

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.230
Shut up! I know!

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.610
Even if we try to retreat, there's gas...

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.360
They're obviously trying
to drive us into a corner...

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.450
Did you hear that, Kendo?!

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.990
We've got permission
to throw some punches!

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.540
Wait, Tetsutetsu!

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.410
Do you understand this gas?

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.210
You're saying it's dangerous, right?

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.510
I'm not stupid.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.290
Stupid!

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.800
There was nothing about
the gas in Mandalay's Telepath.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.590
That means the gas hasn't spread
so far that it can be seen

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.550
from the clearing where Mandalay is.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.010
It's weird.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.720
This gas is flowing slowly in one direction.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.640
Normally, it would spread more, right?

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.810
This is staying in one place.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.810
"Itsuka Kendo - Quirk: Big Fist"
"Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu - Quirk: Steel"

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.940
And look. The gas is a little denser
here than it was where we were before.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.370
Which means... what?

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.820
I think it's swirling around its source.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.820
Like a typhoon.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.950
In other words, there should be someone
who is producing the gas at the center--

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.490
someone who can also control it.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.660
I see! Man, Kendo, you're amazing!

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.960
I knew it. That's why I came with you.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.960
And, the closer we get to the
center of the swirl, the denser the gas,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.130
so it's just a matter of time.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.680
There's a limit to the gas masks' filters,

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.050
and the denser the gas,
the shorter the functioning time.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:55.800
In other words--

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.600
Run all out toward the denser gas
and punch all out! Right?

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.150
Well, yeah, but...

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.110
He's got such a one-track mind...

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.980
But...

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.700
Shiozaki and our other classmates
suffered because of this gas.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.490
I hate this! Stuff like this pisses me off!

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.030
Let's do our best, Kendo!

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.290
Yeah!

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.160
I don't dislike that part of you!

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.090
Heading straight toward
me are three... two people?

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.850
I guess there are those who notice
and can make it through, huh?

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.640
"Villain - Mustard"

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.880
As expected of a prestigious school.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.310
But it's sad...

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.100
No matter how wonderful the Quirk...

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.560
Found you...!

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.190
...they're still human, huh?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.280
What was that sound just now, a gunshot?

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.610
Don't tell me it's Kacchan...

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.950
Oh yeah, I saw you during the
live broadcast of the sports festival.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.830
There were guys who could turn hard.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.250
A gun won't work, huh?

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.040
But well, it doesn't matter.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.420
Because it's just a matter of how long
you can hold your breath in this gas.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.470
Seriously, a gun?

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.550
And aiming for my mask, too!

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.470
What's with this shorty, anyway?

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.430
A school uniform?

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.560
So he's about the same age as me,
or maybe even younger?

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.430
Don't underestimate me!

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.560
Are you pretending to be the Terminator?

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:30.570
Even if you can harden yourself,
you're charging straight in? Give me a break.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:31.940
You go to a prestigious school, right?

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.150
You're smart, aren't you?

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.650
Will you use your head a little?

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.700
If you don't, you're not worth my time.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:39.910
Tetsutetsu!

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:40.700
It's no good!

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.740
Retreat!

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.960
Two against one, with one of
you hiding for a surprise attack, right?

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.500
That's weak! Such a weak plan!

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.420
--This gas is produced by me
and controlled by me.
--Tetsutetsu, you're bleeding!

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.380
--This gas is produced by me
and controlled by me.
--It's fine, just retreat!

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.550
It's telling me your movements
directly with its fluctuations.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.180
In other words, you can't hide from me!

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.770
Why can't you figure that out?

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.220
You go to U.A., right?

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.020
Don't ruin my image of it.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.410
That's why you're being
attacked like this now.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.520
Wait a--

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.440
Stupid.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.530
Huh? Aren't you softer
than you were before?

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.490
Is it metal fatigue or something?

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.950
Looks like you can't breathe anymore either.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.330
You can't really brace
yourself anymore, huh?

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.960
Does your hardness depend on your stance?

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.500
For simple guys like the ones
that just harden themselves,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.090
they usually end up
in tests of endurance, huh?

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.050
You just rush in without
thinking about stuff like that.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.140
Hey, you guys are gonna be heroes
when you grow up, right?

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.240
I think it's strange.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.270
A world where someone
with a one-track mind like you

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.900
is fawned over just because
of where you went to school...

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.860
It's not right, is it?

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.740
Crap... I can't breathe... I can't...

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.120
My strength is...

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.250
My vision's getting
blurry... and distorted...

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.970
Crap... everything's
turning black and white...

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.710
Tetsutetsu!

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.090
I told you, I can tell how you're
moving from the flow of the gas--

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.510
It doesn't matter
if you can tell how I'm moving!

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.890
I can't believe you can look so
triumphant with a pitiful Quirk like that!

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.520
Whether it's pitiful or
not depends on how it's used!

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.110
Take this...!

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.940
The gas is being blown away!

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.690
Just how much power do those hands have?!

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.570
You're the stupid one, uniform boy.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:43.990
Carrying a gun like that is like
saying you're not confident in a fight!

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.660
You little...

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.650
Above all, for those
at U.A. with a one-track mind...

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.290
The gas got thinner, so I didn't realize...

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.330
...when everyone else would
think "I can't take it anymore,"

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.670
they'll take another step

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.840
and go beyond that.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.090
The gas... is dispersing...

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:22.070
If a gas user is wearing a mask,
then you have to break it, right?

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.000
Stupid!

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:33.580
I'll have you make up for
ruining our training camp, kid.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.010
Kacchan and Todoroki started
second in the test of courage.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.870
If they haven't moved from there,
then they shouldn't be far.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.550
Sh-Shoji?!

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.360
Those injuries...

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.360
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.360
You shouldn't be
moving anymore, should you?

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.490
You're only thinking
about saving your friend...

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.620
What are we going to do with you?

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.990
That just now...

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.650
Yeah.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.740
We were ambushed by villains,
and I covered us.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:18.130
But that triggered the Quirk that he'd
been desperately trying to hold back...

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.510
My Quirk's offensive ability
increases the darker it is,

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.880
but it becomes fierce
and difficult to control.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.350
D-Don't tell me...

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.560
Yeah.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.560
If we want to get through here,
we'll have to do something about this first...

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.570
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.070
Get away... from me...!

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.150
You'll die!

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.450
T-Tokoyami!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.710
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.000
Tokoyami's Dark Shadow's out of control?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.170
Should I head toward Kacchan,
or help Tokoyami?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.800
I have to make a fateful choice.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.140
Next time, "Roaring Upheaval."

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:36.560
"Next time: Roaring Upheaval"

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.290
Go beyond!

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.140
Plus Ultra!
