WEBVTT

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.860
Evil wiggling on the underside
of the showy superhero society...

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.520
No matter how many times they're driven back,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.110
they hide in the darkness,
storing up strength...

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.880
They start to move again...

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.490
I expect nothing less from Master,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.920
finding so easily the destination
of those guys that I couldn't find

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.340
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.340
no matter how hard I looked.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.340
"Villain - Kurogiri - Quirk: Warp Gate"

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.050
It was worth having them on standby,
wasn't it, Tomura Shigaraki?

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.830
I guess.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.210
I was contacted by the union.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.640
They said they could deliver
the goods by tomorrow morning.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.690
They were hastily put together,
so they don't look like much,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.650
but the quality is guaranteed.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.530
I apologize for asking
for something unreasonable.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.990
Hey, Shigaraki...

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.830
"Villain - Giran"

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.830
Do you know why the union
accepted your unreasonable request?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.870
'Cause everyone's got
high expectations of you.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.290
If the League of Villains becomes active,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.330
then those smoldering
in the dark will start to move.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.380
If that happens, then those
like me can share in the profits.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.510
Don't worry.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.050
You'll soon be so busy
you won't be able to keep up.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.600
I'm looking forward to that.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.400
Anyway, thanks.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.480
My pieces and prey have
all arrived at the destination.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.330
Then, it's time to start the game.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.030
The prestigious school that
turned out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.870
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.210
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.540
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.270
U.A. High has finished its first semester
and started summer vacation.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.190
However...

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.400
Those of you trying to be heroes
will not receive days of rest.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.400
At this summer training camp,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.990
we'll have you aiming for even
greater heights--for "Plus Ultra"!

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.130
Yes, sir!

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.080
Deku, it's finally time for the
training camp in the woods, huh?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.080
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.790
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.790
Y-Yeah, that's right, Uraraka!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.410
So close...!

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.920
What's the matter?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.080
Well, um...

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.460
Do you like...

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.630
I-It's time for training camp!
Training camp! Training camp!

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.260
Training camp! Training camp! Training camp!

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.470
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.840
Uraraka and the others are so excited...

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.980
"Neito Monoma - Quirk: Copy"

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.980
What? There are people in
Class A taking extra classes?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.020
Does that mean you had
people who failed the finals?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.110
What? Isn't that weird? Isn't that weird?

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.980
Even though they're supposed
to be way better than Class B?

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.730
How can that be?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.210
Sorry!

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.410
Monoma's scary.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.790
Oh, it's Class B--

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.660
We kind of met during the sports festival,
but nice to meet you, Class A.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.460
Yeah.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.170
"Itsuka Kendo - Quirk: Big Fist"

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.870
We're getting on the bus!

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.170
Okay!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.800
Not just the girls from Class A,
but the girls from Class B will also be there!

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.300
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.300
It'll be like a buffet
we can pick and choose from!

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.010
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.260
That's about enough out of you.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.090
Class A's bus is this way!

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.520
Line up in seat order!

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.520
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.610
Everyone, the bus will stop
once in about an hour.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.690
After that--

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.400
Let's play some music!

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.110
"chatter chatter chatter"

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.610
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.570
Oh, well.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.800
This is the only time
they'll be able to play around.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.920
"Wild, Wild Pussycats"

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.000
Finally taking a break, huh?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.590
I gotta pee!

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.090
Anyway, does this even count as a rest area?

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.720
Huh? Where's Class B?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.180
--B-B-B-Bathroom!
--There's no point stopping without a reason.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.140
Huh?

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.570
Where's the bathroom?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.730
Hey, Eraser!

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.650
Long time no see.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.860
Lock on with these sparkling gazes!

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.070
Stingingly cute and catlike!

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.410
Wild, Wild...

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.000
...Pussycats!

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.790
These are pro heroes who will be working
with us during the camp, the Pussycats.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.250
They're a four-person
hero team who set up a joint agency!

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.840
They're a veteran team that
specializes in mountain rescues!

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.010
This year will be their twelfth workin--

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.630
I'm 18 at heart!

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.260
At heart...?

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.100
Y-You're 18!

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.220
She sounds desperate.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.930
Greet them, everyone.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.160
Nice to meet you!

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.900
We own this whole stretch of land here.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.980
You all will be staying
at the foot of that mountain.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.360
So far!

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.950
Huh? Then why did we stop here?

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.660
Could this mean...?

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.370
No way...

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.610
Why don't we get back to the bus, huh?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.370
Fast.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.210
Yeah. Let's do that.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.250
It's 9:30 a.m. right now.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.420
If you're fast...

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.920
Maybe around noon?

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.170
No way... guys...

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.010
Let's get back!

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.050
Get back to the bus!

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.140
Hurry!

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.600
Kitties who don't make it
by 12:30 won't get any lunch!

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.220
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.640
Training camp...

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.060
...has already begun.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.940
Wh-What is this?!

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.240
The ground is rising up?!

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.410
Hey!

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.250
Since it's private land,
you can use your Quirks as you wish!

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.750
You have three hours!

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.370
Come to the facility on your own two feet!

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.590
After getting through... The Beast's Forest!

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.590
"The Beast's Forest"?!

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.840
That name sounds like it came
right out of Dragon Quest!

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.260
U.A. does stuff like this way too much.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.470
It's no use complaining.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.600
We just have to go.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.560
I held it! I held it!

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.520
Now to hide in the shadows and...

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.990
It's...

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.570
...a beast!

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.660
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.870
Calm down, kind beast!

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.250
Stay back!

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.340
Koda's Quirk, which is supposed
to subdue animals, didn't work?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.890
A dirt clod...

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.630
I get it!

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.010
With Pixie-Bob's Quirk...

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.520
It's a really crazy schedule, though, Eraser.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.940
Well, we're planning to
have them acquire early

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.400
what they normally would get
at the beginning of their second year,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.980
so it's going to be crazy no matter what.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.820
Permits to use their Quirks
in the time of an emergency--

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.700
A provisional license allowing
them to work as heroes.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.870
With villains being so active right now,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.870
they also need to learn
how to defend themselves.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.750
One For All...

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.000
...Full Cowling!

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.590
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.840
Reciproburst!

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.020
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.020
Die!

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.230
Smash...!

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.660
Well then, I continue
to count on you, Pixie-Bob.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.650
Leave it to me!

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.570
My fur's standing on end!

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.870
You guys defeated that beast in an instant?

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.990
You did it!

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.910
You did it... and I did, too...

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.870
You're amazing, Bakugo!

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.000
Not yet!

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.090
Hey, come on.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.340
How many of them are there?

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.140
What should we do? Run away?

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.430
This is no joke.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.520
If we don't make it to the facility
by noon, then we don't get lunch.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.850
Then we have no choice but to get
through here and take the shortest route.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.190
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.870
Ribbit.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.820
All right. Let's go, Class A!

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.280
Yeah!

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.660
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.070
There are three up ahead!

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.780
Two each on either side!

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.620
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.620
Seven total. They're coming!

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.290
All right, here I go!

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.370
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.130
Sato! Kirishima!

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.840
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.980
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.230
Dark Shadow!

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.520
Got it!

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.770
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.690
Aoyama, now!

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.650
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.360
The finishing blow, right?

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.440
Damn it!

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.910
It's you guys' fault that my pants are wet!

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.220
Get away, Mineta!

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.060
1.3 Million Volts!

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.790
Yay...

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.540
Birds of the forest!

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.800
Remove the evil beasts from this place!

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.220
Take that!

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.430
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.430
Oh, no! It's gonna get me!

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.140
Hagakure, good job being the bait.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.590
There!

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.610
Everyone, please take cover!

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.520
You did it, Yao-momo!

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.030
Okay, Tsu!

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.920
Leave it to me!

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.200
Ribbit...!

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.250
Ribbit!

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.990
Release!

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.880
More have appeared!

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.510
Don't get in my way, Half-and-Half Bastard!

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.630
I'm not in your way.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.240
Let's go, Midoriya!

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.070
Okay!

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.400
Hi-ya! Is that how you wanna play?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.980
Kota, we're going.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.460
This is pointless.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.090
Are they stupid?
Saying they want to be heroes...

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.950
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 10/8" "Height: 108 cm"

Oh, you're finally here, meow!

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.300
That took quite some time.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.280
What do you mean, three hours?!

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.410
That's the time it would've taken us. Sorry!

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.830
You were trying to boast
about how much better you are?

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.460
That's mean...

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.630
I'm hungry... I'm gonna die...

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.170
But honestly, I thought
it would take even longer.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.970
You guys didn't have as hard a time beating
my earth beasts as I thought you would.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.800
You guys are great... Especially...

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.140
...you four!

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.930
Were you able to act without
hesitation because of your experience?

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.060
I'm looking forward to
where you'll be in three years!

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.560
I call dibs!

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.480
Wh-What are you...?!

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.250
--Stop that! Get away!
--Mandalay... was she always like that?

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.570
She's a little desperate, since she's
about the suitable age for, you know...

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.410
Speaking of "suitable age"--

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.660
What about it?

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.750
I-It's been bothering me for a while...

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.870
Whose child is that?

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.500
Oh, not one of ours.
He's my cousin's kid.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.940
Come on, Kota. Greet everyone.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.230
You'll be with them for the next week.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.510
Oh, um, I'm Midoriya from
U.A. High School's hero course.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.720
Nice to meet you.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.390
Midoriya!

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.890
You brute of a nephew!

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.020
Why would you do that
to Midoriya's scrotum?!

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.480
I don't intend to hang out
with guys who want to become heroes!

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.570
"Intend"? Just how old are you?!

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.070
Precocious brat.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.320
Isn't he kind of like you?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.990
What? Not at all!

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.120
Anyway, shut up, you GG bastard!

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.870
Sorry.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.670
Enough with this charade.
Get your stuff off the bus.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.210
Once you've put your bags in your rooms,
we'll have dinner in the cafeteria.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.090
After that, you'll bathe and go to sleep.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.890
We'll start for real tomorrow.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.870
Now, move quickly.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.390
Thanks for the food!

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.190
Really? So the girls' room is a normal size?

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.650
Are the boys in a big room?

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.520
I wanna see it! Hey, can I go see it later?

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.400
Sure, come whenever!

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.400
So good! Rice is so good!

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:52.570
"clack clack clack"

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.030
It's soaking into my internal organs!

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.910
It's a match for Lunch Rush's cooking!

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.570
I can keep chewing forever!

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.660
A clay hotpot?!

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.200
Is that from a clay hotpot?!

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.330
Yeah.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.960
But man, it looks like you guys were
so hungry that you're acting weird...

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.750
Anyway, today's the only day we'll be doing
stuff for you, so eat as much as you can.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.580
Thanks!

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.170
Oh, Kota!

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:13.430
"Vegetables"

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.850
Can you bring those veggies?

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.860
Well, frankly, food and
stuff isn't really that important.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.640
That's not what I'm here for.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.570
I know that much, at least.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.620
What I'm here for is beyond that wall.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.290
What are you talking to
yourself about, Mineta?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.080
This feels great!

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.670
I love that there are hot springs here.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.920
See, there they are...

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.180
Nowadays, for them to not stagger bathing
times for men and women is an accident...

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.510
Yes, an accident waiting to happen.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.930
Don't tell me you're...

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.560
Mineta, stop it!

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.770
What you are doing is demeaning
for both yourself and the girls!

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.140
It is shameful behavior!

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.070
You're too fussy.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.320
Walls...

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.820
...are meant to be climbed over!

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.950
Plus Ultra!

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.740
For a time like this...

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.660
For a time like this, I...

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.330
Before learning to be a hero,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.660
you need to learn about being human.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.170
Damn kid...!

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.430
Mineta really is the worst, huh?

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.440
Thanks, Kota!

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.140
Yay, yay!

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:45.650
Look out!

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.900
He just fainted from fear at the fall.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.500
Thanks.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.040
I heard from Eraser that there was
an embodiment of lust among the boys,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.600
so I just had him there keeping watch.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.210
These days, girls develop
quickly, don't they?

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.540
Anyway, I'm glad he's okay.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.390
You must've hustled to save him.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.130
I don't intend to hang out
with guys who want to become heroes!

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.280
Kota has a negative view
of heroes, doesn't he?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.210
For me, I've always been surrounded
by people who wanted to be heroes--

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.120
Oh, me included...

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.690
So I thought it was unusual for a boy
his age to feel the way he does...

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.420
That's true.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.150
Of course, there are many people in
society who don't think well of heroes...

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.540
If he had been raised normally,
maybe he would've admired heroes, too.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.020
"Normally"?

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.920
Mandalay's cousin--

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.680
Kota's parents--were heroes,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.590
but they were killed in the line of duty.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.430
Two years ago...
protecting citizens from a villain...

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.570
For a hero, it was a respectable
way to die... an honorable death.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.100
But...

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.200
P-Papa... Mama...

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.350
But a child barely aware of what was
around him couldn't understand that.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.410
His whole world had
revolved around his parents.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.170
"My parents left me behind..."

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:38.760
But society kept praising them, saying it was
a good thing for heroes... a wonderful thing.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.020
He doesn't seem to like us much,
either, since we're also heroes.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.550
But it's like he's just here because
there's nowhere else for him to go.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.430
To Kota, heroes are a kind of human
he can't understand and finds unpleasant.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.740
It's because that trash
is smiling thoughtlessly,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.580
as if there was no one he couldn't save!

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.360
It's a very irresponsible thing to say that
makes it seem like someone else's problem,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.030
but there are people
with many different beliefs.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.760
As I listened to these different opinions
one after another, I couldn't say a word.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.220
"Training Camp - Day 2"

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.730
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.640
Today, we will begin training camp
to increase your strength in earnest.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.360
The goal of this training camp is
to increase everyone's strength

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.180
and with that, for everyone
to obtain their provisional licenses.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.080
It is to prepare you all to face hostilities
that are becoming more real by the minute.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.010
Proceed carefully.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.060
So Bakugo,

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.370
try throwing that.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.080
This is from the fitness test...

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.260
Your previous record, from right after
you started school, was 705.2 meters.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.380
Let's see how much you've improved.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.760
Oh, we're checking our progress?

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.220
Since a lot has happened
these past three months, huh?

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.890
Maybe he can throw it
a kilometer or something now!

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.920
Do it, Bakugo!

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.100
Then...

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.370
Here I go...

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.900
Go to hell!

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.330
"Go to hell."

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.950
709.6 meters.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.810
Huh? It's less than I thought...

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.540
It's been about three months
since you started high school.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.110
Through various experiences,
you all have definitely improved.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.130
But that improvement has mainly been
at the mental and technical levels,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.810
with some increase in stamina.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.480
As you can see, your Quirks themselves
have not improved that much.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.860
That's why we will work on
improving your Quirks starting today.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.940
It'll be so hard you'll feel like dying,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.500
but try not to actually die...

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.710
We got a delivery from Tomura!

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.090
"Villain - Himiko Toga"

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.090
He said there's enough for everyone,
so we should bring it with us.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.340
Throbbing... It's throbbing...

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.890
Let's hurry up and go!

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.100
It's still early.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.540
Besides, didn't he say
we shouldn't do anything flashy?

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.190
Yeah, even though
he attacked me right after we met,

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.570
he's suddenly acting like he's in charge.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.860
This is just a signal fire.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.910
Those empty heroes will
be pulled off their pedestals...

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.410
"Villain - Dabi"

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.330
To create a brighter future.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960
"Preview"

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.450
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.960
It looks like Kota, a relative
of Mandalay from the Pussycats,
