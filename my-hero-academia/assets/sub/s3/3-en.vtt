00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.230
The prestigious school that turned out
many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.310
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.150
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.440
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.200
Develop our Quirks?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.300
Class A is doing it already.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.730
Let's go, quickly.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.430
Last semester, Class A got all the attention,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.680
so next semester, it'll be Class B's turn.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.190
Got it? It won't be Class A,
it'll be us, Class B!

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.190
"You're crying too much..."

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.190
Sir...! Sorry that we are
such disappointing students!

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.780
Even if you say that we're going
to develop our Quirks out of the blue,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.860
all twenty of us have different Quirks,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.530
so how are we supposed to know
what we're developing and how?

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.660
Can you be more specific?

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.290
When muscle fibers are overused,
they break and become stronger and thicker.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.160
Quirks are the same.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.710
If you keep using them,
they become stronger,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.090
and if you don't, then they waste away.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.300
In other words, there's just one thing to do!

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.050
Break through your limits!

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.640

Katsuki Bakugo. Plunging both hands
into boiling water to expand his sweat glands

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.730

to increase the scale of his attacks!

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.110
Damn it!

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.650

Alternating between ice and fire to make
the temperature of the bathwater uniform.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.160
This training is to get his body used to freezing

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.530
and have him try controlling
the temperature of his flames!

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.240
He might even be able to use
both Quirks at once eventually!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.580
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

By having him producing tape continuously,
his training will increase his capacity

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.780

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.260
--Eijiro Kirishima and Mashirao Ojiro.
--Come at me!

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.930
By having Ojiro use his Tail to hit
Kirishima with his Hardening activated,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.010
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.300

In order to increase the reach of his Anivoice,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.450
he's doing vocal exercises
to build up his vocal cords.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.820
It's also good for helping him become less shy.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.370
Yuga Aoyama.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.450
Training to get his body used to Navel Laser

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.370

By turning continuously in zero gravity,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.220
she's training the semicircular canals
in her inner ear to decrease nausea

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.750

They're increasing the
strength of both their Quirks

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.400

What is with this hell?

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.830
Those of you who are operative types
will have to raise your maximum limits.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.050
Heteromorphic types and other composite types

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.790
need to train the parts of
their body related to their Quirks.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.790
Normally, this would occur
as your bodies grow...

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.710
...but we don't have that time.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.090
Class B, you guys hurry up, too.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.970
But once we join, there will be forty in all.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.430
Can just six people manage
the Quirks of that many people?

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.930
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.310

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.360

The full version!

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.160
Damn it!

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.330
My Quirk is Search!

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.040
I can know all the info about up to
a hundred people by just looking at them!

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.500
"Ragdoll - Quirk: Search"

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.500
I can find out their location
and weaknesses, too!

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.050
With my Earthflow, I can make the
perfect places for each person to train!

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.710
"Pixie-Bob - Quirk: Earthflow"

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.730
And with my Telepath, I can give
advice to multiple people at once.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.100
"Mandalay - Quirk: Telepath"

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.030
And my job is assault
through punching and kicking...

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.100
"Tiger - Quirk: Pliabody"

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.810

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.720
Damn it!

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.600
All you power-up types, come to me!

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.440
Tiger's Bootcamp has already begun!

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.070
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.570
That's so obsolete!

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.700
Now, hit me with what you've got!

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.450
Five percent Detroit Smash!

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.580
You're still pretty lively!

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.250
That means your muscle fibers
haven't been ripped apart yet!

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.130
Yessir...

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.290
I can't hear you!

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.920
Yessir!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.920
He's scary.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.170
It's "Plus Ultra," right?

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.260
Then, do it!

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.050
Give me "Ultra"!

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.640
Yessir!

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.560
That guy's the only one whose gender
and genre are different, huh?

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.310
U.A.'s busy, so it's hard to spare staff
for just the first years of the hero course.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.270
Based on their track record
and wide range of Quirks,

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.240
these four are the most logical choice to train
your Quirks in a short amount of time.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.950
Don't fall behind Class A!

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.030
Let's go, Class B!

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.150
Yes, sir!

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.160
All Might endowed me with
a Quirk that was more than I deserved.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.840
Gran Torino taught me how to use my
Quirk in a way that worked with my body.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.880
The more you train a vessel,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.150
the more you'll be able
to move the power freely.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.180
I've already come this far since receiving it!

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.310
Now, it depends on my own hard work!

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.100
All right, stretch and
rip apart your weak Quirk!

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.270
Yessir!

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.110
Now, remember what I said yesterday?

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.530
"Self-Support"

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.110
"Today's the only day
we'll be doing stuff for you"!

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.530
At least make your own food!

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.280
"Hero Aca Curry"
"That hero and that other one also eat this!"

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.280
Curry!

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.740
Yessir...

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.790
You all look exhausted!

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.750
But that doesn't mean you
can make any old sloppy cat food!

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.630
It's true that part of rescuing someone
is filling the stomachs and spirits

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.130
of those exhausted during a disaster.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.050
That's U.A. for you! No opportunity wasted!

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.050
Let's make the most delicious
curry in the world, everyone!

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.930
Okay...

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.850
Iida's so useful.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.560
Todoroki!

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.850
Can we get fire over here, too?

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.560
Bakugo, use Explosion to light this.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.110
Like I would, scum!

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.990
Huh...?

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:36.390
If you only rely on others,
then you will not learn how to light a fire.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.620
No, it's fine.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.290
--Wow, thanks!
--Burn, burn, burn it up!

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.640
You can't burn it all up.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.760
Thanks for the food!

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.470
If I got this at a restaurant,
I wouldn't be very happy,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.510
--but in this situation, it's delicious!
--Don't say that! It's rude!

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.680
Yao-momo, you eat a lot, huh?

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.680
Yes.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.850
My Quirk turns lipids into
various atoms to create things,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.860
so the more I eat, the more I can make.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.860
It's like poo.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.940
Apologize!

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.030
I'm sorry!

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.450
Kota, it's time for dinner!

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.470
Kota!

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.440
Kota...

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.170
"Kota Izumi"

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.340
You're hungry, aren't you?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.680
You can eat this curry.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.760
You...! How'd you find this place?

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.180
Oh, sorry. I followed your footsteps...

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.640
I thought maybe you'd want something to eat...

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.040
I'm fine. I don't need any.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.770
I told you, didn't I?
I don't intend to hang out with you.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.550
Get out of my secret hideout!

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.650
A secret hideout, huh?

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.240
Getting all into trying
to improve your Quirk. It's gross.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.530
You want to show off your power that badly?

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.780
Your parents...

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.670
Could they be Water Hose? With the water Quirks?

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.130
Did Mandalay tell you?!

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.010
Oh, no, um, uh...

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.010
Sorry!

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.440
Yeah, I kind of ended up hearing about it,

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.900
and based on the information
I got, I thought maybe...

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.360
It was an unfortunate incident. I remember it.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.310
Shut up.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.760
Everyone's crazy...

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.400
Calling each other stupid names like
"hero" and "villain" and killing each other...

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.250
Talking about Quirks and stuff...

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.230
It's because they're all showing off
that it ended up like that... Stupid...

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.900
It's not just heroes...

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.960
Kota hates Quirks...
and the superhuman society itself...

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.170
What is it?
If there's nothing else, then go away!

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.220
Well, um... my, uh... friend...

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.190
My friend... couldn't inherit
any Quirks from his parents...

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.320
Huh?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.230
It's a hereditary thing,
and apparently it's rare but does happen...

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.320
But he admired heroes
and wanted to become one,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.480
but you can't be one
these days without a Quirk...

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.530
My friend couldn't accept
that for a long time and practiced...

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.290
Trying to draw objects to him

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.380
and breathe fire...

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.360
But it was no good.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.420
There are a lot of different
ways to think about Quirks,

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.140
so I don't know if this'll apply to everyone,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.760
but if you reject it that much,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.050
then it'll just make it more painful for you.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.140
Um, so...

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.970
Just shut up!

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:45.950
Get out of here!

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.410
Sorry. I'm just rambling...

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.520
I'll leave the curry here.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.700
Shut up...

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.700
All of you...

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.300
I mean, I don't like this. It's not cute.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.010
"Villain - Himiko Toga"

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.090
This was orchestrated by
the designer behind the scenes, right?

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.260
Appearances don't matter
as long as it makes sense.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.390
I'm not talking about that.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.310
I just don't want to wear this.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.190
Hi! Sorry for the wait.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.060
Work... work...

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.660
That makes seven.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.030
I don't care, just let me at 'em.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.320
I'm getting too pumped up.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.480
Shut up, you crazy bastards.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.240
Not yet...

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.750
"Villain - Dabi"

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.290
We'll move when all ten of us are here.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.360
Gathering a bunch of punks who are
just strong will only increase the risk.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.360
It's better to have a
small group of experienced elites.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.340
First, we make them realize...

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:12.830
...that their peace is resting in our hands.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 8/22"
"Height: 179 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Beef Stew"

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.980
"Tenya Iida"
"Quirk: Engine"
"He can run very fast using the engines in his calves."

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 2/12"
"Height: 150 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Jello"

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.980
"Tsuyu Asui"
"Quirk: Frog"
"She can do pretty much everything a frog can, like stretch out her tongue really far."

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.410
Hey, extra lessons group, don't stop.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.940
Got it!

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.200
Sorry, I'm kind of sleepy...

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.290
I didn't think yesterday's extra lessons...

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.930
...would go until 2 a.m....

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.500
And we started at 7 a.m....

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.880
I told you it'd be tough.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.170
You're not just trying to improve your Quirks.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.380
Above all, you need to work on the weaknesses
that were exposed during the final exams!

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:53.020
Think carefully about why you're more
tired than your classmates before you move.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.770
Y-Yes, sir...

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.310
Uraraka! Aoyama!

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.060
You two should, too.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.650
You didn't fail, but you were close.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.730
If 30 points was passing, you were at about 35.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.440
Ah, we barely made it...

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.400
How unexpected.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.200
Don't lose focus.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.750
All of you, move faster!

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.740
No matter what you're doing, you should
always be aware of where you came from.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.870
That's what it means to improve.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:22.880
Always keep in mind why you're sweating,
and why you keep getting nagged.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.090
Where I came from...

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.590
Where I came from...

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.780
Where I came from...!

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.550
That reminds me, Mr. Aizawa,
it's already the third day...

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.060
What did I just say?
Don't just walk over here like that.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.970
Is All Might... I mean,
are the other teachers coming?

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.610
Like I said before the training camp,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.690
in order to keep the villains
from finding out where we were,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.190
we kept the number of
people to the absolute minimum.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.360
That's why you got a
training camp with the four of us!

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.490
And especially since we believe
All Might is one of the villains' targets,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.500
we can't have him here.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.120
For better or for worse, that's what happens,
since he stands out so much...

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.890
Hmph.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.010
Seems like there's a
lot more of the "for worse" part...

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.160
I see.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.680
All Might isn't coming, huh?

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.720
More importantly, everyone, tonight...

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.730
we'll have a test of courage with
the classes pitted against each other!

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.520
After training hard, you can play hard!

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.730
The carrot and the stick!

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.570
Oh, I forgot.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.190
I hate scary things...

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.570
Revelry in the dark...

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.410
They're letting us do the
typical training camp stuff, too, huh?

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.290
I like the part where we're
"pitted against each other"...

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.080
So, do your best right now!

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.420
--Yessir!
--Yessir...

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.540
Where I came from... All Might...

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.380
Hey.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.420
Where's your "Plus Ultra"?

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.800
R-Right!

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.260
Bakugo, you're really good at using a knife!

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.220
It's unexpected...

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.770
What do you mean, unexpected?
How can you be bad at using a knife!

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.020
There he is. We haven't seen
the capable version of him in a while.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.520
Everyone's too energetic...

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.190
Did you need All Might for something?

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.190
You asked Mr. Aizawa about him, didn't you?

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.740
Yeah... um...

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.280
I did, about Kota...

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.990
Kota? Who's that?

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.870
Huh?

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.890
That kid... You know,
Mandalay's cousin's, um...

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.770
Huh? He's gone again.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.330
Maybe he's at his hideout...

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.540
He really hates being around us, huh?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.510
That kid hates heroes--I mean,

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.100
he hates the whole Quirk-based superhuman society in general,

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.730
and I couldn't say anything to help him.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.440
I was just wondering what
All Might would've said to him...

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.440
What would you have said, Todoroki?

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.780
It depends.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.740
Of course it does!

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.200
To have some stranger trying to reason
with you would just be annoying, right?

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.550
What's important is
what actions he took or is taking.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.170
If the words are going to move someone by
themselves, they have to be pretty powerful.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.310
I think words have to
be accompanied by action...

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.010
It was because it was none other than
the timid, Quirkless you at the scene

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.350
that I was able to act.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.870
You can become a hero.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.270
That's right.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.530
It's just as you say...

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.900
I'm just a stranger.
How can I say anything to him?

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.150
I don't know what you want to do with him,

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.950
but I don't think you should keep
poking your nose in a delicate situation.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.160
You have no qualms about
breaking through that kind of stuff,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.630
even though you don't seem like the type.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.330
Sorry about that...

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.130
You guys! Your hands have stopped moving!

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.130
We're going to make
the best meat and potato stew!

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.840
Now, we've filled our bellies
and washed the dishes!

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.800
Next...

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.640
...it's time for the test of courage!

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.010
We're gonna test it!

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.680
Before that, it pains me to say this,

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.310
but the extra lessons group
will be having class with me now.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.280
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.940
Sorry.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.190
Your training during the day wasn't
good enough, so I have to use this time.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.940
Give me a break!

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.280
Let us be tested!

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.410
Okay, so Class B will be
the first to be the scarers.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.620
Class A will leave in pairs every three minutes.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.500
There are tags with your names written
on them in the middle of the route,

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.250
so bring those back with you.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.420
Revelry in the dark...

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.800
He said it again.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.760
Those being the scarers aren't
allowed to make direct contact.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.680
Show us how scary you are with your Quirks.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.270
The class that makes the most people piss
their pants with creativity and imagination wins!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:48.520
"Wow"

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.890
Stop it. That's filthy.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.480
I see! They're trying to make us refine our
ideas by making us compete with each other,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.940
giving us more options
for our Quirks in the process!

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.570
As expected of U.A.!

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.950
Now, you'll draw lots
to determine your partners!

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.460
If we're two to a team...

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.160
Huh? Since there are twenty
with five at extra lessons...

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.790
"1st Team"

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:11.170
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...?

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.410
"2nd Team"

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.040
"3rd Team"

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.660
"4th Team"

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.290
"5th Team"

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:09.920
"6th Team"

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.540
"7th Team"

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.170
"8th Team"

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.630
Since there are twenty
with five at extra lessons...

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.960
"1st Team"

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.840
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eigh...?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.380
"2nd Team"

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:15.800
"3rd Team"

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.210
"4th Team"

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:16.630
"5th Team"

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.050
"6th Team"

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:17.460
"7th Team"

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:17.840
"8th Team"

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.050
There's an extra person!

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.560
--We drew lots... Someone had to have this fate...
--There's an extra person! And it's me...

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.730
Hey, Tail! Switch with me!

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.390
Aoyama...

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.310
--Please switch with me!
--Hey, I said switch with me!

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.400
What'd he call me?

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.980
Revelry in the dark...

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.940
"12 Minutes Later"

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.450
Okay, the fifth team!

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.160
Ribbit-kitty, Uraraka-kitty, go!

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.370
I'm scared, Tsu...

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.290
There are so many screams...

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.270
Kyoka and Toru, huh?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.130
Let's hold hands.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.190
It's fine, I'm not scared.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.960
Let's go.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.760
O-Okay...

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.060
Kodai, you scared everyone so far!

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.770
You're really putting yourself out there, Yui!

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.690
Yeah.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.650
Bakugo and Todoroki were so funny!

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.280
Oh. Oh. Oh.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.570
"Juzo Honenuki - Quirk: Softening"

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.490
What was that "Oh"?

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.530
Hey, doesn't it smell a
little like something's burning?

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:31.160
Huh? Now that you mention it,
it suddenly got smoky...

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.280
Did Bakugo and Todoroki get so
scared they fired off their Quirks...?

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:36.710
Honenuki?!

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.800
"Itsuka Kendo - Quirk: Big Fist"

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.170
Yui! Don't breathe in!

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.970
This smoke...

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.760
It's poisonous!

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.560
What's this burnt smell...?

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.310
That's...

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.850
Black smoke...

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.340
Is something burning?

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.300
Could there be a fire on the mountain?!

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.840
Now...

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.690
...it begins.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.760
Wh-What is this?!

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.630
Pixie-Bob!

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.880
Take them down.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.090
The false brilliance of the title of "hero"...

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:20.820
We, the Vanguard Action Squad of
the League of Villains, will condemn them.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.880
Those pet cats are in the way.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.390
Wh-Why...?

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.350
I thought they made doubly sure...

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.690
Why are there villains here?!

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.070
Pixie-Bob!

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.060
Oh, no!

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.620
Kota!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.830
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.040
We're under attack by the League of Villains...

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.840
And not even Kota can escape their evil clutches.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.720
Next time, "My Hero."

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.380
With a full-power One For All...

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.150
...I will save Kota!

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:36.560
"Next time: My Hero"

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.270
Go beyond!

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.350
Plus Ultra!
