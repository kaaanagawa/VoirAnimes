00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.190
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.860
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.150
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.620
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.670
Those of us in Class 1-A of
U.A. High School's hero course

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.340
"Provisional Licensing Exam Location
National Dagoba Arena"

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.590
take on the provisional hero licensing exam.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.300
Well, for all hundred of
you who passed the first test,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.220
please watch this.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.600
It's the field...

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.980
I wonder what's going to happen?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.650
Why?!

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.820
Th-This is...

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.910
The next test will be the last one.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.330
We will have you all perform rescue
exercises as bystanders in this disaster site.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.710
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.710

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.040
"Bystanders."

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.210
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.170
They're people who happen to be at the scene.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.630
We learned this in class, remember?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.970
It can also refer to
ordinary citizens, though.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.970
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.720
We will assume that those of
you who have passed the first test

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.350
have received your provisional licenses

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.480
and test how well you can carry
out suitable rescue procedures.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.930
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.190

"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.320
There are people in there.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.280
Huh?

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.950
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.990
Elderly and children?!

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.950
That's so dangerous! What are they doing?

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.540
They are people who have undergone training
to be professional people-in-need-of-rescue

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.300
and are in high demand right now--

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.620
"Blood"

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.170
The "Help Us Company," or "H.U.C." for short!

"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.960
Professional people-in-need-of-rescue?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.050
There are a lot of jobs out there, huh?

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.470
It's one adapted to this world
where heroes are so popular.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.680
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.390
The people from H.U.C. have
dressed up as injured victims

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.890
and are on standby throughout
the disaster site.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.140
We will now have you all
carry out their rescue.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.230
In addition, we will score
your rescue based on points

"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.150
and if you have more points than
the benchmark at the end of the exercises,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.450
"Inasa Yoarashi - Quirk: Whirlwind"

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.100

"Yo Shindo - Quirk: Vibrate"

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.950
so please use the restroom and take care
of any other necessary business right now.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.160
Midoriya.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.820
Yeah... I wonder if this disaster site
is based on Kamino Ward...

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.840
It's true that the situations are similar.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.880
Back then, we were focused on getting
Bakugo far away from the villains...

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.090
...and staying out of the way of the pros.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.850
There were many casualties
in the midst of all that.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.260
Let's do our best.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600
"Rescue Exercises"

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.150
Hey, something amazing happened!
Listen to this--

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.150
What's the rating?

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.990
R-18!

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.650
I'll listen.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.120
You know that bodysuit girl
from Shiketsu over there?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.700
Yeah.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.910
If you're just going to say
she's hot, that's not good enough.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.330
I've been watching her this whole time, and--

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.620
Well, I saw her completely naked in
the shadows by the rocks with Midoriya.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.670
Midoriya!

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.170
--Huh?
--What were you doing, bastard?!

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.170
When the rest of us were working so hard!

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.420
Were you making light of life
just because it was during a test?!

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.550
O-Ow, stop that! What?!

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.300
Don't play dumb!

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.060
What did you do with that
person over there...?

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.060
"Camie Utsushimi"

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.860
That's a greeting exchanged
secretly by a man and a woman

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.230
after they've progressed to
a certain point in their relationship!

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.940
I misjudged you, you
smooth-talking, curly-haired bastard!

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.700
Oh, I see... It was Sero!

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.370
No, I'm telling you, that's not how it is!

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.870
It was because of her Quirk.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.080
Actually, I didn't know what
was going on, and it was super scary!

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.460
But you saw her naked, didn't you?

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.710
W-Well...

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.880
You saw, didn't you?!

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.590
And she's still waving at you!

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.800
Just how far did you two go?!

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.630
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.010
I told you, that's not how it is!

"pull pull"

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.680

"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.310
Bakugo.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.970
Huh?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.480
Did you see Shishikura--the guy
whose eyes look like slits?

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.810
There's so much hair.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.400
Yeah. I knocked him out.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.690
That's what I thought.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.490
I think he probably acted rudely.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.950
He must have caused offense.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.410
He has the tendency to impose
his own values on others.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.700
He probably couldn't help himself
after seeing you, since you're pretty famous.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.420
I would like to build
a good relationship with U.A.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.670
I apologize on his behalf.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.500
--"Good relationship"...?
--"Good relationship"...

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.760
It doesn't really seem that way at all...

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.550
"Good relationship"...

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.180
But that face...

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.370
Well then.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.100
Hey, you with the shaved head.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.400
Did I do something to you?

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.360
Oh?

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.830
Well, I'm sorry, son of Endeavor..

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.290
...but I hate you guys.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.000
You've changed a bit since back then,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.670
but your eyes are the same as Endeavor's.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.220
Yoarashi, what's wrong?

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.260
Nothing, sir!

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.050
The old man's... eyes?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.100
Todoroki.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.890
See ya.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.220
R-Right!

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.850
What do you mean, "R-Right"?!

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.860
You sexual maniac...

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.360
I told you, it's not what you think!

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.530
She's super scary!

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.530
Oh dear, you're acting disgraceful.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.070
What are you doing? We
still have another test.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.740
But--!

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.210
You must focus properly!

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.370
I don't like this.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.000
Why do I feel so stirred up?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.380
I was fine when I was fighting...

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.760
I don't like this...

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.600
Dek--

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.680
Villains have begun
a large-scale terrorist attack!

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.890
This is occurring in all
areas of "City Name Here."

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.190
Due to buildings collapsing,
there are many injured.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.530
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.110
This is the scenario for the exercises, huh?

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.530
Huh? Then...

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.400
It's starting.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.370
Due to heavily damaged roads, the first
group of rescue workers have been delayed!

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.830
This opens up, too?

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:03.620
Until they arrive, the heroes in
the area will lead the rescue efforts.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.090
Save as many lives as you can.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.750
Well, then...

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.920
Start!

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.640
Saving lives... That is the
greatest ambition of a hero!

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.890
We have to do this properly! Properly...!

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.980
He mentioned points, but he didn't
say anything about how we'd be scored...

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.270
Since we don't know,
all we can do is follow our training.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.550
Let's do this! Let's do this! Let's do this!

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.360
Let's start by going to
the closest urban area!

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.950
We'll work as a team as much as possible!

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.740
Right!

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.030
Bakugo, again?

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.200
Why are you guys following
me, you damn extras?!

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.870
We just felt like it!

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.920
Okay now, please wrap up the
second test as quickly as possible, too.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.230
Rescue exercises, huh?

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.550
Even if this is just an exercise,
this is pretty crazy.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.300
Everyone, be careful of falling debris!

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.140
What's wrong, Midoriya?

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.470
I hear a child's voice!

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.600
--Help!
--There! He's over there!

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.110
My grandpa! He's been crushed...!

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.320
What? This is bad! Where?!

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.490
What's up with that? Minus points!

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.070
Huh?!

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.490
First, you need to check
whether or not I can walk!

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.580
My breathing was weird, too, right?

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.830
And I'm bleeding pretty badly on my head!

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.460
Those with provisional licenses should be able
to take in the victim's condition in an instant

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.670
and act based on that!

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.790
Will the members of H.U.C. be
the ones scoring us for these exercises?!

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.960
This will show how much you've trained!

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.510
Look all around you and pay attention!

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.430
Okay, let's rope this off
temporarily as a danger area!

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.350
No, go wider! This is a terrorist attack!

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.890
There might be a lot more damage!

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.230
I'll make a road and a
helicopter landing area for now.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.410
Move!

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.240
"Nagamasa Mora - Quirk: Extend-o-Hair"

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.860
Shiketsu High School, second
year, Nagamasa Mora!

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.240
Quirk: Extend-o-Hair!

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.330
He can extend all the hair on
his body and manipulate it at will.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.830
The only bad thing about it
is that it gets tangled easily.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.120
As expected of Mora! You're amazing, sir!

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.330
I'll set up the first-aid station here!

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.880
There's a lot of space. Let's set up
a temporary evacuation area here.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.500
"Shikkui Makabe - Quirk: Stiffening"

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.500
Okay!

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.220
I'll be in charge of triage!

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.590
When it comes to saving lives,

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.050
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"
"Pro Hero - Ms. Joke - Quirk: Outburst"

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.970
experience really makes a difference.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.890
You're not just providing rescue and aid.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:30.270
Until the firefighters and police arrive,
you need to exercise authority in their place

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.940
and do your best to make sure everything
goes smoothly to hand off to them.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.110
In order to save people,
heroes must do many things.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.410
Above all, you...

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.330
We're all scared, hurting,
and worried out of our minds.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.450
The first thing you say
is "What? This is bad!"?

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.930
That's no good.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.090
It's fine now. Why?

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.340
Because I am here.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.310
Calm down! What am I doing?

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.890
I've gotta turn it on.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.940
The provisional license and
this test aren't just points on the way.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.270
All of it is for what I want to become--

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.320
The shape of my dream!

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.570
Do what I should be doing
with everything I've got!

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.660
I-It's... fine!

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.040
--Over there! My grandpa...!
--Don't worry, we'll definitely save him!

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.330
I'll carry this kid to the first-aid area.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.830
You guys go on ahead!

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.630
All right!

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.540
Let's do this!

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.720
Yeah!

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.670
It'll be all right! It'll be all right!

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.550
Can't you say anything else?
You're terrible at this!

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.970
I'll save you! I'll definitely save you!

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.140
Enough already!

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.680
What am I doing...?

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.020
Do you...

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.190
...like him?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.350
It's love!

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.490
I'll put this feeling away.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.790
Because I thought Deku looked
cool giving his all to reach his goal,

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.700
with no room for anything else.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.080
There's someone you like, right?

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.740
And you feel like you want
to be like that person, right?

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
I'll put this feeling away...

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.390
Because I think I have
to work hard like that, too.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.390
I'll put it away!

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.330
It's been ten minutes since it started.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.730
"Heroes Public Safety
Commission - Yokumiru Mera"

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.700
Everyone seems to be doing well,
thanks to their training.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.740
However, naturally...

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.460
This won't be that straightforward.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 12/27"
"Height: 156 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Japanese Food"

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
"Ochaco Uraraka"
"Quirk: Zero Gravity"
"She can make people and things weightless with the pads on the tips of her fingers."

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
"Inasa Yoarashi"
"Quirk: Whirlwind"
"He can create strong winds around himself and control them."

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.130
I'm a first year at
Shiketsu High School, Inasa Yoarashi!

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.590
Hero name: Gale Force!

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.430
Rescue exercises pump me up!

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.310
I'll do my best!

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:11.600
Inasa?!

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.350
Oh, wind?

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.560
It looks sloppy at first glance,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.770
but he's using a countless number
of different types of winds

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.690
to fit the different shapes and
sizes of people and debris he's moving.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.900
His subtle control is unbelievable!

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.120
But it is sloppy after all!

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.870
Minus points!

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.120
Don't move anything without any safety checks
or checking the condition of the injured!

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.540
You could make things worse!

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.880
I see! I apologize!

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.000
Hey, Camie's gone again.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.210
What's the matter with her?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.760
Are you all right?!

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.380
Sloppy!

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.800
The initial response is where the amount
of training and one's decision-making ability

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.010
becomes most obvious.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.720
Inasa...

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.100
Petitioning to take a test normally
taken in the second year as a first year,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.810
and being strong enough to be accepted.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.820
"Seiji Shishikura - Quirk: Meatball"

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.110
However, he is being too impatient.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.780
He lacks experience and self-awareness.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.820
Do you realize you're the only
who has failed already, Shishikura?

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.950
Yes, I do.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.450
Oh, okay...

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.210
Then you should use this chance
to reflect on what happened.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.750
You've been influenced too much.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.000
Influenced?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.550
It's been pretty easy
to see ever since Stain.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.510
Me? Influenced by the words of a villain?!

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.760
Absurd.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.840
Absurd?

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.680
Well, it's not necessarily a bad thing.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.060
With his fundamentalist assertions
and All Might's retirement,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:40.060
there is an increasing number of people
who wish to reform the position of heroes.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.270
But...

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:47.030
...if negativity and hate become
the impetus like it did for you this time,

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.570
then it can cloud your judgment
and make you go too far.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.450
There's someone in here,
but there's no response to our calls.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.410
It's too dark to see what's going on.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.000
First, let's confirm a pulse and breathing.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.380
I'll make a space for emergency treatment.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.840
They're so used to this.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.300
Everyone, let us move quickly, as well.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.840
He's conscious. It's an old man.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.300
Ouch... Hurry it up!

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.510
The debris is in the way!

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.760
I'll make them float and move them!

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.560
Whoops, you'll get points
taken off for that decision.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.140
Please wait a minute!

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.810
--Huh?
--Please look more carefully around you.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.560
A building has collapsed
next to this piece of wall

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.570
and it's only luck that
they're balanced the way they are.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.820
That balance can be destroyed
if we move anything carelessly.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.780
I see! Oh, no!

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.330
Let's use a support to prop up
the wall before we evacuate him.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.830
It'll take some time
to put it together, though...

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.200
Leave that to us!

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.160
How's this?

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.300
I've reinforced the wall, too!

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.170
All right, Uraraka!

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.050
Right!

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.840
I'll move the debris that doesn't have
any effect on the balance and create a path!

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.760
Here I go!

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.270
It's not perfect, but they're not bad.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.770
When there is a large-scale
disaster like this,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.520
there are not enough rescuers
to help those in need of rescue.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.530
Therefore, the work must be
as efficient as possible.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.950
If someone tries to do
the whole process themselves,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.320
they'll end up losing time instead.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.700
What's important is to understand
what your own Quirk can do

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.540
and see how much you can
divide the labor with those around you.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.550
To focus on your role during a test where
you're trying to sell yourself takes courage.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.050
It's something you can only do if
you really understand the situation.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.550
But there is still a lot of wasted effort.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.210
If you keep going like this,
we won't be able to grant you the license.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.980
We ended up just watching.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.560
A number of people have already left,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.980
but unlike the first test, it looks like
it would be better to split up for this one.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.900
Let's move in smaller groups.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.160
In that case, I'll go towards the river,
where I can use my abilities best.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.030
I'll go with you.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.950
Me, too!

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.450
All right, let's go, too!

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.700
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.120
Yeah!

00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.700
Right.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.710
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.460
Koda, can you use animals
to look for people who need rescuing?

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.210
I'll look, too.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.000
Mineta, help me.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Okay!

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.750
All right.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.420
Depending on the situation,
you should also communicate with other schools,

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.380
and save as many lives as possible!

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.690
Right!

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.680
Did you say it's too dark to see back there?

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.600
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.770
Have a bright future with my twinkle!

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.230
Oh, thanks!

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.690
Aoyama, I didn't think you'd
be the first to start!

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.020
You really like that, don't you?

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.190
Yaoyorozu, we will disperse and get to work!

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.110
Roger!

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.320
His right leg is broken!

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.820
Sero, use your Tape!

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.820
Leave it to me!

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.580
Jiro, please look for the
next person who needs help.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.830
I know, I am!

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.670
"Mountain Zone"

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.670
S-Someone!

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.960
I've hurt my arm!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.340
Help! It hurts!

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.840
Shut up! Save yourselves!

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.430
What?!

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.550
You're sticking too close to your own style!

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.930
They might be really hurt!

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.810
No... We're supposed to be victims with
minor injuries who are low priority rescues.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.860
Could he have figured that out in an instant,
telling us to move by ourselves?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.360
No way... They took it in a way
that makes it sound okay...

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.150
We'll take you someplace safe.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.360
Yeah!

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.080
But that tone of voice was inappropriate.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:21.780
Minus points.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.870
What did you say?!

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.790
"City Zone"

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.790
I hear a voice.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.340
Over there!

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.420
All right, I'll go first to check on the
condition of those who need to be rescued.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.550
Got it.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.300
Even if this weren't a test, I would
reach out to save those who need help.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.980
I'm sure that's what my brother,
Tensei, would've done!

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.230
Let's go to the mountain zone.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.730
There will be animals over there.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.980
It'll be easier to use Koda's Quirk there!

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.730
Todoroki, Tsuyu, over there!

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.400
H-Help!

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.610
I'll go.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.620
Let's gather things that'll
burn to warm him up.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.530
Leave it to me!

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.380
We're almost at a safe place, okay?

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.130
There are already so many...

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.960
You! Let me see that boy!

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.220
Oh, okay! He's hurt his head.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.100
He's bleeding a lot,
but the wound's not that deep.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.060
He responds clearly to questions.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.640
Yeah, he looks fine.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.350
Okay, carry him to the space on the right.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.940
Yes, ma'am!

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.190
Good.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.240
Screening the injured and
performing first aid.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.910
In the short time until
emergency responders arrive,

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.950
heroes must act in their stead

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.570
and ensure a smooth transition
after their arrival.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080
How's it going?

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.880
During their initial response, well...

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.090
...there were many who acted incompetently,

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.920
but even so, the points taken off
by the members of H.U.C. were...

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.550
...less than I expected.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.090
I think in general, everything is going okay.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.470
In order to protect the
people on the streets,

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.560
heroes are expected to multitask.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.940
In other words, rescue...

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.510
...and...

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.450
What's that?!

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.820
What is this?!

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200
An explosion?

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.200
Why?

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.580
Th-This is...

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.290
There has been a large-scale
terrorist attack by villains.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.790
Everyone, the scenario for the exercises...!

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.750
Seriously?

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.750
That's...

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.500
Hey, look!

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.300
"Pro Hero - Gang Orca"

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.300
Rescuing and fighting!

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.300
Can you do everything at the same time?

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.140
Gang Orca...!

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.980
During the League of Villains
search-and-destroy operation in Kamino Ward,

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:59.020
he's a hero who was called out
alongside Endeavor and Best Jeanist.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:00.690
He's strong, you know.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.110
He's currently at number ten!

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:08.530
By the way, he's third in the
ranking of heroes who look like villains!

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.120
Villains have appeared
and started their pursuit!

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.590
Hero candidates at the scene
should continue their rescue efforts

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.090
while also suppressing the villains.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.260
Continue rescue efforts while fighting?!

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.430
Jeez, are they serious?!

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.930
Aren't they expecting a little too much?!

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.270
This situation would
be difficult even for a pro.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.760
To go this far for the provisional license...

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.810
Now...

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.360
What'll you do?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.110
Fight, or protect?

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.610
Help, or run?

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.930
What will you do, heroes?!

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
"Preview"

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.250
I am here for the preview!

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.670
Next week will be a special,
completely original episode!

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.760
Why? Because we've
gotta have fun when we can!

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.860
Next time on My Hero Academia,
"Save the World with Love!"

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:36.650
"Next time: Special Episode:
Save the World with Love!"

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.280
Go beyond!

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.750
Plus Ultra!
