WEBVTT

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.360
I have used up everything in me...

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.240
Next, it's your turn.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.750
The Nomus we captured are
the same as those from before...

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.750
"Metropolitan Police Department"

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.010
They do not have human reactions,

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.260
and we are not likely to acquire
new information from them.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.180
The warehouse where they
were kept has been blown away,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.350
so all we can do is continue
our investigation on their manufacture.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.480
We haven't gotten more personal information
about them from the bar either, right?

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.400
We are currently investigating.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.490
Even if we were able to capture most of them,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.990
we let all the perpetrators,
including Shigaraki, escape.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.830
Even if we were to grade ourselves really easy,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.790
we only got away with a draw due to injury.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.250
Idiot.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.210
We traded in the Symbol of Peace.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.790
All Might's weakened body
has been exposed to the world,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.210
and there is no longer a Symbol of Peace
that will never be defeated.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.090
Not for the citizens, or for the villains.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.760
That's what happens
when we rely on one person.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.560
Everyone realized that you can get
this far just by gathering a bunch of idiots.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.980
That scares me.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.560
From our initial profiling,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.570
the principal offender, Tomura Shigaraki,
was even said to throw childish tantrums.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.990
The more plans he comes up with,
the more circuitous they become.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.200
They've become ways for him
to see how he can affect society.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.080
His thought process has matured.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.910
And now, All Might has been taken down,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.620
and there are less checks
on people's actions than before.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.430
Each time the League fails,
they become stronger.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.990
And he's left with the means
to expand their sphere of influence.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.380
Are you saying that this was part of their plan?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.900
Is that just hindsight?

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.550
I don't know.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.390
The only thing I can say for sure is

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.230
that we must capture them.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.730
We police have no time to sit around
being called the "villain reception."

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.540
Something needs to change.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.990
The embers inside me have gone out.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.240
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.240
The Symbol of Peace is dead.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.950
"Police Officer - Naomasa Tsukauchi"
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.360
However--

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.210
There is still something that I must do.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.420
Tomura Shigaraki.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.750
Shimura's grandson, huh...?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.630
That's just what All For One said, right?

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.170
That's not very much to go on.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.840
The two of you didn't have any
interactions with this Shimura's family?

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.730
No...

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.640
Why not?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.520
Shimura's husband was killed,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.900
so she put her child in foster care
to keep her child away from the hero world.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.900
"Nana Shimura - Quirk: One For All"

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.240
She told Toshinori and me that she didn't
want us to have any contact with the child

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.950
even if the worst were to happen to her.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.910
So your promise to the deceased backfired...

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.670
That's sad.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.210
The blood relationship that
my master severed for the sake of peace...!

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.150
I must find Shigaraki...

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.960
Find him and...

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.710
No. What're you planning
to do once you find him?

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.340
You're not looking at him as a villain anymore.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.890
You will definitely hesitate.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.080
No matter who he's related to, he is a criminal.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.890
Tsukauchi and I will investigate
Shigaraki from here on out.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.150
You stay at U.A. and do
everything you should be doing.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.150
Even if you cannot be
the Symbol of Peace anymore,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.310
All Might is still alive.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.950
"Safe and Worry-Free"
"Regional Safety Campaign"
"Stop!"

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.950
After the incident, we met up
with Todoroki and Yaoyorozu

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.460
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All" "Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine" "Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.460
and went with Kacchan to the police.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.460
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.910
Kacchan was quiet.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.300
And then, after more than
half a day, we headed home.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.220
"Shocking! All Might's True Form"

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.100
Welcome back!

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.980
Oh, something crazy is happening, Shoto.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.360
I was so worried because you didn't return
my messages after you went to see Mom!

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.490
Sorry, Sis.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.700
He came back a little while ago,
and he's been like that ever since.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.710
If All Might really cannot stand
on the front lines anymore,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.210
"Training Room"

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.210
then the position of number one is--

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.140
"Pro Hero - Endeavor - Quirk: Hellflame"

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.180
I don't accept it... Not like this...

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.140
Like I could accept it!

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.500
I cannot accept it!

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.240
Welcome home.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.690
"Inko Midoriya"

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.190
It looks like All Might had a hard time, huh?

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.200
"Midoriya"

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.200
You must've had a hard time getting home, too.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.230
Yeah...

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.370
"YAP! News"
"All Might fighting a monstrous villain"

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.980
What'll happen now?

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.040
Were my actions really okay?

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.310
All Might...

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.520
Hey! Where are you going?
The food's almost ready!

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.400
L-Later!

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.570
"Dagoba Municipal Beach Park"

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.330
All Might!

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.490
Oh, you're finally here.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.370
All Might!

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.120
You took so long!

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.330
All Might!

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.880
Texas...

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.670
Smash!

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.260
You really don't keep your word, do you?

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.430
Everything was almost in vain, you know.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.650
Jeez, who do you take after?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.520
Young Midoriya, I...

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.330
...am effectively retired.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.770
My body cannot fight anymore.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.700
The last embers of One For All have gone out,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.450
and I can't really keep my muscle form anymore.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.540
But even so, every single time,
you rush out no matter what I tell you!

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.340
No matter how many times I tell you,
you keep destroying your body!

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.710
That's why, this time...!

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.430
...when you got out of a predicament
for the first time without getting injured,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.860
I was so happy.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.730
From here on out,
I will devote myself to raising you.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.360
Let's keep... working hard together.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.660
A-All Might...

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.290
You really don't keep your word, do you?

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.910
Didn't I tell you to stop being a crybaby?

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.250
The slight pain lingering in my cheek

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:56.050
throbbed as it told me that it was
the end of the era of All Might.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.930
"End of the Beginning, Beginning of the End"

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.930
"All Might" "(True Form)"
"Quirk: One For All"
"Smashes villains with a super power passed down from one generation to the next."

Thank you, All Might.

"Pro Hero - Vlad King - Quirk: Blood Control"
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"
"Pro Hero - Nezu - Quirk: High Specs"

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.320
For a long time, you sacrificed
your body to save thousands.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.520
As a citizen, a hero, and the principal,
I cannot thank you enough.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:25.460
However, there are many who do not believe
you should continue as a teacher at U.A.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.460
"Symbol of Peace and
No. 1 Hero, All Might, Retires!!!"

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.840
"This was all because
All Might started working at U.A."

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.970
"Won't the children be caught up again
now that he cannot fight anymore?"

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.800
Everyone's uneasy.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.140
That's why this time, we must make stronger

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.560
the faith in the heroes
you have passed the torch on to.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.770
However, the threat is still there.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.450
We must protect and train
with more strength than before.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.160
That is why we will proceed to implement
a plan that I've had in mind for a while.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.740
"Notice of the Introduction
of the U.A. All-Dorm System"

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.340
I'm counting on you all to visit the families.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.580
That's not very rockin'.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.040
Even if it didn't turn out
to be anything serious,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.750
to announce that you're going to move
to an all-dorm system like nothing happened

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.420
after my only daughter was injured...

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.680
What you are saying is quite right.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.580
However, we took another look at the pride and negligence that

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.030
grew without our realizing it

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.770
and thought about what we could do.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.440
Will you leave it to us just this once?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.770
We will definitely raise
Kyoka to be a fine hero.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.440
Oh, Mr. Aizawa, you don't have to bow!

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.440
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.660
We'd already decided what to do
after we got the notice in the mail.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.410
When this old man saw
All Might's fight, I heard he said...

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.950
I can't believe my daughter's
being taught by someone so rockin'!

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.370
It's seriously like Brian the Sun!

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.380
...and cried!

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.670
Kyoka, stop!

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.210
--I was trying to act like a strict dad!
--Shut up, old man!

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.260
Stop it, you two.
We're not at a loud punk concert.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.720
I was prepared to face more criticism.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.560
I'll buy you a drink.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.360
Oh, stop. That's not like you.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.900
I can't drink, anyway, and the next family...

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.070
...probably won't be that easy.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.660
Oh, sure! I'm counting on you!

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.950
Don't hit me, old lady! I'll kill you!

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.740
Shut up! It's your fault to begin
with for being so weak!

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.910
You got caught, and now you're
causing everyone trouble!

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.960
You two... stop it...

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.250
You're startling the teachers...

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.290
Shut up, damn old man! Don't butt in!

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.840
You're the one who should shut up!

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.340
If you're going to talk, then speak clearly!

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.050
What's with the darkness in this family...?

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.510
Um, is it really all right?

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.220
Hm?

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.520
Oh, the dorm, right?

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.060
We'd actually be grateful.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.900
Katsuki's reckless
and really good at everything,

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.440
and he was blessed with a good Quirk, too,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.440
so he had other people fawning over him
all the time and ended up like this.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.360
He kept getting praised for shallow stuff.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.450
That's why I was really happy to hear
what you said at the press conference.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.370
He is trying harder than anyone
in his pursuit of becoming the "top hero."

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.960
If the villains saw that
and thought they had an opening,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.340
then I believe they are being short-sighted.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.430
Yeah, it made me think that this school
was really watching him carefully.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.760
I was worried for a while
and wasn't sure how it would turn out,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.470
but he's back safe and sound now, so...

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.960
You might face some harsh criticism for a while,

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.310
but I trust you guys and will leave him to you.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.650
Right?

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.500
Yeah.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.320
He's a hopeless guy, but please train
him hard and make him a good hero.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.550
Shall I buy you a drink?

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.160
Next is...

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.630
Midoriya's house is close by, right?

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.070
All Might.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:55.870
Hm?

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.270
Next, it's your turn.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.890
What is Deku to you?

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.520
He's my student.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.630
Just like you.
A future hero with bright prospects.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.770
I'm sorry, Young Bakugo.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.810
I just can't tell you any more.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.180
Hey Katsuki, the police said not to go outside!

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.700
I see.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.700
If you don't want to tell me, that's fine.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.260
Thanks.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.040
Katsuki!

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.710
I know!

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.380
Are you sure you'll be all right by yourself?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.590
Yeah, we need to talk to
everyone in the class today, right?

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.940
I'll take this place.
Maybe you should hurry, too...

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.230
"Midoriya"

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.610
P-Please come in!

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.560
Excuse me.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.070
A-A-A-All Might is in our home!

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.820
Mom, calm down!

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.660
Yes, I believe we have
already sent notice of this,

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.960
but I'm here to talk about U.A.'s dorm system...

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.540
Yes, about that...

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.710
I'm against it.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.710
Mom?!

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.170
You said it was okay yesterday!

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.220
I thought about it! But I don't like it!

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.220
Izuku's Quirk never appeared,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.750
but he still admired you for so long.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.480
But since his Quirk miraculously appeared...

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.150
Ever since he entered U.A., Izuku...

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.310
He just keeps getting more and more beat up.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.610
Did you know about Izuku's arms?

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.120
If he injures them any more,
he might lose his ability to move them!

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.280
I watched your fight the other day on TV.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.010
As a regular citizen, I am very thankful.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.420
But as a parent, I was scared.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.300
Izuku looks up to you.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:11.140
If his path leads to a future filled
with blood like that, then I...

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.930
Help!

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.350
I am here!

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.600
I...

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.270
I'm sorry, Izuku!

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.890
I'm sorry.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.550
I...

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.450
I feel like maybe staying Quirkless
and happily watching heroes work

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.610
would have made him happier.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.870
I couldn't help it.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.330
Mom!

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:41.620
Izuku, I told you that I would support you,
but that I wouldn't stop worrying, right?

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.900
You want to go to U.A., right?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.450
But...

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.290
I'm sorry, Izuku...

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:58.480
This was the obvious consequence
of ignoring my mother's feelings up until now.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.350
I will speak frankly.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.940
As Izuku's mother,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:10.740
I don't have the nerves of steel I'd need to
entrust my son to U.A. High School as it is now.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.080
It does not matter how
wonderful of a hero you are.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.410
When villains attacked,
you couldn't continue classes,

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.460
and you couldn't stop the students
from getting seriously injured...

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.720
I don't want to let my son attend
a school like that any longer.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.670
I...

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:29.710
Mrs. Midoriya--

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.300
It's not like that, Mom!

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.380
It was my own fault that I got hurt!

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.930
The teachers all told me over and over--

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.180
It was me who didn't listen--

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.850
If this is how it turned out,

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.980
then don't you think that's
the school's responsibility?

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.890
Young man, sit down.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.940
I might be acting like a "monster parent."

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.940
But I'm fine being a monster.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.740
I don't want to steal
Izuku's dream away from him.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.240
If he really wants to be a hero,
then he could go to a different school.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.040
There are a lot with hero courses, right?

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.000
Izuku!

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.250
This must be heartbreaking.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.880
For you who looked up to me
and followed in my footsteps,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.510
there is great meaning in studying at U.A.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.010
To have to give that up...

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.830
I'm sorry. I'll call him back.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.150
It's fine. Even if it's not U.A.!

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.480
Look, Mom, All Might.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.690
I got a letter.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.610
From the boy I saved at the training camp.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.910
A kid who hated heroes
and even Quirks said, "Thank you"!

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:52.170
"Dear Mr. Midoriya,
I'm sorry I punched you in the balls.
Thank you for saving me
 even though you barely knew me."

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.500
I'm still hopeless
and will make you worry a lot,

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.580
but even so, for one instant,

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.170
this letter, and this boy, made me a hero.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.290
I was really happy!

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.050
I see.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.440
It doesn't have to be U.A. Anywhere is fine!

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.850
Because I will become a hero!

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.750
You are already...

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.530
You are already more than someone
who is just following in my footsteps.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.530
In that case, as your teacher,
I must support you.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.430
You and the path you walk.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.000
I apologize for doing things out of order.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.010
I believe that Young Izuku
is the right person to succeed me...

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.260
What I mean is, I believe he is the person
who should become the Symbol of Peace.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.430
Huh? What? Wait a minute,
please stop. What is this?

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.350
It is an apology... as the one who
was formerly the Symbol of Peace.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.020
I was weak to his admiration
and negligent in my teachings.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.440
I humbly apologize!

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.030
And this is my entreaty as a U.A. teacher--

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.950
It's true that my path was filled with blood.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.330
But that is why, to keep him
from going down the same path,

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.230
I want to stand by him
and walk together with him.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.880
All Might...!

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.050
He's such a cool hero...

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.760
Can I... be a hero, too?

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.140
I don't blame you for having
misgivings about the current U.A.!

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.390
But the U.A. heroes also know
that they cannot continue like this

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.770
and are trying to change!

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.030
Is there any way you can look not
at the current U.A., but at the future U.A.?

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:43.280
Will you allow me to pour
my all into Young Izuku?

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.580
I will protect him and raise him up,
even if I have to give my life to do so!

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.500
M-Mom!

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.050
I don't like this after all...

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.350
I mean, you are Izuku's reason for living.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.810
It's not that I hate U.A.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:14.730
I just want Izuku to be happy.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.900
So don't give up your life.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.900
Please live properly
to protect him and raise him.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.910
If you can promise me that,
then I will allow it.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.690
Mom...!

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.110
I promise.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:42.740
Izuku, if you're going to live at U.A.,
then you understand, right?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.640
I definitely won't make you worry!

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:54.440
Mr. All Might, please take care of my son.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.400
"Special Prison For Villain Criminals -
Tartarus"

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.370
I lost, All Might.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.370
It was a pitiful struggle.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.440
But you were wrong.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.880
At the end of the fight, you chose a path
that led you closer to your students.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.380
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.370
You missed your chance to leave.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.430
You lost your chance to die.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.590
A teacher's job is to help
his student become independent.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.890
The teacher he's come to rely on
goes someplace he can't reach,

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.640
and his hatred grows stronger,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.900
allowing him to walk the path of a true leader.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.820
He has comrades.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.150
He's learned how to increase their number.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.160
You'll be fine, Tomura Shigaraki.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:16.040
Take all the experience, hatred,
and regret and use it to move forward.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.290
Next, it's your turn.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.920
"Preview"

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.920
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.380
Our new life in the dorms
with our classmates has begun!

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.630
But suddenly, we have to
decide whose room is the best.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.740
Next time, "Moving into Dorms"!

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:36.480
"Next time: Moving into Dorms"

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.060
Go beyond!

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.070
Plus Ultra!
