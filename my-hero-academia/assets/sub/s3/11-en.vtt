WEBVTT

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.590
My origin...

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.550
I want to make a world where
everyone can smile and live together.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.760
A symbol is necessary for that to happen.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.260
A symbol?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.220
A Symbol of Peace...

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.680
The reason crime in
this country isn't decreasing

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.930
is that the citizens have no support...

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.310
They have no pillar they can rely on.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.570
That's why I will become that pillar.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.570
Is that why you want to be a hero?

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.360
Even though you're Quirkless?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.490
Yes.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
Toshinori Yagi... right?

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
"Nana Shimura - Quirk: One For All"

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.460
You're really funny.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.040
You're crazy.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.010
"One For All"

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.390
Midoriya, are you okay over there?

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.440
Yeah! How about you guys?
Were you able to make a clean escape?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.650
I think so.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.020
We escaped from behind.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.110
The pros are giving us evacuation instructions.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.820
Good! We're in front of the station.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.610
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.120
"Breaking News Alert"

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.780
Looks like we're out of
the range of that shockwave.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.320
Our recovery was successful!

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.120
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.540
Listen. You didn't rescue me, okay?

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.330
You all just happened
to be the best escape route.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.920
Nice decision!

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.630
I didn't want to get in All Might's way.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.420
Yeah... We'd get in the way.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.920
This was the best we could do in this situation.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.390
Even Gran Torino's here.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.600
We made the right decision, didn't we?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.360
It was okay, right? All Might...

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.270
You really are similar...

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.740
...to the previous One For All
successor, Nana Shimura.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.030
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.660
Be proud, Toshinori!

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.950
It's different from
if you had one to begin with.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.790
You worked hard to secure that power!

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.500
Do not sully the name of my honored master...
with that filthy mouth of yours...!

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.260
She was a woman with no
skill whose ideals got ahead of her.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.510
She was an embarrassment to me
as the one who created One For All.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.310
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.060
She died in a really pathetic way.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.770
Where shall I start...?

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.810
Enough!

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.320
Teacher!

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.450
You're in the way...

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.950
This is the same as six years ago!

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.580
Toshinori, calm down!

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.700
You were so caught up in
his challenge that you let him escape!

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.660
And then he made a hole in your stomach!

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.880
That's what's hopeless about you!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.920
Don't exchange words with him!

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920
Yes, sir...

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.340
His fighting style and Quirk seem
completely different from last time!

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.680
You won't be able to get a good hit in head on!

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.640
You'll have to be tricky.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.350
Can you still move?

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.510
Go beyond your limit!

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.640
It's do-or-die time!

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.140
Yes, sir!

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.480
This scene looks like
it's straight out of a nightmare!

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.270
In an instant, half of
Camino Ward has been destroyed!

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.320
Currently, All Might is fighting
the villain thought to be the ringleader!

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.740
I can't believe it!

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.410
There's just one villain!

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.120
"Pro Hero - Vlad King - Quirk: Blood Control"
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.990
He's destroyed the city and is more than
holding his own against the Symbol of Peace!

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.500
"Pro Hero - Nezu - Quirk: High Specs"

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.950
Our plan has been thwarted...!

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.080
Tsukauchi...! All Might...!

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.960
"Villains' Numbers, Quirks Unknown"
"Camino Ward, Yokohama" "Live"

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.040
What is this? Oh, jeez...

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.090
The city's all torn up!

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.340
Doesn't All Might look kind of beat up?

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.550
Whoa, he's getting really beat up!

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.260
Where's Camino again?

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.390
Daddy might not have
to go to work tomorrow...

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.720
What are the other heroes doing?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.560
Don't you think the villains
are going a little too wild recently?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.640
Or the heroes are losing too much.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.600
They're getting soft! Like I can talk.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.650
But I think it's true.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.150
Well, but in the end,
All Might will take care of it, right?

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.940
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.450
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.200
I'm a little conflicted...

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.000
The trust in heroes that
Tomura steadily chipped away at...

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.040
I wonder if it's okay for me
to land the decisive blow...

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.170
But you know, All Might,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.510
as much as you hate me,

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.170
I hate you in the same way.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:53.180
I killed your master, but you took
away the things I built up, too, right?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.020
That's why I want you to die the ugliest
and most gruesome death possible!

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.770
A big one's coming!

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.020
Dodge it and counterattack!

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.030
Is it enough to just dodge?

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.400
Hey!

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.410
I will steal away the things
you protected until now.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.090
First, your self-respect
you kept even with your injury.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.050
Show the world your pathetic form,
"Symbol of Peace."

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.480
Huh?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.190
What's with that skeleton...?

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.650
Um... What's...? Huh?

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.730
Can you all see this?

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.530
All Might has... deflated...

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.780
This was not made public to the world.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.080
I asked that it not be made public.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.500
I will save people with a smile!

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.830
The Symbol of Peace
cannot be daunted by evil.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.670
All Might's...

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.510
...secret is...

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.260
Hollow cheeks and sunken eyes!

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.140
What a pathetic "top hero"!

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.350
Don't be embarrassed!

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.480
That's your true form--the real you--isn't it?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.610
I see...

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.740
Even if my body rots and grows weak...

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.410
Even if you try to expose that form...

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.740
...my heart will remain
that of the Symbol of Peace!

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.210
It is not something that
you can steal even a single piece of!

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.460
Wonderful. I give up.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.210
I'd forgotten what a stubborn
and naughty child you were.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.550
Then perhaps this will not
hinder your heart at all either:

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.930
You know, Tomura Shigaraki
is Nana Shimura's grandson!

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.690
I kept thinking about
what you would hate the most.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.820
I created chances for you and Tomura to meet.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.900
You defeated him, right?

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:18.160
You smiled so proudly when you won,
not knowing a thing.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.200
Lies...

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.000
It's the truth.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.040
You realize it, don't you?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.500
That it's something I would do.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.090
Oh, that's strange, All Might.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.300
Where's your smile?

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.970
When you have to save someone,

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.140
that means that the person
went through something scary.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.110
So true heroes don't just
save lives, they save hearts, too.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.070
That's what I think.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.820
No matter how scared you are,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.740
you should smile to show that you're okay.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.740
Because in this world, the ones
who are smiling are the strongest.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.370
You... bastard...

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.710
This really is fun!

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.300
Maybe I was able to steal a piece, huh?

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.300
He's... a relative of my master's...

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.850
What have I done...?!

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.520
Don't... lose...

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.230
All Might... please...

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.980
Help!

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.900
All Might!

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.160
Isn't this bad?!

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.740
Win...

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.450
--No... No way...
--All Might...

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.920
If you can't win, then who can?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.380
Even if he looks different,
All Might is All Might, right?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.000
Haven't you always been
able to save us somehow?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.840
All Might, you can do it!

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.930
Don't lose, All Might!

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.840
You can do it!

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.300
--Win!
--Win!

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.890
All Might!

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.440
Of course, Miss.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.150
Yeah, there's a lot...

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:18.490
A hero has a lot to protect, All For One.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.370
That's why I won't lose!

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.040
Toshinori, when you think
you're at your limit, remember--

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.960
I will remember...

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.090
Remember why you clench your fist--

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.130
Remember why...

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.050
Where you came from... your origin.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.770
That'll bring you just a little past your limit!

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.520
My origin...

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.230
I want to make a world where
everyone can smile and live together.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.160
How many times has he cancelled
out such large-scale attacks...?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.080
He should've passed
his limit a long time ago...

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.330
Muscle form on just his right arm...

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.870
His distorted form is telling me that...

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:17.380
All your might... that was
the last of it, wasn't it, All Might?

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.760
A wounded hero is the most frightening.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.760
I see the image of your face as you come
after me with your guts strewn around

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.600
in my dreams sometimes even now.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.520
Oh, no!

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.940
I should watch for two or three swings, huh?

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.320
What, bastard...

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.820
"Pro Hero - Endeavor - Quirk: Hellflame"

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.330
What is that form of yours, All Might?!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.290
Looks like we made it in time somehow...

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.790
The Nomus here look like
they've all been rendered harmless.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.170
Please go help All Might!

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.670
"Pro Hero - Edgeshot - Quirk: Foldabody"

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.000
He knew...

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.540
...that it would turn out like this...

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.510
Oh? Even though they were all mid-rangers,

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.800
I didn't think you'd be able
to suppress them so soon.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.010
As expected of the man who climbed
his way to the number two spot.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.480
All Might...

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.980
I worked diligently to surpass you...

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.570
The harder I worked, the more I realized...

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.530
...how big the difference between us was.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.280
As I watched your back grow further away...

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.110
I despaired...!

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.830
What is with that pitiful back?!

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.910
Endeavor...

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.960
If you just came to cheer him on,

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.250
then be quiet and watch like a good audience!

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.630
Quiet, you destroyer!

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.010
We have come to help!

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.550
"Pro Hero - Kamui Woods - Quirk: Arbor"

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.680
That is our job!

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.430
You did your best, Mt. Lady.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.260
Kamui Woods...

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.230
All Might.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.440
"Pro Hero - Tiger - Quirk: Pliabody"

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.350
This is all we can do...

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.610
If we can help ease
your burden even a little...!

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.190
Tiger!

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.450
Please stop that evil man, All Might...!

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.240
Everyone is praying for your victory!

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.490
No matter what you look like,

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.540
you are still everyone's number one hero!

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.920
Toshinori Yagi?

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.880
He's an interesting guy.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.170
He's crazy.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.010
According to him, there
hasn't been a decrease in crime

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.050
because the citizens
don't have anyone to rely on.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.260
He says this country has
no pillar of support right now,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.520
so he will become that pillar.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.020
Toshinori...

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.100
You are a pillar.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.980
A pillar that must not be broken.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.610
You are the number one hero.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.650
You can hear them, can't you?

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.990
Even if he's threatening
to expose your weakened body,

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.830
everyone's voices are
continuing to cheer you on!

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.710
Everyone's voices that
are praying for your victory!

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:03.920
The voices of your students who admire you
and want to become a hero like you!

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.430
All Might...!

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.180
How annoying.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.650
Let's stop talking about emotions
and start talking about reality.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:32.080
Springlike Limbs, Kinetic Booster times four,
Strength Enhancer times three,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:39.330
Multiplier, Hypertrophy, Rivets,
Air Walk, and Spearlike Bones.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:45.340
The shockwaves until now were
just to wear you out, not kill you.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.920
In order to kill you for sure,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:56.020
I will punch you with the ultimate
combination of Quirks that I have right now!

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:03.060
I am finally certain after
exchanging blows with you, All Might...

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.320
One For All no longer dwells inside you.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.820
What you are using now
are the lingering dregs...

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.700
The embers left after you passed it on.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.870
And that fire becomes
weaker each time you use it.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.630
A feeble light that will go out
without even being blown on...

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.710
Izuku Midoriya!

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.970
He's the one you passed
One For All on to, isn't he?

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.930
He came without any qualifications...

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.470
It's as if you have
no control over him at all...

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.890
You can die full of regrets, All Might.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.520
Even as a teacher, it's your loss!

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.620
Impact Nullification!

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.790
That's right.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:10.300
As a teacher, I should've reprimanded him.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:16.140
I have to reprimand him!

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.390
I see...

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.060
The weak embers that are
going out without even being blown on

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.900
are resisting, huh?

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:31.150
They're desperately resisting to keep
from going out until they fulfill their duty...

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.650
How unsightly!

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:44.920
...when you think you're
at your limit, remember--

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.960
It's not just because I'm a symbol.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.840
Like my master did for me...

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.010
...until I finish training him...

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.510
Until then--

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.680
For you to resist so much
in such an unsightly way...

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.190
I can't--

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.730
I miscalculated...

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.520
I can't die!

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.740
You won't be able
to get a good hit in head on!

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.490
You'll have to be tricky.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.120
In that last swing, he put the
power of his right arm into his left...!

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.460
He used his right arm as bait!

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.170
But--

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.170
Little tricks like that aren't like you.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.590
Someone else has been influencing you!

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.260
It's weak!

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:41.060
That's because my back wasn't in it!

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.690
This power has been entrusted
to the next generation by many people,

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.980
praying that it would
work for the good of all.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.360
That all their hopes would become one.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.030
It's your turn now.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.950
Do your best, Toshinori.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.630
Farewell, All For One!

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.510
United States of...

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.600
...Smash!

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.400
Farewell, One For All...

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.190
All Might...!

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.990
The villain has stopped moving!

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.370
Victory for All Might!

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.120
He's standing in victory!

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.790
Hey, he shouldn't push himself right now--

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.710
Let him be.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.300
He's still working.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:42.100
It's his last job as the Symbol of Peace,
and the number one hero...

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.180
All Might! All Might! All Might! All Might!

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:55.900
All Might! All Might! All Might! All Might!

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.620
"Pro Hero - Uwabami"

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.950
There are two people below here!

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.370
Over there, too!

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.960
The heroes continued rescue
operations during All Might's fight,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.710
but it is expected that there will
be a large number of casualties...

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.460
The villain thought
to be the ringleader is now...

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.510
Oh, they're leading him
into the Maiden right now!

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.140
Now, as All Might and the others
are in a state of high alert!

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.600
--The trains are currently not running!
--We can't go anywhere...

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.940
--We are passing out blankets here, too!
--I wish we could meet up
with Todoroki and Yaoyorozu, but...

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.690
Anyway, let's move.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.730
We have to tell the heroes about Bakugo, right?

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:40.690
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.240
Yeah...

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.070
Next...

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.580
Next, it's your turn.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.670
All Might!

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.300
You really are amazing after all...!

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.640
The short message from All Might...

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.480
On the surface, it appeared
to be a warning to criminals yet unseen.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.150
The unbending figure of the Symbol of Peace...

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.610
But, I heard the complete opposite.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.040
"I have used up everything in me..."

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.020
"Preview"

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.980
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.270
All Might has essentially retired.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.820
I will be the one to take over--

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.530
His will as All Might, and One For All.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.820
Next time, "End of the Beginning,
Beginning of the End."

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:35.030
"Next time: End of the Beginning,
Beginning of the End"

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.070
Go beyond!

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.450
Plus Ultra!
