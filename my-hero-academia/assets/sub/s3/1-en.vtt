00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.600
U.A. High School's hero course...

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.980
In a world where about 80% of the population
has some kind of superpower called a "Quirk,"

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.490
this prestigious school was built to raise
heroes to oppose villains and their crimes.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.610
I, Izuku Midoriya, am a student at this school,
working hard to achieve my dream--

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.750
To become someone who
can save people with a smile...

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.510
Yes, this is the story of
how I became the greatest hero!

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.310
"Summer Vacation Hero Special:

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.690
"All Might Becomes a High School Teacher"

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.270
From Number One Hero
to U.A. High School Teacher."

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.320
This time, we will look back
at All Might's work and his great--

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.280
"Villain - Kurogiri - Quirk: Warp Gate"

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.200
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.200
I figured it out.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.700
I know why the hero killer pisses me off

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.710
and why those U.A. brats irritate me.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.840
It's all because of All Might.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.340
It's because he's always
smiling thoughtlessly,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.560
as if there was no one he couldn't save.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.850
Because he's always smiling thoughtlessly...

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.230
Izuku Midoriya.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.520
He was Quirkless until
his third year of middle school,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.610
but then he suddenly manifested a Quirk.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.650
In April of this year, after enrolling at
U.A. High School, he distinguished himself,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.070
finishing in the top eight
at the U.A. sports festival.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.530
And then,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.260
during the Hosu incident, he and his friends
fought against Hero Killer: Stain, and won.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.790
At that time, the hero killer saved his life.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.260
The boy acknowledged by the hero killer,
the man seeking true heroes.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.410
The complete opposite of Tomura Shigaraki...

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.720
I'll make it myself--

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.970
A world without All Might.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.790
And I'll show everyone...

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.900
...just how fragile that
so-called justice is.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.900
"Game Start"

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.620
U.A. High School has finished
all classes for the first semester

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.130
and started summer vacation.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.460
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.160
But that didn't mean
I had time to play.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.380
To prepare for the upcoming
training camp in the woods,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.510
I continued my independent training.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.260
Can you see that?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
He's already saved a hundred people!

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.720
That's crazy! It hasn't
even been ten minutes!

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.010
That's crazy!

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.020
He's laughing!

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.400
It's fine now. Why?

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.500
Because I am here.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.720
All Might...

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.410
There are still times when
I can't believe it...

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.010
That All Might acknowledged me
and transferred his Quirk to me...

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.000
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.290
Mineta? Kaminari?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.750
Hey, Midoriya!

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.380
Let's go to the pool!

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.050
The pool?

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.800
Yeah, before the summer training camp--

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.300
Let's train together!

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.060
Vlad, about the strength increasing
part of the summer training camp...

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.770
"Pro Hero - Vlad King"

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.690

the Quirks of the Class A students for me?

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.570

We should also look at Class B's Quirks--

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.180
Excuse us.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.890
What is it, you three?

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:47.230
Mr. Aizawa, about the form we turned in
the day before yesterday to use the pool...

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.940
Oh right, the school granted permission.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.900
You can use the pool until 5 p.m.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.860
Yes, sir!

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.160
Thank you very much!

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.680
You said you wanted to use
the pool for endurance training, right?

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200
Do your best.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.570
Yes, sir!

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.580
Using the pool for endurance training, huh?

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.420
What a great idea, Mineta!

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.590
If we're at school,
then we can use our Quirks, too.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.550
It's perfect for training!

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.840
We're in the hero course, you know.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.840
Go beyond!

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.010
Plus Ultra!

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.180
Ultra!

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.600
It was the right choice to invite
the diligent Midoriya, Mineta.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.850
If it had just been us, we might not have
gotten permission to use the pool, huh?

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.320
By the way, there's
no problem with that, is there?

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.570
Of course not. I overheard by accident--

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.570
After finals were over...

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.830
We have to refrain from
taking long trips over the summer?

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.490
Apparently, it's a request from the school.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:45.080
That's too bad. I was supposed
to go to Venice with my parents.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.460
How bourgeois!

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.340
Aw, I bought a new swimsuit, too!

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.840
It can't be helped.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.470
We were attacked by
the League of Villains before.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.340
Even so, I wanna play! I wanna go somewhere!

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.560
Then, do you wanna meet up at
the school pool over summer vacation?

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.900
Yeah, if we're using the school pool, then
I'm sure the teachers will give us permission.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.480
Good idea! Then we won't have
to spend any money, either.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.010
It's better than being cooped up at home.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.490
Then, I'll go get permission from the school.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.950
That's what I heard!

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.120
Then we have no choice but to go!

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.710
Let's find the new charm of
the girls in a different setting!

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.170
Come, let us go...

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.920
...to our paradise!

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.500
You're late!

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.260
Hey, hey, hey!

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Why are you guys here?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.300
Since we're doing
endurance training at the pool,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.850
I messaged everyone
to see if they wanted to come.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.270
Is that what happened?

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.810
You're too diligent, Midoriya!

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.100
Calm down, Kaminari.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.900
There are definitely girls in swimsuits here!

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.360
I'll burn the sight into my eyes!

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.360
The sight of their new swimsuits!

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.240
Oh, Mineta.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.160
Kaminari, you came, too?

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.870
What's with those swimsuits?

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.330
They should be wearing bikinis.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.790
School-issue swimsuits are pretty good, too.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.290
You're okay with anything?

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.290
Kaminari, Mineta!

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.710
It was a great idea to suggest
endurance training at school!

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.380
I'm impressed!

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.340
Now, why don't you come
and sweat with the rest of us?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.720
N-No, wait...

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.930
W-Wait...

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.010
Wait a minute!

"Izuku Midoriya"

"Smashes villains with a super power passed down from one generation to the next."

Here I go!

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.960
Here!

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.450
Got it!

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.120
Ribbit!

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.780
Take that!

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.280
Got it!

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.290
All right, let's take a 15-minute break!

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.910
I brought these for everyone! Drink up!

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.040
Oh!

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.250
Just what I'd expect from the class rep!

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.290
I feel alive again. Thanks!

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.550
Why are the girls playing around?

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.180
They got permission
to use the pool for sunbathing.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.100
--It's too hard... too hard... too hard...

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.100
--Mineta, why did you apply
to use it for endurance training?

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.140
--It's too hard... too hard... too hard...

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.140
--We might not have
gotten permission otherwise!

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.480
You've been working out, huh?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.650
Yeah, I've been working out ever
since summer vacation started.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.940
We must do our utmost.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.190
Midoriya.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.740
You need to take a break.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.370
Thanks, Iida.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.120
What?

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.990
Well, I just thought it was strange.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:40.810
During the entrance exams, I didn't think
I'd end up being such good friends with you.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.550
Frankly, I didn't think
much of you back then.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.270
But during the practical exam...

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.570
Smash...!

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:07.790
...you prioritized saving
Uraraka over passing the exam.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:17.630
How can a hero course reject people
who save others and do the right thing?

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.420
Come, Young Midoriya.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.800
This is your hero academia!

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.020
I was so happy.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.700
It had always been my dream
to attend All Might's alma mater, U.A.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.820
But when I was told that whoever was last
place in the fitness test would be expelled,

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.290
I thought it was over for me.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.480
Even so, you didn't give up.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.950
Not during the combat training, either.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.490
Detroit...

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.590
...Smash!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.510
What the--?

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.260
Improvised special move--

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.600
Comet Home Run!

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.310
You call that a home run?!

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.560
Retrieved!

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.770
This was all...

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.300
I could think of...

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.780
It's true that your methods were reckless,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.580
but I could feel your tenacity, Midoriya.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.810
I think that's what Bakugo and I lost to.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.720
That's...

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.880
I'm here thanks to the
help of many different people.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.840
That's why I need to work harder!

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.850
Of course!

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:48.010
Otherwise there's no way
I'd lose to a damn nerd like you!

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.640
K-Kacchan!

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.640
I got your message, but sorry I'm late!

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.890
It took some time to get Bakugo to come.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.890
Is that what happened?

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.270
Hey, damn Deku!

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.980
You wanna decide things right now? Huh?

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.780
No... that's not...

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.860
It's true that just training
isn't that interesting.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:11.330
Everyone, do you want to see which of
the boys can swim 50 meters the fastest?

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.410
Yeah!

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.660
Sounds fun!

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.790
Let's do it!

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.170
Iida, we will help, too.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.790
Thanks!

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.290
What about Quirks? Can we use them?

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.590
We're at school,
so there shouldn't be a problem.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.590
However, you cannot cause
damage to any people or buildings!

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.510
I'll crush you, Deku!

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.320
Of course, I'll crush you, too,
Half-and-Half Bastard!

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.810
Then, on your marks...

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:42.310
Get set...

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.490
Explosive Speed Turbo!

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.030
How was that, you extras?!

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.280
What do you mean, "How was that"?!

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.620
You didn't even swim!

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.540
It's freestyle!

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.700
On your marks...

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.180
Get set...

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.580
Hi!

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.380
You're supposed to be swimming!

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.060
On your marks...

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.490
Get set...

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.140
You too, Iida?!

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.100
One For All...

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.150
...Full Cowling!

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.960
Wow!

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.250
Good job, Midoriya!

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.540
Iida, you were so close!

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.710
You beat me, Midoriya.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.520
Iida, you were amazing, too.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.390
Midoriya...

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:54.260
If you have something from
the number one hero, then I...

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.820
...have even more reason to beat you.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.560
By winning first place without
using my damn old man's Quirk,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.670
I'll reject him completely.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.990
You want to win with just
half your strength?!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.970
You haven't put a single
scratch on me yet, you know!

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.330
Come at with me with everything you've got!

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.020
It's your power, isn't it?!

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.370
I want... to be a hero, too...!

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.690
You must be Hero Killer: Stain!

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.530
I am the younger brother
of a hero you attacked.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.680
The younger brother of
a most excellent older brother!

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.150
I have come to stop you in his place!

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.610
You and your brother are both weak.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.960
Because you're fakes.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.540
Smash!

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.130
I came to save you, Iida!

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.720
You made me late.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.430
The two of us will protect them!

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.560
Why are you two...

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:20.930
Why...

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.980
Please, stop!

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.850
I've inherited my brother's name.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.280
Please stop...

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.980
I'm... already...

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.110
If you want us to stop, then stand up!

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.050
Look properly at what you want to be!

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.260
Todoroki, I vow once more

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.460
that I will become a hero
like my elder brother.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.460
I will also become the hero I wish to be...

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.480
I will also become a hero--

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.550
A hero like All Might,
who saves people with a smile...

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.470
"Let's make this town safe and peaceful"
"Regional Safety Campaign Going on Now"
"Stop! Drunk Driving"

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.060
U.A. High School was attacked by the League
of Villains during a rescue training session

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.520
during what became known
as the USJ incident...

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.320
There were indiscriminate attacks by Hero Killer:
Stain and the League of Villains in Hosu City,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.900
which became known as the Hosu incident...

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.740
And then, the other day,

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.200
Tomura Shigaraki, thought to be
the leader of the League of Villains

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.620
suddenly appeared before Izuku Midoriya,
a student in the hero course at U.A. High...

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.940
There have not been any significant moves
made by the League of Villains since.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.710
However, I'm sure they
are wriggling under the surface.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.670
I know.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.720
The police are working with heroes to gather
information about the League of Villains.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.220
"Police Officer - Naomasa Tsukauchi"

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.210
When that investigation bears fruit,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.560
we'll be counting on you, All Might.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.350
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.710
Of course, Tsukauchi.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:55.990
The winners of each heat--Bakugo, Todoroki,
and Midoriya--will race for first place.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.070
Is that all right?

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.780
Yup.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.610
Yeah.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.110
Hey, Half-and-Half Bastard!

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.120
Don't hold back like
you did at the sports festival.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.740
Come at me seriously!

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.250
All right.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.960
You too, damn Deku!

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.950
A-All right, Kacchan.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.050
Then, the 50-m freestyle
final will begin now!

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.630
Go, Bakugo!

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.970
Don't kill the other guys!

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.660
Todoroki, don't lose!

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.090
Do your best, Deku!

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.300
Everyone, fight!

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.060
On your marks...

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.810
I'll fly across all at once!

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.140
I'll slide through.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.570
I'll swim to the finish
with everything I've got!

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:34.480
Get set...

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.360
Wh-What?

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.200
Their Quirks were erased?

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.450
It's 5 p.m.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.870
Your pool use time has now ended.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.290
Hurry up and go home.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.620
Come on, Mr. Aizawa!

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.210
We just got to the good part!

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.000
Did you say something?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.710
Nothing, sir!

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.250
Damn it!

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.920
Stopping the race like that!

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.890
I know how you feel, but calm down.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.300
Midoriya and Todoroki are
classmates--and friends--right?

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.010
Shut up!

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:11.480
No matter who it is, I won't let them
catch up to me, let alone get ahead of me!

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:17.230
Isn't that what it means
to be better than All Might--

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.730
To be better than the number one hero?

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.740
"Dagoba Municipal Beach Park"

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.280
You have ten months
until the U.A. entrance exam.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.750
You must build up your body by then!

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.500
Young Midoriya?

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.500
All Might, why are you here?

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.270
What about you?

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.250
I'm here...

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.840
You can become a hero.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.140
Young man, I will tell you the truth.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.150
My Quirk was passed on
to me like a sacred torch.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.560
The power to transfer power...

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.610
That is the Quirk I inherited!

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.250
I was crowned with "One For All"!

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.070
And next, it is your turn.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.540
...because this is where I started.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.240
Young Midoriya, the summer
training camp will be tough.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.450
Do your best.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.010
I will!

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.720
The location for the
training camp has been changed?

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.230
It's a measure we're taking to be cautious

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.850
since information may be
getting leaked to the villains.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.610
Even within the school, only the
upper management is aware of this.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.140
Please keep this quiet.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.940
Even from the students.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.900
There's something I'd like you to prepare...

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.210
That's right, it's the start of a new game...

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.790
It's the preview!

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.590
Summer training camp has started.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.550
What appeared in front
