00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.180
If you're talking about Katsuki Bakugo,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.230
I took him with my magic.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.820
Damn it, that mask guy's fast!

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.070
We can't... give up...

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.110
We have to catch up...
and get them back!

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.830
Make sure you save those two.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.160
Ribbit!

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.340
I know these kids!

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.440
Who are they?!

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.260
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.360
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.060
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.610
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.620
Going back in time to right after everyone
first heard that Kacchan was being targeted

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.410
"What a Twist!"

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.000
through Mandalay's Telepath...

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.250
Sir, you heard Mandalay's Telepath, right?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.210
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.590
My friend's being targeted.
Please, let me go to him!

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.510
No.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.210
Why not?

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.880
Stop it, Kirishima.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.680
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.660
Sir, if we do not know
how many villains there are,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.760
then wouldn't it be better to have
as many people fighting as we can?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.060
Hey, are you planning on fighting the villains?

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.770
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.390
Yeah, that's right.
Even Mr. Aizawa said to fight, didn't he?

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.400
"Pro Hero - Vlad King - Quirk: Blood Control"

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.310
That is for self-defense.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.300
It was so everyone could get back here.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.900
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"
"Neito Monoma - Quirk: Copy"

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.900
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.110
Did someone come in?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.860
Do you think Mr. Aizawa came back...?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.740
Perfect timing. I'll go ask him directly.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.910
No, wait.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.700
It's not him!

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620
Everyone, get back!

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.340
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.800
That guy... Is he the villain
that was defeated earlier?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.960
"Villain - Dabi"

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.550
You're too slow!

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.010
Blood Control... It's so strong!

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.010
As expected of our Mr. Vlad!

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.980
You're pushing hard into
a place like this without thinking?

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.940
You're really underestimating us!

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.020
And why wouldn't we?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.280
You're acting exactly like I thought you would.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.280
You all lost the minute you lost the initiative.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.450
The pinnacle of hero education, U.A.,
and the Symbol of Peace, All Might.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.290
The two most trusted figures
of hero society, gathered together.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.340
If multiple incidents keep
putting that trust into question,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.550
then don't you think that
will shake society as a whole?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.760
Sloppy management that keeps
allowing attacks to get through,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.430
and in the end, being so weak as to allow a
student to be stolen away by a criminal group.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.310
Bastard, are you saying Bakugo's...

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.270
...going to be kidnapped by you?

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.770
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.770
Stop messing around!

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.650
Look, there are so few of us,
and we're driving you into a corner.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.690
You bastard...!

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.990
It's no use, Vlad!

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.450
Mr. Aizawa!

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.870
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.660
This guy's just trying to stir things up.
He won't tell us anything.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.540
Erasure Hero: Mr. Aizawa!

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.620
Besides, look--he's a fake.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.790
One came earlier, too.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.500
A fake...

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.920
Is that one of the villains' Quirks?

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.130
Eraser, what were you doing?

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.090
Sorry. I was planning to give
orders allowing the students to fight,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.430
but I ended up taking care of Kota.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.430
"Kota Izumi"

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.470
Take him for me.
I'm going out to the front lines.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.640
Vlad, I'm counting on you
to keep defending this place.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.850
Wait, Eraser!

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.890
We still don't know
how much they'll come at us.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.480
You'll be fine by yourself.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.310
Look at this fake.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.860
Both times, it was just one like this.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.230
I think they're coming strong at us

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.750
because they want to keep
our attention here since we're pros.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.240
It's their strategy to make up for
the small number of people they sent.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.700
If there are only a few,
then there's even more reason for me--

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.620
Yes! Nothing can beat strength in numbers!

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.750
No!

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.210
If they're trying to keep the pros back,
that means they're after the students.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.040
Bakugo's just one of them,
but they might be after others, as well.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.880
We're still losing by
a lot in terms of information.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.760
For the time being, we'll win by
having everyone stay safe and sound.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.640
And now back to the present...

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.100
Give Kacchan and Tokoyami back!

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.810
"Villain - Himiko Toga"
"Villain - Twice"

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.060
I know these kids!

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.810
Who are they?!

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.340
Mister, get out of the way.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.360
Roger!

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.280
Idiot! That's cold!

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.200
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.700
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.660
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.660
Midoriya! Shoji!

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.580
Faces from Shigaraki's kill list!

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.620
That little beat-up boy and you!

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.750
They weren't, though!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.590
That's hot!

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.260
I'm Toga, Izuku!

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.600
I thought so earlier, too,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.640
but you'd be cooler if you bled more, Izuku!

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.020
Midoriya!

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.980
Is that how it is?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.140
Are you going to get in the way?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.030
You're not my type at all,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.660
but I'll cut you anyway.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.330
She's crazy...

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:35.750
Good job!

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.660
This is easy!

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.610
Give me all you've got!

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.620
Stop messing around!

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.270
What's with this guy?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.090
Ow...

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.260
"Villain - Mr. Compress"

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.260
I can't believe you flew
so far to chase after me.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.720
Your ideas are far out!

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.600
Where's Bakugo?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.670
Of course...

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.500
Hm?

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.600
Midoriya, Todoroki, we're running away!

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.560
I'm sure now based on what he just did--

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.250
I don't know what your Quirk is,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.780
but inside
that right pocket of yours that you kept flaunting

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.740
were these--Tokoyami
and Bakugo, right, entertainer?

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.240
Shoji!

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.750
Oh, that didn't take you very long!

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.410
As expected of someone with six arms!

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.750
You're good at feeling around!

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.880
All right! Good job, Shoji!

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.840
--Moron--
--No, wait.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.260
A Nomu!

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.330
Over here!

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.970
Th-This guy...

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.720
...was at USJ...

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.980
The warp...

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.690
It has been five minutes since the signal.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.400
Let us go, Dabi.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.270
Sorry, Izuku, I'll see you later.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.070
Wait. Our goal is not yet--

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.800
Oh, that? They seemed so happy
that they rushed out here,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.490
so I thought I'd give them a present.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.040
It's a habit, one of the basics of magic.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.170
When I flaunt something,

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.560
it's because there's something
I don't want you to see.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.510
N-No way...!

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.140
My ice?!

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.390
That's right.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.430
During the freezing attack, I prepared
dummies and put them in my right pocket.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.690
Damn it!

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.020
His Quirk lets him compress and confine things?

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.570
If you discover that what was in
my right hand was in my right pocket,

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.860
then of course you'd rush happily over.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.490
Wait...!

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.200
And now, that's all from me--

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.540
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.540
Aoyama!

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.470
That's sad...

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.100
Shoto... Todoroki...

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.770
Confirm it now. Release this.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.770
My show's been ruined!

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.900
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.110
No problem.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.240
Kacchan!

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.210
Kacchan!

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.350
Don't come, Deku!

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.430

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.710
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.260
On that day...

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.100
...we who were aiming to be heroes

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.440
completely lost to the villains.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.020
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 7/15"
"Height: 166 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Pork Cutlet Bowl"

"Quirk: Explosion"
"He uses a nitroglycerin-like substance secreted on the palms of his hands to create explosions."

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.340
Apparently, Mr. Vlad King
called emergency services,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.120
and fifteen minutes after the villains left,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.430
ambulances and fire trucks arrived.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.670
Of the forty students,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.750
fifteen were unconscious and in
serious condition from the villains' gas,

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.300
and eleven others had major or minor injuries.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.510
Thirteen were uninjured.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.480
And...

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.910
...one was missing.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.060
"Pro Hero - Pixie-Bob - Quirk: Earthflow"

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.850
Of the six pro heroes,

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.440
one was in serious condition after
receiving a hard blow to the head,

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.350
"Pro Hero - Ragdoll - Quirk: Search"

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.270
and one lost a lot of blood and went missing.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.280
"Villain - Muscular -
Quirk: Muscle Augmentation"

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.280
Meanwhile, on the villain side,
three were caught red-handed and arrested...

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.820
"Villain - Mustard"

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.780
Leaving those three behind,
the other villains disappeared without a trace.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.780
"Villain - Moonfish - Quirk: Blade-Tooth"

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.870
As I felt my consciousness fading,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.040
I remembered the words
of that man, Tomura Shigaraki.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.290
More importantly, you should be careful.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:39.470
The next time we meet will likely be
when I have decided to kill you.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.430
The summer training camp that
we had all been looking forward to

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.890
ended in the worst way.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.350
"The Next Day (Still Summer Vacation)"

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.060
Will you open your gates?

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.360
I'm from Yomiuri TV.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.440
Is there an official statement from U.A. High?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.950
How do you plan on dealing
with the families of the victims?

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.210
To be attacked during a training camp meant
to prepare students to fight villains...

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.040
"Meeting Room"

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.040
We should be embarrassed by the irony.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.470
We feared the revitalization of villains,

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.880
but our understanding of it was naïve.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.570
They had already started their war--

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.010
Their war to destroy hero society.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.520
"Pro Hero - Nezu - Quirk: High Specs"
"Pro Hero - Midnight - Quirk: Somnambulist"

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.020
Even if we had understood it,
would we have been able to defend against it?

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.560
With all these persistent developments
unfolding one after another...

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.650
Ever since All Might, most
organized crime had been weeded out.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.150
"Pro Hero - Present Mic - Quirk: Voice"
"Pro Hero - Snipe - Quirk: Homing"

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.110
So we all got too complacent during
peaceful times without realizing it,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.280
thinking we had time to prepare.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.790
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.120
I am angry from the bottom of
my heart at my own cowardice.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.120
While they were fighting desperately, I...

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.630
...was relaxing in the tub.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.750
Having the sports festival
right after the attack...

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.720
We can't keep taking unyielding positions
like that, like we have up until now.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.640
To have a student kidnapped
is U.A.'s greatest failure.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.520
They have stolen the trust people
had in us heroes, along with Bakugo.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.310
All the news outlets are filled
with criticism of U.A. right now.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.150
If they were trying to get Bakugo,
then it was probably because

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.780
"U.A.'s Great Failure"

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.780
his violent side was made common
knowledge at the sports festival.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.570
"No contact since the incident"
"Katsuki Bakugo"

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.900
If he is won over by the villains,

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.900
"The Most Prominent Hero Educational
Institution's Many Scandals"
"Shaking the Trust in Hero Society"

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.030
"Bringing Careless Management to the Forefront"

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.030
then it's over for U.A.
as an educational institution.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.500
Since we're on the topic of trust,
there's something I'd like to say.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.830
We can say conclusively now--

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.670
There's a traitor among us, isn't there?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.340
Only the teachers and the Pussycats
knew where the training camp would be held!

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.760
That's not all that's suspicious!

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.260
Using their cellphone location
information, even the students--

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.470
Mic, stop it.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.800
How can I?

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.310
Let's clean this place up thoroughly!

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.520
What about you?
Can you prove that you're 100% innocent?

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.110
Can you assert that everyone here is innocent?

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.530
If we suspect each other, then we'll
destroy ourselves from the inside.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.240
Looking for a traitor isn't
something we should do in a hurry.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.160
At the very least, I trust you all.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.620
I can't prove definitively that
I'm completely innocent either, though.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:22.030
For now, what we must do as a school
is guarantee the safety of the students.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.290
With the suspected leak,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.590
there's something I've been thinking about doing for a while now.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.420
That's--

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.470
A phone call is here! A phone call--

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.180
Excuse me, I have to take this.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.060
We're in a meeting. Turn off your phone!

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.480
His ringtone's so lame...

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.530
What Symbol of Peace can't
even save his own students...?

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.150
What hero...?

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.370
Sorry, what is it, Tsukauchi?

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.460
We just got the statements
from Aizawa and Vlad King,

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.250
"Police Officer - Naomasa Tsukauchi"

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.330
but there's been an unexpected development!

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.050
We may be able to determine the
whereabouts of the League of Villains.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.340
Really, Tsukauchi?

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.270
Yeah.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.900
About two weeks ago, one of
my subordinates was gathering information

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.270
and found out that a man
with a patchwork face was seen

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.390
going into a building that
was supposed to be vacant.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.730
The man was said to be in his twenties,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.980
so he checked the records for past criminals
but didn't see anything notable.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.780
After checking with the owner of the building,

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.820
he found out that there
was a sort of hidden bar there,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.740
so he thought it was unrelated
to our investigation and ignored it.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.870
But one of the villains who kidnapped
the student this time had the same markings!

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.120
With the situation as it is,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.460
once we find evidence,
we'll be on them at once!

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.380
This is top secret.
I'm only telling you because it's you.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.380
We're planning on asking for
cooperation from a lot of pro heroes

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.760
for this rescue and cleanup mission.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.500
All Might, please lend us your power, too!

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.930
All Might?

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.190
I... had a wonderful friend.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.610
This is what I'll say when I meet those guys:

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.240
"I am here... to counterattack."

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.660
"The Most Prominent Hero Educational
Institution's Many Scandals"
"Shaking the Trust in Hero Society"

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.040
It appears the principal offenders
of the U.A. High training camp attack

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:30.170
"Is the League of Villains involved?"

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.090
called themselves the League
of Villains Vanguard Action Squad.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.960
For U.A. High, in both the
USJ incident and the Hosu incident,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.170
the name "League of Villains"--

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.010
Among the victims of the training camp attack

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.220
was the child of the pro heroes,
Water Hose, who were killed by Muscular--

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.890
We must conclude that there is some sort
of problem with the management of U.A. High.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:46.230
Even if my child wanted to become
a hero, I could not possibly enroll--

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.230
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.850
I'm really grateful for all
the publicity we've been getting.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.240
Hey, don't you agree...?

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.990
Katsuki Bakugo...

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.040
The day after that...

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.840
As for me,

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.670
I had been brought to a hospital near the
training camp immediately after the incident,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.010
and for two days,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.610
I was in and out of consciousness
with convulsions, delirious with fever.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.310
During that time, apparently
Recovery Girl came and healed me,

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.690
and the police came to visit,

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.310
but I don't remember a thing.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:33.280
"When you wake up,
please eat this and call me"

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.560
Mom's writing...

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.610
Izuku, I can't take this anymore.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.700
My heart can't take it...

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.730
Kota... I wonder if he's okay...

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.420
Oh, Midoriya, you're awake!

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.470
Did you see the news?

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.640
The media's swarming the school right now.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.800
It's way worse than in the spring.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.390
We've got a melon!
We bought it together! A big melon!

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.770
I caused you trouble, Midoriya...

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.830
No, I did, too...

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.650
Did everyone from Class A come?

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:19.200
No, Jiro and Hagakure are still
unconscious from the villains' gas.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:24.540
And Yaoyorozu also got hit hard
on the head and is hospitalized here.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.040
Apparently she regained consciousness yesterday.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.810
So everyone but those three came...

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.300
Fifteen of us...

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.460
Because Bakugo's not here.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.280
Hey, Todoroki!

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.510
Kacchan!

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.640
Don't come, Deku!

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:51.690
All Might said,
"I can't save the people I can't reach."

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.320
That's why he will always
save those he can reach.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.660
I... was in a place where I could reach...

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.900
I had to save him...

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.570
That's what my Quirk is for...

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.290
It's exactly like what Mr. Aizawa said to me.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.760
You'll just be decked and turn into
a useless doll after saving one person.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.750
My body... wouldn't move...

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.430
It was all I could do to save Kota...

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.740
I couldn't save someone right in front of me...

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.600
Then, let's save him this time.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.860
Actually, Todoroki and I
were here yesterday, too.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.950
Todoroki, why are you here?

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:42.950
What about you?

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.700
I... well... I couldn't just
sit still at home... and...

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.750
I see.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.690
Me neither.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.710
On our way to your room,

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.370
we saw All Might and a
police officer talking to Yaoyorozu.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.140
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.260
With the help of Awase from Class B,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.940
I attached a tracking device
to one of the villains.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.600
This device will receive that signal.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.980
Please use it for your investigation.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.850
Before, Aizawa said you lacked
the judgment to make quick decisions.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.570
You have grown so much!

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.490
Thank you, Young Yaoyorozu!

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.970
With a classmate in danger...

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:30.080
it is frustrating to only
be able to help in this way...

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.230
That feeling is proof that
you are worthy of being a hero.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.580
Please leave the rest to us!

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.800
Does this mean you're going to have
Yaoyorozu make another receiver?

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:47.390
What if it does?

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.120
Either way, we will need to take responsibility for

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.190
being negligent in our supervisory duties.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.110
I am truly sorry.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.940
All right. You'll cause trouble for others!

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.910
If you understand, then don't do it again!

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.030
It is as All Might said!

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.530
This is something we should leave to the pros!

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.240
This isn't the place for us to act, you idiots!

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.120
We know that!

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.250
But, I couldn't do anything!

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.040
After I heard that my friend was being targeted!

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.590
I couldn't do anything!

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.630
I didn't do anything!

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.010
If I don't do anything now,

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.630
I won't be a hero or a man anymore!

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.010
Kirishima, we're in a hospital. Calm down.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.180
It's fine to feel strongly
about things, but this time--

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.140
Iida is correct.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.550
Iida, all of you, you're all correct.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.260
I know that.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.610
But!

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.440
Hey, Midoriya, your hand can still reach!

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.480
We can go save him!

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
"Preview"

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.130
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:26.090
There's still a way to save Kacchan,
who was kidnapped by the League of Villains!

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.800
My outstretched hand can still reach.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.760
I can go save Kacchan.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.080
Next time, "From Iida to Midoriya"!

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:36.650
"Next time: From Iida to Midoriya"

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.300
Go beyond!

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.070
Plus Ultra!
