00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.270
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.230
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.200
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.870
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.680
All Might said, "I can't save
the people I can't reach."

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.060
That's why he will always
save those he can reach.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.690
I... was in a place where I could reach...

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.520
I had to save him...

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.830
That's what my Quirk is for...

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.580
My body... wouldn't move...

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.790
It was all I could do to save Kota...

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.560
I couldn't save someone right in front of me...

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.460
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.460
Then, let's save him this time.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.630
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.050
This is something we should leave to the pros!

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.760
This isn't the place for us to act, you idiots!

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.170
We know that!

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.840
But, I couldn't do anything!

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.600
After I heard that my friend was being targeted!

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
I couldn't do anything!

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.180
I didn't do anything!

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.180
If I don't do anything now,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.190
I won't be a hero or a man anymore!

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.190
Hey, Midoriya, your hand can still reach!

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.570
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.920
We can go save him!

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.070
"From Iida to Midoriya"

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.210
So, in short, you're planning on getting the
receiver from Yao-momo, following it,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.080
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.420
and going to save Bakugo yourselves?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.590
Yeah.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.170
Even though the villains said
we were targets to be killed,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.920
they took Bakugo without killing him.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.430
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.800
They probably let him live,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.490
but that doesn't mean
they won't kill him eventually.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.220
Kirishima and I are going.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.730
Don't go overboard with your messing around!

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.140
Wait. Calm down.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.150
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.150
I understand Kirishima's frustration
at not being able to do anything

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.320
and Todoroki's frustration at having
him stolen in front of his very eyes.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.440
I'm frustrated, too.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.910
But, this isn't a situation
where we should act on our emotions.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.400
Right?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.830
L-Let's leave this to All Might...

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.870
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.120
Mr. Aizawa's permission to fight at
the training camp has been rescinded, too.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.130
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
Aoyama's right.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.590
I can't say much since I was
the one who needed saving, though...

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.670
But--

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.470
Everyone, we're all shocked
from Bakugo's kidnapping.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.050
But let's think things through calmly.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.310
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.310
No matter how just your feelings,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.810
if you're saying you'll fight again...

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.230
...that you'll break the rules...

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.230
Those acts are the same as those of villains.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.360
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.610
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.860
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.360
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.710
Sorry to interrupt...

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.270
It's time for Midoriya's exam...

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.380
Wh-Why don't we go?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.800
I wanna see how Jiro
and Hagakure are doing, too.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.510
Oh yeah.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.220
Deku, feel better soon.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.660
Thanks, all of you.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.470
We talked to Yaoyorozu yesterday.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.560
If we go, we go right away. Tonight.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.900
Since you were seriously injured,
I don't know if you can move,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.190
but we still wanted to invite you

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.430
because you're probably
the most frustrated out of everyone.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.940
We'll be waiting in front
of the hospital tonight.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.660
"Orthopedic Surgery"

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.040
While you were out,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.830
Recovery Girl performed
some pretty strong healing on you,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.540
so I think you should be able to move them,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.960
but they were pretty messed up.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.840
You've had a lot of pretty bad injuries
recently in a relatively short amount of time,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.980
but frankly, this time doesn't
even come close to those.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.430
By "doesn't come close," you mean...

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.020
I got special permission to see
a copy of your chart up until now,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.600
and all the times before this,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.610
your bones broke like a
firecracker exploding from the inside.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.940
But this time was especially bad.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.620
Usually, a person's body has limiters to keep
it from using more than 80% of its power.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.040
But when someone faces a crisis situation,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.610
it's possible for those limiters to come off,
allowing them to use 100% of their power.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.130
It's called "hysterical strength,"
like when a mom lifts a car off her child.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.590
But we have those limiters because
our bodies can't take that strain.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.760
This time, it looks like your power erupted
while you were in the "hysterical strength" stage,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.220
and for a long time at that.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.480
It's bad enough for your bones
and muscles to get battered,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.310
but it's worse for your ligaments...

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.610
Ligaments protect the joints,
and they are deteriorating badly.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.230
In other words,

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.070
if you keep getting injured in the
same way two or three more times or so,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.280
I think you'll have to live without
being able to use your arms.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.210
All you can do is work on rehabilitation
to get them back to normal.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.780
Use them a lot, even if it hurts.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.660
We'll be leaving the rest to U.A., back home,
so you'll be discharged from here today.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.840
Th-Thank you very much.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.800
I'm sorry to have caused you trouble.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.100
Ms. Recovery was fed up with you.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.180
You must've gotten many
scoldings from her in the past.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.940
But there was someone
who was saved by you, too.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.940
"To Mr. Midoriya"
"Kota"

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.500
Well, healing begins in the mind,
so don't worry too much, and stay positive.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.450
"Dear Mr. Midoriya,

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.410
I'm sorry I punched you in the balls.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.420
Thank you for saving me
even though you barely knew me.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.340
Please get better soon
so I can thank you in person.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.850
Kota."

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.870
Kota...

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.520
Mom?

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.690
Yeah, I was discharged.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.270
But there's something I have to do,

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.440
so I won't be home until
tomorrow or the day after--

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.530
Yeah... Yeah...

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.740
I can move now, at least.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.360
My body feels kind of sluggish,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.160
but it looks like they performed
some strong healing on me.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.080
I heard that it's because
U.A. wants to keep students close,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.790
and also to keep the media away.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
Izuku...

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.750
...do you have to go to U.A.?

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.600
Endeavor, a phone call for you.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:20.890
Who is it?

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.600
A Mr. Tsukauchi from the police.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.210
It's me.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.550
We would like to request
your urgent assistance, Endeavor.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.190
"No. 2 Hero - Endeavor"

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.200
I have received an emergency summons
and must leave this place for a while.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.410
Even if I am not here,

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.780
I want you to keep being strong in both
mind and body like a pair of tight jeans

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.960
"No. 4 Hero - Best Jeanist"

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.660
and continue to keep
the streets safe while I'm gone.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.960
Sure, Best Jeanist!

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.380
"No. 5 Hero - Edgeshot"

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.760
"No. 10 Hero - Gang Orca"

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.100
"Gran Torino"

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.520
"Wild, Wild Pussycats - Tiger"

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.190
"Kamui Woods"

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.190
"Mt. Lady"

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.870
You want me to make a receiver?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.390
Yeah, please!

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.820
You already know why we want it, right?

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.310
Please let me think about it...

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.360
I wonder what Yaoyorozu decided.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.930
Well, no matter how
restless we are, it's up to her.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:39.900
She's here!

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.520
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.560
Midoriya...

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.570
Yaoyorozu... What's your answer?

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.700
I--

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.280
Wait!

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.370
Iida?

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.140
Iida...

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.410
Why... Why did it have
to be you guys of all people?!

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.980
The ones who stopped me when
I acted recklessly for personal reasons...

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.550
You two, who received amnesty with me...

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.990
Why are you trying to make
the same mistake I did?!

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.930
It's too much!

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.740
What are you talking about?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.170
We are still minors.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.770
U.A. is in a bad enough position as it is.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.690
Who will take responsibility for your actions?

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.730
Do you understand?!

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.230
Iida, it's not like that.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.490
We don't think it's okay
to break the rules either--

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.870
I'm frustrated, too!

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.990
And worried! It's only natural!

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.290
I am the class representative!

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.330
I'm worried about my classmates!

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.330
Not just Bakugo!

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.380
When I saw your injuries,
I also saw my brother in his sickbed!

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.380
What if your bodies end up irreparable,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.270
like my brother's,
because of your recklessness?

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.390
Are you saying that you
don't care about my worries?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.640
Are you saying that you
don't care about how I feel...?

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.000
Iida...

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.010
Iida.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.070
We don't expect to face
them head-on and win either.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.070
We'll extricate him without fighting.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.160
In other words, covert action!

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.660
That's the way we students can fight
while toeing the line on the rules!

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.210
I trust Todoroki.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:40.840
But so that I can stop them if anything happens,
I plan to accompany them, as well.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.470
Yaoyorozu!

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.570
Yaoyorozu!

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.460
I don't know myself, either,

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.440
but after hearing that I could
still reach, I couldn't just sit still...

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.320
I can't help thinking that I want to save him.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.450
Top heroes have stories
about them from their school days.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.660
Most of their stories have one thing in common:

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.510
Their bodies moved before
they had a chance to think.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.420
We can't come to an agreement, huh?

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.710
Then, take me with you, too!

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.180
Do you remember after the USJ attack,

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.720
when I said there was a
major incident coming later?

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.680
We have gathered some
of our finest heroes here today.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.810
"Police Officer - Naomasa Tsukauchi"

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.060
Now, let us begin our strategy meeting.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.650
I'll ask you one more time,
aspiring hero, Katsuki Bakugo...

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.650
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.160
Will you join me?

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.540
If you're gonna talk in your sleep,
you should just go to sleep and die.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.410
That major incident is about to begin.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
"Momo Yaoyorozu"
"Quirk: Creation"
"She can create any non-living thing from her body."

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 9/23"
"Height: 173 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Reading"

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.010
"Eijiro Kirishima"
"Quirk: Hardening"
"He can harden his whole body, which can be used for offense or defense."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.010
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 10/16"
"Height: 170 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Meat"

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.230
Midoriya.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.480
I apologize for getting violent with you.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.350
I'm sorry.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.190
Seriously, Iida.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.650
Your reason for joining
the group is not very persuasive.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.490
It's fine! I'm okay!

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.330
I am accompanying you because I am not
convinced you will behave yourselves.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.700
If I get even a whiff of combat,

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.710
then I will make you return immediately.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.830
In other words,
you will be under my surveillance.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.830
That's right, I will be a "watchman"!

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.460
Watchman Iida...

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.810
The same goes for me.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.460
Rescuing Bakugo is a job for the pros.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.720
Looking at this objectively,
there is no need for you all to do anything.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.470
However, it is a compromise plan
because I know very well how you feel.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.140
Do not forget that.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:54.810
Yeah.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.890
I know.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.310
A rescue without combat...

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.480
It is not realistic.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.570
The others have not realized that they
are not able to think about this objectively.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.320
But once they see the situation
first-hand and see how hard it'll be,

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.580
they should realize
how unrealistic their idea is...

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.290
The coordinates on the receiver indicate
Camino Ward, Yokohama City in Kanagawa Prefecture.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.370
Since we're leaving from Nagano,
it will take about two hours.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.550
We should arrive around ten o'clock.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.390
Um, did you tell everyone
that we would leave tonight?

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:31.930
Yeah.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.770
They tried even harder to stop us
when we told them, though.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.230
After that, Uraraka said
something pretty harsh, too.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:44.230
I think Bakugo will feel humiliated
that he had to be saved by everyone...

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.700
...she said.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.070
Kacchan!

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.370
Don't come, Deku!

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.620
Just to make sure,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.600
you know that what we're doing is selfish and
that no one wants us to do it, right?

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.000
You can still turn back if you want to.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.710
If I were hesitating, then I wouldn't've
said I'd do it in the first place!

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.420
He's not someone who'd let the
villains do whatever they want with him.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.300
What about you, Midoriya?

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.220
I...

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.350
Meddling when you don't need to...

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.560
...is the essence of being a hero.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.240
Mom...

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.270
I got everything from All Might...

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.730
Since All Might chose me...

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.320
...I cannot turn back.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.280
I see...

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.270
All right.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:47.920
"Camino Ward, Kanagawa Prefecture"

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.710
So this is Camino Ward?

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:44.960
There are a lot of people.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.880
So those guys are hiding
somewhere in this city?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.630
Okay, where are they, Yaoyorozu?!

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.470
Wait a minute!

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.350
From here on out,
we must be very, very careful.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.760
The villains know what we look like, remember?

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.270
We must also consider that
we may be attacked at any moment.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.300
Got it!

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.810
Gotta be covert!

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.860
That's making you stand out more, Midoriya.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.150
But at this rate,
we won't be able to scout very easily.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.650
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.940
"Dirt-Cheap Donki Oote"

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.570
I have a suggestion.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.570
"Dirt-Cheap Donki Oote"
"fidget fidget"

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.070
"Dirt-Cheap Donki Oote"

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.500
Hey, you!

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.500
"*Midoriya"

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.710
I see. Disguises, huh?

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.710
"*Todoroki."

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.510
That's right.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.510
"*Yaoyorozu"

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.260
What are these clothes?

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.260
"*Iida"

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.810
"Bonds"     "Friends"

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.070
I'll tell ya later.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.980
"Bonds"     "Friends"
"*Kirishima"

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.060
Hey, you!

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.690
That's all wrong!
You've gotta push your jaw out more!

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.270
Hey!

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.070
That's it!

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.360
There's a lady with a huge rack over there!

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.030
Okay!

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.370
Kids would stand out in the
shopping district at night, right?

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.160
"*Todoroki"

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.160
Yaoyorozu, wouldn't it have been free
if you used Creation to make all this?

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.670
Th-Th-That's against the rules!

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.340
If I make anything I want with my Quirk,
then circulation of money and...

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.090
That's right, as a citizen of this nation,

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:14.930
I must increase the flow
of money in the economy!

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:15.970
I see.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.930
This innocent rich girl just
wanted to go inside Donki, huh?

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.680
Everyone, our destination is this way--

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.020
Whoa, it's U.A.!

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.480
H-Hey!

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.690
And now, please watch a clip from U.A. High
School's apology press conference

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.980
"Broadcast"
"U.A. High School Emergency Press Conference"
"Nezu"     "Eraser Head"     "Vlad King"

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.980
that just occurred.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.780
Mr. Aizawa...

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.320
And even the principal!

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.010
We deeply apologize for the incident

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:42.410
that allowed harm to come to 27 first years of
the hero course because of our unpreparedness.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.100
We apologize for causing unease in society

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.280
due to our negligence in properly defending
ourselves as a place of learning.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.510
We are truly sorry.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.300
Mr. Aizawa, who hates being on TV, is...

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.390
I'm from Yomiuri TV.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.470
Since the beginning of the year,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.180
U.A. High School students have
had four encounters with villains.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.060
This time, there were even students injured.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.900
How did you explain to their families,

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.570
and what are some specific
countermeasures you are taking?

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.660
From the sports festival,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.030
they should know what U.A.'s basic position is.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.030
Is he still going to make them say it?

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.580
Treating them like the bad guys...?

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.080
We will increase policing
in the surrounding area

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.960
and review the security within the school,

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.710
ensuring the students' safety
with a strong position.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.340
That is what we told them.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.640
Huh? What are these guys saying?

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.300
They're not being protected at all.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.060
Hero schools aren't usually
defeated by villains...

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:46.850
How's that s'posed to ensure anything?

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.810
Aren't they just trying to protect themselves?

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.240
That's disappointing, U.A.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.630
Results are everything.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.150
The atmosphere was becoming stagnated,

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.940
being pulled in a bad direction.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.120
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.120
It's so strange...

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.330
Why are the heroes being criticized?

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.540
The way they were dealing
with things was just a little off the mark.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.040
"Villain - Dabi"

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.040
Is it because it's their job to protect?

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.300
"Villain - Twice"      "Villain - Magne"

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.300
Everyone makes a mistake or two.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.130
"Villain - Himiko Toga"

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.130
Are they supposed to be perfect?

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.470
"Villain - Spinner"     "Villain - Mr. Compress"

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.050
Modern-day heroes are so uptight.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.630
Don't you think, Bakugo?

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.060
Once heroes receive
compensation to protect people,

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.380
they aren't heroes anymore.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.810
That is Stain's teaching.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.820
The strange system of transforming
people's lives into money or glory...

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.200
The society that sticks tight to those rules...

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.580
The citizens who blame the losers
rather than encourage them...

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.830
Our fight is to question:

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.080
What is a hero? What is justice?

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.750
Is this society truly just?

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.770
We'll have everyone thinking about it.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.130
We're planning on winning.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.930
You like winning, too, right?

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.810
"Villain - Kurogiri - Quirk: Warp Gate"

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.810
Dabi, release his restraints.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.180
Huh? This guy's gonna fight, you know.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.270
It's fine. We need to treat him like an equal,

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.480
since we're scouting him.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:23.280
Besides, you can tell if you'll win or not if
you fight in this situation, right, U.A. student?

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.330
Twice, you do it.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.410
What, me? No way.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.450
Do it.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.750
Man...

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.880
I do apologize for using such forceful methods.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.090
But please understand that we are
not just a mob trying to commit crimes.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.300
We didn't kidnap you by accident.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.350
Even though our situations differ,
everyone here has been restricted and suffered

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:53.690
because of people... rules... and heroes...

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.190
I'm sure you also--

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.610
Shigaraki!

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.370
I listened quietly to your endless talking...

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.790
Idiots can't get to the point,
so they're always talking for a long time.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.460
Basically, you mean "We wanna
harass people, so please join us," right?

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.420
Don't bother.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.880
Look! Did you see that just now?

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.260
All Might really is cool, isn't he?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.390
No matter how much trouble he's in,
he always wins in the end!

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.010
I want to win like All Might.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.900
No matter what anyone says,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.480
that will never change!

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:48.510
Father...

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.080
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.380
As we headed toward the
hideout of the League of Villains,

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.960
we discovered that it was a Nomu factory!

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.760
But Kacchan isn't there--

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.720
Next time, "All For One"!

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:36.610
"Next time: All For One"

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.040
Go beyond!

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.610
Plus Ultra!
