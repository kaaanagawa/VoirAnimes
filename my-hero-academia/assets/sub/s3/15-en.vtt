WEBVTT

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.270
The prestigious school that turned out
many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.250
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.150
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.530
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.000
I see! Leg techniques, huh?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.130
If your arms are unstable,
then switch to your legs!

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.800
I like that kind of thinking!

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.640
In that case, I'll whip up some
super cute leg-part babies for you!

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.350
Oh, but I don't want to change my current
costume design much right now...

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.480
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.400
A good designer can meet all the reckless,
ignorant, and ill-advised demands of the client!

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.020
Mr. Power Loader!

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.150
If my idea is good, then
you will use it, right?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.320
Only if it's good.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.740
Everything's settled?

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.370
But if you are going to use
your legs as a selling point,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.210
then you'll need to adapt
to being a speed-type hero!

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.000
That's true...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.550
With his stature and weight, Iida is just like
an armored car equipped with an F1 engine.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.380
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.590
If you're going to fight
in the same ring as him...

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.760
Wait a minute!

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.550
I have a power-up move called Full Cowling

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.850
that lets me increase
the strength of my whole body...

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.560
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.930
Oh, in that case, we can
finish this off quick!

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.560
"Four Days Later"

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.060
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.060
A new move...

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.840
AP Shot!

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.190
"AP Shot (Armor Piercing Shot)"

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.060
I did it!

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.780
Hey, look out!

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.450
Idio--

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.290
I got the idea for Full Cowling
from Gran Torino and Kacchan!

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.670
The essence of that is quick,
small movements and precise maneuvering!

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.880
In order to keep that alive,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.300
I need the least amount of equipment
with the maximum possible effect!

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.180
Arm supporting braces

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.310
and iron soles that can
act as cleats or armor!

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.650
Smash...!

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.700
This is my new costume
that I made with Hatsume,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.590
Costume Gamma!

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.120
"The Test"

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.910
Are you all right, All Might?!

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.080
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.080
Yeah!

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.540
Oh?

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.580
What was that, Midoriya?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.630
You just waltzed in there and showed
some amazing destructive power!

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.550
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.550
I thought you were a puncher.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.840
Kaminari, Kirishima.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.430
The destructive power was thanks
to the soles Hatsume suggested for me.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.350
I learned how to use my body
from Iida and changed my fighting style.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.350
I've only figured out
what direction I want to go in,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.730
but it's still just a stopgap,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.650
and I don't have anything
I can call an ultimate move yet...

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.510
No,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.230
I think it's already more
effective than just a stopgap.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.570
Especially for the
provisional licensing exam.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.990
All Might, it's dangerous,
so don't get too close.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.340
Oh, excuse me!

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.540
Young Bakugo! I'm sorry!

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.960
Watch yourself, All Might!

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.040
"Watch yourself," huh?

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.070
I get it, but...

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.270
I guess to everyone else,
I'm someone to be protected now, huh?

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.930
You guys made improvements
to your costumes, too?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.440
You noticed? Did you?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.900
You're not the only one with a new style!

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.280
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.240
The others are making
changes here and there, too.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.700
This is no time to lose focus!

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.370
But my change in style is huge!

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.120
You're in for a surprise!

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.790
You wanna see? You can!
It's seriously amazing!

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.360
That's enough, Class A!

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.420
"Itsuka Kendo - Quirk: Big Fist"
"Pro Hero - Vlad King - Quirk: Blood Control"
"Neito Monoma - Quirk: Copy"

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.420
Today, Class B is scheduled
to use this place in the afternoon.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.460
Class B?

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.500
Man, what terrible timing!

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.220
Eraser, hurry up and get out of the way.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.180
We still have almost ten minutes.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.890
You're not good at using time wisely, Vlad.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.720
Hey, did you know?

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.390
The provisional licensing exam
has a 50% fail rate.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.640
All of you should just fail!

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.440
He comes right at us with how he feels, huh?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:49.070
"ha ha ha"

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.440
--Wait, is that Monoma's costume?
--Why don't we see exactly who's better?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.700
--"Since my Quirk's Copy, there's no need
for anything especially eccentric," he said.
--Why don't we see exactly who's better?

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.070
That's him not being eccentric?

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.990
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.950
Still, his opinion is reasonable.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.000
As long as we are taking the same exam,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.830
it is our fate to crush each other.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.920
That's why Class A and
Class B applied to different locations.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.050
The hero licensing exam takes
place each June and September

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.310
in three different locations across
the country at the same time.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.550
In order to avoid students from
the same school fighting each other,

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.140
all schools subscribe to the theory of
splitting up their students by time or location.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.190
Whew.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.600
"Whew"

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.150
It is unfortunate that we will not be
able to fight each other directly!

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:26.740
"ahahaha ahahaha ahahaha"

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.860
He said "Whew," didn't he?

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.740
I wonder if there's a diagnosis
for the type of mental state he has...

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.240
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.110
"All schools," huh...?

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.280
That's right, I didn't really
think about it that much,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.280
but we'll be fighting
against other schools to pass.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.620
And in our case, we're accelerating
the process of getting them...

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.080
In addition,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.770
there are very few first years in the country
trying to get their provisional licenses.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.170
In other words...

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.760
...the test will have those
who've trained longer than you,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.850
with Quirks you don't know about
that they've polished up until now.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.260
The actual contents of the exam are unclear,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.770
but what is clear is that
you all will have a hard time.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.270
It's not good to get too hung up about it,

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.560
but keep that in mind.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.700
Yes, sir!

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.780
We're working so hard every day...

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.570
It's not called "intensive
training" for nothing, huh?

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.410
"Momo Yaoyorozu" "Toru Hagakure" "Tsuyu Asui"
"Kyoka Jiro" "Mina Ashido"

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.200
Even so, there's less than a week left
before the provisional licensing exam.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.370
Yao-momo, how's your ultimate move coming?

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.750
There's something I want to do,
but my body can't keep up yet,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.920
so I need to develop
my Quirk a little more first.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.050
What about you, Tsu?

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.720
I've perfected a move even
more frog-like than before.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.720
I'm sure even you'll be surprised, Toru.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.320
What about you, Ochaco?

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:35.640
Ochaco?

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.350
Huh?

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.640
You seem tired.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.440
Oh, no, I'm not tired at all.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.810
I'm just getting started!

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.080
At least, that's how it's supposed
to be, but, how do I put it...?

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.070
Recently, my heart's
been feeling all stirred up...

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.970
It's love!

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.990
Wh... What? Glove? Shove? Dove?

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.740
"Glove!? Shove!? Dove!?"

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.870
--I don't know what you're talking about!
--Is it Midoriya, or Iida?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.330
You're always with them, aren't you?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.410
No, no, that's not it!

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.330
No, it's not, it's not...

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.420
She floated...

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.210
Who is it? Which one? Who is it?

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.420
Spit it out.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.800
You'll get a lighter sentence if you confess.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.590
That's not it, really!

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.300
I really don't know anything
about that stuff...

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.060
It's not good to force
an investigation, you know.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.020
That's right.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.310
More importantly, we have an early
start tomorrow, so we should turn in.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.060
What? No way! I want to hear more!

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.820
Even if we don't talk about anything important,
I want to force it to be about romance!

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.420
That's...

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.380
That's not it... Iida was more like...

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.550
He used his back, yeah,
his back and his flexibility...

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.800
I can visualize the shape in my head now.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.440
In order to bring it up
to the "ultimate move" level...

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.040
That's not...

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.310
"Provisional Licensing Exam Location"
"National Dagoba Arena"

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.780
Our days of training passed by,
and then the day of the exam was upon us!

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.030
Ah, I'm getting nervous!

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.060
I wonder what we'll have to do...

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.780
I wonder if I can get my
provisional license...

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.990
Mineta, it's not about whether
or not you can. Go and get it!

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.780
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.450
Right, c-course-of!

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.620
If you can pass this test
and get your provisional licenses,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.380
then you novice eggs will become chicks...

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.000
You'll hatch into semi-pros.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.210
Do your best.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.300
All right, I'll become a chick!

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.590
Let's all call out the usual! Ready, set--

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.470
Plus...

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.860
...Ultra!

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.020
You shouldn't just barge in
on other people's huddles, Inasa.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.560
Oh, no!

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.020
I am...

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.810
...very... extremely...

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.610
...sorry!

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.950
What's with this guy trying
to get by with just his enthusiasm?!

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.990
He is...

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.820
Wait, that uniform...!

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.410
It's from that famous
school in western Japan...

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.580
U.A. in the east, Shiketsu in the west...

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:12.750
Of the many hero courses,
it's an elite school that rivals U.A....

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.840
...Shiketsu High School!

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.220
I wanted to try saying
it just once! Plus Ultra!

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.760
I love U.A. High School!

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.680
I am extremely honored to be able
to compete against U.A. students!

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.390
I'm looking forward to it!

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.180
Oh, blood.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.140
Let's go.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.600
Inasa Yoarashi...

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.270
Mr. Aizawa, you know him?

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.980
He's... strong.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.030
--Blood? I'm fine! I like blood!
--Last year, the same year as you guys,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.410
Yoarashi got the top scores of those
admitted through recommendations,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.500
but for some reason,
he turned down his acceptance.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.960
What?! Then, he's a first year?!

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.750
And if he was the top of those
with recommendations...

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.960
Then, his abilities are above Todoroki's?!

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.290
Inasa Yoarashi... from
Shiketsu High School...

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.970
"Ochaco Uraraka"
"Quirk: Zero Gravity"
"She can make people and things weightless with the pads on the tips of her fingers."

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.970
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 12/27"
"Height: 156 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Japanese Food"

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.980
"Eraser Head"
"Quirk: Erasure"
"He can erase the Quirks of whoever is in his field of vision."

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class Teacher"
"Birthday: 11/8"
"Height: 183 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Cats"

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.650
And now, everyone from
U.A., please excuse me!

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.650
His name's Inasa Yoarashi?

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.150
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.740
Even though he says he loves U.A.,
he threw away his chance to enroll. I don't get it.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.660
Right? What a weirdo.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.630
He's weird, but he's the real thing.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.080
Keep an eye out for him.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.210
Eraser? It's you, isn't it, Eraser?!

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.670
I've seen you on TV and
at the sports festival,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.420
but it's been a while since
I've seen you in person!

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.340
She's...

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.260
Let's get married.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:40.880
No.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.090
"ba-dump"

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:48.430
--No? Good one!
--You're hard to talk to, as usual, Joke.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.140
...Smile Hero: Ms. Joke!

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.350
"Outburst"

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.350
Her Quirk's Outburst!

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.190
She forces those near her to laugh,
dulling their thinking and their movements!

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.990
Her fights against villains
are full of craziness!

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.700
If you marry me, then we can make
a happy family with never-ending laughter!

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.750
A family like that can't be happy.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.160
You two seem close.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.620
Our agencies used to be close to each other!

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.960
In our cycle of helping and being helped,
our mutual love for each other bloomed--

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.840
No, it didn't.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.170
Oh, I love your quick retorts!

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.420
You're so worth teasing, Eraser!

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.430
Joke, since you're here, that means...

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.180
That's right. Come here, everyone!

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.270
It's U.A.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.390
Oh, it's the real thing!

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.520
Wow, that's amazing! I've
seen them all on TV!

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.440
Ketsubutsu Academy, second years, Class 2!

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.820
They're my class. Please be kind.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.240
I'm Shindo! U.A. this year's had trouble
after trouble, so it must've been tough!

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.030
Huh? Ye...

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.080
But even so, you all are still
aiming to be heroes like this, huh?

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.410
That's wonderful!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.540
A heart of fortitude

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.210
is what I believe all heroes
should have from now on!

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.630
He's too bright!

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.130
He's totally a charming pretty-boy type!

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.390
From among you, there's Bakugo,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.090
who experienced being the
center of the Camino incident.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.100
You have an especially strong heart.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.310
Today, I'll do my best
while learning from you!

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.520
Stop pretending. What you're saying
doesn't match the look on your face!

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.030
Hey! Stop being so rude!

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.530
Sorry for his rudeness...

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.490
It's fine! It just proves
how strong his heart is.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.280
Hey, Todoroki! Can I have your autograph?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.660
You were so cool at the sports festival!

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.490
Huh?

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.370
Stop being such a fangirl.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.370
You can have my autograph, too.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.920
Hey, change into your costumes
and go to the orientation.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.420
Don't waste time.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.340
Yes, sir!

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.050
It's like... contact with people
outside of school reminds me...

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.390
U.A. students are actually
pretty famous, huh?

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.010
Oh, dear!

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.540
Could it be...? You didn't tell them, Eraser?

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.270
"Provisional Hero Licensing Exam Location"

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.860
There are so many...

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.230
There're so many...

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.820
Um...

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.670
Well then, let's do that
provisional license thing...

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:16.830
I'm Mera from the Heroes
Public Safety Commission.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.210
The kind of sleep I like is non-REM sleep...

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.240
Nice to meet you.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.790
I've been so busy that
I haven't gotten much sleep...

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.840
We're too short-staffed...

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.780
I'm so sleepy!

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.220
With that conviction,
I will give you the orientation.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.140
He's not hiding his
exhaustion at all. Is he okay?

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.020
About the content of
the provisional license thing...

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:48.320
Frankly, all 1,540 examinees here will
have to win through a free-for-all exercise!

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.990
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.530
Seriously?

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.990
That's not a lot to go on.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.830
Our society is currently said
to be saturated with heroes,

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.870
and ever since Stain was arrested,

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.710
many have shown doubts
about the current state of heroes.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.150
"Heroes should not seek compensation."

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.260
"It must be a title given to those
who have sacrificed all of themselves."

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.950
The hero killer's convictions...

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.560
Well, as a private citizen,
no matter what the motivation,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:24.020
to tell someone risking their lives
to save others not to seek any reward is...

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.150
It's the ruthless story
of these modern times...

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:34.030
But anyway, whether its for compensation
or for loyalty and courage...

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.620
...the result of many heroes working hard
together to help people and defeat villains

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.130
is that right now, the time from when
an incident begins to when it is resolved

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.840
is so short that it'd make you sick.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.340
You all are about to receive
your provisional licenses

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.960
and finally throw yourselves
into those rapids.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.930
Those who can't keep up with
that speed will frankly have it tough.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.640
Accordingly, what you'll
be tested on is speed!

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.150
"Number to Pass 1st Test
100 People"

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.150
The first hundred to fulfill
the requirements will pass.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.150
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.330
There are a total of
1,540 people taking the exam!

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.280
Didn't they say half would pass...?

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.700
This means, less than
10% will actually pass...

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.830
I'm getting even more nervous!

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.040
Well, a lot's happened
out there in the world,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.130
and you know, about luck and everything...

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.800
So anyway, here are the requirements.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.550
The examinee will put three
of these targets on his or her body.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.390
They can go anywhere
as long as it's an exposed area.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.220
You can't put them on the soles
of your feet or in your armpits.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.790
You will also have six of these balls.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.860
The targets are made to only
light up if they're hit by these balls,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.270
"1st Test Rules"

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.940
and if all three of your
targets light up, then you're out.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.940
"1st Test Rules"
"Fail"

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.030
The person who lights up your
third target will have it count as their defeat.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.520
You get through this round
by defeating two people.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.290
That's it for the rules.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.870
It's similar to the entrance exam...

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.330
No, but going up against people is completely
different from going up against robots!

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.710
You have exactly enough
balls for you to pass.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:15.120
Are they recommending that we swoop in
and steal the third target from someone else?

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.120
The rules are even harsher
than in the entrance exam.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.720
Okay then...

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.810
After we open,
we'll pass out the targets and balls,

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.350
and then we'll start one minute
after we've gotten to everyone.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:28.410
"Open"?

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.710
I believe you all have terrain
that you like and dislike.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.230
Use your Quirks well and do your best.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.050
It's unnecessarily big!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:59.720
Anyway, we arranged for
the terrain to be announced like that...

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.950
But yeah, it's unnecessary.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.060
It's because of this that my sleep was...

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:10.210
I hope the developments are speedy
so that I can rest as soon as possible...

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.650
Eraser, your fly's down...

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.240
Why is everyone around me so noisy?

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.200
I can't believe you still
had twenty students, though.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.740
It's unusual for you
to not have expelled anyone.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.190
You like your class this time?

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.520
Not really.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.290
Don't be embarrassed! That's so lame!

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.680
--Go out with me!
--Shut up.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.340
But then, it's strange...

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.590
There's no way you don't know about that.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.520
If the first people to finish win, then no one
will go after people from their own school.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.290
The way to win would be to team up
with people whose power they already know.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.020
Everyone, don't get too separated!
Let's move as a group!

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.690
Okay!

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.480
Yeah.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.490
Yeah right, this isn't a field trip!

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.110
Idiot, wait up!

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.240
Kacchan!

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.120
Kirishima!

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.670
I'm going to go on my own, too.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.330
It's hard for me to use
my power in a big group.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.580
Todoroki!

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.790
Midoriya, there's no time! Let's go!

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.080
Right!

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.840
Every year, the test is different,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.300
but there is one thing that's almost like a
tradition for this provisional licensing exam.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.300
I don't think it's a good idea
to go off on our own, though...

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:22.970
Why not?

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.430
Because, you know! Everyone already
knows what powers we have.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.270
They already know?

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.730
I see, the sports festival!

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.730
As all the high schools around the country
compete to pass the provisional licensing exam,

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.650
the only high school that has lost the
advantage of no one knowing their Quirks...

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.120
the top school whose sports festival
is broadcast across the country

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.960
showing not just the students' Quirks,
but also their weaknesses and fighting styles...

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.240
Your school.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.420
The other schools should also have figured out
what I said earlier about the way to win.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.030
I think it'll end up being
a battle between schools.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.340
Which means, they'll start thinking
about which school to go after first.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.390
Does that mean...

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:05.390
Don't tell me...

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.780
First test, start!

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.270
If you like your class this year,
then you should've told your students.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.440
What always happens at the beginning...

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.570
The crushing of U.A.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.280
I knew it!

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:29.240
I saw it on TV! The super power
that also destroys yourself!

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.500
Well, if a nail sticks out,
then you've gotta hammer it down!

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.590
I think it's already more
effective than just a stopgap.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.760
Especially for the
provisional licensing exam.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.550
One For All...

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.340
...Full Cowling...

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.300
...Shoot Style!

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.350
"The crushing of U.A."

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.390
There wasn't really a
reason why I didn't tell them,

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.850
but in the end, it wouldn't
change what they had to do.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.520
They just have to overcome everything.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.730
Dark Shadow!

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.680
Got it!

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.250
All right!

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.710
Take that!

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.780
Oh?

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.230
A hero is someone who can
turn around a bad situation.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.130
In the first place, if they become pros,
then everyone will already know their Quirks,

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.770
so I'm sorry, but we look a
little further ahead than everyone else.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.060
This can work.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.440
My Shoot Style, and everyone's power...

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.280
...are showing the results
of our intensive training!

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.950
Everyone, let's keep going like this!

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.300
Yeah!

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.670
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.800
The first test of the provisional
licensing exam has finally begun.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.920
I end up getting separated from the
rest of the class, and in front of me,

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.050
a girl from Shiketsu High School appears...

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.070
Next time, "Shiketsu High Lurking"!

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:36.610
"Next time: Shiketsu High Lurking"

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.300
Go beyond!

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.760
Plus Ultra!
