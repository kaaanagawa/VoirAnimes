00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.190
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.820
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.150
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.530
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.300
You spoke about the
students' safety, Eraser Head.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.430
During the incident,
it appears you urged them to fight.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.720
What was your intention behind this?

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.850
"Pro Hero - Eraser Head - Quirk: Erasure"
"Pro Hero - Vlad King - Quirk: Blood Control"

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.930
I concluded that because we were
unable to fully grasp the situation,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.100
it had to be done in order
to avoid the worst possible outcome.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.190
What do you mean by "worst possible outcome"?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.280
You don't call 26 victims and
one abducted the worst possible outcome?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.240
The "worst outcome" I assumed in that situation

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.620
was that the students would be
at their wits' end and be killed.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.200
"Pro Hero - Nezu - Quirk: High Specs"

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:35.420
"U.A. High School Principal: Nezu"

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.370
The gas attack accounts for most of the victims.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.460
We have determined that it was a
sleeping gas from one of the enemies' Quirks.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.580
Thanks to the quick response
of Ms. Kendo and Mr. Tetsutetsu,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.090
there were no serious injuries from that attack.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.260
In addition, we are providing
mental care to the students,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.470
but at the moment, we do not see
any signs of serious psychological trauma.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.640
Are you saying that it was
a bright spot in this tragedy?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.430
We believe that the worst outcome is one
that would have infringed on the future.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.150
Can you say the same thing
for the kidnapped Bakugo?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.780
He enrolled at U.A. High with
excellent marks and won the sports festival.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.900
In addition, during the incident
with the sludge villain in middle school,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.610
he resisted the powerful villain alone,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.660
so he has a history of showing
how tough and heroic he can be.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.700
On the other hand,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.210
the violence he showed in the finals
and his attitude at the award ceremony

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.210
show that he is not always very stable mentally.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.040
"angry angry angry angry"

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.750
What if the villains kidnapped him
because they had an eye on that?

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.510
Kidnapping him with deceitful words,
and dyeing him with the path of evil?

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.930
What evidence do you have
for saying that he has a future?

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.560
I know it's his job,
but he's being so aggressive!

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.310
He's trying to stress us out and
catch us saying something inappropriate.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.390
Don't fall for it...

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.440
He's probably doing this knowing
that you hate the media, Eraser!

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.940
No, don't let him trick you!

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:48.080
"Nezu" "Eraser Head" "Vlad King"

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.620
As an educator, I take full responsibility
for Katsuki Bakugo's violent behavior.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.880
However, his actions at the sports festival
originate in what he considers "ideal strength."

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.920
He is trying harder than anyone
in his pursuit of becoming the "top hero."

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.840
If the villains saw that and
thought they had an opening,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.260
then I believe they are being short-sighted.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.310
That is not evidence, though.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.140
This isn't a question of how you feel--

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.850
I'm asking whether or not
you have a concrete plan in place.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.110
We are not just standing around idly.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.820
We are currently investigating
along with the police.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.860
"Broadcast: U.A. High School
Emergency Press Conference"

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.070
We will definitely get our student back.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.490
You said it, U.A. and Mr. Aizawa!

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.870
That's how it is, you damn scum of a league!

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.750
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.620
They went through all that trouble to mount
a huge attack, and all they got was me.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.380
They even told me what they wanted.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.630
To them, I'm an important
person that they can use.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.920
Since they're trying to turn me to their side,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.260
they won't try to kill me seriously.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Before they change their minds,
I'll take down two or three of them and escape!

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.020
Just so you know, I'm still allowed to fight!

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.770
"Villain - Magne"

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.310
You know exactly what your position is, huh?

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.560
What a smart boy!

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.230
"Villain - Mr. Compress"        "Villain - Dabi"

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.940
No, he's an idiot.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.940
"Villain - Twice"     "Villain - Himiko Toga"

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.150
I'll stick you.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.860
"Villain - Spinner"

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.450
Even if he wasn't going to join us, he should
have pretended we were winning him over...

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.700
He's done it now.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.870
I won't do something I don't
want to even if I'm only faking it.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.410
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.620
And I don't wanna be in an
annoying place like this for very long.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.210
Father...

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.800
Don't, Tomura Shigaraki! Calm down!

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.300
Don't touch him, any of you.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.520
This guy...

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.900
...is a valuable piece.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.060
"Villain - Kurogiri - Quirk: Warp Gate"

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.570
I wish you would've listened to me a little...

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.160
I thought we could come to an understanding...

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.910
Heroes and villains are
two sides of the same coin.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.910
Come to an understanding?

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.410
No way.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.500
Then I have no choice.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.090
The heroes said they're
continuing their investigation of us...

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.710
We don't have time to talk leisurely.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.380
Master--

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.720
Lend me your power.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.850
That was a good decision, Tomura Shigaraki.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.940
"All For One"

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.940
"Camino Ward, Kanagawa Prefecture"

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.780
"*Yaoyorozu"

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.700
This is the spot the receiver is showing.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.570
"*Yaoyorozu"                                   "*Kirishima"

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.450
So that's their hideout...

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.910
It really looks like one!

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.910
I don't know if it's their hideout or not,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.620
but from what I can see on the receiver,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.960
the villain has not left here for the past day.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:51.010
"*Midoriya"      "*Iida"      "*Todoroki"

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.750
Also, just because that villain
is here does not mean Bakugo is.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.340
We are here with very little to go on.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.300
Please think about that objectively.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.350
We don't have anyone who excels at
sneaking around, like Jiro or Hagakure, with us.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.640
If I think it's even the least bit dangerous,
I will stop you immediately.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.360
Because I am your friend,
I will not hesitate to call the police, either.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.190
Thanks, Iida.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.950
What can we do with what we have...?

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.490
I've gotta think.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:20.870
"mutter mutter mutter"

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.370
The prerequisite is that we not use
our Quirks or fight with the villains.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.950
--It's been a while since I saw that muttering.
--On top of that, we need to figure out
if Kacchan is in that building or not.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.910
--It really feels like Midoriya.
--Like Iida said, we don't have anyone with
a good scouting Quirk like Jiro or Shoji, so...

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.920
That's right. Once you decide
to do something, you're unstoppable.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.590
You can't stop.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.340
It's what I respect about
you as a friend... a rival.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.470
But I can't allow any more than this.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.470
This time, I will protect you.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.440
Why do I have to clean up after U.A....?

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.480
"Pro Hero - Endeavor - Quirk: Hellflame"

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.940
I'm a busy man.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.020
Come on, don't be like that.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.650
"Pro Hero - Best Jeanist - Quirk: Fiber Master"

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.110
You went to U.A., too, didn't you?

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.700
"Police Officer - Naomasa Tsukauchi"

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.900
Right now, we cannot call
any heroes away from U.A.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.200
Please look at the big picture, Endeavor.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.870
It's possible that this incident will become
the impetus for the destruction of hero society.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.870
We must give it our all to make
sure we resolve this successfully.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.880
In the past, I invited Bakugo to
my agency in order to reform his behavior.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.380
There are very few men as stubborn as he is.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.300
He is probably fighting back right now.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.180
The situation requires that we act fast.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.970
Not even you were able to change him?

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.100
"Pro Hero - Gang Orca"

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.180
He was inflexible with
pride down to the roots of his hair.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.850
"Pro Hero - Tiger - Quirk: Pliabody"

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.020
My comrade, Ragdoll, was also taken.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.060
I cannot overlook this
at a personal level, either.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.690
Based on the tracking device
set by one of the students,

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.860
we believe that there are multiple hideouts.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.950
From our investigations, we know
where the kidnapped victim is located.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.780
We'll send the bulk of our forces there

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.370
and prioritize getting the victim back.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.580
At the same time, we will gain control of
the other location we believe is their hideout,

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.870
cutting off all paths of retreat
to arrest all of them at once.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.000
Toshinori,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.420
if they're recruiting the likes of me, then--

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.880
There's nothing to "the likes
of you" about you, Gran Torino.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.510
With such big developments,
that guy will definitely move.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.930

Don't let the villains get away with anything!

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.560
At the press conference earlier,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.770
we had just the principal work
with us to deceive the villains.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.690
I had him feign distress,
as if going through a very rough time.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.860
After hearing those words,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.620
the villains won't think that we
will rush in on the very same day!

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.200
Let us retaliate!

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.910
Come, it's time for our counterattack!

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.830

"A Few Minutes Earlier"

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.310
There's no reaction even
though we've gotten this close.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.180
The lights aren't on, either.
It doesn't look like anyone's in there.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.520
To hide a tree, use the forest...

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.770
I guess they're hiding as
an abandoned warehouse.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.860
The weeds under the front door are pretty thick.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.650
Is there another way in and out?

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.780
Has it been camouflaged using someone's Quirk?

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.620
We can't do anything reckless,
like enter carelessly.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.740
--We have to see what's inside somehow--
--Hey, what're ya doin', hostess?

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.000
Come drink wit' us!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.040
Stop that, idiot!

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.170
--Th-There's a lady with a huge rack!
--Hey, you! Hey, you!

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.960
Let's get away from here for now.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.380
There aren't many people
walking by, but there are some.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.720
We can't do anything to stand out.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.840
What should we do?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.550
Let's try going around to the back.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.680
No matter how little information
we have on this place, it's all we've got.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.150
This is very narrow...

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.480
I feel like I will get stuck...

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.280
We can't move until we know for sure it's safe.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.610
No one will see us here,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.030
and at that height,
we should be able to see inside, too!

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.950
Will we be able to see
anything in this darkness?

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.120
I can make a night vision scope--

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.160
Wait, Yaoyorozu!

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.920
Actually, I brought one with me...

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.130
Wow, why?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.710
When I thought about what we'd have to do,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.130
I thought we'd need it.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.800
But isn't that super expensive?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.140
I did research on them online
when I was thinking about my costume,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.560
but if I remember correctly,
they cost around fifty thousand yen...

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.810
Who cares how much they cost?
Stop talking about it!

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.230
Okay, then Midoriya and Kirishima,
you two look through it.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.230
Iida and I will carry you on our shoulders.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.320
It's really cramped...

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.610
Don't lean forward too much.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.740
I want to make sure we can run
the second we think it's dangerous.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.150
Iida, can you move back a little?

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.030
Oof.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.660
Tell us what you see.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.490
Kirishima, what's inside?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.910
It's just dirty...
I don't really see anything...

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.000
--Kirishima?!
--Hey!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.500
What's wrong? What can you see, Kirishima?!

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.760
In the back on the left...!
Midoriya, look in the back on the left!

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.310
No way...

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.310
Are those... all...

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.350
...Nomu?!

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.110
Master, lend me your power.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.690
Master...?

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.980
You're not the boss around here?

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.240
That's not funny!

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.120
Kurogiri, Compress,
make him go to sleep again.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.830
I can't believe he's such a bad listener.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.750
I'm almost impressed.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.830
If you want me to listen to you,
then get on your knees and die!

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.460
I want to blow them up with my max firepower,

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.130
but that warp bastard's in the way.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.630
Think...

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.090
I need to make an opening somehow
and get to the back door...

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.140
Hello, this is Pizza-La, Camino store.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.100
Smash!

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.400
What the--?!

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.530
Kurogiri! Gate!

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.860
Pre-emptive Binding...

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.740
...Lacquered Chain Prison!

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.120
A tree? What the heck?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.790
Don't be impatient.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.790
It'd be in your best interests to stay put.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.750
"Pro Hero - Kamui Woods - Quirk: Arbor"

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.750
Just what I'd expect from one of the most
competent new heroes around, Kamui Woods!

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.590
And the veteran faster than
the eye can see, Gran Torino!

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.610
You can't run anymore, League of Villains!

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.470
Why?

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.680
Because we are here!

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.270
Right after that press conference...

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.600
Don't tell me this was pre-arranged?

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.310
--Tree man! Stop pulling me! Push!
--No! No...!

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.650
When one is on the offensive is
when one neglects defense most.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.240
"Pro Hero - Edgeshot - Quirk: Foldabody"

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.700
We're not the only ones here
from the Pizza-La Camino store.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.830
Outside, you're surrounded by skillful
heroes, like Endeavor, and the police.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:36.120
Tsukauchi! Why does that American get to
rush in while I'm out here holding the perimeter?

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.630
In case we miss catching them in there,
you've got a wider field of vision.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.590
Fine!

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.840
I'm sure you were scared...

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.960
You did good bearing it.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.760
I'm sorry.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.630
It's fine now, young man!

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.510
I-I wasn't scared!

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.890
Not even close, damn it!

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.180
After I went through all
that trouble to prepare this...

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.560
Why are you coming to me, you last boss?

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.860
Everyone's been restrained.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.190
We can't escape from this easily.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.190
Damn it.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.450
It can't be helped.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.570
"We're not the only ones here."

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.120
The same goes for us.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.870
Kurogiri, bring as many as you can over!

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.870
Nomus, I presume?

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.420
Hey!

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.880
That's...!

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.090
"Pro Hero - Mt. Lady - Quirk: Gigantification"

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.430
What's the matter, Kurogiri?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.390
I'm sorry, Tomura Shigaraki.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.020
The Nomus that were supposed to be
in a fixed location... are not there...!

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.980
Huh?

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.610
You are still green, Shigaraki!

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.450
Huh?

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.490
League of Villains,
you underestimated everything too much--

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.790
The soul of a young man--

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.500
The diligent investigations of the police--

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.250
And--

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.630
Our anger!

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.590
The Nomu hangar...

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.750
...is completely under our control.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.130
That's enough with the childish pranks.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.880
This is the end.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.260
Tomura Shigaraki!

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.810
All Might...

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.930
This is the hero acknowledged by Stain...!

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.050
The end, you say?

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.310
Don't be ridiculous.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.980
I've only just begun.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.150
Justice... peace...

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.990
I'll destroy this garbage heap that
you put a lid on with such vague ideas!

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.120
It was for that purpose
that I set All Might apart

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.140
and started gathering people to my cause...

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.190
Don't be ridiculous.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.460
This is the beginning...

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.210
Kurogiri!

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.800
No, stop!

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.880
I couldn't see anything!

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.470
What, did you kill him?

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.590
I played around with his insides
and made him unconscious.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.590
He is not dead.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.350
Ninpo: Thousand Sheet Pierce!

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.600
This man was always a nuisance.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.230
I'll have him sleep.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.020
Didn't I tell you earlier that it'd be
in your best interests to stay put?

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.020
Kenji Hikiishi,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.820
Atsuhiro Sako,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.690
Shuichi Iguchi,

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.400
Himiko Toga,

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.570
Jin Bubaigawara.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.410
With little information and time,

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.000
the police officers worked through
the night to determine your true identities.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.290
Do you understand?

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.750
There's nowhere left for you to run.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:32.500
Hey Shigaraki, can I ask you where your boss is?

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
No one came to save you, huh?

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.720
It must've been hard, huh, Tenko Shimura?

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.310
"Heroes..."

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.570
"Eventually, the heroes will..."

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.530
Everyone thought that and
pretended not to see you, huh?

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.180
Just who made this world into what it is?

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.220
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.790
It's fine. I'm here for you.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.360
This...

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.170
This is...

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.430
...unsatisfying...

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.590
Don't be ridiculous...

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.640
Don't be ridiculous...

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.770
Where is he right now?

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.680
Go away...

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.890
Disappear...

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.900
Shigaraki!

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.110
I hate you!

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.490
Nomus?!

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.400
They came from nowhere!

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.070
What is that?!

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.490
Edgeshot, what about Kurogiri?!

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.530
He's still unconscious!

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.240
He didn't do it!

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.700
They just keep coming!

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.370
Kamui Woods! Do not let them
go under any circumstance!

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.460
Yes, sir!

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.710
What the--?!

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.870
Young Bakugo!

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.260
Noooo!

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.220
Endeavor, we need backup!

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.990
What?!

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.890
Tsukauchi, expand the evacuation area!

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.560
There should be two hideouts...
That's what our investigation results said...

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.900
Jeanist, didn't you take control over there?

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.320
Jeanist?!

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.030
Toshinori, these guys...

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.450
They shouldn't have been able to warp...

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.830
They're dealing with this too quickly...!

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.600
Don't tell me they're going to use this...?!

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.590
Master...

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.630
"2 Minutes Earlier"

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.340
--Ouch...
--Wh-What happened?

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.520
Mt. Lady and Gang Orca...

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.230
...and even the number four hero, Best Jeanist?

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.270
Mr. Tiger is there, too!

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.400
Ugh, are these really alive?

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.530
Is it really okay for our job
to be this easy, Jeanist?

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.070
Maybe we should've gone with All Might.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.490
Don't think about difficulty
and importance together, newcomer.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.370
Riot squad, get the Maidens ready.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.750
They might still be here.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.160
Please continue to give it your all.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.080
Yes, sir!

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.540
Ragdoll! Answer me!

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.040
Is that your teammate?

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.130
Looks like she's breathing. I'm glad.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.960
But her condition...

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.970
"Pro Hero - Ragdoll - Quirk: Search"

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.510
What did they do to you, Ragdoll?!

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.510
The heroes were already
moving way before we were!

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.600
Wow...!

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.600
Now, let us fall back immediately.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.560
There's nothing left for us to do now.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.650
Since she said "with All Might,"
does that mean Kacchan is there, too?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.940
If All Might is there, then there's
even more reason to rest easy.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.280
Now, hurry!

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.320
Right.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.130
Sorry, Tiger. She's always had a good Quirk.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.550
It was the perfect opportunity, so I took it.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.760
Are you with the League?

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.760
A light, someone...

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.550
After my body turned into this,
I also depleted a lot of what I'd stocked up...

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.930
Stop! Don't move!

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.280
Wait, Best Jeanist,
what if he was an ordinary citizen?!

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.610
Think about the situation.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.530
That instant of hesitation
could decide the fight.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.120
Don't let the villains do anything!

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:22.650
Tomura finally started thinking
and making decisions for himself...

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.240
I wish you wouldn't have gotten in his way.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.620
There was no time to even look back--

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.330
It was the work of an instant.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.790
What happened...

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.370
...didn't even take a second.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.420
Even so, that man's spirit...

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.670
...gave us hallucinations of death.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:54.140
You may one day have
to fight against this great evil...

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.440
"Tomura"... He was talking about Shigaraki!

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.900
What is this...?

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.150
It's not true, is it, All Might?

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.110
Don't tell me... Then, that's...

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:10.490
That's... All For One...!

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.660
Now then, shall we do it?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.580
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.630
The symbol of evil, All For One!

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.210
We couldn't even move in the
face of his overwhelming presence!

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.130
Even though Kacchan is so close!

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.160
Next time, "Symbol of Peace"!

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:36.560
"Next time: Symbol of Peace"

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.370
Go beyond!

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.940
Plus Ultra!
