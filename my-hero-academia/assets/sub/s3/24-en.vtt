00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.350
What's important is to know well who you are.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.700
Going to work with those content faces...

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.240
That's no good.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.500
I think that's wonderful.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.250
They're all just decent people!

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.160
What am I doing? What I do every day.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.010
Something special.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.980
I start every day with a puff of
Natural American Spirit and people watching.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010
And then it's over...

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.980
"A Season for Encounters"

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.930
It's been half a month since
All Might retired after the fight

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.470
in Kamino Ward in Kanagawa Prefecture.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.160
On TV and on the internet,
they've just been letting loose idle gossip

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.910
meant to stir up people's
unease day after day.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:38.970
"Special: Where is hero society headed?"

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.040
However, there haven't been many
big changes to our lives, right?

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.340
I believe we should investigate
how they'll change in a practical way

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.920
and consider countermeasures.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.090
--You're different.
--Please tell us about how you think
hero society will change in the future.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.680
--I approve of you Newscaster Miyagi.
--Please tell us about how you think
hero society will change in the future.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.060
I don't.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.810
It's really just that the presence
of All Might got too big--

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.230
so big that we couldn't see it anymore.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.280
The biggest change for regular
people's gotta be this guy, right?

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.140
The hero who advanced to
the number one spot, Endeavor.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.990
"Pro Hero - Endeavor - Quirk: Hellflame"

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.040
A big part of the unease lays on him.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.700
That's not surprising.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.370
He's not really the
kind of guy that everyone likes.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.130
It's not that I don't like Endeavor,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.380
"Japan without All Might"
"Businessman (36)"

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.340
it's just that I can't help
comparing him to All Might!

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.340
In a word, he's "rough."

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.220
To me, he looks like a regular person
pretending to be a superhero.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.760
He is a superhero.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.810
"Endeavor"
"Endeavor hero"
"Endeavor hate" "Endeavor scary"

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.640
Through circumstances beyond his control,
he received a rank unsuited for him.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.060
"Endeavor resolving crime"
"Endeavor cool"
"Endeavor kids"

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.020
It's unfortunate for him, too.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.400
To be the symbol of the
weakening of heroes? No, thank you!

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.030
Although Endeavor has resolved
a large number of cases,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.570
he is prone to anger,
and many times, he has gone overboard.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.470
In addition, in the base supporters
of men ages twenty to forty,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.040
there is a lot of bias against him
when compared with All Might.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.040
For us in the media, we need to
stop trying to just passively protect,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.840
but actively raise excitement for heroes.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.760
We should not keep bringing up the minuses
but see how we can turn them into pluses--

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.220
"Weakening" isn't about physical power.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.810
Miyagi knows what he's talking about.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.850
It's about the heart.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.270
It's about power.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.730
Be quiet... Shut up...!

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.070
"I am here"... is what that
man says when he saves people.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.070
For those who lived normally,
that was reassuring.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.570
But for everyone else, that was a curse.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.830
No way, no way!

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.960
I've already done it! I've already done it!

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.010
Villains...

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.050
Those who are only faithful to themselves.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.760
Once the curse is removed,
this is naturally what would happen.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.300
Jeez, give me a break!

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.600
Hero! Over here!

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.800
Even so, it's tempting for people who
don't know what to do with their Quirks...

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.690
This is the usual scene.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.480
You bastard, acting so boldly
like this in the middle of the day!

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.280
However, this is where
it's slightly different.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.240
Yellow, hurry up!

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.080
Idiot! You brought the whole counter!

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.550
Too bad, hero!

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.540
There's more than one of us!

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.750
We are...

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.080
...Team Reservoir Dogs!

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.840
And don't you forget it!

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.180
If we all walk across together
at a red light, it's not scary.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.640
The guys who've formed factions
and started moving in a systematic way

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.310
have started to come into the spotlight.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.190
The thing is, what we're looking
for are those who're more--

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
What is it, Giran? Have you been well?

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.160
"Villain - Giran"

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.620
Long time no talk! How've you been?

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.330
I don't know. I don't know
if I'm doing well or not.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.290
I see. That's tough.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.120
Hey, answer my question.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.380
Have you been well?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.290
Sure I have.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.700
I've been so busy
I'm just shrieking with delight.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.590
In the past week or two,

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.550
there's been a surge
in the black market for suits and items.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.140
Demand's growing exponentially.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.350
The League of Villains!
It's the darling of the idiots right now.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.270
--That's nice.
--No, it's not.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.150
Shut up... damn it!

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.150
And? What do you want? I'm a busy man.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.280
I'm not busy.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.440
I can't get in contact with Dabi.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.320
You know where he is?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.570
Apparently, Shigaraki
wants to meet up briefly.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.160
He'll probably contact you again later.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.200
I know where he is.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.120
No, I don't!
Don't go saying whatever you want!

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.000
Okay, looks like you're having a hard time.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.210
Don't overdo it.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.630
Damn it, I'm... me...

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.820
The League of Villains is currently
scattered in different areas.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.680
It's to get the investigation off our trails

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.810
and also to find new comrades.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.540
It's to make the organization even bigger.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.400
What the hell, bastard?
Your face looks gross!

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.740
What're you looking at? I'm gonna kill you!

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.700
We don't need guys like this...

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.750
Get down.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.190
If you're trash, at least burn
and be kindling for me.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.760
This is no good... I need
to wrap myself up...

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.760
I'm gonna tear apart...

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.400
...split in two...!

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.730
Once I'm wrapped up, I become one.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.680
Here's my story.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.960
In the past, I was one of those
who had fun making mischief.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.990
My Quirk is Twice.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.910
It's a simple power
that turns one thing into two.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.290
I can make a clone of myself,
and then make clones from the clone.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.500
I can make a full team of just myself.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.340
I made my clones do everything,
and I was the king of all of us.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.810
But the mes weren't satisfied
with me being the king.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.590
I was almost killed by myself.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.810
The things that I make won't disappear
without receiving a certain amount of damage.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:32.010
Before long, all of us were arguing
with each other, saying we were the real me.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.530
Can you imagine it?

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.660
This crazy situation continued
for a week and two days.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.790
In the end, we killed
each other and disappeared.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.040
Ever since, I haven't been able
to be certain that I'm the real one.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.960
I didn't know anymore.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.970
There isn't anywhere
a crazy person can belong.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.350
Heroes only save good people.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.180
By helping the league
that accepted me as I am,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.850
I want to be able to think
that I'm okay the way I am, too.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.610
What I'm looking for are people
who are crazy like me.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.440
Oh...

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.590
Crazy bastards wandering
in search of a place to belong...

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.090
A bunch of adults got together,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.380
and all they stole was a
small convenience store register?

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.080
I think that's weird...

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.590
If you've got this many people,
you should have a bigger goal.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.590
You guys are sick.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.940
You need to get better.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.260
We got the money,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.210
so we should skedaddle
before the heroes get here, Overhaul.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.170
They're all sick, every last one of them.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.780
It looks like the crazy ones have started
to make their own place to belong.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.660
Both the hero side and
our side have started changing sordidly.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.830
What's important is
to know well who you are.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.410
Knowing what you want to become...

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.890
Knowing what you want to do...

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.790
That is very important...

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.340
All right...

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.880
What shall I do...?

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.060
"Izuku Midoriya"
"Quirk: One For All"
"Smashes villains with a super power passed down from one generation to the next."

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.060
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 7/15"
"Height: 166 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Pork Cutlet Bowl"

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.810
"Midoriya"
"Under house arrest!"

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.270
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.270
There's almost no pain or weird sensations...

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.860
If you keep getting injured in the
same way two or three more times or so,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.900
I think you'll have to live
without being able to use your arms.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.330
I was really careful about holding back
when I used it yesterday,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.410
but when I'm not fully under
control of myself because of my emotions,

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.750
I should still try not to use them.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.210
I need to keep concentrating
on my Shoot Style!

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.630
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.840
Listen up, everyone!

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.640
Stay in line and move
promptly to the grounds!

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.510
You're the one who's not in line.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.350
The dilemma of a class rep!

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.230
I heard, Class A--

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.230
"Neito Monoma - Quirk: Copy"

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.690
Two people! You had two people
fail the provisional licensing exam!

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.690
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.150
Class B's Monoma!

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.150
He's crazy, as usual!

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.070
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.610
So were you the only one to fail again?

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.070
Like with the final?

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.370
Which is it?!

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.080
We...

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.510
...all passed!

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.580
We've pulled ahead of you, Class A.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.630
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.530
Sorry... everyone...

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.800
They're turning it into a competition
on their own, so don't worry about it.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.510
According to Vlad Teacher,
we'll have classes together this semester!

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.180
"Pony Tsunotori - Quirk: Horn Cannon"

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.140
I'm looking forward to it!

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.230
Oh, I can't wait to test out my skills!

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.180
Anyway, you're an exchange student, right?

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.560
I'll beat you up so bad
you won't be able to get back up!

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.810
Don't teach her weird phrases!

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.740
Hey, we're trying to get through back here.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.780
I'm sorry!

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.450
Come now, everyone,
save your chitchat for later.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.990
You're causing problems for other people!

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.450
Don't show me how uncool you are.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.500
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.830
Shinso.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.540
He's the person who fought
Midoriya at the sports festival.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.960
That guy looks...

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.550
...like he's bulked up a bit...

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.550
"Pro Hero - Nezu - Quirk: High Specs"

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:27.470
Hey! It's the small mammal
you all love, the principal!

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.340
Recently, the fur I'm so proud
of has deteriorated in quality...

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.980
It's hard for me to take care of it.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.250
This is something you
can say about humans, too.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.280
Even if you have a balanced diet
with zinc and vitamins,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.320
the most important thing has to be sleep.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.910
Disturbing your lifestyle
is the worst for your fur.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.000
So if you're trying to
improve your hair quality,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.120
--I really don't care...
--you should make sure to get enough sleep!

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.040
--I can't believe how long
he's talking about this...
--you should make sure to get enough sleep!

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.380
The cause of the disturbance in lifestyle
is incidents from this summer vacation

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.630
I'm sure you all already know about--

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.550
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.510
The loss of a pillar.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.430
The effects of that incident have
appeared faster than I could have imagined.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.640
There will probably be great chaos
in society in the near future.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.650
In particular, this will be most apparent
to those of you in the hero course.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.280
You must approach
activities outside of school,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.440
like the hero work studies that mainly
second and third years participate in,

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:29.120
--with a greater sense of
caution and crisis than before.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.200
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.120
--Hero work studies?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.410
Is it like the next level
of the internships we did?

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.910
The air always feels heavy when we
talk about gloomy things like this, huh?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.960
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.090
The adults are working hard to do
something about that heaviness.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.090
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.720
We'd like you all to learn that hard work
from them and develop into capable people.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.430
All of you in the business course, general
studies, support course, and hero course--

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:56.190
I don't want you to forget that
you're all successors of this society.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.690
Thank you, Principal Nezu.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.190
If you're looking for a successor,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.110
there's no place more blessed
with young talent than U.A.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.780
How about it? Will you come teach for us?

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.650
Taking your condition into account,
as well, I don't think it's a bad idea.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.500
Oh, I'm not just saying this
with a vague idea in mind.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.750
I have no doubt that someone suitable
to be your successor will be here.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:29.540
And now, we have a few warnings from the
non-curricular guidance teacher, Mr. Hound Dog.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.680
"Hunting Dog Hero: Hound Dog
(Non-Curricular Guidance)"

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.680
Grrr... Yesterday... grrrrrr...

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.410
At the dorms! Grrrrr... growl...!

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.750
Unused to grrr... life--

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.160
Let's see. There were
students fighting last night.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.990
"Pro Hero - Vlad King - Quirk: Blood Control"

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.290
You might be unused to life at the dorms,

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.200
but let's live a life of moderation,
is what he means.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.000
What was Mr. Hound Dog there for?

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.290
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.080
Does he forget human speech
when he gets angry?

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.540
There's still so much I
don't know about U.A....

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.380
Midoriya and Bakugo are being treated
as problem children, aren't they?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.430
And now, return to your classrooms,
starting with the third years.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.760
Hey, hey, hey! I know!

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.020
Hey, listen to what I heard!

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.770
"slap slap"

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.850
It was a couple of first years! First years
from Class 1-A who were fighting!

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.060
Hey, do you know them?
They're so energetic!

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.230
--Hey, hey, hey!
--Oh?

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.280
Okay, then, we'll be continuing
regular classes starting today.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.490
"Pro Hero - Eraser Head - Quirk: Erasure"

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.960
A lot of unprecedented things happened,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.740
but you'll need to switch gears
and focus on your duties as students.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.900
We'll be staying inside the classroom today,

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.420
but this semester, you'll have
even harsher training than before.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.630
He's not talking about it...

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.420
What's that, Ashido?

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.920
I haven't felt this in a while!

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.380
I'm sorry, can I ask a question?

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.640
Can you tell us what the
"hero work studies" that came up earlier

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.060
during the opening ceremonies are about?

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.770
Oh yeah, the principal
said something about that.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.270
I was wondering, as well.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.730
He said it was something many
of the upperclassmen are engaged in...

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.170
I was planning to talk more
about those at a later date, but...

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.700
I guess telling you guys now is more logical.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.700
To put it simply,
they're hero activities outside of school.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.160
Like the internships
you did under heroes before...

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.580
...only closer to the real thing.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.560
Oh, there was a system like that?

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.220
Then why did I work
so hard at the sports festival?!

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.890
That's true. If we have work studies,

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.560
then even those who didn't
get scouted at the sports festival

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.970
would have paths open up for them.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.970
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.140
Now, calm down. You're not being yourself.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.390
But--!

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.770
The hero work studies use the scouting
from the sports festival as connections.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.990
This isn't part of a class, but an activity
done at the discretion of the student.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.680
So those who weren't
scouted at the sports festival

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.780
would have a hard time
lining one up to begin with.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.910
Originally, individual
agencies recruited on their own,

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.250
but there were many complications
with trying to get U.A. students to join,

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.620
so it ended up being like this.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.670
If you understand, sit down.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.750
I'm sorry I jumped to conclusions...

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.600
Now that you have your provisional licenses,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.030
you can assist in more real ways
for longer periods of time.

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.060
But there haven't been many cases where
first years have received their provisional licenses.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.350
With the increased activity of villains,

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:27.040
we are currently thinking
seriously about your participation.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.470
Well, we'll have you hear
more about what it's like

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.130
and explain in further
detail at a later date.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.610
We've got our own circumstances to consider.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.670
Well then, sorry to keep you waiting, Mic.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.830
First period is English!

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.510
In other words, my time!

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.330
"Pro Hero - Present Mic - Quirk: Voice"

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.450
It's been an age
since I stood on this stage!

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.620
Did you miss me, bro?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.650
We've got a lot to cover today!

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.550
Let's fire it up! Yeah!

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.930
Hm? What's this dust, Bakugo?

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.350
Deku was supposed to clean that!
Stop messing around!

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.110
Hey, can't you even clean properly?!

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.930
I-I'm sorry!

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.480
Man, I'm beat.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.480
Oh, everyone, put the trash from your
rooms out. I'll take them out together.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.990
Hey, Mic's class today...

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.820
Don't tell me, you too?

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.740
Grammar we didn't learn
just came out naturally, huh?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.080
Oh yeah, that! Right? I was surprised, too!

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.000
I forgot to prepare for class...

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.960
If I get stuck once, I can't process
anything that comes after that.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.580
About the work studies,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.630
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.960
I didn't get scouted, so I wonder
if I'll be able to participate...

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.380
Maybe they'll have us go to
the places where we did our internships.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.800
I wanna participate. Don't you?

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.760
In just one day,
I feel like I'm being left behind!

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.930
That's the face you're
making, Mr. House Arrest.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.190
Don't call me "Mr. House
Arrest"! That's mean!

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.060
Um, Iida, what's a work study?

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.650
I am angry!

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.530
We have been forbidden to tell you
anything about our classes by the teachers.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.950
Sorry, but you two will need to fully
experience that feeling you have right now.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.870
Are you listening, Bakugo?

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.080
Shut up! I get it, Damn Four-Eyes!

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.790
I want to know...

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.790
What's a "work study"?

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.880
We're clearly being left behind.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.050
For normal classes of course, but thinking
objectively, these three days of house arrest

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.970
will really hit hard.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.050
There's hero basic training tomorrow, too.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.260
Everyone's going to
learn new things and improve.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.890
There's gonna be a difference!

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.300
I'm falling behind!

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.930
I need to catch up!

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:33.730
Trash, right?

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.320
"Garbage Dump"

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.280
You can throw away the
food trays with the burnables.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.870
Uh... right.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.180
Good.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.280
What was that just now...?

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.580
You're the energetic first year, right?

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.220
You're surprised, right?

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.440
Sorry about that!

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.090
I did it because I thought
you'd be surprised, though!

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.140
What in the world are you?

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.640
I wonder...

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.820
I wonder what I'm doing, too,
once in a blue moon.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.600
You'll find out who I am soon, right?

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.940
I'm just glad you're doing well!

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.690
All I can say is that people are
talking about you, so I came to see--

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.120
What... just happened?

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.890
I feel like I've seen him somewhere before...

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.000
In my discomfort,
with my feelings of impatience,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.040
three days passed,
and I turned in my written apology.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.840
My house arrest was over
a little before Kacchan's.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.840
I was back!

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.470
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused!

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.680
Deku, thanks for all your hard work!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.180
"Hard work"? Why does
he look so angry, anyway?

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.370
Iida, I'm sorry for disappointing you!

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.850
Right... I'm just glad you
know what you did wrong.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.110
But what's the matter?

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.400
I'm going to catch up with everything
I fell behind in these past three days!

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.610
Oh, that's great! I love stuff like that!

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.240
In your seats, everyone.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.830
Morning.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:14.540
Now that Midoriya is back, we'll go
into more detail about the work studies.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.380
Please come in.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.490
We'll have people who
experienced it first hand

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.010
tell you about how these
are different from the internships.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.390
Listen carefully.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:35.940
The three third years at U.A. who
stand at the top of all U.A. students--

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.040
Also known as the Big Three.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.570
The Big Three...

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.830
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.170
Work studies where we'll be
able to work like real heroes.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.170
Those tasked with teaching us
about them are the Big Three,

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.050
who stand at the top of U.A.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:36.180
One of those three, Mirio Togata,
suddenly offers to fight us.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.520
The top of U.A. and the me now.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.520
I'll experience it firsthand!

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.650
Next time, "Unrivaled"!

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.400
That ability is really close
to the number one hero's!

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.290
"Next time: Unrivaled"

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.930
Go beyond!

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.390
Plus Ultra!
