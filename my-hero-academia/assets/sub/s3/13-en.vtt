00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.270
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.200
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.150
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.530
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.710
Will you allow me to pour
my all into Young Izuku?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.010
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.800
I will protect him and raise him up,
even if I have to give my life to do so!

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
"Inko Midoriya"

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.140
M-Mom!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.810
I don't like this after all...

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.820
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.530
I mean, you are Izuku's reason for living.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.780
So don't give up your life.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.780
Please live properly
to protect him and raise him.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.790
If you can promise me that,
then I will allow it.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.560
Mom...!

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.880
I promise.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.560
Izuku, if you're going to live at U.A.,
then you understand, right?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.100
I definitely won't make you worry!

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.460
Don't say it with a face like that.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.820
I don't actually like it.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.200
But while I wasn't looking,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.130
you became someone the hero
you admired would say so much about.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.960
This must make you
happier than anything, huh?

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.570
"Live properly," huh?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.090
Acting like a natural born hero, it's been
a while since anyone said that to me...

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.310
You have a good mother.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.020
Yes.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.100
She's like my master... my predecessor...

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.060
What? My mom is?

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.950
Yeah. Like their hairstyles and stuff.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.520
Hair, huh?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.200
I'm saying that she's someone strong.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.280
Oh? Oh my, look at that skeleton face...

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.200
--Ew, could it be...?
--Oh no, I'm All Might in
this form, too, now, huh?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.540
I'm still not used to it.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.750
Well, see you at school!

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.730
Oh, okay.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.880
After my mother gave me permission,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.290
I left home and started my new life.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.310
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.310
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.310
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.310
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.320
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.320
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.320
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.320
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.320
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.330
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.840
On the grounds of U.A.,
about a five-minute walk from the school,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.430
a student dorm built in
three days: Heights Alliance.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.360
This is my--no, our--new home.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.060
"Moving into Dorms"

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.070
The dorm system we've put in place
isn't just to ensure the students' safety.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.070
"Pro Hero - Nezu - Quirk: High Specs"

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.240
It is also to determine the threat we
have still not taken care of—the leak.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.500
In order to overcome the unease
that has been in the air for a long time,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.940
we will avoid doing a public investigation
and search behind-the-scenes.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.130
It pains me to suspect not just
the teachers, but also the students,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.220
but in the position I'm in, I have no choice.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.390
The loss of the Symbol...

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.480
I'm sure the effects of that will
appear in big ways as time passes.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.230
Anyway, right now, we
need energy and revival.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.940
At least, for the children,

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.790
we need to show them a bright future.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.660
For now, I'm just glad that we were able
to bring Class 1-A back together again.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.660
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.510
Everyone was allowed to enter the dorms, huh?

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.620
I had a hard time!

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.500
That's normal...

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.380
The two of you were
directly affected by the gas.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.550
We were all able to be together
again because of the teachers.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.260
When I watched the press conference,
I thought we'd lose them, and it made me sad.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.930
Yeah.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.050
I was surprised, too.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.100
Well, I'm sure everyone
has different circumstances.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.810
For the most part,
rather than trying to convince them,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.110
it was more like we let them
go free and then grabbed their tails.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.280
Now, I'll explain briefly
about the dorms, but first--

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.860
For now, we will focus on
getting the provisional licenses

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.120
we were planning to have
you get during the training camp.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.950
Oh yeah, they did talk about that!

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.000
So much happened that I forgot about it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This is important. Listen up.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.130
Kirishima.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.380
Yaoyorozu.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.670
Todoroki, Midoriya, Iida.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.390
These five went to go save Bakugo that night.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.640
Ribbit...

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.480
Your reactions tell me that
you all were at least aware of it.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.230
I'm going to set aside
a number of issues and say this:

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.490
If it weren't for All Might's retirement,

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.450
I would've expelled everyone
except Bakugo, Jiro, and Hagakure.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.000
Of course the five that went, but also
the twelve who knew but didn't stop them

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.230
betrayed our trust, no
matter what the reason.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.340
I would be grateful if you could follow
the proper procedures and act properly

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.980
in order to regain that trust.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760
That is all.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.720
Now, we're going inside.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.680
Let's have some energy!

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.690
No, wait, how are we
supposed to right now...?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.320
Come here.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.000
Huh? What? No!

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.080
Yay...

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.330
What? What did Bakugo do...?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.330
Kirishima!

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:03.920
Huh?

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.460
--Wait, you're scaring me! What is this,
did you shake someone down for money?
--No! I withdrew this money.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.010
You used up all your allowance, right?

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.660
Yeah... Where did you hear about
me buying night-vision goggles--?

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.850
If you keep having to scrimp
and save, then it'll make me feel bad.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.890
Show your dumb side, as usual.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.610
--Yay? Yay, yay, yay!
--Oh, no... I... Oh, Kaminari...

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.010
You're laughing too much!

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.560
Sorry.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.790
I guess sometimes it's
necessary to let loose...

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.960
Sorry, everyone! This won't make up for it,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.080
but let's all go eat yakiniku
tonight with this money!

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.170
Seriously?!

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.090
Yay!

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.640
Each student dorm building holds one class.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.460
Girls on the right, and boys on the left.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.560
But the first floor is the common area.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.640
Food, baths, and laundry are on this floor.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.560
There's even a courtyard!

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.150
So spacious! So clean! And a sofa!

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.280
It's like a mansion!

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.150
Uraraka!

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.030
Did my ears deceive me?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.330
Baths and laundry are in the common area?

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.910
Is this a dream?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.790
They're separated by gender.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.250
You better watch yourself.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.660
Yes, sir.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.920
Rooms start on the second floor.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.760
There are four rooms per gender
on each floor with five floors total.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.800
Everyone gets their own room.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.430
They're luxurious spaces equipped
with their own AC, toilets, fridges, and closets.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.930
There's even a balcony!

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.890
This is about the same size
as the closets we have at home.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.390
It's like a mansion!

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.650
Uraraka!

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:54.190
"Koda     |   Jiro
Kaminari
Iida Ojiro      |   Hagakure"

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:54.190
"Mineta
Midoriya
Aoyama Tokoyami"

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.070
These are your rooms.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.610
The belongings you sent ahead
have already been placed in your rooms,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.360
"             | Yaoyorozu
Sato
Todoroki Sero        | Asui"

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.360
"Shoji       |   Uraraka
Kirishima
Bakugo                 | Ashido"

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.360
so unpack and get settled in today.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.280
I'll tell you more about what will
happen from now on tomorrow.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.200
That's all. Dismissed!

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.600
Yes, Mr. Aizawa!

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.540
Ahh, I'm so tired.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.420
Kirishima, are you done unpacking?

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.420
Yeah, finally.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.540
Good work.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.420
How things ended up this way weren't great,
but it's kind of exciting to live together, huh?

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.010
Yeah!

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.930
Living together...

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.970
This is also training to help us
learn cooperation and discipline!

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.640
You're really going all out, huh, Iida?

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.060
Boys, are you all done with your rooms?

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.890
Yup. Just relaxing now.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.390
Well, the girls were all talking just now...

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.730
...and we have an idea.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.110
Want to have a room presentation contest?

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.170
Huh?

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.490
No, no, wait--!

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.700
"Midoriya"

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.870
It's filled with All Might!

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.200
It's an otaku's room!

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.540
It's because I admire him...

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.210
This is so embarrassing!

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.080
Crap, they just started something.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.210
But it's kind of fun...

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.460
"Tokoyami"

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:57.630
This is foolish.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.720
So black! Scary!

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.730
You little...

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.770
I bought this keychain
before in middle school.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.940
Boys like this kind of thing, huh?

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.150
Get out.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.740
A sword...! So cool!

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.650
Get out!

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.900
"Aoyama"

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.700
So bright!

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.620
Non non, not "bright,"

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.870
"dazzlin--"

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.660
It's exactly how I thought it'd be.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.540
It fits within my expectations.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.790
This is starting to get fun!

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.500
The last person on the second floor is--

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.210
Come in...

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.340
I'll show you something amazing...

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.470
Let's go to the third floor.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.300
Come in... Come on...

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.560
"Ojiro"

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.270
Wow, it's so normal!

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.310
It's so normal! Wow!

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.020
So this is what's normal, huh?

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.440
It's fine if you don't
have anything to say...

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.030
"Iida"

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.610
The shelves are lined with hard books.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.240
That's the class rep for you!

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.950
There's nothing strange here.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.280
There are so many glasses...

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280
What's strange about that?

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.580
It's because I expect them to be
destroyed during our intense training.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.830
"Kaminari"

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.040
It's so gaudy!

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.120
It's like he just used anything
he could lay his hands on.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.090
What? Isn't it great?

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.340
"Koda"

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.880
There's a rabbit! It's so cute!

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.880
It's not fair to have a pet.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.890
Koda, you've gotta be doing this on purpose!

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.890
It seems like everyone's
starting to compete...

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.390
Anyway, I'm not satisfied.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.440
Yeah, what a coincidence.
Me neither. Not satisfied.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.480
Yeah.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.190
Yeah, me neither.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.570
It's weird for the boys to be
the only ones getting picked on.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.700
You said this was a
room presentation contest, right?

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.540
Then, of course, we should also see
the girls' rooms before we decide, right?

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:57.500
Shouldn't we decide who has the best taste in
interior decoration from everyone in class?

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.340
These sharp words that
showed no mercy to the girls

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.880
lit a fire under the
competitive spirit of the boys.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.260
Sounds good!

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.840
Huh?

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.100
Getting even those completely
uninterested involved,

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:14.100
the first annual Class 1-A
Best Taste Contest is about to begin!

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.810
Is this all right?

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.610
Is this really all right?

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.990
"Tsuyu Asui"
"Quirk: Frog"
"She can do pretty much everything a frog can, like stretch out her tongue really far."

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.990
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 2/12"
"Height: 150 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Jello"

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.990
"Rikido Sato"
"Quirk: Sugar Rush"
"He can temporarily increase his strength by consuming sugar."

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.990
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 6/19"
"Height: 185 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Cake"

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.410
Um, okay, so we'll be deciding who has
the best taste in interior decoration in the class,

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.120
or who's the Room King!

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.460
Room King?

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.620
We don't have to decide anything like that...

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.840
If I'm the only one asserting my opinion,
then they'll all just make fun of me.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.640
But if I take advantage of the will of these
guys who've had their self-confidence hurt...

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.640
...then my opinion will be cloaked
under the cover of "the popular will."

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.310
With this, I'll have a very natural excuse
for rummaging around the girls' rooms!

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.300
I'm sleepy...

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:09.030
The ones on the boys' side of the fourth floor
are Bakugo, Kirishima, and Shoji, right?

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.030
Where's Bakugo?

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.040
He said, "This is lame. I'm going to sleep,"
a long time ago and went to his room.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.080
I'm sleepy, too.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.870
Then, let's do Kirishima's room!

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.290
Let's keep this going!

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.750
"shima"

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.170
I don't really care,
but I don't think you girls will get it--

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.300
"Congrats"
"Big Catch"

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.720
"Certain Victory"

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.720
This manliness!

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:28.880
Yeah.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.930
This looks like it'd rank in
around second for the room

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.470
you'd least want your boyfriend to have.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.180
It's so hot! So hot and stuffy!

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:35.850
See? I told you.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.480
Next, Shoji.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.100
There's nothing interesting here.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.810
"Empty"

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.110
Nothing interesting?

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.360
I didn't know you were a minimalist.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.860
Well, I've never really
liked having a lot of things.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.240
It's guys like this that are
super pervy inside, you know.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.200
Next, let's go up a floor
to the fifth floor boys' rooms!

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.120
We'll start with Sero!

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.870
Are we seriously doing everyone?

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.170
Wow!

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.210
Asian!

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.550
It's lovely!

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.550
Sero, I didn't know you
liked stuff like this.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.930
Yup, that's me! Always expect the unexpected.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.680
Next, next!

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.350
Next is Todoroki, right?

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.180
The most capable student in the class!

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.560
The most handsome boy in the class!

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.560
Going into the aloof
Todoroki's room is kind of exciting...

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.530
Hurry up and get this over with. I'm sleepy.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.860
A Japanese-style room!

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.200
Was his made differently?!

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.580
We have tatami at home,
so I can't relax on flooring.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.780
Who cares about why?

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.450
How did you remodel it in a day?!

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.000
I worked hard.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.080
What's up with this guy?

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.340
"Todoroki"

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.920
He seems like he'll be a big shot one day.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.380
Pretty boys do things differently, huh?

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.340
Okay, next! The last of the boys is...

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.260
Me.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.260
"Fresh"
"Made with Kushiro Cream"
"Vegetable Fat"

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.510
Anyway, it's a boring room.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.010
Anyone's would be after Todoroki's.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.350
Something smells good... what is it?

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.480
Oh no, I forgot!

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.360
I finished unpacking really early,
so I baked a chiffon cake.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.020
I thought we could all eat it together.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.240
It'd be even more delicious with
whipped cream, but you guys want some?

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.740
Yeah!

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:14.990
It's like an exemplary unexpected side!

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.790
It's delicious! So fluffy!

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.450
Buono, buono!

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.960
He easily surpassed Sero's unexpected side!

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.870
Yeah, yeah!

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.960
What a wonderful hobby you have, Sato.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.500
Would you like to bake something
to go with my tea next time?

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.630
Oh, I didn't expect everyone
to like it so much.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.340
I just make it as part
of training for my Quirk.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.390
Buying sweets can get expensive.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.390
That's it for the boys. Next, it's our turn!

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.020
Aw man, are we seriously
doing everyone? Is that all right?

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.150
It's probably fine, right?

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.020
It's kind of embarrassing...

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.900
It's filled with even more
instruments than I expected.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.450
It's because Jiro's a rockin' girl.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.160
Can you play all these?

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.030
Yeah, at least the basics...

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.240
It's not girly at all.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.330
Unladylike.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.710
Next. Let's move onto the next one!

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.830
Next is me, Hagakure.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.790
What do you think?

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.670
O-Oh...

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.300
It's like a normal girl's!
It's making my heart pound.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.680
Plus Ultra...!

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.930
Mineta, you went straight for it, huh?

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.770
"Ashido"

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.770
I'm next!

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.640
Ta-da! Isn't it cute?

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.850
Wow...

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.100
"Uraraka"

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.900
It's not a very interesting room...

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.230
Wow...

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.990
I feel a little dirty going around looking
at so many normal girls' rooms...

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.990
A forbidden garden...

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.240
Next is Asui...

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.580
Wait, Tsu's not here.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.620
Oh, Tsu said she wasn't feeling well.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.840
We can't do anything if
she's not feeling well.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.710
We'll just have to get her to
show us when she's feeling better!

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.260
"Asui"

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.510
"Yaoyorozu"

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.510
Then, last is Yaoyorozu!

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.100
Well, I think I miscalculated...

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.690
Unlike all of your rooms
filled with originality,

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.610
mine became a little cramped.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.320
It's huge! It's cramped!
What happened, Yaoyorozu?

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:20.120
It's the furniture I was using, but I didn't
think the room would be this small...

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.330
She's a rich girl, all right.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.000
All right, everyone--

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.420
Have you all voted?

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.710
You can't vote for yourself!

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:39.090
And now, here are the results of the first
Room King competition, minus Bakugo and Tsu!

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:47.940
With a total of five votes! The overwhelming
winner standing alone at the top is...

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.150
Rikido... Sato!

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.650
Huh?!

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.940
By the way, they were all girls!
The reason was...

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.110
"Because the cake was delicious!"

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.070
What about my room?!

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.860
You little--

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.280
Aspiring heroes shouldn't use bribery!

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.080
I'm not bribing anyone!
What the heck, I'm super happy!

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.250
--Don't laugh!
--Is it over? Can I go to sleep now?

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.770
Yes! Since you had cake,
don't forget to brush your teeth!

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.380
He was waiting until it was over, huh?

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.590
Oh, Todoroki, wait a sec.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:22.340
Deku and Iida, too, and Kirishima
and Yaoyorozu. Do you have a minute?

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.230
Uraraka, where...?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.150
You see, Tsu said she
had something to tell you all.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.140
I can't help but say everything
that comes to mind.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:49.160
But there are times
when I don't know what to say.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.210
Do you remember what I said at the hospital?

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.590
...if you're saying that
you'll break the rules...

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.380
Those acts are the same as those of villains.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.010
Yeah, I remember.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.270
I hardened my heart
and said some painful things.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.480
Tsu...

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.900
Even so, you still went.
When I heard about that this morning,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.230
I was shocked.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.990
I thought I'd stopped you, so I was filled
with disappointment and bad feelings...

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.290
I didn't know what to say...

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.620
I didn't feel like I could have
fun talking with everyone...

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:31.750
But...

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.420
...that made me very sad.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:44.590
That's why I wanted to tell you even
if I couldn't gather my thoughts properly,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.560
so that I could have fun
and talk with everyone again.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.480
It's not just Tsu that feels this way.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.110
Everyone felt uneasy and wanted
to make that feeling go away...

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.070
That's why...

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:04.450
The "Room King" and everything was
because they understood how you all felt...

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.700
So don't blame them, but, you know...

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.160
I mean, I know it's hard, but anyway...

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.960
Let's all work hard together
and laugh together again!

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.000
Tsu...!

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.830
Ribbit...?

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.710
I'm sorry! Thanks for telling us!

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.380
Asui.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.420
Tsu!

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.220
Asui, sorry.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.050
Asu--

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:24.930
Tsu!

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.010
--I won't ever do it again.
--Ribbit... ribbit...

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.680
--Me neither.
--I promise!

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.190
That's right... Everyone was trying hard
to make things go back to normal.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.390
We have to return...

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.240
That's right, we have to
return to our usual...

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:47.610
Our usual daily lives of making each
other better as we aim to be heroes!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.960
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.040
As we work towards getting
our provisional licenses,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.710
we need to come up with our ultimate moves.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.430
How can I with my damaged arms?

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.830
Next time, "Create Those Ultimate Moves"!

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:36.560
"Next time: Create Those Ultimate Moves"

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.220
Go beyond!

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.700
