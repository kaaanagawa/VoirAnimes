00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.230
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.320
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.870
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.360
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.930
"Provisional Licensing Exam Location
National Dagoba Arena"

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.000
Those of us in Class 1-A of
U.A. High School's hero course

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.130
take on the provisional hero licensing exam.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.680
If you can pass this test and
get your provisional licenses,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.390
then you novice eggs will become chicks...

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.270
You'll hatch into semi-pros.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.390
"Pro Hero - Eraser Head - Quirk: Erasure"

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.390
Do your best.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.110
"Number to Pass 1st Test
100 People"

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.110
In the first test, the examinees put three
targets anywhere they like on their bodies,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.110
"1st Test Rules"

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.450
and if all three get hit by balls,
then they're out.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.780
The first hundred to get two or more
people out with the six balls they're given

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.410
can move on to the next round of testing.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.700
"Fail"

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.330
If you like your class this year,
then you should've told your students.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.500
"Pro Hero - Ms. Joke - Quirk: Outburst"

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.500
What always happens at the beginning...

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.750
The crushing of U.A.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.090

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.470

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.930
Dark Shadow!

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.390
--Got it!
--The crushing of U.A.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.770
--All right!
--There wasn't really a reason
why I didn't tell them,

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.440
but in the end, it wouldn't
change what they had to do.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.030
They just have to overcome everything.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.240
A hero is someone who can
turn around a bad situation.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.200
In the first place, if they become pros,
then everyone will already know their Quirks,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.560
so I'm sorry, but we look a little
further ahead than everyone else.

"Shiketsu High Lurking"

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.880
Hey, Eraser.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.880
For this first test, since they
pass in the order they finish,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.180
there's the impression that
whoever attacks first wins,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.930
but that's not the case, is it?

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.430
No, it looks like the keys will
be teamwork and cooperation,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.140
and their ability to gather information.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.900
If they're seduced by the words
"the first hundred" and rush to get points,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.290
then they'll have the tables turned on them.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.320
Most are getting repelled, huh?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.370
I guess we shouldn't be surprised that
something like this won't take down U.A....

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.050
But well, I think I see now...

"2nd Year - Shikkui Makabe

Quirk: Stiffening!

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.250
He can make objects he kneads or
scrapes with both hands super hard!

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.470
However, it does not work on living things!

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.800
I'm leaving it to you.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.970
I'll take it from here.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.760
But I might just end up
finishing ahead of you all.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.590
I hope you let it pass because it means
you have less people to go up against.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.850
Target Lock-On...

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.780
Boomerang: Crescent Moon Trajectory.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.200
The targets have been determined.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.160
Since their trajectories
are hiding underground,

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.910
you won't be able to react.

He can throw objects in his hands
at any trajectory he wishes!

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.880
He can even throw them underground!

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.340
Where in the world are they?!

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.590
Get back! I'll take this!

She's digging up the ground!

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.890
But--

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.600
Huh?

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.690

Thanks! That's a great move.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.660
It's a defensive move
that puts up a melty wall!

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.410
They've finished their ultimate moves, huh?

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.660
Of course.

She can fold her body into
itself like a turtle.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.980
It'll make you faint if you
see it on a dark road at night!

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.190
I see. This isn't the Class A
from the sports festival.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.710

No one has passed yet.

them all from this broadcasting area.

The targets everyone is wearing--

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.420
In other words, their weak points!

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.880
Everyone will fight while protecting them,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.850
so throwing blindly will
have a low chance of hitting.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.060
But well, I think I see now...

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.140
Everyone's still at the "wait-and-see" stage.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.400
Everyone's watching for their opponents'
weaknesses and how they use their Quirks.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.010
The fight will probably speed up from here!

"We look a little further ahead
than everyone else," huh?

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.310
That's pretty condescending, Eraser.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.910
There are as many kids who want to become
heroes as there are stars in the sky.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.170
The strength of that will has
nothing to do with being famous.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.170
If you act like you're the stars of the
show and look down on everyone else,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.800
then you're the ones that might
get the tables turned on you.

Quirk: Vibrate!

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.710
He can make the things he touches vibrate.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.420
However, aftershocks based on the strength
of the vibrations transfer to his body,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.930
making him unable to move.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.260
No, probably someone's Quirk.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.890
What kind of Quirk is that?

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.640
Which school is it from?

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.560
Don't lose focus!

The enemy's close!

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.900

Wait, now that he's
got our balls, we can't...!

...forward to it!

All right! I won!

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.010
Um, well, I'm so surprised
that I'm awake now.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.810
It looks like they'll just keep coming now.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.050
Everyone, please do your best
as quickly as possible.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.100
What a Quirk.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.040
It seems like it would be hard to use
where there are buildings...

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.360
Oh, no, we've gotten split up!

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.160
This situation is what
Ketsubutsu was planning.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.580
I need to meet up with
everyone--someone--soon!

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.320
If I'm by myself, I'm done for.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.250
There's a big difference in the length
of time we've had to work together

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.960
and make decisions during battle.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.130
We're behind by a whole
year's worth of training!

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.400
It's not something that can just
be made up for with experience!

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.630
Yoarashi...

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.590
Last year, the same year as you guys,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.390
Yoarashi got the top scores of those
admitted through recommendations,

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.350
but for some reason,
he turned down his acceptance.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.270
If he was the top of those
with recommendations...

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.350
Then, his abilities are above Todoroki's?!

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.190

I don't know why,

Sh-She came out of nowhere?!

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.250
Got you.

That's no good.

Don't stare off into space.

you're in trouble, you're smiling.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.030
"Hanta Sero"
"Quirk: Tape"
"He can shoot tape-like material from his elbows and use it to apprehend or for movement."

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.030
"Affiliation: Shiketsu High School 1st Year"
"Birthday: 9/26"
"Height: 190 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Passion"

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.030
"Inasa Yoarashi"
"Quirk: Whirlwind"
"He can create strong winds around himself and control them."

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.450
That was a forceful division...

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.790
Someone could've died!

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.040
If I try to call out to the others,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.080
the other schools will find me,
and I'll be a target.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.340
They shouldn't be too far away.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.090
In order to keep from having
to fight by myself against a team,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.720
I need to find the others first.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.930
It's especially at times like this
that I need to be calm and careful...

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.230
It's time for Sneak Uravity!

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.140
In tests where they expect
a melee like this one,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.900
apparently, there are those who go after places
they've already got a lot of intel on.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.230
That's why I came to see you,

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.480
since there was the possibility
that U.A. would be taken out early.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.610
I didn't want to miss this chance
to interact with a prestigious school,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.870
and I wanted to know more about you all.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.700
You sure talk a lot.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.460
Ketsubutsu Academy will
be here soon as a group.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.210
This is no time for a leisurely chat.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.090
I'm sure she understands that.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.460
Does she have teammates
coming to help her?

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.550
Or is she just that confident?

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.380
It can't be helped.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.120
I've gotta make sure I don't get taken out!

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.430
She's gone again!

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.560
Where...?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.140
I just have to punch with a ball, right?

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.100
Oh, no!

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.480
Counter... attack!

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.030
Or not...

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.320
Do you think my Quirk lets me disappear?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.240
Shoot!

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.370
I was just hiding.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.290
Just hiding?

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.160
That's right.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.750
It's a technique.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.750
I make my opponent's eyes and ears
turn away from my presence.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.760
At that instant, I hold my breath,
clear my mind, hide, and disappear.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.380
The hard part is clearing my mind.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.850
You can even learn something
like that at Shiketsu?

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.970
The trick is to not think
about training as training.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.520
Oh, we both want to know about each other.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.100
My turn next.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.650
Why do you want to become a hero?

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.490
For honor? Pride? For someone else's sake?

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.360
I want to know more about you.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.920
Man, Shiketsu's here, too.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.840
I don't like it.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.800
Oh, no...

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.300
This is bad.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.430
I wasn't able to find anyone,
and I'm being targeted by a big group.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.550
I made the worst-case scenario
I thought of earlier into reality!

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.890
Here they come...

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:12.560
Dodge!

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.810
Dodge!

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.410
Dodge!

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.860
Just dodge!

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.770
Are you okay?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.280
Uraraka!

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.030
Over here! Hurry!

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.030
What, does she have a plan?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.870
I won't let you hurry!

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.700
Jeez, get outta my way!

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.080
I'll take her out!

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.790
Hey, wait!

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:41.870
Back then, I chose to fight
and destroyed my arms.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.590
If I hadn't destroyed them, I might've
been able to get Kacchan back.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.400
And if I had been able to get him back,

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.270
then All Might might not have
had to fight against All For One.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.020
Back then, if I had been able to protect
Kota and get him to Mr. Aizawa

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.560
and go after the villains sooner...

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.290
I will train focusing on my legs.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.590
Because I should've gotten there sooner.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.200
An opening!

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.700
In order to save others, you have
to be able to take care of yourself first!

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.670
Damn it! He's making us lose our footing!

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.840
No, I think it's already more
effective than just a stopgap.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.970
Especially for the
provisional licensing exam.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.740
It's just as All Might said!

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.980
I've decided. Until my body catches up,
I won't use One For All at 100%.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.980
But until then, the instant my
iron soles create a strong impact,

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.280
the toes spring back out,
so I get two hits in an instant!

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.700
This support item compensates for the
lack of power and the pull of my legs!

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.700
I'll make my legs stronger,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.920
and become the hero I hold as my ideal...

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.760
We finally got the 30th person, huh?

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.090
We've still got a long way to go...

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.590
Can you hurry it up, please...?

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.060
Man, U.A.'s fast at running away!

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.770
Gone! Are they hiding?

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.980
I'm sure they're close!

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.190
Anyway, I was thinking about this earlier,
but isn't this kind of inefficient?

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.130
Anyone chasing us? No...

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:27.980
I wonder if they gave up.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.860
Thanks. Sorry, I messed up.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.110
No, it's not that...

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.350
Could you be someone from Shiketsu?

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.690
Huh?

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.110
Uraraka has been training with her Quirk

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.690
so that if it's for a short time, she can

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.860
ignore the side effects
and use it on herself.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.240
But to not even try to use it
even though you were in danger...

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:19.240
...and above all, to show yourself
to the enemy with no plan in mind!

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.700
That's not like the Uraraka I know at all!

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.710
If you saved me even though you noticed...

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.510
...does that mean you were
trying to use me, instead?

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.260
I-I didn't think that far ahead.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.800
But I'm glad I saved you then.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.020
Because if you're not Uraraka,
then you couldn't have floated away.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.480
If you kept falling the way you were,
then you would've definitely injured your back.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.310
Oh? I see.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.570
So that's why you did it...

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.320
I want you to tell me more about yourself.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.070
Can't we do this after the exam?

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.580
Will you save anyone?

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.250
Where's the boundary?

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.080
Where do you draw the line?

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.710
Wait, your clothes!

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.750
Why are you naked?
Please put something on!

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.040
I will after I do what I need to do!

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.670
A scratch?

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.380
What is the matter with her?!

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.510
Jeez.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.810
Tape!

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.940
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.140
Midoriya! What's with this
enviable situation you're in?

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.940
Sero!

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:25.850
Uraraka!

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.520
Release!

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.860
What amazing reflexes!

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.040
Things were just getting good... Too bad...

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.750
I really, really...

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.790
...wanted to talk to you more.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.920
But it's impossible like this.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.220
It's really too bad...

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.670
Ochaco Uraraka.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.220
He really trusts you a lot.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.900
Huh?

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.760
Hey, stop, you molester!

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.430
You don't have to follow her!

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.720
Why not?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.390
It might've been because of her Quirk,
but she's not wearing her clothes or her targets.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.900
There's still a chance
she might come after us,

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.770
but taking into consideration
the time we have left and everything,

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.050
it would be hard to get a point off her.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.740
More importantly, you two
are the real thing, right?

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.740
What are you talking about, Midoriya?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.370
Well, actually, the girl earlier transformed
to look exactly like Uraraka...

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.450
Huh?!

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.370
Was she naked, Midoriya?!

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.620
That's what you're concerned about?

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.710
She was wearing her costume!

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.360
So that molester's Quirk
is to transform into others, huh?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.720
Probably.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.480
The other schools really
know a lot about us, huh?

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.310
If they even know that you
and Uraraka are good friends...

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.860
Maybe it's because we were on the same team

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.860
for the cavalry battle
at the sports festival.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.230
Oh, I see.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.980
More importantly, how'd you two find me?

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.820
I saw a fight and rushed over.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.580
I met up with Uraraka on the way.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.240
I'm glad we made it in time!

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.990
Yeah, thanks.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.530
We've got three for now, right?

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.870
I wish we could meet up with the
others who got separated, though.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.880
But 30 people have already
passed the first test.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.600
We have to hurry.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.070
It'll hit a hundred before we know it!

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.300
The other guys are moving around
in groups of ten or more.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.120
I could attack first,
but it would be annoying

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.810
if there are people with
Quirks I'm weak against.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.200
Ideally, the other teams
would fight each other

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.540
and bring each other's numbers down
before I launch my attack, but...

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.570
Let's see, things have been moving quickly.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.240
The current number of people
who have passed is 52--

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.570
No, 53. They just keep on coming.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.120
Since there were people who
took out more than two people,

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.830
there are now 230 people who have failed.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.710
And just now, the 54th person has passed.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.330
Less than half left, now!

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.690
Hurry up! Finish!

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.380
I can't just wait around, huh?

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.310
That was pretty good.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.310
As expected of the runner-up
of the U.A. sports festival...

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.730
Todoroki, was it?

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.480
I can't believe you're acting alone,
though. That's amazing.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.940
You must be really confident.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.200
But even if he is from U.A., acting alone'll
get him in trouble, don't you think?

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.030
It's one-on-ten, you know.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.370
What're you going to do?

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.040
Thanks--

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.870
For saving me the trouble of finding you.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.620
Aren't you cool.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.550
Damn it, I can't move!

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.430
You guys...

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.810
Are you sure you watched the sports festival?

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.810
Of course we watched it!

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.190
A Quirk that makes things bigger, huh?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.030
That's not all!

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.160
Should I go all out?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.620
No, but if there are more of them...

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.300
Even if I couldn't melt all of it...

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.920
It didn't affect it at all?!

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.640
That's because they're not
made of ordinary metal.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.390
They're made of tungsten,
which can take super high temperatures!

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.270
Didn't I tell you, Todoroki?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.900
Even if you're a U.A.
student, acting alone...

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.660
...shows you're overconfident.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.130
"Preview"

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:21.770
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.880
It's the provisional licensing exam,
and those of us in Class A are still in trouble.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.050
Todoroki's being targeted
by Seijin High School,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.340
and Yaoyorozu and the others
are having a hard time, too...

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.720
Next time, "Class 1-A"!

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:36.660
"Next time: Class 1-A"

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.250
Go beyond!

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.710
Plus Ultra!
