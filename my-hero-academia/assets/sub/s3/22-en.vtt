00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.890
The provisional hero licensing exam ended,

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.480
and it was finally time
for the results to be revealed...

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.610
The names of those who passed
are listed in syllabary order.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.830
Please check the list.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.370
"List of Passing Candidates for
the Provisional Hero Licensing Exam"

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.370
A lot of people passed, huh?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.830
--Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi...
--Mi... Mi... Mi...

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.330
Ba--!

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.000
It's there...!

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.330
My name's there, All Might!

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.890
It's there! "Minoru Mineta"!

It's there...

"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.470
I see it!

"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.060
All right.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.640

"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.310
It's there!

"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.110
Yay!

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.110
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.110
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.440
I did it!

"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.610
Aw, yes!

"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140
I'm there! But...

"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240

Yo...! There's nothing after "Yu"...

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.450
It's not there after all, huh?

--Todoroki...
--Todoroki!

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.570
Sorry!

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.030
It's my fault that you didn't pass!

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.450
It's because I was too narrow-minded!

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.780
I'm sorry!

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.200
The path I was on until
now as that man's son...

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.460
It's something I must bear
as I aim to become a hero...

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.500
I started it in the first place.
Don't worry about it.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.130
But--!

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.380
There were things I realized thanks
to you confronting me directly, too.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.380
Todoroki... didn't pass?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.260
Both of our top two failed?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.850
You should rethink your abusive language.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.140
Words are important, you know.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.020
Shut up. I'll kill you.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.560
Because they are both highly skilled,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.570
they end up fighting
against their own egotism.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.910
The hierarchy's collapsing...!

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.560
Todoroki...

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.410
Todoroki...

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.420
Um, next we will pass out your results.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.550
They will have the breakdown of your scores,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.260
so please look over them carefully.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.530
Kirishima.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.950
Thanks so much!

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.010
Hand it over...

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.890
That's not how this works.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.890
Kaminari, lemme see!

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.390
Wait a sec, I haven't looked at it yet.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.850
The cutoff score was 50 points.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.400
We scored based on a demerit system.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.640
You can see how many points were taken off

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.900
for which actions all listed
out on the printouts.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.490
61 points... I barely passed...

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.160
I got 84! Look, isn't it amazing?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.450
I'm kind of good at this, huh?

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.910
Wait, Yao-momo, you got 94 points?!

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.040
Iida, how'd you do?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.790
I got 80 points.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.630
Overall, I think I had trouble
with practical application.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.380
What about you, Midoriya?

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.920
I got 71 points.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.920
I didn't lose points for my actions,
but mostly for my conduct before I acted

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.300
and for standing around and stuff.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.390
I'm thankful that they tell us
what we need to improve on!

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.180
Yeah.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.170
But, I wonder...

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.440
If it was a demerit system
with no chance to add points,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.900
and no hope of passing
after falling below 50 points...

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.360
Then why didn't they remove those
who dropped below 50 points--

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.610
why allow them to stay until the end?

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.040
Um, for those of you who passed,
from now on, during emergency situations only,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.870
you may exercise authority
the same as that of pro heroes.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.170
In other words, fighting villains,
saving people from criminal acts or accidents--

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.880
You may act on your own judgment in
these cases without the direction of a hero.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.670
However, this means that
each and every one of your actions

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.970
"Heroes Public Safety
Commission - Yokumiru Mera"

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.140
carries with it a responsibility
toward society.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.150
I'm sure you all know that the great hero,
All Might, has used up all of his power.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.820
His existence played a
large part in suppressing crime.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.490
With that deterrent gone,
impudent people will definitely appear.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.450
The balance will be destroyed,
and as the world changes greatly,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.210
you young people will someday
become the center of society.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.750
Next, you all must become exemplar heroes

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.090
and become great enough
to suppress crime yourselves.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.680
This time, all you have received is your
provisional license to perform hero activities.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.600
I would like you to think
of yourselves as fledglings

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.900
and be even more diligent in
your studies at your respective schools.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.310
And for those of you who did not pass--

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.150
There is no time for you to feel dejected
that you didn't have enough points.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.160
There is still a chance left for you all.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.780
After you attend a
3-month-long special course

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.780
and pass an individual test,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.450
we plan to issue a provisional
license to you all, as well.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.880
In order to deal with this
"future" that I just spoke of,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.420
we need as many good heroes as we can get.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.260
The first test was one to weed people out,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.800
but we would like to grow the hundred
selected in that test as much as possible.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.890
That is why we watched
all of you until the end.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.890
As a result, we saw that it wasn't
that you didn't have promise.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.850
Rather, once your inadequacies are corrected,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.270
all of you have the potential to be
even greater than those who passed.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.320
I think it will keep you pretty busy
doing this concurrently with your studies,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.320
and you may also choose to retake
the exam in April instead, but--

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.620
Of course!

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.890
Please!

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.870
Isn't this great, Todoroki?

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.460
Stop that. You don't have to take it.
Just take it easy.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.770
The hierarch--

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.840
We're waiting for you.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.630
Yeah.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.670
I'll... catch up soon.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.810
And so, the provisional licensing exam ended.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.270
And we are one step closer
to becoming heroes!

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.020

"Izuku Midoriya"

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.150
Deku, are you crying?

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.230
Well, it's... you know...

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.240
I was helped by so many...
and caused trouble for so many...

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.740
So... how do I put it?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.990
It's like proof that I've matured,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.710
and it makes me so happy.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.710
I want to show it to Mom
and All Might as soon as possible!

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.270
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.950

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.050
Since we've got this chance,
do you want to do a joint practice sometime?

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.800
Yeah, that might be good.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.760
Hey! Hey!

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.180
Oh my, even Shiketsu's here.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.680
Todoroki, I'll see you at the special course!

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.100
But you know, honestly,
I still don't like you!

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.190
I'll apologize in advance!

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.690
Sorry!

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.650
That's all!

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.280
Was that supposed to be considerate?

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.600
I'll make the best of it, too.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.150
Merci...

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.770
He's someone who's both
bold and sensitive, isn't he?

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.210
Excuse me! U-Um...!

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.880
What kind of training do you
do to erase your presence?

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.680
We don't have any training like that...

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.840
But, um, the girl with big lips said...

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.510
And she seemed like she wanted to talk more,

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.810
so I was hoping to talk to her, but...

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.600
Big lips...?

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.890
Oh, Camie?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.400
She said she wasn't feeling well
and took a taxi to the station first.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.280
Oh, uh, I see...

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.610
I feel bad for not finishing
our conversation...

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.110
Now that you mention it, she's been
weird for the past three days or so.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.450
A little different from usual, I think...

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.750
You finally picked up!

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.040
Where are you, and what are you doing?

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.000
Toga!

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.460
I had the most wonderful fun.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.420
Don't slack off on your regular check-ins.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.920
If they catch one of us, we're all in danger.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.550
Don't worry.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.760
I've never been caught in my life.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.810
And I've got something to show for it.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.820
Tomura's gonna be happy.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.940
I got some of Izuku's blood!

By ingesting someone else's blood,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.090
she can transform to look like that person.

Tartarus"

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.410
The second semester is starting soon, right?

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.260
Or has it already started?

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.570
I thought you were going
to devote yourself to teaching...

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.750
What do you want from me?

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.880
I just want to make things clear...

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.570
All For One.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.010
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.020
"All For One"
"Quirk: All For One"
"He can steal the Quirks of others for himself or give them to others."

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.020
"Affiliation: Unknown"
"Birthday: Unknown"
"Height: Unknown" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Unknown"

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.020
"All Might (True Form)"
"Quirk: One For All"
"Smashes villains with a super power passed down from one generation to the next."

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.020
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class Teacher"
"Birthday: 6/10"
"Height: 220 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Yakushima Cedar"

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.650
This place is stifling, All Might.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.270
For example, if my back starts to itch,
and I scratch it with the back of the chair,

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.160
all the gun muzzles instantly point at me.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.740
In addition to my vital signs, even my brain
waves are constantly being monitored.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.380
One thought about activating my Quirk

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.810
and my life is in danger.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.720
I'm imprisoned deep underground,
covered by layers of security,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.800
with the thorough removal
of anything irregular.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.180
The world likens this place to
Greek mythology, calling it "Tartarus."

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.980
It is the name of the god that
represents the underworld.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.610
Even I would have some
trouble rebelling against a god.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.520
No, you can't get out.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.600
I'll let you think that.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.620
So, what do you want?

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.880
Where's Gran Torino?

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.370
You acting alone?

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.830
What's with that costume that looks
like you don't know when to give up?

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.850
Don't tell me you're still working as a hero?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.840
You've got a lot to say.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.260
Try to understand!

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.040
It's the first decent conversation
I've had in a while.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.300
Shigaraki...

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.350
Where is Tomura Shigaraki right now?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.520
I don't know.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.360
Unlike yours, he's already left the nest.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.900
What are you trying to achieve?

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.740
What did you want to do?

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.110
Preserving that body beyond
human reason to live on for a long time,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:08.660
devoting all of that time to exploiting,
controlling, and toying with people...

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.260
What did you hope to accomplish?

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.120
That's not a very productive topic.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.610
You wouldn't be satisfied
with my answer even if I told you.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.990
There will always be people
who can't understand each other.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.590
I'm the same, you know. The same as you.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.430
Just like you longed
to become a hero of justice,

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.430
I longed to be like an evil devil king.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.140
Isn't it simple?

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.650
I had an ideal and the power to give it form.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.490
If I could live forever in my ideal,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.150
then I wouldn't begrudge
the effort to make that happen.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.620
Then why do you need a successor?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.530
You're one to ask!

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.950
That's funny!

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.160
It's because you took everything from me!

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.750
Look at my body.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.920
I am just barely able to remain
alive with the help of this tube.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:06.430
After you appeared,
my seemingly infinite ideal became finite.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.890
When a person realizes the end is coming,
he passes his work on to someone else.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.270
That's true for anything--

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.270
the houses and buildings you see everywhere,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.350
the food you casually put in your mouth...

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.760
All of it developed as it was passed
from person to person.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.950
I'm just trying to do
what everyone else is doing.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.780
All Might, you have about three minutes left.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.790
Wait, don't say that.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.530
I want to talk... more...

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.840
I know, the world's probably
pretty shaken up by your retirement,

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.460
but how are things looking?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.550
He must be isolated from outside news.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.340
Please refrain from saying
anything carelessly.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.500
You heard him.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.720
That's too bad...

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.820
I'm sure... it's like this...

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.650
Right about now,
the media's unease by you being gone

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.820
coupled with their worry
about Endeavor as the new leader

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.690
is causing them to complain
about the unity of hero society as a whole.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.570
Meanwhile, sensing the growing instability,

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.740
those who do not listen to heroes,
in other words, the people of the shadows,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.770
have started to act.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.080
They think they might have
a chance to change society

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.330
and have started to move in an organized way.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.840
I think Tomura and his group
will continue to hide for a while...

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.810
...in order to be sure of which
organization will rise to the top.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.220
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.600
Everyone will want to
increase their influence,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.980
so there will likely be quite a bit of
fighting among the villains themselves.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.380
If the scenario I wrote functions properly,

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.480
then that's probably how it'll turn out.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.900
Supposing that does happen,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:52.620
then it would have all been because
of your fake form and your retirement.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.950
From now on, you will not be able
to save people as you wish to.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.790
All you can do is look on at the villains
you yourself caused to increase

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:06.870
and be stricken by your powerlessness
as you pass the rest of your days.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.360
But won't you tell me...

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.160
...how you feel?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.600
All Might, please stand back.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.850
When their feelings are guessed correctly,
people often get angry.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.860
Too bad, you can't punch me in here.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.320
Don't think that you alone know everything.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.290
I kept thinking about
what you would hate the most.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.500
I understand very well
what you were thinking.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.340
To have my master's blood
relation, Shigaraki,

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.590
kill me, or kill me and Young Midoriya...

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.820
That was what you plotted, right?

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.590
And?

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.430
You're not looking at him
as a villain anymore.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.930
You will definitely hesitate.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.010
No matter who he's related
to, he is a criminal.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.720
I will not die.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.780
I will not let Shigaraki kill me.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.760
I can't be killed!

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.260
I won't let the future
you imagine come to pass!

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.200
You said you came to make things clear...

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.290
Did you come to say that?

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.290
All Might, it's time.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.250
Please exit.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.180
I will smash your future to pieces.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.820
As many times as it takes.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.860
You're the one who will look on
as you pass the rest of your days here.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.000
The rest of my days, huh?

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.730
Excuse me.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.280
"Young Midoriya"
"I was able to take another
step forward thanks to you!!!!!"

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.780
Young Midoriya!

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.580
We've got regular classes
starting tomorrow, huh?

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.920
There is no rest for heroes.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.460
But man, a lot sure has happened!

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.840
I will never forget this summer
for the rest of my life.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.170
--Oh, what a cutie.
--I wonder if All Might got my message!

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.340
--So cute!
--I wonder if All Might got my message!

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.510
Hey, go out front later.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.520
Let's have a talk about your Quirk.

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:27.130
Kac... chan...

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:41.700
Kacchan...

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.200
How far are we going?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.440
We shouldn't be walking around
in the middle of the night like this.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.480
Hey...

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.720
You're so lucky, Kacchan.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.090
Your Quirk's so cool!

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.090
I hope I get mine soon, too.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.930
No matter what Quirk you get,
you'll never beat me.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.810
This is... Ground Beta...

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.150
This is the place where
we had our first combat training,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.190
where I fought and lost to you.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.820
You've always made me sick.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.420
I could tell, somehow...

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.700
You were Quirkless and useless,

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.460
so how'd you get into U.A.,

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.710
and how'd you get a Quirk?

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:35.760
My Quirk is something
I received from someone else.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.030
One day, I will make this Quirk my own

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.010
and beat you with my own power!

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.850
I didn't understand this guy that
said some stuff that made no sense

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.300
and then looked satisfied with himself and

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.940
just kept on climbing
up, higher and higher...

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.200
Ever since the sludge villain...

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.130
No, since All Might came to town...

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.830
Higher and higher...
until finally for the provisional license,

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.870
you passed, but I failed.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.080
What the hell? Huh?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.630
That's not a matter of ability, but--

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.500
Shut up and listen, damn scum!

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:15.960
Sorry...

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.970
You've always made me sick and pissed me off.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.880
But that thing in Kamino
helped me understand, kind of.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.190
You've made what you borrowed your own, huh?

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.730
Here it comes.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.480
I've been thinking about it this whole time.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.110
You got it from All Might, didn't you?

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.360
Your power.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.910
The boss villain,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.500
apparently he could steal people's
Quirks and give them to other people.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.910
It's hard to believe,

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.210
but one of those old cat ladies
lost her Quirk and can't work anymore.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.300
After you met All Might, you changed,

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.720
and then All Might lost his power.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.890
What All Might said
after he beat the boss villain...

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.270
Next, it's your turn.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:15.020
Back then, you were the
only one who took it differently.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.650
Thinking about how those
Nomu scum had multiple Quirks,

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.490
it seems pretty credible.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.490
Besides...

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.490
You've gotten weaker, All Might.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.830
This time, I will throw
you in prison for sure!

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.540
...All Might and that
boss bastard knew each other.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.630
Quirks could move from one person to another,

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.460
and All Might knew the guy who could do it,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.550
so it all connected to what you said
about receiving your Quirk from someone.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.310
I asked All Might about it.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.690
But he wouldn't answer me.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.310
That's why I'm asking you.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.990
Fortunately, Young Bakugo
did not seem to take it seriously,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.110
so I'll let it go this time.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.870
But please don't do it again.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.380
Since you're not denying it, it must be true.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.910
Damn it...

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.300
When he said he wanted
to talk about my Quirk, I knew.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.490
It was the price I paid for not
following All Might's instructions.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.510
What're you going to do with the answer?

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.390
You and I both wanted to be like All Might.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.730
Right... That's how it was...

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.730
Someone I'd always thought was just a pebble

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.090
was acknowledged by the person
I admired without me realizing it...

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.110
That's why...

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.820
Let's fight.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.570
Right here, right now.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.040
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.550
The number one hero, All Might.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.920
The person Kacchan and I
have admired since we were young.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.010
We both admired him the same.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.760
That's why there might not
be any meaning in this fight.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.890
There might not be any
meaning in winning or losing.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.310
Even so, I thought that
I had to go through with it.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.720
Next time, "Deku vs. Kacchan, Part 2."

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.850
Right now, I'm the only one
who can accept Kacchan's feelings!

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.620
"Next time: Deku vs. Kacchan, Part 2"

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.550
Go beyond!

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.290
Plus Ultra!
