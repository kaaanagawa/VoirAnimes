WEBVTT

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.190
The prestigious school that turned out
many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.290
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.200
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.530
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.380
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.510
Kacchan and Todoroki started
second in the test of courage.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.510
If they haven't moved from there,
then they shouldn't be far.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.940
Sh-Shoji?!

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.190
Those injuries...

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.700
You shouldn't be moving anymore, should you?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.740
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.990
You're only thinking
about saving your friend...

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.950
What are we going to do with you?

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.870
That just now...

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.950
D-Don't tell me...

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.210
Yeah.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.090
If we want to get through here,
we'll have to do something about this first...

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.300
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.340
Get away... from me...!

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.430
You'll die!

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.430
T-Tokoyami!

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.020
"Roaring Upheaval"

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.100
Wh-What's going on, Shoji?!

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.270
Quiet.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.690
After Mandalay's Telepath about
the villain attack telling us not to engage,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.690
we went on alert immediately.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.860
Right after that, we were attacked by a villain.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.160
Shoji!

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.410
I covered Tokoyami, hiding in
the foliage even as my arm got cut off.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.710
Your arm...?!

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.920
Even though it's not a shallow cut,
it's not like I've lost it forever.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.970
My Dupli-Arms can even
duplicate my duplicated organs,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.420
and what was cut off was a duplicate.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.550
But I guess he couldn't even stand that.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.520
The Quirk he had been holding
back started getting out of control...

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.810
In deep darkness, he can't control it...

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.530
I didn't realize his Quirk was so peaky...

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.950
It was probably his emotions,
like righteous indignation and regret

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.160
that made it even more wild.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.200
He kept trying to hold it back, but...

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.290
It reacted to any movement or sound,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.460
turning into a monster that was just
lashing out with attacks indiscriminately.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.590
Forget... about me...

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.420
Find the others...

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.670
...and help them!

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.640
Calm down, Dark Shadow!

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Dark Shadow's weakness is light.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.390
If we lead it to the fire or
back to camp, it should calm down.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.020
Midoriya, no matter the circumstance,

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.860
I don't want to become a person
who leaves a suffering friend behind.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.210
You forced that body to get you here
because you were worried about Bakugo, right?

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.450
If you think you can still move,

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.870
I'll draw Dark Shadow away
and open up a path for you.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.160
Wait...

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
It's pretty far to either camp or the fire.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.750
Then, you'll be in dange--

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.840
I know.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.210
The act of saving people comes with risks.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.590
That's why heroes are called heroes.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.060
Will you stay with me and help Tokoyami,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.470
or will you rush to where Bakugo is...?

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.490
Which will you choose, Midoriya?

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.110
Sorry, Shoji...

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.280
"Villain - Moonfish - Quirk: Blade-Tooth"

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.650
Flesh... Piece of meat...

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.370
Flesh...

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.870
I can't get near him, damn it!

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.430
The only thing I can do is
blast him with everything I've got...

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.380
You can't!

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.790
If the trees burn, just cover
them with ice right after!

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.550
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.300
The blast will impair my vision, too!

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.470
What'll happen if I can't stop all of it?

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.060
Our opponent has the advantage
in both number of moves and distance!

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.220
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.980
There! I can see ice!

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.440
They're in the middle of a fight!

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.940
Huh?

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.520
Bakugo! Todoroki!

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.900
One of you, please--

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.030
Make some light!

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.820
Flesh...

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.330
Sorry, Shoji,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.420
I want to keep going, but I have an idea.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.210
What is it?

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.460
If it'll react to just sound,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.360
then make duplicates
of your arms to use as bait

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.260
"whoo whoo"

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.570
and make it follow without attacking us.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.640
But we'll lead it to Kacchan.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.850
He can calm Dark Shadow
down with an explosion.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.060
If I have to choose one or the other...

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.150
...I want to save both of them!

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.600
Kacchan!

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.320
Shoji and Midoriya?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.190
And...

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.510
...Tokoyami?!

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.360
Hurry up and make light!

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.450
Tokoyami's out of control!

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.830
Indiscriminate attacks, huh?

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.830
All right, I'll use my flames...

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.830
Wait, idiot.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.080
Flesh... Piece of meat....

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.380
It's no good... I can't allow it...

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.840
I'm the only one who's allowed
to look at a cross-section of those kids...

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.550
Don't steal them from me...!

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.300
Don't beg.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.220
Small fry!

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.560
Look...

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.080
I haven't had enough fun yet!

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.180
I'm a bad match-up for you.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.300
Sorry... Thanks for saving me...

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.390
In an instant, the opponent we were
barely able to defend against was...

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.690
Tokoyami, are you all right?

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.270
You did a good job doing what we asked.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.690
Tokoyami! Don't fight it!

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.320
Surrender yourself to Dark Shadow!

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.230
Sorry, Shoji...

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.960
You, too, Midoriya...

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.380
I was too immature...

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.920
I let my anger take over
and released Dark Shadow...

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.540
The influence of the darkness and my anger

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.760
spurred on that guy...

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:15.360
In the end, it got so strong that I couldn't
hold it back and ended up hurting Shoji.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.890
We can leave that for later.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.860
That's what you would say, right?

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.980
Oh, right!

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.030
We confirmed that one of
the villains' targets is Kacchan.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.780
Bakugo?

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.070
Are they trying to kill him? Why?

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.660
I don't know.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.530
Anyway,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.690
I think the camp is the safest place

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.000
since there are two pros, Vlad King and Mr. Aizawa, there.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.500
I see. So now our mission is
to escort Bakugo there, huh?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.380
But at the clearing,
the Pussycats are still fighting.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.930
Going back on the path would bring us to
the attention of the villains, and we'd lose time.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.260
We should cut straight across.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.300
We don't know how many villains there are.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.270
We might come across one suddenly.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.430
We can use Shoji's search ability.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.100
And we have Todoroki's freezing,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.190
and if Tokoyami's okay with it, an invincible
Dark Shadow with built-in controls...

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.100
Honestly, with this group,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.040
we could probably even go up against All Might.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.330
What's with you guys?!

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.700
You walk in the middle.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.580
Don't protect me, you scum!

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.250
Let's go!

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.290
Don't ignore me!

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.590
Make sure you keep up.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.250
Don't tell me what to do!

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.510
Get everyone back safely.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.200
If we do that, then we win...

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.980
"Ochaco Uraraka"
"Quirk: Zero Gravity"
"She can make people and things weightless with the pads on the tips of her fingers."

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 12/27"
"Height: 156 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Japanese Food"

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.980
"Tsuyu Asui"
"Quirk: Frog"
"She can do pretty much everything a frog can, like stretch out her tongue really far."

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 2/12"
"Height: 150 cm" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Jello"

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.940
"5 Minutes Earlier"

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.190
Ochaco, is your arm okay?

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.950
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.710
Yeah, it just grazed me.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.580
Shallow... Not much blood...

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.580
"Villain - Himiko Toga"

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.710
That's mean, suddenly coming out slashing at us!

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:07.920
Who are you?

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.670
I'm Toga!

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.710
You two sure are cute.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.710
Uraraka and... Asui...

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.420
She knows our names.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.340
Maybe from the sports festival?

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.350
In any case, she knows who we are,
which means we're at a disadvantage.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.180
There's not enough blood.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.940
Normally, I'd suck it out
directly from the cut to get more,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.650
but this machine will
start sucking if I just stick it in,

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.980
so my work will progress very quickly.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.950
I'm sticking it in.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.450
She's coming!

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.280
Ochaco!

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.160
Run back to camp!

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.760
We were give permission to use our Quirks not to defeat

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.910
the villains but to protect ourselves!

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.170
That's the kind of person Mr. Aizawa is.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.460
Tsu, you too!

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.090
Of course, I will also--

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.800
"Tsu"...

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.760
"Tsu"... "Tsu"...!

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.800
Ribbit...

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.310
What a cute nickname.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.890
I'm gonna call you that, too.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:07.890
Don't.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.850
The only people I want calling me
that are the ones I want to be friends with.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.780
Yay, then I'm your friend, too! All right!

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.690
Tsu!

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.950
You're bleeding, my friend, Tsu.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:26.410
You're so cute. I love blood.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.790
Get away from her!

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.710
Against someone with a knife,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.500
pivot on one foot to disappear
from your opponent's line of sight

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.210
and grab the wrist and base of the neck.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.170
Then, with all your might, pull!

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.010
And push down!

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.550
It's the close combat technique
I learned during my internship!

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.530
Gunhead Martial Arts!

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.480
That was amazing, Ochaco!

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.600
Tsu, can you restrain
her hands with your tongue?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.060
Does it hurt?

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.440
Give me a second for my tongue.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.610
Ochaco...

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.940
You're wonderful, too.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.720
You've got the same smell as me.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
There's someone you like, right?

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:14.060
And you feel like you want
to be like that person, right?

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.250
I'll win! I'll win and be like Deku, too!

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.010
I can tell.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.630
'Cause you're a maiden like me.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.550
What... is with her...?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.180
You want to be the same
as the person you like, right?

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.200
It's only natural, right?

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.730
You end up wearing the same things and stuff...

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.820
But eventually, not even that's enough...

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.040
You end up wanting
to become that person, right?

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.110
It can't be helped, right?

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.320
What kind of person do you like?

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.460
I love people who are
beat up and smell like blood!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.980
That's why in the end, I always cut them up!

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.130
Hey, Ochaco, you're having fun, right?

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.050
It's fun talking about our crushes, right?

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.050
Ochaco!

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.970
Suck, suck... Suck, suck...

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.470
Suck, suck...

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.140
Suck, suck... Suck, suck...

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.600
Uraraka?!

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.560
Shoji! Everyone!

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.110
Shoot...!

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.990
There are more people now
and I don't want to be killed,

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.510
so bye-bye.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.160
--Wai--
--It's too dangerous!

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.590
We don't even know what kind of Quirk she has.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.170
Who was that woman just now?

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.340
A villain. A crazy one.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.880
Uraraka, you're injured!

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.380
It's fine. I can still totally walk.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.160
Anyway, you're the one that--

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.010
This isn't the time to stand around and talk.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:47.890
Let's go, quickly.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.550
Anyway, I'm just glad you're okay.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.100
I know! Come with us!

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.060
Right now, we're protecting
Kacchan as we head back to camp.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.140
Ribbit?

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.560
You're protecting Bakugo?

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.360
Where is Bakugo?

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.280
Huh?!

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.610
What are you saying?

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.560
Kacchan is right behind...

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.310
During this emergency,

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.890
no one let their guard down.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.450
But...

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.410
The boy you're talking about...

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.920
I took him with my magic.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.300
This talent isn't someone
who should be on the hero side.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.510
We'll take him to a stage
where he can shine more.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.510
"Villain - Mr. Compress"

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.340
Give him back!

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.050
"Give him back"?

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.760
That's a strange thing to say.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.020
Bakugo doesn't belong to anyone.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.770
He's his own person, you egoist.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.150
Give him back!

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.760
Move!

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.980
We simply want to show him that

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.860
the path he's on now with its fanatical
values is not the only path he can take.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.410
Kids these days are made to choose
their paths based on their values.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.080
It's not just Bakugo!
Tokoyami's not here, either!

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.130
He snatched the two in the back noiselessly?

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.800
What kind of Quirk does he have?

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.630
To go out of your way to talk to us...

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.760
You're underestimating us.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.260
I was originally an entertainer, you know.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.300
It's a bad habit of mine.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.810
Taking Tokoyami was
an improvisation on my part.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.940
Moonfish... The man with "Blade-Tooth"...

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:25.070
He may not look it, but he's a cutthroat on
death row whose appeal was dismissed.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.650
With a violent nature that trampled
that cutthroat down one-sidedly,

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.660
I decided that he was good, too.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.240
You bastard! Don't take them!

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240
Midoriya! Calm down!

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.740
Uraraka, take this guy.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.120
Right!

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:49.260
Sorry, tricks and running away
are my only redeeming features!

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.260
There's no way I'd fight students
who are hero candidates.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.720
Vanguard Action Squad!

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.680
Target successfully collected!

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.480
It was just a short while, but with this,
our show has come to a close!

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.770
As arranged, head to the
retrieval point in the next five minutes!

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.440
"Come to a close"...?

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.270
No!

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.650
I won't let you!

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.070
I won't let you get away!

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.410
Hey, Dabi! Did you hear the radio?

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.870
I'm so pumped!

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.790
Mr. Compress already succeeded!

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.500
Took him long enough!

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.080
I was getting sleepy!

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.830
"Villain - Dabi"

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.500
Don't say that.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.290
He did a good job.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.170
Now, we just have to wait
for everyone to get back here.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.130
"Villain - Twice"

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.250
That's not right!

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.130
You're right.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.120
This place was supposed to be hard
to find because of the wall of flames and gas,

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.510
but the gas was cleared away.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.520
Things never go according to plan, huh?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.640
You're right!

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.730
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.730
Things are going as planned!

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.440
Aoyama, I must go help
the students from Class B.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.110
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.820
Please carry these
two back to camp!

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.270
The gas dispersed...

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.750
Someone defeated the villain...!

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.380
They're fighting!

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.030
I...

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.490
I need to...

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.250
Our eyes met?!

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.670
Hey, Dabi!

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.340
Speaking of which,
this has nothing to do with anything,

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.350
but is it okay not to call the "Nomu" guy?

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.350
You said it'd only react to
your voice or something, right?

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.850
It's very important!

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.810
Oh, yeah.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.520
You asked me why I didn't
add it to the battle, right?

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.360
Be grateful! Bow before me!

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.280
A monster specifically for me, from Shigaraki...

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.750
It's probably killed at least one person by now.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.700
This is bad! This is really bad!

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.370
This guy's really bad news!

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.540
Yaoyorozu, are you alive?!

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.330
Hey! Please, run!

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.540
"Yosetsu Awase - Quirk: Weld"

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.880
It's gonna catch up!

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.960
I'm sorry...

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.420
Awase...!

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.720
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.550
I'm... I'm fine...!

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.530
When I came to, I was on the ground.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.300
I had no idea what had happened to me...

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.720
Crap! Damn it!

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:03.810
What the--?!

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.390
What's that?!

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.810
What is that?!

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.780
What...?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.380
Why is it leaving...?

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.400
Does this mean it has done its job...?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.760
Then, don't tell me...

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.420
Bakugo!

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.670
Use your judgment...

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.370
What would be the worst-case scenario, Momo?

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.340
And what's the best thing you can do right now?

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.800
Awase, use your Quirk to attach this...

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.470
...to that!

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.810
What is this? A button?

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.230
Just hurry up and do it!

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.430
It'll get away!

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.370
I don't know what's going on, but...!

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.190
I attached it, like you asked!

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.150
Thanks, Awase.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.360
Ah, that was too scary...

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.780
Let's get away!

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.950
Right.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.240
"Villain - Magne"

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.410
Hey, Spinner, this is your fault!

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.950
Shut up!

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:11.630
If you're going to blame someone,
blame yourself for doing evil!

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.630
"Pro Hero - Tiger - Quirk: Pliabody"

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.130
"Pro Hero - Mandalay - Quirk: Telepath"

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.590
That's how it is, Spinner, you villain.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.050
"Villain - Spinner"

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.460
Hey, let go, you harlot!

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.090
Damn it, Stain will live again!

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.140
You hear? His will, it'll live again right here!

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.930
Through me!

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:30.310
I have to purge you degenerate
heroes and that glasses kid!

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.440
What're you talking about?

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.400
At any rate, you didn't show us
your Quirk at all, did you?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.820
Shut up! Get off!

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.440
Yes...

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.450
Let's have the two of you...

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.820
"Villain - Kurogiri - Quirk: Warp Gate"

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.300
...move out of the way.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.910
Damn it, that mask guy's fast!

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.290
If only Iida were here...

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.710
The hero course students are not
as big of a deal as I thought they'd be.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.630
Damn it!

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.840
We can't... give up...

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.260
We have to catch up...
and get them back!

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.550
But at this rate,
he's just getting farther away!

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.180
Uraraka, make us float!

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.620
And then Asui, throw us
as far as you can with your tongue!

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.270
Ribbit?

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.110
Shoji, use your arms to correct
our trajectory and pull us!

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.650
Uraraka, measure the distance with your eyes

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.660
and release your Quirk
when the time looks about right!

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.740
I see. A human bullet, huh?

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.830
Wait, Deku! You're still going
to move with those injuries?

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.620
It's true that it wouldn't be strange for
this guy to lose consciousness at any moment...

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.380
Midoriya, you stay here.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.840
With that pain, you're in no state to--

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.840
I don't feel any pain right now...

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.260
I can move...

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.800
Hurry!

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.760
Deku, at least let me do this...!

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.060
Okay, Tsu.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.980
Make sure you save those two.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.820
Ribbit!

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.860
Huh? No one else is here yet?

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.240
You lunatic, did you get the blood?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.580
How many people's worth?

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.790
One person's worth!

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.000
Just one?!

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.580
Weren't you told to get at least three?!

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.290
It couldn't be helped.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.250
I thought I was going to be killed.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.050
Anyway--

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.380
Toga, aren't you a little too happy?

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.630
Was there anything to make you depressed?

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.430
I made some friends
and found a boy I'm interested in.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.720
You mean me?!

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.930
Sorry, can't!

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.060
I like you, too!

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.270
You're too loud. Shut up...

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.450
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.340
I know these kids!

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.000
Who are they?!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.000
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.920
Todoroki, Shoji! Let's make sure
we save Kacchan and Tokoyami!

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.880
We'll use everything
we learned up until now at U.A.!

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.920
Next time, "What a Twist!"

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:36.560
"Next time: What a Twist!"

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.170
Go beyond!

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.210
Plus Ultra!
