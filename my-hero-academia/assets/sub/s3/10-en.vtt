00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.250
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.840
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.180
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.680
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.230
--Smash!
--Come, it's time for our counterattack!

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.860
Let's overturn this flow of events, heroes!

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.450
"Pro Hero - Gran Torino - Quirk: Jet"
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"
"Pro Hero - Kamui Woods - Quirk: Arbor"

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.990
Where is he right now?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.450
Shigaraki!

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.870
I hate you!

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.830
"Villain - Tomura Shigaraki - Quirk: Decay"

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.960
Nomus?!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.670
They came from nowhere!

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.500
What is that?!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.010
They just keep coming!

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.510
What the--?!

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.430
Young Bakugo!

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.010
Noooo!

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.640
Endeavor, we need backup!

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.060
What?!

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.520
Toshinori, these guys...

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.940
They shouldn't have been able to warp...

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.820
They're dealing with this too quickly...!

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.450
Don't tell me they're going to use this...?!

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.740
It's fine now. I'm here for you.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.250
Master...

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.710
Oh, no!

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.040
Everyone's going to be taken away!

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.750
Damn it!

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.180
Take me with you, Shigaraki!

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.430
I-I'm sorry, everyone!

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.770
It wasn't your fault!

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.730
We were also unable to do anything!

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.570
We thought Kurogiri's Warp
was more like teleportation

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.610
"Pro Hero - Edgeshot - Quirk: Foldabody"

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.360
rather than one that opened a path in space.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.660
All Might!

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.490
Oklahoma Smash!

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.000
That was an energetic way of breaking things!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.210
I can't help it! Focus on the villains!

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.630
You monsters...

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.050
"Pro Hero - Endeavor - Quirk: Hellflame"

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.430
These guys...

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.930
Did they come from over there?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.010
"Police Officer - Naomasa Tsukauchi"

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.800
I can't get a hold of Jeanist and the others!

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.470
It's possible that we failed
on the Nomu factory side!

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.390
What a mess!

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.350
Endeavor!

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.890
Huh?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.690
Are you all right?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.030
What're you looking at
to ask a question like that?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.650
Even though you're at the top,
will you need bifocals soon?

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.450
If you're gonna go, then hurry up and go!

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.540
Yeah. I'll leave it to you.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.580
"Symbol of Peace"

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.340
"Pro Hero - Mt. Lady - Quirk: Gigantification"

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.210

"Pro Hero - Tiger - Quirk: Pliabody"

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.600
As expected of the number
four hero, Best Jeanist.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.890
"Pro Hero - Best Jeanist - Quirk: Fiber Master"

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.110
I thought I'd blown everyone away.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.530
To be able to manipulate everyone's clothes
and pull them to the side in an instant--

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.240
That quick decision-making... and skill...

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.120
You must have nerves of steel.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.160
This man...

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.580
The League likely...
no, definitely has a brain behind it.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.290
And his strength is comparable to All Might's.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.000
Despite that, he's crafty and cautious.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.430
If he doesn't feel like his safety is
guaranteed, he will not show himself.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.640
This time, I'd like to take care of Shigaraki
and the others' capture and arrest

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.350
as quickly as possible.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.850
This isn't what I was told...

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.650
But so what...?

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.360
A top hero...

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360
...doesn't use that as an excuse for failure--

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.990
I see...

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.870
This is strength from a huge amount
of practice and practical experience.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.960
I don't need yours...

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.010
It's a Quirk that doesn't go
with Tomura's disposition.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.630
"Villain - All For One - Quirk: All For One"

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.130
What's with this guy?

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.590
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.890
What just happened?

"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.180
He erased them all in an instant!

"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"       "Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.930
We must run...!

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.730
I know this, but...

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.350
I'm so scared, my body...

"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.060
...my body...

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.150
...won't move...

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.700
What... in the world... was that...?!

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.870
Damn it...

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.490
...the hell...?!

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.500
Kacchan!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.910
Bakugo!

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.040
Sorry, Bakugo.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.090
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.840
Huh?!

"Villain - Spinner"

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.010
"Villain - Himiko Toga"

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.970
What the--?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.140
Something stinks!

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.010
"Villain - Twice"

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.050
Smells good!

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.760
Master...

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.480
You failed again, huh, Tomura?

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.060
But do not be discouraged.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.150
Just try again.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.820
I have brought your associates back as well.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.650
Even this child.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.280
Because you judged that
he was an important piece.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.250
Do it over as many times as you need to.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.000
That is why I am here.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.790
It's all for you.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.720
Remember!

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.060
Why did you come here?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.060
It's because your body wouldn't move
back then, so you couldn't save him, right?

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.600
To say you can't move because you're scared...

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.070
He's right in front of you, you know.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.990
He shouldn't have noticed us yet.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.030
If he had, he wouldn't have spoken so freely.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.450
There are six or seven meters
between us and Kacchan, huh?

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.540
With Full Cowl, I can get there
in less than a second.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.790
After that, can I get away? Where would I go?

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.210
Everyone else will be in danger.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:48.420
How can I... I need a plan... so everyone...

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.550
Anyway, I need to move!

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.390
If I can't move here...

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.470
...then it's all--

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.730
I will...

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.020
I will...

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.020
...protect you!

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.820
Think!

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.740
Think!

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.320
How can we...

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.320
...get away from here!

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.950
You're here, after all, aren't you...?

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.420
I'll have you return everything,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.130
All For One!

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.930
Will you kill me again, All Might?

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.950
"All Might"
"Quirk: One For All"
"Smashes villains with a super power
 passed down from one generation to the next."

"Height: Unknown" "Blood Type: B" "Likes: Unknown"

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.690
I'll have you return everything,

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.360
All For One!

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.990
Will you kill me again, All Might?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.580
E-Even All Might...!

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.630
You're pretty late.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.090
It's a little more than
five kilometers from the bar to here.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:20.810
It was easily thirty seconds after
I sent the Nomus before you arrived.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.810
You've gotten weaker, All Might.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:29.190
What about you? What's with
that industrial mask you've got on?

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.530
Aren't you overexerting yourself?

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.360
He held All Might back with his bare hands!

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.490
This guy's the villains' boss!

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.790
I won't make the same mistake
as I did six years ago,

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.540
All For One!

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.500
I will take Young Bakugo back!

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.210
And this time,
I will throw you in prison for sure!

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.260
And all of the League of Villains
you control with you!

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.590
There's so much to do. It'll be tough...

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.680
...for both of us.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.690
Air Cannon plus Springlike Limbs,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.360
Kinetic Booster times four,
Strength Enhancer times three.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.070
This combination is fun.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.830
Maybe I'll try to add a
few more enhancer-types.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.790
All Might!

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.960
Even without your worry,
he won't die from something like that.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.720
So run away from here, Tomura,
and take that child with you.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.850
"Villain - Kurogiri - Quirk: Warp Gate"

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.220
Kurogiri, get everyone away from here.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.390
Hey, wait! He was defeated
and is now unconscious!

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.270
"Villain - Magne"

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.640
I'm not sure what's going on, but if you
can use Warp, then you should get us away!

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.650
I just got mine, Magne.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.320
On top of only being able
to transport short distances,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:02.820
unlike his coordinate transport,
I can only bring people to me or away from me,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:09.750
and I can only send them away
to someone I am very familiar with.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.330
So I'll have Kurogiri do it.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.340
Forcible Quirk Activation!

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.550
Now, go!

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.380
What about you...?

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.390
Think constantly, Tomura.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.980
You still have much more room to grow!

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.610
I won't let you get away!

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.650
Master...

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.030
Let's go, Shigaraki!

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.660
While that pipe mask is holding All Might back!

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.620
"Villain - Mr. Compress"

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.580
Get your piece!

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.500
What a pain...!

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.080
Young Bakugo!

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.250
All Might!

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.470
All For One's in the way,
so he can't save Kacchan!

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.890
The League is trying to escape
in that opening with Kacchan!

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.140
Kacchan's also surrounded
and can't run himself!

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.310
These guys are in crisis mode, too!

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.020
Unlike earlier, they'll drag me
with them even if it's by force.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.860
Six against one...

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.450
Anyway, I can't let that
damn mask lay a finger on me!

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.240
I'm going now!

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.820
I won't let you.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.700
That's why I'm here!

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.710
All Might and Kacchan are in such trouble...

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.170
But...

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.590
For uncertified individuals
to cause injury with their Quirks

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.180
without specific instruction
from their guardians or supervisors

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.220
is a clear violation of the rules.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.010
I'm frustrated, too.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.020
But, this isn't a situation
where we should act on our emotions.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.060
...if you'll break the rules...

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.860
Those acts are the same as those of villains.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.860
Why did it have to be you guys of all people?!

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.110
Why are you trying
to make the same mistake I did?!

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.160
"Nezu" "Eraser Head" "Vlad King"

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.240
We are...

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.450
We are not allowed to fight!

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.580
At least... where is there an opening?

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.000
Just an instant is enough!

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.880
Is there any way we can save Kacchan?

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.170
If we save Kacchan, then All Might
can use his power to the fullest!

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.180
Where?

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.390
Where is that route...?

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.180
Where?

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.560
No.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.140
This won't work.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.640
There has to be one...

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.570
An opening!

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.190
Iida, everyone!

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.110
You can't, Midoriya!

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.530
No, there's a way!

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.620
A way that won't involve fighting
that will let us leave this place,

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.950
but still save Kacchan!

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.920
Let's hear it.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.920
But this plan also depends on Kacchan...

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.470
Don't come, Deku!

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:11.970
I think Bakugo will feel humiliated
that he had to be saved by everyone...

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.180
I don't think my plan will succeed if I do it.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.230
That's why, Kirishima, you're
the key to increasing the success rate!

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.360
Give us more details, Midoriya.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.030
Right.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.990
This is my plan.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.200
Are you saving your strength?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.830
To keep the boy from
getting caught up in this?

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.340
It's rough, isn't it?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.710
To be these creatures called "heroes."

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.970
Young Bakugo...!

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.930
It's hard for All Might
to fight because I'm here!

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.390
Damn it!

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.140
That's your plan?

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.900
Kacchan should also realize
the situation All Might is in.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.150
Yeah.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.780
Kacchan's on guard against
the enemy, fighting from a distance.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.400
We need to do this at a time when Kacchan
is a certain distance away from the enemy.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.070
Iida...

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:17.120
It's a gamble, but considering the situation,
there isn't much risk to us.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.710
More importantly, if we succeed,
it'll change the tide of the fight for the better.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.840
Let's do it.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.550
This is my plan.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:35.720
First, we'll propel ourselves
with my Quirk and Iida's Recipro.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.890
Then, with Kirishima's Hardening...

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.310
...we'll break through the wall!

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:47.690
The second it opens up, I want
Todoroki to make a path of ice for us--

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.650
One that'll go as high as possible.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.240
The villains haven't noticed us yet!

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.450
The villains have outmaneuvered us until now,

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.450
but now we're in a position to outmaneuver them.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.460
And we'll cross the battlefield
at a height they can't reach.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.670
The villains' boss is holding All Might back.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.800
That means that the reverse is also true!

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.100
So then, it's up to you, Kirishima.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.640
It's no good if I do it.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.930
Or Todoroki, or Iida, or Yaoyorozu...

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.860
Ever since school started,
you built an equal relationship with Kacchan...

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.270
If you, his friend, called him...

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.820
Come!

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.490
...then I'm sure!

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.210
You stupid or something?

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.040
What?!

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.880
Bakugo, on my mark, create a blast--

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.550
You match my mark!

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.800
Don't fight at a time like this!

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.430
Just as we thought!
Their eyes are locked on them.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.600
This is our chance. Let's go!

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.600
Right!

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.640
You show up everywhere!

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.230
Seriously?

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.270
Jeez!

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.190
Don't let them get away!

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.270
Where are the long distance fighters?

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.690
Dabi and Kurogiri! They're both down!

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.190
You two, get close!

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.990
"Magne - Quirk: Magnetism"

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.280
Magne. Quirk: Magnetism!

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.410
It's the ability to give a magnetic force
to anyone within a 4.5-meter radius!

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.540
It's possible to adjust to whether it's
on the whole body or just a body part!

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.410
Men become south poles
and women become north poles!

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.170
You can't make yourself magnetic, though!

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.880
Here I go!

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.670
Repulsion Breakup...

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.170
Moonlight Flit Cannon!

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.470
Titan Cliff!

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.680
Mt. Lady!

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.390
Prioritize... the rescue...!

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.020
Go... stupid kids...!

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.810
We can still make it!

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.850
Let's do it agai--

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.860
Gran Torino!

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.030
You're too slow!

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.820
You're too fast!

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.240
Hey, that Midoriya's really turning
out to be more and more like you.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.870
In a bad way!

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.620
After that experience at Hosu,
I didn't think he would come to the battlefield.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.290
Teenagers...!

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.880
Shimura's friend, huh?

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.260
It's shameful, but with this,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.180
I can defeat you without reserve!

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.220
All For One!

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.060
We've got two left here, too!

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.520
I'll end this!

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.110
Tomura, I don't want this to end!

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.570
They got us.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.070
They neatly turned
the tables on us in one move.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.820
Forcible Quirk Activation!

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.570
Magnetism!

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.200
Turn to dust!

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.750
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?!

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.790
Wait, if you come at me that fast...!

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.840
Wait, don't, Master!

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.380
I won't let you escape!

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.510
With that body, you'll...

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.140
No!

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.900
No one came to save you, huh?

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.860
It must've been hard, huh, Tenko Shimura?

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.650
It's fine. I'm here for you.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.200
I'm... not...

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.790
Tomura...

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.420
You must keep fighting.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.420
"Warping"...

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.510
Plus "Shock Inversion"!

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.180
I-I'm sorry!

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.970
I only came to save Tomura,

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.150
but if you say you're
going to fight, then I will, too.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:20:00.650
In the past, that fist crushed
one after another of my comrades,

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:05.530
and you were extolled as the Symbol of Peace.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:10.450
The view you had from atop our sacrifices...

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.870
It must have been a great one.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.670
Detroit...

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.720
...Smash!

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.190
He forcibly negated it, huh?

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.230
I won't let you fight without reserve, though.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:42.400
Heroes have a lot of things
they need to protect, don't they?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.530
Shut up...

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.240
You always toy with people like that!

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.580
You break them! Steal from them!

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.830
Take advantage of them and control them!

00:20:54.830 --> 00:21:01.920
Scoffing irrationally at the people
just trying to live their lives!

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.970
I cannot...

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.470
Oh no... time for Warping...

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.640
...forgive that!

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.900
Toshinori...

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.820
You've reached your limit...!

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.370
What's wrong?

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.580
You seem to be very worked up
about something, All Might.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.500
I heard the same line before...

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:45.130
from the previous One For All successor...

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.840
Nana Shimura.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.980
"Preview"

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.850
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.940
The secret All Might was
hiding has been brought to light.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.820
Even so, he continues
to fight against great evil.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.820
Next time, "One For All."

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.990
"Next time: One For All"

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.070
Go beyond!

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.530
Plus Ultra!
