WEBVTT

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.190
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.370
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.150
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.430
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.050
Young Midoriya, I...

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.050
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.750
...am effectively retired.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.300
My body cannot fight anymore.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.310
The last embers of One For All have gone out,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.980
and I can't really keep
my muscle form anymore.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.240
But even so, every single time,
you rush out no matter what I tell you!

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.860
No matter how many times I tell you,
you keep destroying your body!

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.450
That's why, this time...!

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.910
...when you got out of a predicament
for the first time without getting injured,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.430
I was so happy.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.550
From here on out,
I will devote myself to raising you.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.800
Let's keep... working hard together.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.790
All... All Might, I...

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.470
All Might...!

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.490
Huh...? This...

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.190
Oh yeah, I'm not at home...

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.980
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.400
Morning.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.330
After being attacked twice
by the League of Villains,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.250
U.A. High School thought to protect its
students by switching to an all-dorm system.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.120
A five-minute walk from U.A. school grounds,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.790
on the third day after moving into
the student dorm, Heights Alliance,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.630
our new lives begin as we devote
our days to becoming heroes.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.150
I will definitely become one.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.320
Since I inherited from All Might...

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.710
...his will and One For All!

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.150
"Create Those Ultimate Moves"

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.990
I believe I mentioned
this yesterday, but for now,

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.950
Class 1-A of the hero course will be focusing
on getting their provisional licenses.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.600
Yes, sir!

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.000
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.580
A hero license bears with it the
great responsibility of human life.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.500
Of course, the exam
to receive one is very difficult.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.010
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.880
Even the provisional license has
only a 50% passing rate each year.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.800
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.800
Just the provisional license is that hard?

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.430
That's why today, we will have
each of you come up with at least two...

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.940
...ultimate moves.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.310
"Pro Hero - Cementoss - Quirk: Cement"
"Pro Hero - Midnight - Quirk: Somnambulist"
"Pro Hero - Ectoplasm - Quirk: Clones"

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.560
Ultimate moves?!

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.610
It's like a real school thing and yet--

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.230
It's like a super normal hero thing!

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.320
"Ultimate"! This means that
this move will give you a sure win!

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.510
A move so ingrained into
your body that others cannot copy it.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.210
Battle means seeing how much you can
force what you're good at on your opponent.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.750
Your moves will represent you.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.050
These days, pro heroes without
ultimate moves are an endangered species.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.260
We will tell you more as we go along.
We want to proceed logically.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.220
Change into your costumes
and meet in Gym Gamma.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.480
"Gym Gamma"

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.980
Gym Gamma, also known as the
"Training Dining Land," or TDL.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.940
"Training Dining Land"

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.940
TDL might make a certain mouse mad at us...!

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.280
I came up with the idea for these facilities.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.290
Terrain and other things can be
prepared specifically for each student.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.910
That's what the "dining" part refers to.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.410
I see...

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.120
Please allow me to ask a question!

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.380
Why must we have ultimate moves
for our provisional licensing exam?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.960
Please tell me your reasoning!

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.960
I'll tell you everything in order.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.880
Calm down.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.350
The job of a hero is to save people
from danger, like crimes, accidents,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.460
natural disasters, and man-made disasters.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.980
The exam to become one naturally looks
at how well you are able to do that.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.320
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.320
Your ability to gather information,
make decisions, move, and fight,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.780
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.780
in addition to your ability to communicate,
draw people to you, and lead--

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.950
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.300
Every year, a different test is used to look
at how well you are able to do those things.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.040
Of those, your ability to fight is especially
important to your futures as heroes.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.210
If you are prepared, you won't have to worry.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.460
Whether or not you have an ultimate move
will greatly affect whether or not you pass.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.010
Not being influenced by circumstances
and being able to act consistently

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.590
will make you a great
asset on the front lines.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.350
Your ultimate moves do not necessarily
need to be of the attacking type.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.230
For example, Iida's Reciproburst--

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.980
The temporary burst of speed is enough of
a threat to be worth calling an ultimate move.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.070
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.490
So that's good enough
to be called an ultimate move?

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.610
I see... So we need to find
something that allows us to feel like

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.200
"As long as I do this,
I have the advantage. I can win."

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.540
Exactly!

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.500
Kamui Woods, who played a
big part in the fight the other day,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.290
has a move called Lacquered Chain Prison
that is the perfect example of an ultimate move.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.960
It restrains his opponents
before they can do anything.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.300
The training camp was cancelled,
but the training you did to develop your Quirks

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.300
was part of the process
to create your ultimate moves.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.010
In other words,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.850
until the beginning of the next semester,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.890
for the ten days or so
until the end of summer vacation,

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.980
you'll be working out your ultimate
moves as you develop your Quirks.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.480
You'll be doing intensive training!

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.740
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.490
In addition, you should think about
how you can improve your costumes

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.110
to work better with your developing Quirks.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.220
Get through this with a
"Plus Ultra" mentality.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.330
Are you ready?

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.540
Yes, sir!

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.660
I'm getting excited!

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.130
What should I do?

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.510
Your movements say
"I move like this because I have a tail."

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.980
Let's reexamine the
fundamentals of how you move.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.350
Yes, sir!

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.400
In other words, I'm too normal, huh?

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.780
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.190
Ultimate move--

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.500
Shooting acid from my hands like this!

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.110
How is it?

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:57.090
If you're going to take that route, then make
a nozzle with your fingers and squeeze it out.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.220
That's it.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.710
Wow, I can shoot further now!

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.880
Shall we have you focus
your acid to develop it further?

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.800
Create two things at the same time.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.340
You can start with something simple.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.720
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.540
Yes, sir!

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.970
Everyone's moving forward.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.810
What are you staring off into space for?

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.140
Oh, um--

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.520
About the ultimate moves...

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.440
My arms are like ticking time bombs now,
and I can't really use them too much...

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.570
Honestly, I can't really visualize how
an ultimate move would work in my case...

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.490
Hmm... It's true that your Quirk is the furthest
from being able to be called consistent.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.660
If you still don't have a fixed style yet,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.080
then today, focus on developing your Quirk.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.130
Yes, sir...

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.260
Everyone's working hard, huh?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.590
All Might...

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.880
I am...

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:01.390
...here even though I wasn't asked to be
because I didn't have anything else to do today!

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.100
Well, please focus on your recuperation.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.810
To prepare for the next semester.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.690
Hey, hey, don't act so cold.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.570
This is the class for ultimate moves, right?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.570
There's no way I want to miss this.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.360
I am a teacher, too, you know.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.770
It looks like he's having trouble.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.200
Take that!

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.380
It's been a while since I've
been able to go wild! It feels good!

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.190
Ectoplasm! Mine died! Give me another!

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.720
He's amazing.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.800
Yes. He'll definitely get even stronger.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.020
Oooh! Bakugo's really into it!

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.430
That guy's already got a lot of
different ideas for his ultimate move, huh?

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.030
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.230
He had a name from the entrance exam!

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.530
Whoops!

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.280
Focus!

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.610
Y-Yes sir!

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.280
I've got a move I've been working on
since I was a kid called Grape Rush, you know.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.790
I mean, everyone's
thought about it before, right?

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.950
I thought about doing
a lightning sword or something.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.710
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.470
I'm getting excited just thinking about
being able to do it for real in a place like this.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.750
What kind of ultimate move
can I create with these arms...?

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.800
Hey.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.260
Oh, All Might!

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.300
Here's some advice.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.890
You're still trying to imitate me.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.350
Huh?

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.600
What do you mean by that...?

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.900
Hey, Young Kirishima!

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.560
All Might!

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.470
I'm going over to give you some advice.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.780
With your Hardening,
rather than trying for small tricks,

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.780
you should try to bulldoze your way through.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.280
Yes, sir!

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.580
I can't call it teaching
if I just tell you the answer.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.820
Think, young man!

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.120
Whether you're right or
wrong isn't important.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.100
What's important is for you
to think it over and realize it for yourself.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.760
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.550
Young Jiro! I have advice for you!

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.200
What are you doing, all of a sudden?

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.050
"Even Dummies Can Be Teachers!
Easy Education Theory"

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:04.650
Huh?

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.980
Regarding the improvements to your costumes,

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.690
it won't do any good to think
about things outside your specialty.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.610
If there's something you want to change,

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.690
go to the development studio
on the school grounds

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.890
and ask an expert.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.740
You're still trying to imitate me.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.770
I still don't really understand
what All Might meant by that,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.310
but anyway, it'd be bad
if my arms stopped working.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.720
If there was some sort of brace that
could support the movement of my arms...

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.030
I need to work out my body to increase the
upper limit of how much One For All I can use...

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.780
From the conception to the
completion of my ultimate move...

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.850
To keep from falling behind everyone...

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.980
No, that's not it! I need to be at the top!

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.490
I see! You're focusing
on making your own body float?

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.740
Yeah! If I add more mobility,

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.120
then I can use the martial arts
I learned at my internship even more!

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.330
What about you, Iida?

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.500
I want to reduce the demerits of my Recipro.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.210
I'm planning on asking the development
studio to improve my radiator.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.670
Oh, it's Deku!

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.250
I was just wondering where you were!

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.300
Don't run in the hallway!

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.590
Deku, are you here
for costume improvements, too?

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.570
Oh, Uraraka--

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.980
Oww...

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.230
You know, you really shouldn't just
put everything you think of together!

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.650
"Failure is the mother of invention,"
Mr. Power Loader,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.240
as Thomas Edison once said.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.240
Even if what I made
doesn't work the way I planned,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.290
that doesn't mean it was a waste of time--

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.580
This isn't the time for that!

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.320
Will you listen to me for once, Hatsume?

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.880
Oh? When did you get here?

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.050
B-B-B...

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.180
...oobs!

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.980
"Izuku Midoriya"
"Quirk: One For All"
"Smashes villains with a super power passed down from one generation to the next."

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 7/15"
"Height: 166 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Pork Cutlet Bowl"

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.980
"Mei Hatsume"
"Quirk: Zoom"
"She can see clearly up to 5 km away."

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.980
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Support Course"
"Birthday: 4/18"
"Height: 157 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Steampunk"

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.770
Sorry about the sudden explosion!

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.780
It's been a while, huh?
Hero course students, um...

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.280
"Support Course First Year - Mei Hatsume"

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.280
I've forgotten all of your names.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.780
I-I'm Izu-Izuku M-Midoriya...

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.160
I'm Tenya Iida!

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.710
I'm the man you used as an advertising
tower during the sports festival tournament!

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.830
I see!

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.330
Well, I'm busy developing my babies, so...!

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:44.800
Um, wait, I wanted to ask Mr. Power Loader
about improving my costume...

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.550
Improving your costume?

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.010
Sounds interesting!

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.800
Hatsume.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.020
It's fine for you to come in and out of the
studio now that the dorm system is in place,

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.640
"Excavation Hero -  Power Loader"

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.640
but if you go wild in here any more,
I'm going to banish you!

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.020
U-Um...

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.770
I've already heard from Eraser Head.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.150
You're here about changing your costumes
as you develop your ultimate moves, right?

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.380
Come in.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.410
It's like a secret hideout!

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.700
Now, show me the instructions
for your costume.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.210
It's in the case with your costume, right?

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.670
I have a license to make costumes,
so I'll tinker with what I can using that.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.680
For small changes and repairs, I can just
report what I changed to the design company,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.800
and they'll do the paperwork for it,

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.640
but for major changes,
we'll have to fill out an application

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.230
and ask the design company to do it.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.230
Then, the government will check
the new costume, and once it's approved,

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.730
it'll come back here.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.320
Anyway, the agencies we
work with are the best,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.360
so we usually get them
back in about three days.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.200
Um, I was thinking about how I could lessen
the strain on the ligaments of my arms...

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.660
Is something like that possible?

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.500
Um, Midoriya, you...
fight with your fists and fingers, right?

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.030
If that's the case, then it'd be possible
to do it pretty fast with just a little tinkering.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.510
Isn't that great, Deku?

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.590
Yeah!

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.260
Yes, yes, I see.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.310
H-Hatsume, what are you...?

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.850
I'm touching his body.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.600
Yes, yes, much more solid than he looks.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.780
Very well, you can use...

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.280
My baby that I'd been saving, a powered suit!

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:31.780
Um...

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.240
This high-tech baby can read
the contractions of your muscles

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.700
and support your movements!

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.250
It's baby number 49!

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.120
I'm fine with just support for my arms...

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.670
Start!

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.130
Wow, it's amazing! It's moving on its own!

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.010
Huh? Wait, it won't stop... wait...

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.010
--Ow... Ouch... my back...!
--Deku!

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.260
Stop!

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.180
It looks like I made a mistake
in its operational limits program.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.930
"heh heh heh"

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.620
I'm sorry!

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.310
Are you all right?!

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.100
All I asked for was a brace for my arms,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.730
but my torso ended up
almost getting twisted off...

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.190
This is fine, too. It'd probably
be useful as a capture item.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.110
Um, I would like you to strengthen
the cooling device on my legs...

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.320
If that's the case, then...

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.410
There's this baby!

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.070
Hey!

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.120
This is an electric booster for super coolers
that can cool things that give off heat!

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.700
It's baby number 36!

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.210
--Isn't it cute?
--No, I don't need to change my booster, Hatsume!

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.630
--Booster, on!
--Besides, why is on my chest?! Hey!

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.050
Iida!

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.430
My Quirk is on my legs, though...

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.340
I know.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.720
But you know what I think?

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.730
If you want to cool your legs,
then why don't you run with your arms?

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.270
What in the world are you saying?!

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.650
Stop messing around!

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.670
You're still trying to imitate me.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.280
Oh, it's like.... oh...

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.080
Sorry about that.
She's self-centered to a fault.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.120
I know that very well.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.080
Yeah.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.040
But well, if you all are
aspiring to be heroes,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.250
then you should treasure
your relationship with her.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.130
I'm sure you'll be calling
on her after you become pros.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.600
Take a look at that.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.250
That pile of junk...

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.420
Those are all support items Hatsume
has made since starting school.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.270
Even when school's not in session,
she's here tinkering with something.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.690
I've seen many students
in the support course in my career,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.770
but Hatsume really is special.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.280
It's been just a little over
four months since we started school,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.610
and she's already made so many...

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:44.250
"Common sense is the collection of prejudices
acquired by age eighteen," said Einstein.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.590
She is unafraid of failure, constantly
thinking of new ideas and trying them out.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.060
Those who are innovators
are not bound by existing ideas.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.010
You're still trying to imitate me.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.600
--Something...! Something...!
--Your admiration for All Might and
your sense of duty are like shackles.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.480
--Something is...
--If you want to cool your legs,
then why don't you run with your arms?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.780
...becoming clear!

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.070
Iida, can you teach me?

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.950
I-I don't know what you're
talking about but wait a minute!

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.240
You may not have noticed, but we haven't
made progress on any of our costumes.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.620
Oh, that's right!

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.420
Deku, your face suddenly cleared up.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.130
Huh? R-Really?

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.420
Speaking of which,
are you changing part of your costume?

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.340
I want to control my nausea more...

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.090
Is that right?

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.470
In that case, how about this?

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.390
What is that? Will it explode?!

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.370
If you do this to the item...

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.640
Something black came out!

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.640
Hatsume!

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.360
I'm sorry!

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.530
Our training to create
ultimate moves continued...

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.620
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.880
"Suppression in Progress"

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.730
"Four Days Later"

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.610
How are things progressing, Aizawa?

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.450
You're here again? We're getting there.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200
Midoriya!

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.370
Did you change your costume?

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:50.120
Yeah! I got braces
to reduce the strain on my arms.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.290
You should've used the chance
to change your whole look.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.500
Your costume was on the boring side.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.270
It's fine.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.090
Congrats on getting into U.A.!

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.010
I might've jumped to conclusions, though.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.350
I don't want to change the base too much.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.850
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.590
Cover me, Dark Shadow!

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.500
Got it!

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:14.980
By covering myself with Dark Shadow,

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.820
I am able to make up for my
weaknesses in physical and close combat.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:20.280
I call it...

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.280
"Abyssal Black Body"

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.280
...Abyssal Black Body!

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.660
Isn't that hard to say?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.990
It's important for your
move names to be easy to say, too.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.870
Got it!

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.660
There are those who have
finally solidified their styles

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.260
and those who are already
trying to create multiple moves.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.930
Not from the whole palm of my hand,

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.800
but an explosion from
a single concentrated point...

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.140
"AP Shot (Armor Piercing Shot)"

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.730
AP Shot!

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.100
I did it!

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.350
Young Bakugo's really doing well, as usual.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.610
Yes.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.400
Hey, look out!

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.830
Smash...!

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.840
All Might's ultimate moves
are generally fists.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.590
Since I inherited One For All,
I thought I should also do the same

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.100
and decided that without realizing it!

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.600
It's really simple!

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.020
So simple that I didn't even realize it!

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.610
If I'm worried about my arms,
then I'll use my legs!

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.900
One For All: Full Cowling...

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.460
...Shoot Style!

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.330
That's right.
