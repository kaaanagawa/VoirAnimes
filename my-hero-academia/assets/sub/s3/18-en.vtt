00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.310
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.860
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.200
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.660
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.630
"Number to Pass 1st Test
100 People"

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.420
The first hundred to fulfill
the requirements will pass.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:06.270
"1st Test Rules"

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.760
The examinee will put three
of these targets on his or her body.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.350
They can go anywhere
as long as it's an exposed area.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.480
You can't put them on the
soles of your feet or in your armpits.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.310
You will also have six of these balls.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.980
The targets are made to only
light up if they're hit by these balls,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.530
and if all three of your
targets light up, then you're out.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.990
"Fail"

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.700
The person who lights up your third
target will have it count as their defeat.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.450
You get through this round
by defeating two people.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.710
I believe you all have terrain
that you like and dislike.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.800
Use your Quirks well and do your best.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.010
The 62nd person has passed.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.430
After another 38, it'll be over.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.640
"Yo Shindo - Quirk: Vibrate"

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.390
Let's sum up the situation
so we're all on the same page.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.650
During the beginning of the first test,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.770
"Tremoring Earth"

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.440
we focused on U.A., chipping off
their assets and splitting them up.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.450
Currently, we have split into two groups,
going after the split-up U.A.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.450
A number of schools have jumped
in to take advantage of that.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.870
Now, in the final stages of the test,
they have started fighting.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.830
The current progress of fighting is chaotic.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.040
"Tatami Nakagame - Quirk: Telescopic"

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.210
Your splitting the field
had the opposite effect, then...

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.340
I was rushing, too, but
if you think about it,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.630
the result is really excellent.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.380
If I were given eight
hours to chop down a tree,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.510
I would spend the first
six hours sharpening my axe.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.930
Right now, all they can think
about is the number of slots left,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.980
so they're panicking and rushing out,
using up a lot of stamina.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.650
They're focusing on U.A.,
since they have the most intel on them,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.190
so we can hide in the corner and
watch as they narrow their field of view.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.150
That's the current situation.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.660
You've finally taken off your polite face.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.870
You're so sneaky, Yo.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.330
Call me tactful instead.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.910
Well, coming in at the eleventh hour,
whether in a rush or with a plan,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.290
is the sign of an indomitable spirit.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.000
All the people here right now are
struggling to grasp their dreams and ideals.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.760
There are no high or low
ranks in that struggle.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.730
U.A. High School. I respect the school.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.650
I take pride that we are counted as equals.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.400
However, you lot continuously act
in ways that cause its dignity to decline.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.650
He's gonna do that thing again!

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.570
That gross thing!

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.780
Shut up!

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.320
Obligation?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.910
Dignity?

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.330
You just won't stop talking...

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.500
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.460
Show us with your actions,
not your mouth, sir.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.590
Especially you, Bakugo!

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.260
AP Shot: Auto-Cannon!

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.260
I made it weaker to use
against people, though.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.520
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.720
Man, everyone hates you for the same reason!

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.730
Damn it, I cannot believe I fell for it.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.060
Those gross things scattered
around... are going back?!

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.280
A mentality that reacts
impulsively to a simple provocation...

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.570
That is something that depends
solely on how proud a person is.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.910
In that case, I will break him myself
and make him understand...

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.080
Behavior befitting the school one
belongs to is what it means to be dignified.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.580
What's with this guy?

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.500
He talks too much.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.420
I'll kill him!

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.050
Hey, wait! Don't forget that this is a test!

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.260
That's why I'll kill him!

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.630
Absurd!

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.510
Man, this fight isn't going anywhere!

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.390
I'll finish this up fast!

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.520
Projectiles?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.060
Aw, crap!

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.060
You're an eyesore.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.770
Shall I shape you into a ball first?

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.070
Don't ignore me!

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.410
I'm not, though.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.990
Huh?

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.830
Earlier, I had a piece of my flesh from
under this elevated structure go around.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.540
You saw earlier with Kirishima, didn't you?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.290
If it touches you, that's the end.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.670
Bakugo!

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.670
Hey, idiot! Here!

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.680
Pathetic. You should
start again from scratch.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.970
"Gah"

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.730
"Seiji Shishikura - Quirk: Meatball"

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.640
Shiketsu High School, second
year, Seiji Shishikura.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.270
Quirk: Meatball!

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.900
He can change flesh by massaging it.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.610
For someone else's flesh,
he can only knead it and make it round,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.860
but he can do a lot more with his own flesh.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.240
He can cut it off and manipulate it
or gather it up and make a big piece!

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.700
It seems pretty handy!

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.370
No way...

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.620
This is a demonstration of power.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.580
This test has an unusually low passing rate.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.960
Since All Might has retired,
and we have reached a turning point,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.130
wouldn't it normally be appropriate
to increase the number of heroes?

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.220
Namely, what this implies is that
they are weeding out the riffraff.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.720
We can surmise that they
are starting to be more selective

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.060
in order to bring the profession
of hero to a higher level.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.560
I wish to support that,
so I am removing you folks now.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.610
You're ignoring the test to do that?

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.530
That's strange!

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.990
What's strange is for ordinary
people to grow apace in the world.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.540
By the way, their senses, including their sense
of pain, will work as normal even in this form.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.290
So your electricity will
hurt everyone, Denki Kaminari.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.380
You've pretty much just been
slinging insults this whole time, huh?

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.670
It hurts, so I wish you'd stop.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.300
That's because you have some self-awareness.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.390
I hope it will cause you
to reflect on your actions.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.890
I wasn't talking about myself!

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.890
An explosion?

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.730
But I made Bakugo into a ball!

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.650
Bakugo's equipment?!

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.440
He can put ingredients for an
explosion in to make a simple grenade!

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.070
He told me about it angrily before,
when I asked him if they were there for fashion.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.700
He gave it to him back then?

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.530
By the way, sir...

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.620
...you stumbled over to a great spot.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.630
Sharpshooting?

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.640
I can't really manipulate electricity,
so it's hard to fight with other people.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.350
I wondered if I could
do something about it...

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.520
I have prepared the items you wanted--

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.640
A pointer and shooter.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.650
It's a baby we collaborated on!

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.150
If you shoot with the
pointer set to "Shooter,"

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.530
then it'll stick to the point of impact.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.070
As long as it's within
ten meters of the pointer,

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.410
then your electricity will be
gathered into a single line.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.530
If you have multiple targets,
then you can use the dial to select them,

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.080
and you can use the attached glass
to figure out exact locations.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.960
Will it require more thinking...?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.330
Thumbs up.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.970
But with this, I can use my Quirk
without hitting everyone around me.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.470
I know, Bakugo.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.390
The reason you stopped the opponent's
attacks with your smaller-ranged new move

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:06.480
rather than a big explosion was
so you wouldn't hit me or Kirishima,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.480
who was on the ground.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:18.370
Sir, Bakugo might seem vulgar, but he's
actually trying really hard to be a hero.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.620
Throwing that grenade to me in an instant

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.750
was a result of his calm judgment of how
to break the deadlock, don't you think?

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.250
And Kirishima is such a good guy that he'd
rush into enemy territory for his friends,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.050
even though it was a dumb thing to do.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.380
Shoot! I loosened my hold for a second.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.760
You've only heard bits and
pieces of information about these guys,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.550
so don't insult them
thinking you know who they are!

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.310
I'm telling you to be more aware
of your position, you moron!

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.820
Depending on the amount
of damage, it gets released, huh?

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.320
No wonder he was only
using long-distance attacks.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.820
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening"

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.990
Thanks, Kaminari!

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.370
What took you so long, Dunce Face?!

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.530
That's so mean!

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.660
No wonder people keep dissing you!

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.870
Wait, behind you!

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.790
You guys weren't the only ones he balled up!

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.840
I know.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.840
We're currently at 70 people.
It'll be over after another 30.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.300
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.970
The other people in class aren't coming.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.600
Was it too hard with
their Quirks known, after all?

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.390
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"
 "Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.480
Todoroki, you passed!

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.730
Didn't expect any less.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.900
What about the others?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.940
They haven't come yet.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.980
I was the first, and then you all.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.780
I see. They're not here yet, huh?

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.360
Weren't you all working together?

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.830
We were, but we got split up by the
Quirk of someone from Ketsubutsu Academy...

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.450
Thirty people left...

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.330
I hope everyone can pass...

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.260
Huh?

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.760
Just do it!

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.800
Okay, Uraraka!

T-Tape?!

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.900
They stuck it to debris and threw it, huh?

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.400
Damn it!

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.320
I gave some tape to Uraraka
and had her set some traps.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.820
I did say as many as possible,
but... that's so bold...

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.660
In order to make sure no one was
in a position to be hit by the debris,

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.290
I hid and figured out the timing!

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.830
Currently, 76 people have passed.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.290
We will be at capacity soon.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.010
We don't have much time, and I'm sure
others will come attack us soon, too.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.670
Let's take these, guys.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.180
You guys are first years, right?

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.140
Give us a break!

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.260
We've gotta get our
provisional licenses this time around!

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.020
I do, too.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.030
"Tenya Iida"
"Quirk: Engine"
"He can run very fast using the engines in his calves."

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.030
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 8/22"
"Height: 179 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Beef Stew"

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:04.030
"Yuga Aoyama"
"Quirk: Navel Laser"
"He can shoot a strong laser beam from his bellybutton."

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:04.030
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 5/30"
"Height: 168 cm" "Blood Type: O" "Likes: Himself"

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.990
We're at 79 people.
We're moving fast at a good pace.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.290
Wow, the response is super fast!

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.540
Those who have passed
should go to the anteroom.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.830
What about the others?

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.460
"Heroes Public Safety
Commission - Yokumiru Mera"

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.800
Those boys and girls'
youthfulness is just gushing up, huh?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.930
The battle royale... is normal,

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.180
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"
"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.390
but this time, we've got an unusual pattern.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.350
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.980
U.A., which is heavily targeted each time,
still hasn't had anyone taken out.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.350
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.520
That's--

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.940
"Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.860
Aoyama!

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.610
Iida, are you alone?

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.700
What a coincidence. So am I.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.490
I've been trying to help those
in Class A as much as I can.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.950
A number of us gathered in one place,
and I came out to look for others.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.920
Does that mean you're
running around by yourself?

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.460
Yup.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.090
You're so weird.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.670
How do you know who's still left?

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.090
What'll you do if everyone
left you behind and passed already?

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.720
But I found you, didn't I?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.310
If everyone else passed
first, then that's good!

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.020
I am Class A's representative.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.310
I'm in a position to lead the class.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.860
As long as time and energy allow,
I want to serve the class.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.690
That's what my brother would've done.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.740
My actions are also the shape of my dream.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.200
"The shape of my dream"...

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.910
Even so, I do want to get
my provisional license.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.620
The test is nearing the final stages...

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.920
I'll continue my search
on my way to getting it.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.830
Please work with me!

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.550
Now, we had three people pass in succession,

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.170
--bringing the total to 82,
which means there are 18 spots left.
--They're fighting all over the place.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.970
Oh? Hey, that's Sero and the others!

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.800
All right! Amazing! Whoo!

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.060
Kaminari!

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.770
All right! Amazing! Whoo!

00:13:54.770 --> 00:14:01.150
All right! All right! All right!

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.360
You passed, huh? Deku, you damn bastard...

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.740
Kacchan...!

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.070
Um, yeah...

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.740
It feels like it's been a while...

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.660
Ever since Kamino, he's come
at me even less than before...

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.120
With the power you've got, it's only natural.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.790
Huh?!

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.000
Kacchan... just now, to me...?!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.170
You've made what you borrowed your own, huh?

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.220
One day, I will make this Quirk my own

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.060
and beat you with my own power!

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.690
Kacchan...

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.200
Everyone, I'm glad you
are all safe! I was so worried.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.280
Yao-momo, we're safe, we're safe.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.240
Man, you guys were pretty fast!

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.830
We also just finished.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.200
Todoroki was the fastest.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.120
I thought Bakugo would
definitely also be here already,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.460
but I see, it was because
you were with him, Kaminari.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.840
What?! You should fix that part of you!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.210
Ochaco, the key to take off
the targets is in the back.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.260
They said to put them on the
return shelf with the ball bags.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.050
Thanks, Tsu. I'll do that.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.680
That makes eleven from Class A, huh?

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.220
Nine more to go.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.150
The announcement
said there were 18 spots left...

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.560
Everyone...

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.650
I'll take you!

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.610
Aoyama!

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.740
Damn it!

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.200
There's two of us.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.200
In the middle of this war,
it'll be hard to survive now, Iida!

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.370
What are you saying?

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.170
Anyone can give up! Let's do our best!

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.460
No, that's not it...

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.750
Wow!

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.880
We'll be hit by stray shots!

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.090
Damn it, there's no time!

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.970
What should we do?!

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.220
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"
"Pro Hero - Ms. Joke - Quirk: Outburst"

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.890
Okay, eight people just passed all at once!

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.100
There are ten spots left!

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.900
Oh, the eight were from my class!

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.610
Look, they're heading to the anteroom.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.900
It's Shindo and the others.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.190
Good job!

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.400
Ten people left...

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.820
In Class A...

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.370
...there are still nine people left...

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.240
It might be impossible
for all of us to pass at this point...

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.710
As long as time and energy allow,
I want to serve the class.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.710
That's what my brother would've done.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.840
My actions are also the shape of my dream.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.090
"The shape of my dream"...

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.430
Papa! Maman!

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.310
Why am I different from everyone else?

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.370
Wh-What?!

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.910
What are you doing?

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.750
Wait, seriously, what are you doing?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.960
I'm standing out!

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960
You really are!

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.790
No, that's not what I mean!

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.130
If you protect me, we'll both be taken down.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.720
I'm standing out, and two of
my targets have already been taken out.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.180
I'll be out after one more.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.680
I'll do it for you.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.930
Get behind those who're coming
to get me while I'm standing out.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.350
With your speed, you can
do it yourself, right?

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:27.350
What are you saying all of a sudden?

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.770
It might sound sudden, but...

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.280
"The shape of my dream"...

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.160
I always wanted to be an equal...

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.580
They'll be here soon. Get ready!

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.040
But...!

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.000
Hurry up! Hurry!

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.010
Wh-What's that?

00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.930
Pigeons?!

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.180
Ow! Ow!

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.770
This is...

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.520
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.270
Birds, continue to circle that area!

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.480
Black Abyss!

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.860
Covert Black-Ops Arms!

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.660
Wh-What?!

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.280
What the heck?!

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:25.910
Damn it!

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.040
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.290
Get the ones you can first!

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.000
Before they get you!

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.590
Oh, everyone!

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.050
It's U.A.!

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.130
"Toru Hagakure - Quirk: Invisibility"

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:39.220
Warp Refraction: Say Cheese!

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.510
Argh, my eyes!

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.100
I'm going first!

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.230
Me too!

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.480
Two more have passed! Eight left!

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.310
Hey...

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.770
Why...?

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.530
Everyone was panicking and getting careless--

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:01.570
Friend and foe alike were all mixed up,
and we couldn't see anything around us!

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:07.160
But we were able to see your
bellybutton laser and meet up again!

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.540
Now, let's do it!

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.420
Seven left!

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.630
Sorry.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.760
Six left!

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.390
Five left!

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.680
They just keep coming!

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.890
In the final minutes, U.A. came together
and pulled off some great combos to pass!

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.690
There were that many of you left?

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:34.820
I did it!

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.030
Four left!

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.150
All right!

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.990
Three left!

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.620
Oh, we've got one from
Shiketsu High right now, so two left!

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.490
"Camie Utsushimi"

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.120
Aoyama! I don't know
what you want to be equal with,

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.710
because I don't know what
you're measuring yourself up against...

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.000
...but this was thanks to you!

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.590
Thank you!

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.010
Well, that means that
my twinkle won't stop, huh?

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.100
Yeah, probably!

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.810
I don't really know, though!

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.350
And zero!

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.650
One hundred people!
All the spots just filled up!

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:19.320
The end! Whoo-hoo!

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.200
All right!

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.910
Everyone in U.A. passed the first test!

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.410
Amazing! This is amazing!

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.370
Ribbit, ribbit!

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.790
Oh, good...

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.330
Yeah.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.040
And now, unfortunately,
those who failed will have to withdraw.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.920
Everyone, please leave promptly.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.840
Jeez, you all made me nervous.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.510
Once we get back, you'll have to train more.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.680
You're happy, aren't you?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.140
Act it!

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.100
I'm mad.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.020
Your legs look like they're bouncing happily.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.980
No, they aren't.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.160
What?! Shishikura failed?!

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.530
You're too loud.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.040
"Nagamasa Mora"

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.700
It's because that violently passionate guy
went ahead of us and fought alone!

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.910
You two, too!

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.830
Setting aside the first-year, Yoarashi...

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.580
Camie! You should know better!

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.960
Yes, sir...

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.630
Well, for all hundred of you
who passed the first test,

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.720
please watch this.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.260
It's the field...

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.350
I wonder what's going to happen?

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.150
Why?!

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.980
Th-This is...

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.570
The next test will be the last one.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:16.540
We will have you all undertake rescue
exercises as bystanders in this disaster site.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.000
Rescue...!

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
"Preview"

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.670
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.670
The final screening is saving people
who need to be saved at a disaster site.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:26.920
The provisional license and this test--

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.420
All of it is for what I want to become--

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.130
The shape of my dream!

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.930
Next time, "Rescue Exercises"!

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:36.610
"Next time: Rescue Exercises"

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.090
Go beyond!

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.810
Plus Ultra!
