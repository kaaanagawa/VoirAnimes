00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.210
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.840
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.220
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.850
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.980
"Three Weeks Earlier"

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.990
"Planning Meeting for Provisional Licensing Exam"
"Heroes Public Safety Commission"

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.490
Ball throwing?

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.320
That seems too much like a game...

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.530
Is it really all right?

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.290
The real test will be how they deal
with the chaos caused by it.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.660
We want to see if they will be able
to use their Quirks and make decisions

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.460
quickly and correctly in a crisis.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.500
And it's the same for the second exam?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.090
At this rate, we'll be evaluating
not their individual abilities,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.550
but their ability to work in a group.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.220
This was a proposal from
the National Police Agency--

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.930
A revision of the evaluation criteria
and requirements for granting licenses.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.270
It's effectively an order.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.060
Assuming that all examinees have knowledge
of basic emergency procedures and first-aid,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.740
we were told to focus on
their attitudes toward cooperation.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.740
Cooperation, huh?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.700
This has become necessary.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.620
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.540
All Might was at the top in
everything--strength and charisma.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.170
There was always a large gap
between him and the number two hero.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.670
"Pro Hero - Endeavor - Quirk: Hellflame"

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.550
It will be hard to find someone
else as charismatic as him.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.800
Rather than waiting for the next All Might,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.550
we should fill that hole with an army
of heroes with a strong sense of unity.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.390
"Heroes Public Safety Commission - Yokumiru Mera"

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.100
The proposal this time
is like a foothold into that.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.940
The second test of the
provisional hero licensing exam...

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.360
Rescuing people who were
in a large-scale terrorist attack

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.690
and dealing with the villain behind the attack.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.200
What's that?!

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.830
Rescuing and fighting!

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.290
Can you do everything at the same time?

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.460
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.130
Gang Orca...!

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.760
During the League of Villains
search-and-destroy operation in Kamino Ward,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.550
he was brought out among the ranks
of heroes like Endeavor and Best Jeanist.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.720
He's strong, you know.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.980
Villains have appeared
and started their pursuit!

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.190
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"
"Rikido Sato - Quirk: Sugar Rush"
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.110
Hero candidates at the scene
should continue their rescue efforts

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.650
while also suppressing the villains.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.190
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"
"Minoru Mineta - Quirk: Pop Off"

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.860
Continue rescue efforts while fighting?!

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.280
Jeez, are they serious?!

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.870
Aren't they expecting a little too much?!

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.540
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"
"Pro Hero - Ms. Joke - Quirk: Outburst"

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.990
This situation would be
difficult even for a pro.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.870
To go this far for the provisional license...

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.460
Now...

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.880
What'll you do?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.710
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.460

"Inasa Yoarashi - Quirk: Whirlwind"

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.510
Help, or run?

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.340
What will you do, heroes?!

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.970
"What's the Big Idea?"

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.100

"Mina Ashido - Quirk: Acid"
"Fumikage Tokoyami - Quirk: Dark Shadow"
"Mashirao Ojiro - Quirk: Tail"

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.850
Look, right in front of the first-aid station!

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.730
Oh, no!

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.190
I can't believe they'd
send out villains so close!

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.770
They're so mean!

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.940
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.440
There are still a lot of people to rescue here,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.320
but we can't just ignore
what's going on over there...

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.570
Yeah...

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.080
For this second test, everyone starts
off with a certain number of points,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.290
and then they're graded based
on how many they lose.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.290
H.U.C. evaluates whether or not
they are acting properly in their rescue,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.790
and besides that,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.880
for example--

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.800
whether or not you've put yourself
in a position to best use your own Quirk--

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.300
looking at the big picture comprised of
the scoring manual and the examinees' data

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.470
are one hundred employees
of the Public Safety Commission

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.850
scoring each person individually.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.560
Examinees fail when their
total score falls below fifty points.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.140
"Fail"

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.480
Please do your best to make the right decisions.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.320
Get everyone to safety!

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.610
Shindo?!

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.530
Toward the back!

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.200
"Yo Shindo - Quirk: Vibrate"

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.570
Get them as far away
from the villains as possible!

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.910
R-Right!

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.330
I'll keep hammering away at them
with tremors at one-second intervals!

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.920
I won't let them get close!

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.540
Not good enough.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.800
Gang Orca...!

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.130
Is he going all out?

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.970
I wonder...

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.550
Shindo!

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.720
Only a single rear guard when
there's this much of a difference in ability?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.720
Looks like you were underestimating us.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.310
"Gang Orca - Quirk: Orcinus"

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.100
Gang Orca! Quirk: Orcinus.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.650
He can do things an orca can do even on land.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.610
One of those is an ultrasonic
wave attack that can paralyze!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.080
Todoroki!

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.910
Midoriya, are you evacuating?

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.910
We'll help!

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.080
Todoroki's so fast!

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.870
Where were you guys?

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.750
By the water over there!

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.800
Everyone headed to the city first,
so we went where they didn't have enough people.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.470
But after seeing the villains come out
in full force over here, we came to help!

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.600
Yaoyorozu and Asui are still
back there continuing the rescue.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.390
An attack like this is nothing!

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.190
As expected of the number ten hero.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.810
Wind...

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.900
Blow away...!

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.990
A villain attack?

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.330
You guys have prepared
some pretty hot developments!

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.620
That's the guy who turned down U.A.!

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.420
This is good. We should keep evacuating now
that the strong attackers have gathered!

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.090
Right!

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:10.470
Prioritizing the first-aid station--the
cornerstone of the rescue efforts--

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.590
That was very wise...

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.180
In fact, with their strong
all-encompassing Quirks,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.640
Yoarashi and Todoroki were the best for the job.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.230
"Provisional Licensing Exam"
"Second Test Scoring Sheet"

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.140
Good job!

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.190
To arrive at the same time as you...

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.530
I hate you guys.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.320
That's my line.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.160
Everything you say is a distraction.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.450
Why don't you go help
with evacuating the first-aid station?

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.580
That works with your Quirk, right?

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.410
I'll take care of this.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.840
Here they come.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.550
Huh? What're they aiming at?

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.010
Why'd you use your flames?!

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.020
The heat makes the wind rise!

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.560
Because the ice was blocked earlier!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.100
Didn't you do that on purpose?

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.190
Your wind blew away my flames!

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.650
You're the one who did it on purpose
to keep me from getting all the glory!

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.150
Huh? Why would I do that?!

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.240
Why wouldn't you?

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.330
I mean, you're the son of that Endeavor!

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.000
What the hell's been wrong
with you this whole time?!

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.870
My old man has nothing to do with it--

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.250
Cement Gun!

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.000
It'll harden up real fast and
make it hard for you to move.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.050
This is outrageous! I can't believe
you two would start arguing here.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.550
What do you mean,
it has nothing to do with him?

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.680
It definitely does!

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.020
To me, heroes are passionate!

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.570
With their passionate hearts,
they bring hope and inspiration to people!

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.650
Their passion comes through!

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.280
You're in the way.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.030
Don't get in my way.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.370
That's why it was a shock!

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:07.290
Because nothing came through
in those eyes except a cold, cold anger!

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.300
And then, at the entrance exam,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.800
I saw you, and I knew
who you were immediately.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.470
Because you...

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.100
You're in the way.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.770
...had the exact same eyes!

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.190
The same...?

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.270
That's ridiculous.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.240
I'm not the same as him.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.700
That's enough. Stop listening to him.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.290
What it comes down to is
that he's an Endeavor hater.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.000
Focus on the test...

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.540
Don't lose your cool.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.300
You've already overcome
your relationship with the old man.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.090
No...

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.720
There's still some hate toward him...

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.850
This is no good... Focus on the test!

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.980
What are you doing
with a villain in front of you?

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.610
Man...

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.530
You and your dad are the only heroes

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.450
I won't accept no matter what!

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.030
The end!

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.620

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.780

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.620
You really are...

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.670
The wind's sending the flames...!

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.030
What... are you doing?!

"Shoto Todoroki"

I've never been afraid of
anything, ever since I was a kid.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.480
Oh, it's so fast and cool!

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.150
I like this bug!

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.490
I liked anything and everything.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:09.460
That's why, the minute I knew
what a hero was, I was fired up.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.830
Tackling crises in front of them
with everything they had--

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.670
That passion!

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.590
That's why I didn't like that hero.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.630
Just that hero...

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.310
...with those eyes that seemed
to hate something far ahead of him.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.600
He was the only thing that I hated.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.480
Okay, the written test of the
recommendation entrance exam is over!

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.570
Next is the practical exam,
and last will be the interview!

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.320
You'll go six at a time for the practical.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.700
Go to the exam location
when your number's called!

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.030
The exam will be a 3-kilometer race.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.040
But it's a course that you won't
be able to finish if you just run.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.040
Use your Quirks freely to reach the finish line!

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.960
The best hero school in Japan...

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.300
The most passionate high school
life in Japan is waiting for me!

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.430
Making a path of ice to move! He's fast!

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.970
I really didn't like his eyes,

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.640
but his abilities are super hot!

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.400
He'll probably be accepted.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.190
Well, if I use this chance
to make friends with him,

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.480
maybe his eyes won't bother me anymore!

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.780
By a hair! Number 41 finishes first!

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.250
And it's three minutes faster
than the average for a normal year!

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.330
All right! I won!

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.920
But who knows what'll happen next time!

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.670
You're amazing!

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.880
Are you Endeavor's kid or something?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.840
That's amazing!

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.680
Shut up.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.510
I just have to pass this test.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.430
I wasn't competing with you or anything.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.600
He's not looking.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.520
You're in the way.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.320
It's like he hates something...
far ahead of him...

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.370
What... are you doing?!

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.830
Hard to believe they're from top schools.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:18.130
It's too bad, but those two are probably...

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.380
A Quirk using wind...

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.800
That's right... He was in my way...

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.800
It was him... I'm sure of it...

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.310
Why didn't I remember him right away?

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.520
He's so loud and obnoxious...

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.440
I didn't really see him...

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.150
In order to reject that bastard...

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.030
I couldn't think about anything else...

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.200
...I forgot about you.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.950
Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing...

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.460
Whether it is correct or not...

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.830
I just let it go without knowing for sure...

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.880
Is this where it comes back?

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.550
My past... and my blood...

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.760
I can't just bury it and forget about it, huh?

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.310
First...

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.430
I'll take care of the wind that's in the way!

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.770
Shoot!

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.940
Impact!

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.520
It's a teamwork play between us and the boss!

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.860
I'll harden up all the examinees nice and solid!

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.860
Oh, no! My control's...!

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.360
Hey!

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.740
You reap what you sow.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.630
There was some distance between us,
so it wasn't as effective, huh?

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:48.800
While the boss is at it,
let's go mess up the evacuation shelter!

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.180
All right!

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.760
Shit...

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.260
Damn it...

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.890
What... are you doing?!

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.560
Seriously!

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.110
I've become what I hated.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.440
The things I did in the past
caused this situation...

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.820
I...

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.990
...have to fix this!

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.990
Oh no, they're going to get through!

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.740
They're coming this way!

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.450
At this distance,
it'll be bad if I don't make a front line!

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.040
Get out of the way!

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.000
Shindo!

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.300
I thought you couldn't move
because of the orca's ultrasonic waves!

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.760
Well, my extremities are still pretty numb,

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.720
but sound waves and vibrations...

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.310
My brains get shaken pretty much
every day from the recoil of my own Quirk.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.100
So I've built up some tolerance to them...

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:39.980
Anyway...

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.100
I was trying to get a surprise attack
in with that to begin with!

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.980
And then those two first years...!

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.020
His personality's...

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.780
I've stopped them.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.530
Put 'em out of action!

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.450
Split up and get the
remaining injured to shelter!

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.160
Right!

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.120
Now...

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.660
Shall I take down that wind-user

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.410
and go help those guys?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.830
Competing with each other in vain...

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.090
We're not compatible at all...

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.170
And we've got zero teamwork...

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:13.130
There's no way we could
beat a top hero like this.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.100
If you feel the same way I do...

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.680
The heat makes the wind rise!

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.100
From the bottom...

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.940
...scoop it out!

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.980
I'm so numb that
I can't put any strength in it...

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.020
But...

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.900
...I have to do this!

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.160
With flames...

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.080
...and wind...

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.160
...we'll trap you!

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.290
Even though he didn't move his body...!

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.050
His power and accuracy have decreased,

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.970
but the paralysis didn't have enough effect.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.510
He's able to just barely control his Quirk.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.060
On the other hand,
Todoroki, who can't move at all,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.810
is covering for Yoarashi's lack
of strength by adding his flames...

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.730
This won't make their
foolishness earlier disappear...

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.610
...but it's not bad.

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.030
The ground gets packed down after a storm.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.490
They realized their mistake,

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.570
and they're trying to make up for it.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.910
I don't dislike that kind of struggling.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.910
Hey, behind you!

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.500
The boss is trapped by a spiral of flame!

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.620
Isn't this bad?

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.670
The boss is like an orca,
so he's super weak to drying out!

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.380
Forget the wind! Stop the flames!

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.260
What?!

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.880
Todoroki! He's using both his left and right...!

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.180
Simultaneous activation of left and right...

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.180
I need to practice more.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.220
It slows me down.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.100
If I can't move...

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.230
...then it doesn't matter!

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.310
Should we go back and help?

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.400
No, wait!

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.230
Smash...!

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.400
Defeat the villains!

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.610
Shoot! Shoot!

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.570
I'll borrow this!

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.910
Ojiro!

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.870
All the injured have been evacuated!

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.620
Reinforcements will be here soon!

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.130
The rescue of the H.U.C., who were on standby...

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.960
They just have three people
left before they're done...

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.470
The test will end at that point.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.590
Do your best to hold them off until then.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.600
I can sleep soon...!

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.270
Ojiro! Midoriya!

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.640
We're here to help!

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.810
Mow them all down at once!

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.230
Freeze them all in place!

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.770
Ribbit!

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.650
Asui--I mean, Tsu!

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.110
When'd you get there?!

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.370
I polished up my frog skills and finally
reached a level I could use in combat--

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.870
Camouflage! It's my new move.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.410
Asui! Are you done with
the search and rescue already?

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.540
Pretty much.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.500
Ribbit! Look out!

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.590
"Nagamasa Mora - Quirk: Extend-o-Hair"

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.210
Shiketsu High School!

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.670
I sent Inasa here,

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.800
but it's a disgrace on the Shiketsu
name for there to be so many left!

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.810
So strong!

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.810
Yes.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.560
Let's go, too!

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.610
A hot wind prison of flame and wind, huh?

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.490
It's a good idea.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.950
A normal villain would give up,

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.370
cry, and beg for forgiveness.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.910
But what if they didn't?

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.960
After playing a hand, you need
to already be planning the next one.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.930
Well? What's next?

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.430
Nothing.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.520
Please get away from those two!

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.610
Midoriya!

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.740
You're... always...

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.120
Um, at this moment,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.130
all the H.U.C. who were deployed
have been rescued from the danger zone.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.540
Huh? Right now?

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.290
That was us, then!

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.710
It may seem arbitrary,

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:24.720
but with this, all the provisional licensing
exam procedures have been completed.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.430
We're done?!

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.140
After we tally the scores,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.640
we will announce the results here.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.020
Those who were injured
should go to the infirmary.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.730
The rest of you should change and then stand by.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.780
Boss, sorry, we couldn't do our job...

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:46.070
These restraining protectors
really make it hard to move, huh?

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.580
No, even without the protectors,

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.040
the spiral of flame was excellent.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.750
And with Midoriya's surprise attack
after the damage from drying out...

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.380
If the test had gone on longer...

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.210
Or...

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.930
Okay... Everyone,
thanks for all your hard work...

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.430
Now, I will announce the results,

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.440
but before that, I will tell
you about the scoring system.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.400
Between those of us at the
Heroes Public Safety Commission and H.U.C,

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.910
we had a two-fold demerit system
we used while watching you.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.990
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"
"Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening" "Yuga Aoyama - Quirk: Navel Laser"

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:31.080
In other words, we were evaluating you
on how few mistakes you made

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.160
in a crisis situation.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.420
Anyway, the names of those
who passed are listed in syllabary order.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.090
