WEBVTT

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.730
I've been thinking about it this whole time.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.480
You got it from All Might, didn't you?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.610
Your power.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.050
Since you're not denying it, it must be true.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.570
Damn it...

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.160
What're you going to do with the answer?

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.700
You and I both wanted to be like All Might.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.380
Right... That's how it was...

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.170
Someone I'd always thought was just a pebble

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.360
was acknowledged by the person
I admired without me realizing it...

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.760
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.760
That's why...

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.470
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.470
Let's fight.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.180
Right here, right now.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.270
Huh?! Wait, why does it
have to end up like that?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.940
No, this is bad...
We're not even supposed to be here.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.630
If we're going to fight, at least do it
during free practice or something...

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.610
We should reserve
a training room and do it there!

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.530
There's no reason it has to be now, is there?

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.740
If we fight seriously, we'll be stopped.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.520
What part of you made All
Might do what he did?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.290
Let me see for myself.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.060
If the way you admired him was correct,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.730
then does that mean my admiration was wrong?

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.630
Kacchan...

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.930
Did you see that just now?

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.020
All Might really is cool, isn't he?

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.980
He saves everyone with a smile,
no matter what trouble they're in...

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.980
No matter how much trouble he's in,
he always wins in the end!

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.990
He's such a cool hero...

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.370
Can I... be a hero, too?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.710
"Deku vs. Kacchan, Part 2"

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.750
A-Are you really planning on fighting?

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.630
If you don't wanna get hurt, get ready.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.760
Oh yeah, you switched
to mainly using kicks, right?

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.930
I said, wait!

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.180
We can't do this!

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.990
Kacchan!

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.560
His right?!

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.730
No, I got him like this before.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.430
That's not it.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.140
His right is a feint...

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.070
You like to read a lot into things, huh?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.440
Come on!

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.950
Are you serious, Kacchan?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.950
Two students from Class 1-A
identified breaking curfew!

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.290
Their homeroom teacher...

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.290
Hey, Eraser Head!

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.090
Your students are at Ground Beta!

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.590
You are responsible for them. Go scold them!

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.260
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.490
Seriously?

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.210
What in the world...?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.520
I said, wait!

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.680
Do we really have to fight?!

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.560
There's no way you were wrong!

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.110
No one said your admiration was wron--

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.610
Wait, I said!

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.360
Wait for me, Kacchan!

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.260
Kacchan!

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.370
Even though you were always behind me...

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.580
Are you all right?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.960
No matter how much I beat you up,
you were always stuck to my back like glue...!

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.210
Kacchan!

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.920
Don't run! Fight!

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.310
Even though we both
admired the same person...!

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.940
Just so you know, pride is important.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.340
You definitely have the
abilities needed to become a pro.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.540
I know why you're so angry.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.630
It's because of Young Midoriya's
sudden improvement, right?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.950
But you know,

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.460
there's no way Level 1 power and
Level 50 power can improve at the same rate.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.620
Why...?!

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.130
Why...?!

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.430
Why...?!

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.390
A-Are you okay?

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.830
Don't worry about me!

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.730
Fight! What the hell's wrong with you?

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.690
Why...

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.410
Why did I end up having to chase after
the back of someone who was always behind me?

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.660
Why did a damn small fry
like you get strong...

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.540
and become acknowledged by All Might...?

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.370
Why is it that you became strong...

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.750
...but I...

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.300
Why was I...

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.420
Why was I the one who ended All Might?!

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.680
If I'd been stronger and
if I hadn't been kidnapped by villains,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.060
then that wouldn't have happened...

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.480
All Might tried to keep it a secret...

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.690
I couldn't tell anyone!

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.730
Even if I try not to think about it...

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.190
...it just comes to mind unexpectedly!

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.860
I don't know what to do!

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.260
He's been carrying this
with him this whole time...!

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.650
More than me... this whole time...

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.210
He's been worrying about it...

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.270
Thinking about it...

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.420
There might not be any meaning in this fight.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.370
There might not be any
meaning in winning or losing.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.930
Even so, I thought that
I had to go through with it.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.350
Because right now, I'm the only one
who can accept Kacchan's feelings.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.280
This is perfect...

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.740
I can see whether or not
my Shoot Style works on you...

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.110
If I'm gonna do this,

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.410
I'm going all out.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.830
I'm not planning on being a sandbag, Kacchan!

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.840
He might've just wanted to release these feelings
he couldn't do anything about by fighting.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.840
Even if that was the case,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.550
I couldn't just completely reject him.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.840
It was kind of twisted
if you thought about it.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.350
From kindergarten to elementary school,
middle school, and high school...

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.430
We've known each other for a long time,

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.710
but until now, we've never
talked about how we really felt.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.480
From above!

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.360
That was close...

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.700
Don't make me think!

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.660
He's gonna get here before I land!

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.070
This is bad!

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.700
Repel his hand!

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.010
I don't even have time to catch my breath!

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.310
My way of fighting by predicting my
opponent's moves before acting takes too long!

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.310
My speed reacting after seeing the move...

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.320
It's gotten better than before...

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.150
It's only natural, but
I've gotten stronger...

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.370
What're you smiling about?!

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.640
I thought you weren't gonna be a sandbag!

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.830
I won't be one!

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.250
I'm sure you're up to something!

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.080
That's what makes me sick!

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.760
I can't tell what you're thinking!

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.180
No matter how much
I beat you up, you stick close!

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.470
Even though you were nothing,
it's like you're looking down on me!

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.190
That attitude you have
like you're better than me,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.690
like you're seriously gonna surpass me--

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.400
It's an eyesore!

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.320
Is... Is that what you thought?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.830
I mean, normally,
if someone keeps looking down on you,

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.750
you won't want anything
to do with them anymore.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:32.000
But like I said before,
because I had nothing at first,

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.010
along with the parts I hated about you,
I saw vividly all the amazing things you could do!

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.810
You, who had so much that I didn't have,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.980
were an amazing person much
closer to me than All Might!

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.750
He's much faster than earlier!

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.980
Since I was so emotional,
I lost control a bit.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.800
I'd been paying attention to keeping my
Full Cowling at 5% power this whole time.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.370
Surprisingly, I didn't realize
how much stronger my body had gotten.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.120
I won't make it. Guard!

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.050
Continuous whole body limit, raised to 8%.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.590
It's because I thought you were amazing...

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.470
That's why...

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.350
...I kept chasing after you!

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.020
"Katsuki Bakugo"
"Quirk: Explosion"
"He uses a nitroglycerin-like substance secreted on the palms of his hands to create explosions."

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.020
"Affiliation: U.A. High School Hero Class 1-A"
"Birthday: 4/20"
"Height: 172 cm" "Blood Type: A" "Likes: Spicy Food"

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.480
This is faster than I
thought I could do, too.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.230
From a continuous 5% to 8%
is not a dramatic change.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.230
But with that slight
difference, for an instant...

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.000
...I kept chasing after you!

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.640
You passed me...!

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.310
My direct hit didn't make it in time.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.520
You suddenly kicked in another gear--

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.120
Is that all you've got?!

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.700
This is gross, so I can't
tell you to your face, but...

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.370
I want to win and surpass you, you idiot!

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.270
When my feeling of "I have to beat you"
is stronger than "I have to save you,"

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.290
I inadvertently start spouting more insults.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.930
That's the part of you that I hate,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.010
but the image of "victory" I have inside me

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.180
is of you.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.470
I've got the upper hand in the air!

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.890
I didn't jump for no reason.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.980
Inside Kacchan's head, he's got
a strong imprint of my Shoot Style!

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.900
I'm not a nice enough guy to just go
along with your stress-relieving fight.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.370
Shoot Style was just to keep
my arms from getting too abused.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.200
I never said I couldn't use them at 5%!

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.960
I want to beat you, the
incarnation of victory!

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.360
Next, it's your turn.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.220
In order to meet the expectations
of All Might, who chose me!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.990
One day, I will make this Quirk my own

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.270
and beat you with my own power!

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.570
Li... Like I'll lose...!

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.470
I win...

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.940
All Might's power...

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.510
Even with that power...
even if you made that your own...

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.030
You still lost to me...

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.190
Hey...

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.610
Why did you lose...?

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.860
Stop there, you two.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.870
Sorry, but I overheard.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.290
All...

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.170
...Might...

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.880
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.020
I'm sorry I didn't notice...

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.080
It's too late...

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.490
Why Deku...?

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.290
It started when the sludge
villain came, right?

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.770
Why this guy...?

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.780
He was powerless,
but more heroic than anyone else.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.000
I thought you were strong.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.780
You were someone who could already compete.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.320
I decided that he should
also be able to stand in the ring.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.170
I'm weak, too, you know...!

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.430
I always wanted to be strong, like you!

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.370
It's because I'm weak...

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.130
...that I made you turn into that...!

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.030
This isn't your fault.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.030
Either way, my limit was close.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.890
I was always going to end up like this.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.330
You're strong.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.530
But I focused too much on your strength.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.150
I ended up making you bear that burden...

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.440
I'm sorry, even though
you're still young, too...

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.210
After being a hero for a long time,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.000
I've seen that being fixated
on victory like you, Young Bakugo

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.760
and wanting to save those in
trouble like you, Young Midoriya...

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.510
If either of those feelings is missing,

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.680
then a hero won't be able to carry out
the justice he wants to carry out.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.530
Like how you, Young Midoriya,
admired Young Bakugo's strength,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.690
and how you, Young Bakugo,
feared Young Midoriya's heart...

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.010
Now that your feelings are out in the open,

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.640
I think you both understand.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.330
If you both recognize each other

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.040
and can focus on making each other stronger,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.250
then you can save people
to win and win to save people,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.380
becoming the greatest heroes.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:54.350
That's not... what I wanted to hear...

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.930
You...

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.310
...had the strongest guy
lay the groundwork for you.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.650
Don't lose.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.760
I'll get stronger,

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.160
so I can beat you.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.870
Who knows about you and Deku?

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.790
Recovery Girl and the principal...

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.270
Of the students, it's just you.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.340
You don't want this to get out,
do you, All Might?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.540
Since it sounds like you're trying
to hide this, I won't tell anyone.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.550
I won't expose your secret
like damn Deku here.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.970
I'll keep it between us.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.380
Kacchan...

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.880
I should be bowing and
begging you to keep this secret.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.360
Just how much will I need you
to be considerate for my sake...?

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.720
Sorry, thanks.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.240
I'm not being considerate.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.200
It's just too big a risk with too many
drawbacks to spread this around.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.210
Now that it's come to this, I must explain
enough to satisfy you, as well, Young Bakugo.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.010
That is only reasonable.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.310
All Might told Kacchan--

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.700
About the power passed down from one generation
to the next to stand against a great evil.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.840
About how he became the number one hero
and Symbol of Peace with that power.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.230
About how he was gravely
injured and neared his limit.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.020
And...

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.470
...about how he selected his successor.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.570
Basically, if this is exposed, there'd be confusion
about where the power is and stuff, huh?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.350
Jeez, damn Deku,
why'd you have to go and tell me for?

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.700
My using up all my power was my own choice.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.830
I said this earlier,

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.320
but it was not your fault.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.830
In the end...

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.870
...it doesn't change what I have to do.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.800
I'll become a hero that surpasses even you!

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.380
Yeah, you're right.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.470
But unlike what I've been
doing until now, Deku--

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.900
"Hero Analysis for the Future"

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.020
Like how you've been watching me and

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.900
everything around you and
absorbing it to get stronger,

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.400
I'll also make everything my own to go higher.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.690
Higher than even you, the chosen one.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.620
Th... Then, I'll go even higher than that!

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.450
I have to get higher than you!

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.660
I said, I'm gonna surpass you!

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.830
And I'm saying that I need
to go higher than that!

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.730
What?!

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:36.080
They've become proper
rivals now, unlike before.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.260
The secret I had with All Might

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.010
became a secret three of us shared.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.560
And--

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.230
To fight the night you finish
the preliminary hero licensing exam--

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.740
I'm glad you two are so energetic.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.990
Aizawa, wait, hold up
with the restraints. I'm the cause.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.300
Huh?

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.410
What, All Might? It's
Midoriya and Bakugo again.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.160
I heard they were fighting
in the practice field...

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.920
Yes, about that--

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.800
I've known those two since
before they came to U.A.,

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.050
and I've thought about them a lot.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.490
Will you leave them to me?

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.840
I'll bring them back right away.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.970
Cause? Of what?

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.850
Young Bakugo felt responsible
for my retirement.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.020
He had to face the exam
with those pent-up feelings,

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.970
and in the end,
his inferiority complex exploded.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.320
It was because I didn't realize
and was negligent in his mental care...

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.170
It was a fight brought about
by the failure of adults...

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.490
So they had no choice but to break the rules.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.540
But I can't just let it go.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.780
I will give a suitable punishment.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.000
Who hit first?

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.050
Me.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.300
I also went in pretty hard.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.180
Four days of house arrest for Bakugo!
Three days for Midoriya!

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.520
During that time, you must clean all the
common areas in the dorm, morning and night!

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.600
Plus, you have to turn in a written apology!

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.310
For your injuries, if the pain gets worse
or doesn't go away, go to the infirmary!

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.820
But don't rely on the old lady's Quirk!

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.780
Injuries you got on your own
should be healed that way!

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.420
That's all! Go to sleep!

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.170
What?!

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.540
You guys fought...

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.920
...and now you're under house arrest?!

00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.920
That's dumb!

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.790
It's nonsense.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.880
Are you stupid?

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.010
The pinnacle of stupidity.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.880
So, did you guys make up?

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.590
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.790
It wasn't so much "make up," as...

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.100
Hmm... It's hard to put into words...

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.600
You're lucky you got away with house arrest.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.560
That means you two will miss the
opening ceremony we're going to now.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.070
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.940
Bakugo, what're you doing about the
extra classes for the provisional license?

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.360
Shut up! It has nothing to do with you!

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.450
Thanks for cleaning, then!

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.980
About my Shoot Style...

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.750
How was it...?

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.570
The motions when you're
preparing to do a move are too big.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.430
Even when you got faster,
I was able to just barely react in time.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.960
It's not good for a slugfest.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.960
I see...

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.200
When you used it with
your punch, it made me mad.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.640
I see...!

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.000
Here's the preview!

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.170
U.A. High's second semester has begun.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.380
After the Hosu incident, the training camp,
and the provisional licensing exam,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.800
we have grown a lot.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.470
We'll use the results of
that growth in our work studies!

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.000
But I didn't realize

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.790
that with the retirement of All Might,
the villains who had been hiding

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.300
started to become more active.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.730
Next time, "A Season for Encounters"!

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.540
This is the story of how I met the
Big Three who stand at the top of U.A.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.580
"Next time: A Season for Encounters"

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.160
Go beyond!

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.770
Plus Ultra!
