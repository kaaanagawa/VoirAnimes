WEBVTT

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.560
Kota's parents were killed
in the line of duty

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.630
two years ago...
protecting citizens from a villain...

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.140
For a hero, it was a respectable
way to die... an honorable death.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.920
But...

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.640
P-Papa... Mama...

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.790
But a child barely aware of what was
around him couldn't understand that.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.540
"My parents left me behind..."

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.400
But society kept praising them, saying it was
a good thing for heroes... a wonderful thing.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.550
To Kota, heroes are a kind of human
he can't understand and finds unpleasant.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.560
But you know what, Kota?

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.120
I'm sure there will be a day
where you will meet someone,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.410
and then you'll understand.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.140
Someone who will risk
their life to save you...

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.460
"Kota Izumi"

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.360
Someone who will be...

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.590
There's no way anyone like that exists...

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.050
Why...?

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.930
Why are there villains here?!

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.470
Pixie-Bob!

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.100
Oh, no!

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.100
"Pro Hero - Mandalay - Quirk: Telepath"
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.160
Kota!

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.070
"5 Minutes Earlier"

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.900
Aw, we wanted our courage tested, too...

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.530
Didn't she say there was a carrot and a stick?
Where's the carrot?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.120
I'd even take salty licorice...
give us a treat, Mr. Aizawa...

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.660
Salty licorice is delicious.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.670
For tonight's lesson, I will drill into
you how to behave during an emergency.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.010
If you don't become more self-aware
that you're falling behind the others,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.670
then the difference
between you will grow larger.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.720
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.630
In a broad sense,
this is also a kind of "treat."

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.680
Like a mint-flavored one.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.060
"Hanta Sero" "Rikido Sato"
"Denki Kaminari" "Mina Ashido" "Eijiro Kirishima"

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.060
But mint tastes good...

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.100
Oh, that's weird!

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.140
Even though Class A is supposed to be better,
there were five people who failed?

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.140
Even though there was
only one person from Class B?

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.110
"Neito Monoma" "Pro Hero - Vlad King"

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.810
--That's so weird!
--Just how mentally strong are you?!

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.760
He said the same thing
trying to provoke us yesterday.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.530
I'd like to know what his mental state is.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.200
Vlad, I want to add some
practice maneuvers this time.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.450
I was thinking about that, too.
You don't have to tell me that--

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.780
Everyone!

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.620
It's Mandalay's Telepath.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.420
I like this. It makes me jump.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.070
It only works in one direction,
though, so it's kind of annoying...

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.030
Quiet.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.910
We're being attacked by two villains!

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.590
It's possible that there are more!

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.550
Everyone who can move,
get back to camp immediately!

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.430
Even if you come across the enemy,
retreat and do not engage!

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.180
--Vlad, I'm leaving this place to you.
--Huh? Why are villains here...?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.970
--I'll go protect the other students!
--Wasn't this place supposed to be a secret?

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.690
I don't want to think
about what could happen...

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.160
This is bad...

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.650
Is your worry taking precedence, Eraser?

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.480
Vla--

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.820
Don't get in my way, pro hero.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.240
"Villain - Dabi"

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.490
You guys aren't the ones we want.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.710
How are you this evening, U.A. High School?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.460
We are the Vanguard Action Squad
of the League of Villains!

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.750
The League of Villains?!

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.260
Why are they here...?

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.380
Shall I crush this girl's head?
What d'you think?

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.010
Well, what do you think?

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.760
Like I'd let you, you--

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.100
Wait up, Big Sis Mag! Don't be hasty.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.640
You too, Tiger. Calm down.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.980
It all depends on whether having power over
life and death follows Stain's tenets or not.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.060
Stain...!

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.530
So you're the ones his ideology brought?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.530
"Koji Koda - Quirk: Anivoice"
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.070
That's right!

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.570
I'm--

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.530
Oh yeah, you, with the glasses!

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.080
You were the one who brought
about the end of Stain at Hosu City.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.080
I apologize for the late introduction.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.830
I'm Spinner, the one who
will spin his dreams into reality!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.840

"Pro Hero - Tiger - Quirk: Pliabody"

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.430

worrying about getting married recently.

"Pro Hero - Pixie-Bob - Quirk: Earthflow"

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.980
She was doing her best to find
happiness as a woman, despite her age.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.190
You can't damage that woman's face

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.520
and then just stand there
laughing thoughtlessly about it!

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.780
What's a hero doing trying to
be happy like the average person?!

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.700
Tiger! I've broadcast instructions.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.780
Leave the safety of
the other students to Ragdoll.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.950
The two of us will hold them back here!

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.450
Go, everyone!

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.660
Listen carefully. Do not fight.
Class rep, you're in charge!

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.410
Understood!

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.670

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.630
Go on ahead!

--Mandalay!
--What are you saying?
--Midoriya?!

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.380

was nearby and made them for us!

"Yosetsu Awase"

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.770

Take one! We got a bunch!

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.240
Thanks!

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.530
We need to get back to camp.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.950
It's dangerous out here since
we don't know where the villains are.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.950
No, I'm going to fight, too.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.450

What? She said not to fight!

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.500
You're always rebuking Monoma,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.550
but didn't you feel it
in your heart somewhere?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.150
The difference between our class and Class A?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.640
I've been feeling it!

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.760
We got into U.A. with the same exam,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.430
studying the same curriculum.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.810
What's the difference?

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.180
It's obvious!

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.730
What they had that we didn't...

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.600
...crisis!

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.570
They turned their crises into chances!

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.150
It's only natural!

Don't try to stop me, Kendo.

Hero course Class 1-B!
If we don't stand now, then when will we?

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.830
I'll definitely find the villains and
beat the living daylights out of them!

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.420
Can you hear my Telepath?

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.800
Hurry up and come back to camp!

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.180
I'm sorry! I don't know
where you usually go off to...

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.880
I'm sorry, Kota! I can't go save you!

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.480
Come back as soon as you can!

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.940
I tried searching somewhere with a nice view,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.850
and I ended up finding
a face not on our list.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.530
Hey, by the way,
you've got a nice hat there, kid.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.370
Trade with me for this lame mask.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.910
They made me wear this toy since I'm new,

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.070
saying they couldn't get
the shipment in time or something.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.710
Oh, hey.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.920
Let me get a shot in to cheer up!

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.710

But the couple's bright lives
were cut short by a single cruel criminal.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:30.190
The suspect is still on the run,
and police and heroes are on his trail.

contact the police or a hero immediately...

In addition, the suspect is thought
to have sustained an injury on his left eye

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.590

Hm? You were on the list.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.940
I came to keep him from
coming into contact with a villain...

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.990
I can't believe a villain
ended up right here!

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.150
Damn it, my cellphone
broke from that just now.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.030
I came here without telling anyone...

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.870
Which means, I can't hope
for any reinforcements like last time...

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.000
There's just me... just me...

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.250
I have to do something
about this villain by myself...

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.840
Can I do it while protecting
Kota at the same time...?

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.430
No, I can't think like that.
I just have to do it.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.800
Right now, with the power I have!

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.600
It's... It's going to be okay, Kota.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.940

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.510
That's...

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.100
Hey, who was in front of us?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.560
Tokoyami and...

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.690
...Shoji.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.730
So pretty... so pretty...

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.390
No, I have to work... I was captivated...

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.660
Oh, no... what beautiful flesh...

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.130
Oh, don't tempt me...

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.870
I have a job to do...

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.040
Don't fight?

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.670
You fake heroes who only
care about yourselves

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.920
are targets to be purged!

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.090
Spinner, even though
you're a villain, you're pretty cool.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.760
You're face is my type.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.390
Huh?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.180
What're you getting embarrassed about?

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.100
How innocent!

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.310
That was a dirty trick, you harlot!

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.150
Come here, pet kitty.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.650
I won't fall for the same thing twice!

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.780
Kenji Hikiishi. Villain name: Magne.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.040
Nine counts of aggravated robbery,
three murders, and 29 attempted murders!

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.790
Oh my, am I famous?

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.420
What did you come here for, criminal?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.590
Tiger, something's off!

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.540
I still haven't gotten
a response from Ragdoll!

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.130
Normally, she would have replied right away.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.890
Oh my...

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.560
I wonder why that is...

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.190
You'll definitely save him?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.980
That sounds just like what someone
who wants to be a hero would say.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.860
Your kind show up everywhere,
talking about justice.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.950
You're the one called Midoriya, right?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.790
This is perfect.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.960
We were told to take
the initiative and kill you.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.750
I'll make sure to torment you thoroughly,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.250
so show me your blood!

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.370
He's coming!

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.260
Whoops.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.350
I almost forgot. If you know, tell me...

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.890
...where's the kid called Bakugo?

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.060
Kacchan?!

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.180
I still have to do my job.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.860
They're after Kacchan?!

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.570
Why?

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.440
Can I take that as an "I don't know"?

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.490
I can, right?

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.490
All right, then--

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.390
Let's play!

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.960
Blood!

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.330
This is great!
It's what I wanted! This is so fun!

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.590
What'd you say earlier?
That you'd definitely save him?

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.340
Why are you running away?

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.670
You're so weird!

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.460
That muscle-like Quirk
is so fast... so strong...!

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.060
I can't think about Kacchan right now...!

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.770
I have to focus!

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.430
Focus on the enemy in front of me!

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.190
Smash...!

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.190
What? That's your Quirk?

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.780
You're pretty fast,
but not nearly strong enough!

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.660
My Quirk lets me power-up my muscles!

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.750
I increase my speed and strength by
increasing the amount of muscle fibers so much

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.830
they can't be contained by my skin!

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.250
What am I trying to say?

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.250
I'm bragging!

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:44.130
In other words, you are a
completely inferior version of me!

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.300
Do you understand how I feel?

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.850
I can't help but laugh!

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.890
You'll definitely save him?

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.520
How'll you do that?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.980
Don't just spout lip service
you can't actually pull off!

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.280
Be honest with yourself!

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.240
Water Hose...

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.160
Papa... Mama...

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.220
Did you torment them like that,
too, before you killed them?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.710
Huh? Seriously?

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.960
Your parents were heroes?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.050
This must be fate!

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.430
Water Hose... It's thanks to them
that my left eye is an artificial eye now.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.510
It's your fault...

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.820
It's because of guys like you...

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.540
...that it always, always
turns out like this!

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.310
Kids are always shifting the blame like that.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.980
That's no good.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.360
It's not like I have a grudge about
this eye or anything, you know.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.190
I just wanted to kill.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.830
And those two wanted to stop me.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.830
It was the result of all
of us doing what we wanted.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.080
What's wrong is wanting to
do something you are unable to do.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.420
Like your mommy and daddy!

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.630
Which means, you're coming
now aren't you, you piece of trash!

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.160
You're the one who's wrong!

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.270
I got him! Now it doesn't
matter how fast he is!

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.480
And then what? You gonna punch
me with that weak arm of yours?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.940
It's not a matter of whether
or not I can do it!

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.320
A hero's job...

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.860
...is to risk his life to
make the lip service into reality!

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.910
What...?

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.490
One For All 100%!

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.700
He's different from earlier...

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.710
Smash...!

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.220
Sorry...

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.010
...for blowing you away, too...

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.350
Th-Thank--

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.040
Why...?

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.280
Let's get back to camp...
It's not far from here...

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.450
No way...

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.780
It can't be...

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.330
I was at 100%...

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.250
It was the same as All Might's power...

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.670
That punch was too obvious.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.210
But that wasn't bad, Midoriya!

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.970
G-Get away!

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.260
Naw, I feel like attacking
now, all of a sudden.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.430
It's no good!

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.430
What should I do?

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.100
Think. I need time to think...!

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.310
Wh-What are you trying to do?

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.850
What's the League of Villains after?

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.060
How should I know? I just want to fight.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.570
As long as I can stretch my wings
and unleash my Quirk, I don't care.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.150
Do you remember?
Up until just now, we were just playing.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.860
I said so, didn't I? "Let's play"?

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.240
Right? I said!

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.280
But I'm done.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.200
Playtime's over.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.610
'Cause you're pretty strong.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.960
Now, I'm gonna look at you seriously.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.340
Kota, grab on, quickly!

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.680
It doesn't even compare to earlier!

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.390
His speed and his power...

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.390
He was just playing...!

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.350
He was really just toying
with me as he tried to kill me!

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.440
Aw, damn it, I got too excited.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.450
If we get back to camp,
then Mr. Aizawa should be there.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.830
If Mr. Aizawa can erase his Quirk...

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.580
Don't get scared.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.410
Can you get him to follow as far
as the camp without getting caught?

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.410
Impossible.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.790
You're still tired from the training.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.290
Don't think!

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.500
If you show your back to the enemy
in this state, then you'll just become prey.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.340
You have no choice but to fight
and win right here, right now!

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.970
This is the only path
you can take, Izuku Midoriya!

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.930
You're gonna save him, right?!

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.970
Remember where you came from!

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.690
Stay back, Kota.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.400
And then, when it hits,
you run as fast as you can back to camp.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.150
"When it hits"? Don't tell me you're...!

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.950
It won't work! Let's run!

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.030
Your attack didn't work earlier!

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.830
Besides, both your arms are broken...

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.540
It's okay.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.210
One For All, 100%!

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.340
Midoriya!

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.770
Detroit...

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.510
...Smash!

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.810
Ow...

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.390
What's wrong?

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.060
That was weaker than before!

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:56.070
...fine... It's fine...!

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.120
I will not let him past me!

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.950
So... run!

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.450
Run...!

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.830
This kid...

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.500
Man, you're the best!

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:17.670
Shut up...!

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.010
Why...?

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.640
Show me...

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.470
...your blood!

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.100
A hero...

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.400
...can always break out of a tough spot!

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.320
Sorry, Mom!

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.030
Mom, I'm sorry!

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.990
All Might! All Might!

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.360
All Migh...

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.080
I'm gonna crush you!

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.010
What, water?

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.010
St... Stop it...!

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.140
Kota!

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:09.310
Later, 'kay? 'Kay?
I'll kill you later, so just wait--

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.300
In the instant I was distracted...

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.400
As if...

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.110
Wait, are you getting stronger?

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.900
...I'd let you kill him!

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.910
One For All, 1,000,000%!

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.870
Delaware...

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.870
...Detroit...

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:41.320
...Smash!

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.910
Why...?

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:59.150
Kota, about your mommy
and daddy, Water Hose...

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.650
It's true that they ended
up leaving you behind.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:07.620
But there were definitely lives saved
because of what happened to them.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.290
Even though you don't know anything...

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.170
I'm sure someday you'll meet someone,

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.510
and then you'll understand.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.510
Even though you don't know anything,

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.080
why did you do so much...?

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.890
Someone who'll risk their life to save you...

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.420
Someone who will be...

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.860
My...

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.490
My hero.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.950
"My Hero"

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Preview"

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.670
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.550
I was able to drive away
Muscular's fierce attack and protect Kota.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.720
But the villains' attack has also reached
Kendo and the others from Class B...

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.950
Next time, "Drive It Home, Iron Fist!!!"

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:36.610
"Next time: Drive It Home, Iron Fist!!!"

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.190
Go beyond!

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.130
Plus Ultra!
