00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.230
The prestigious school that turned
out many heroes, U.A. High School.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.340
Enrolled in their hero course,
I continue to run toward my dream,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.740
standing up to any difficulties
and saving people with a smile...

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.470
...in order to become the greatest hero!

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.140
Of course we watched it!

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.340
A Quirk that makes things bigger, huh?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.090
That's not all!

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.360
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.610
Even if I couldn't melt all of it...

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.190
It didn't affect it at all?!

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.950
That's because they're not
made of ordinary metal.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.660
They're made of tungsten, which can
take super high temperatures!

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.540
Didn't I tell you, Todoroki?

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.830
Even if you're a U.A.
student, acting alone...

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.210
...shows you're overconfident.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.960
Then--

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.380
Do it!

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.220
Right!

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.180
Keep after him!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560
Got it!

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.650
Water for the flames and
physical attacks for the ice...

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.780
They've worked out
a counterattack for everything.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.820
It's useless!

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.290
Where'd he go?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.080
The Heroes Public Safety Commission must've
made a factory like this for the test on purpose.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.130
Telling us to fight using the idiosyncrasies
of the buildings and terrain.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.090
There he is! Surround him!

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.970
In that case, there must be...

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.300
...the real thing, in the tank.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.140
He got us!

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.410
That bastard... He's crazy...

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.160
It looks like the commission kept
the force of the explosion down.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.000
B-Bastard...!

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.260
Sorry.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.920
I can't afford to fail.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.380
"Class 1-A"

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.930
Simultaneous activation of left and right...

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.180
I need to practice more.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.590
It slows me down.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.810
Those who have passed should
go to the waiting room.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.310
Hurry.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.860
The targets send information about
who passes and who fails!

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.950
They recognize the balls and the
wearers and can tell who hit whom

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.700
based on distance, movement,
and various other factors!

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.620
Also, once mounted, they can only
be removed with a special magnetic key!

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.040
It's super high-tech!

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.270
Miss Sai, I have confirmed that four
U.A. students have entered the building.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.180
Can you show me the video?

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.280
Yes, ma'am.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.180
Arm duplication, the sound wave user, frog...

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.270
...and a Quirk that makes things.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.450
Our prey has been decided.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.120
Will you gather everyone?

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.950
Yes, Miss Sai.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.460
The formula for my success...

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.670
...is already complete.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.880
There are a lot of people here.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.770
Seriously?!

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.140
"Inasa Yoarashi - Quirk: Whirlwind"

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.470
I love Stampman, too!

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.430
He's a super passionate hero!

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.810
Why's he talking to me out of the blue?

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.810
If he applied through recommendations,
then I should've seen him at the entrance exam.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.420
But I think--

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.440
Wait, what were we talking about?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.780
How should I know?

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.680
You're the one who started talking to me.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.370
Currently, 56 people have passed.
Don't panic, but please hurry and do your best.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.870
Shoji, how's it look?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.630
It's no use. I don't see
anyone from our class.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.960
Maybe they're in a different area.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.130
Most likely.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.920
Yaoyorozu, you heard the broadcast, right?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.010
The number who've passed
is already past the halfway mark.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.470
We should probably give up
on finding everyone else

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.430
and start fighting ourselves,
don't you think?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.270
"Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation"

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.140
Yes, you're right...

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.760
Shh!

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.310
"Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack"

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.810
I hear footsteps from
four people on the stairs,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.060
about ten floors below.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.360
They're coming up!

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.540
Are they after us?

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.520
It bothers me that there
are only four coming.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.370
All the schools should be moving
in bigger teams than that.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.710
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"
"Mezo Shoji - Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.960
Maybe their companions were defeated,
and they're running away to hide here.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.120
No, that's not what it sounds like.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.170
They're still climbing up.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.550
There must be more of them.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.260
A distraction?

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.530
Or...

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.760
Jiro!

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.220
There's music!

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.900
I'm fine, but hearing this suddenly
would've been hard on Jiro.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.150
So they know Kyoka's Quirk and are
interfering with it on purpose.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.480
They must be after us, then.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.650
This is bad.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.410
Now we can't tell where our opponents are...

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.660
Phase one, complete.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.040
Next, begin phase two.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.460
What's that?!

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.040
Hide!

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.880
Attacks from outside?

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.150
This is...

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.130
Are they trying to keep me
from using my eyes, too?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.010
The first thing they did was
seal off Jiro and Shoji's Quirks,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.300
which are good for finding the enemy.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.310
Whoever we're up against knows
exactly what our Quirks are...

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.540
Yaoyorozu, what is our opponent after?

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.540
They're probably trying
to keep us rooted here.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.920
And then they'll surround us, huh?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.180
Yes, we should probably assume
that they're already close by.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.330
Then we need to fight!

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.450
We can't move carelessly!

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.610
Heartbeat Dist--!

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.630
Phase two, complete.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.750
Jiro!

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.300
Are you hurt?

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.020
They got my amp! And my left ear...

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.220
They predicted her actions?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.000
They were able to predict our actions
so accurately after only seeing that one attack...

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.280
And this careful plan...

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.130
There must be someone extremely
intelligent among our opponents.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.860
Does it feel a little colder to you?

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.350
Now that you mention it, yes...

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.200
There's cold air coming from the vents!

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.280
Begin phase three.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.210
They've shut us in?!

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.960
The temperature's also decreasing steadily.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.670
I-It's too cold!

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.970
R... Ribbit, ribbit...

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.880
Asui, what's wrong?

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.760
Could it be that since the
temperature dropped all at once,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.720
she's started getting ready for hibernation?

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.430
Ribbit...

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.310
Fire! Make a lighter.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:09.270
I can't. The sprinklers will turn on,
making her body even colder.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.400
Then what about an electric heater?

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.550
Our opponents have control
over the air conditioner.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.530
They probably turned off
the electricity, as well.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.570
Here's a blanket for now!

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.370
All right.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.780
What now?!

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.720
They're welding the door shut!

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.880
So they're trying to keep us from escaping?

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.550
The door over there's the only one left.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.730
Should we force our way through?

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.550
Our opponents are definitely
waiting for us there.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.130
It's dangerous.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.970
They keep being one step ahead of us.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.640
What should we do?

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.640
If we holed up here, we'd have to do
something about the temperature,

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.770
or else we'd also be done in by the cold.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.900
Yao-momo, what if you made a bomb and
blew up the door to the emergency exit?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.410
That might cause a phreatic explosion.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.780
They probably knew we'd think of it.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.820
That's why they sealed off the observation
room and lowered the temperature.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.740
No way...

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.170
Think, Momo.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.740
Think of a way to get out of this situation.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.160
With one ear injured, Jiro can't use
her sound attacks to the fullest.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.880
In that case, should we
break the wall to escape...?

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.680
No, our opponents probably already have
something prepared for such a simple move.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.140
For now, we need to do something
about the air conditioning.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.890
Can I make clay to seal off the vents?

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.060
From what I can see,
there are eight vents...

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.960
I would end up using a lot of my Quirk,
but right now, that's all I can do...!

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.070
Miss Sai, phase three is complete.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.090
Then, let us wait for a while.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.830
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.660
The current problem facing U.A. High
is the air conditioning in the observation room.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.920
In order to solve that, they must use
the Quirk of that student called Yaoyorozu.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.920
Her Quirk uses the lipids
from inside her body.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.800
In other words, there is a limit
to how much she can make.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.810
We'll make her use up her Quirk
and render all four of their Quirks useless.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.950
That is my plan...

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.730
...my formula for success.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.690
"Saiko Intelli - Quirk: IQ"

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.440
Seiai Academy, second year, Saiko Intelli!

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.690
Quirk: IQ!

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.950
After she drinks tea, when she
closes her eyes, her IQ multiplies.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.780
Her IQ is already 150 to start with,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.790
so she becomes a super genius!

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.080
By the way, there's a difference in effect
based on the brand of tea she drinks!

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.010
Now, use your Quirk.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.940
That will be the end of you all.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.390
Now, use your Quirk.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.030
That will be...

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.360
What's wrong, Yao-momo?

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.850
Why did you stop your Creation?

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.340
No matter how many times I think
about it, I get the same answer.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.100
Our opponents are trying
to get me to use up my Quirk.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.910
They're trying to make you
use up your Quirk?

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:08.540
Yes.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.880
In their plan, the most uncertain
factor is my Creation.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:20.510
At first, I thought their manipulation
of the air conditioning was for Asui's Quirk.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.060
But their true goal was
to make me use my Quirk.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.970
I see.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.430
They were planning to march in calmly
after making your Quirk useless, huh?

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.350
Yes. That's why I cannot
use my Quirk right now.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.820
I must save it for when
the need truly arises.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.650
But if we stay holed up here, then we'll
fail the provisional licensing exam!

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.070
We should force our way through!

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.780
I'm sure our opponents have predicted
that that's what we will do.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.290
Then what are you suggesting?

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:56.710
At times like this, what would
Todoroki do? Or Iida? Or Midoriya..?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.000
I don't know myself, either,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.800
but after hearing that I could
still reach, I couldn't just sit still...

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.680
I can't help thinking
that I want to save him.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.140
That's right.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.980
I have to save them...

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.600
Shoji, Jiro, and Asui...

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.610
Forget about the provisional exam.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.980
Just focus on saving them for now. Just that!

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.510
In order to do that...

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.130
In order to do that, I need...

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.780
Everyone, please bear with the
current conditions for a few minutes.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.080
--Yao-momo!
--Please!

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.790
What, headphones?

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.180
Please put them on.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.210
It's the first time I'm making this device,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.410
but its structure is not that complicated.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.890
I'll save just enough lipids to move

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.810
and make it as big... as big as possible...

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.730
This is...

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.830
It's been ten minutes since they
holed up in the observation room.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.440
It is probably about time.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.450
Ready yourselves to storm in.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.720
Yes, ma'am!

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.240
Now, I wonder what the situation is inside?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.510
I'm looking forward to it.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.830
Wh-What...?!

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.880
Th-This is...

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.130
...a high-frequency sound attack?

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.970
Even with headphones on,
I can feel it throughout my body...

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.890
R... Ribbit...

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.560
Are you all right, Asui?

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.980
E-Everyone, please bear with it
for seven more seconds...

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:44.940
Six... five... four... three... two... one...

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.030
All right! It worked!

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.910
Put your balls in the targets.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.580
Got it.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.990
Can you move?

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.830
R-Ribbit...

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.000
I'm fine...

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.290
I'm glad.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.420
Wait--!

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.260
You used your Quirk for attacking
rather than defending...

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.100
I can't believe someone from the elite U.A.
would choose a method with such high risk.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.260
But because of that, you can't move now.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.020
Even if I can only get you,
I'll have you fail.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.020
You can't give up!

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.990
Show the results of the intensive training
at the training camp, Momo!

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.080
You're struggling in vain!

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.910
Ribbit!

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.940
Wha--?!

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.540
E-Everyone!

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.000
Why did you come back...?

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.420
Didn't you think she failed already?

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.420
Right now, we're in the
middle of the licensing exam.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.300
You should be thinking
of yourselves, not your friends.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.510
That might be true for you,
but we're different.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.810
We won't leave our friend behind.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.810
And we don't give up.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.560
If I have to choose one or the other...

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.730
...I want to save both of them!

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.470
That's right. Like Midoriya...

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.930
That's how we, Class 1-A, are!

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.710
As expected of U.A....

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.200
You've defeated me completely.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.550
Kaminari, why'd you follow us?

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.220
'Cause you guys started running!

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.260
I was lonely, so I ended up following you!

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.800
Shut up!

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.430
What's with that tone of voice?

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.430
I told you to stop that, Bakugo.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.060
It looks like there are
a bunch of people up there,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.730
so the three of us should work together--

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.600
No way!

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.480
I told you to stop saying that...

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:45.530
Look out!

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.230
Kirishima!

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.470
Damn it, let go...!

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.490
Wh-What the heck is that?!

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.410
What happened?!

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.240
Basically, that bastard did it, right?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.240
"Seiji Shishikura"

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.080
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.080
I'll kill you.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.170
More people have passed.
We are now at 60 people.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.410
It'll be over once another 40 have passed.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.840
People are passing in groups.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.510
This is bad. What should we do?

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.300
Yeah... I could tell after we were attacked,

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.300
"Hanta Sero - Quirk: Tape"
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.180
but at least we can probably do something
about the group that's near by.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.390
Huh? That's amazing! What do you mean?

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.000
There was someone who was trying
to get a head start on the others.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.900
I'll take her out!

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.150
Hey, wait!

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.070
He was probably panicking.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.990
Since if a large group
is going after a small number,

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.390
they would end up fighting over the prey.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.160
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.740
Oh, so if they keep leaving, then
their numbers will slowly dwindle,

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.070
and they'll be at a disadvantage.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.210
Then why were you saying we should
all stay together, Midoriya?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.880
In the first place, we were told
to hit targets with balls,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.050
so it's easy to think of
this as target practice,

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.090
but without knowing what
our opponents' Quirks are,

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.590
it's not easy or efficient to go after
moving targets that are being protected.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.620
That's why I wanted to first restrain
enough people for everyone to pass

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.350
and then use the balls only after
they couldn't move anymore.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.770
Class A has a lot of people
who excel at zone control,

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.030
so I thought we could do it, but...

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.470
I see...

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.610
It's true that if we were
just doing target practice,

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.990
they'd only be able to tell whether or not
we were good at hitting targets,

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.450
so this might be what they're
really trying to test.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.410
Shh! Wait a sec!

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.230
Don't they sound like they're getting closer?

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.550
What should we do?

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.540
I'll go out.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.090
What?

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:38.760
I'll be the decoy, so you two should find openings
to restrain as many enemies as you can.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.100
Your Quirks are better for
keeping people restrained.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.350
Decoy...

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.100
We've got three people, so we'd need...

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.100
There's no way...

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:49.810
Roger.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.850
What?

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.110
Let's do it, Sero!

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.820
Fine!

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.240
I trust him. Deku's pulled through
enough times that I know I can.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.330
All right, let's go!

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.900
We Shiketsu students are obliged
to wear our uniform hats when working.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.140
Why?

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.210
That is because each and
every one of our movements

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.220
"Denki Kaminari - Quirk: Electrification"

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.830
is crowned with the traditions of
the name of Shiketsu High School.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.520
This is a demonstration of power.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.590
We have placed great importance on obligation
and dignity since the start of our education,

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.480
creating a great difference in level
between us and you vulgar and ordinary folk

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.060
aspiring to become heroes
the way you are.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.480
I hate your type.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.980
What'd he say?

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.440
I can't process what he's saying!

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.660
He said that his eyes are too small, so he can't
see the true strength of his opponents.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.530
My eyes are handsome and long in length!

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.160
Hey, it looks like that's
a sore spot for him!

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.250
Stop saying stuff like that!

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.250
U.A. High School. I respect the school.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.920
I take pride that we are counted as equals.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.720
However, you lot continuously act in ways
that cause its dignity to decline.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.260
He's gonna do that thing again!

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.180
That gross thing!

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.890
Shut up!

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.280
"Obligation"?

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:09.990
"Dignity"?

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.190
You just won't stop talking...

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.530
Show us with your actions,
not your mouth, sir.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.820
Especially you, Bakugo!

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.500
Draw our opponents in as much as possible
and make them gather in one place--

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.330
Want some gum?

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.170
It's the kind that traps your finger, right?

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.170
No thanks.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.170
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"
"Pro Hero - Ms. Joke - Quirk: Outburst"

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:42.050
It's frustrating not being able to see
who failed and who passed, though.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:47.180
Our Shindo made it even harder to see
by splitting open the ground, too.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.060
Hm? What? What? Are you worried?

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.440
There's something I realized after
watching Class A for a while.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.440
They might not have realized it,
but in Class A,

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.530
there are two people whose
presence has a big effect.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.490
They're not leaders, or the most popular,

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.000
and the two of them don't get along at all.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.500
But...

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.420
...before I knew it, their passion
spread to the rest of the class.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:24.630
It's strange, but one of them is always
at the center of any major event.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.390
Joke, I'm not worried.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.270
I can't wait to see what they'll do.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.020
Even if they're not
physically with everyone,

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.000
their presence raises the
standard for the whole class.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.780
You've fallen for them hard, huh?

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.150
Gross.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.160
That is my class...

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.330
...Class 1-A!

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
"Preview"

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.790
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.500
The first test of the provisional
licensing exam is in its second half!

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.800
Everyone taking the test
is fighting desperately.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.210
I can't lose!

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.040
Next time, "RUSH!"

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:36.620
"Next time"

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.210
Go beyond!

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.640
Plus Ultra!
