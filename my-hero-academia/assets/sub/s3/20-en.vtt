WEBVTT

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.230
"Pro Hero - All Might - Quirk: One For All"

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.480
I am here...

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.010
...wearing yellow clothes
to match Young Midoriya's!

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.850
"Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All"

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.070
All Might, what's going on?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.400
Those of us in Class 1-A of U.A. High

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.570
are supposed to be in the middle
of our provisional licensing exam.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.410
That's right! Can't wait to find
out what's going to happen next, right?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.450
But why don't we forget about that for now?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.280
Why?

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.500
You know, we have to save people, right?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.500
With love!

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.750
Yeah, but why?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.500
You're no good at this.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.170
You've gotta have fun while you can!

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.720
Go beyond existing procedure!

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.140
Plus Ultra!

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.260
This episode of
My Hero Academia is a special story!

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.470
We will bring you "Save the World with Love!"

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.020
And now, let's start the opening!

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
"End of July Before Training Camp"

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.320
Morning.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.450
"Pro Hero - Cementoss - Quirk: Cement"
"Pro Hero - Midnight - Quirk: Somnambulist"

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.160
Good morning.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.080
They're airing a special
on you on TV right now.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.040
On me?

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.020
How did the Symbol of Peace,
All Might, become the number one hero?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.680
"Special: What is the yet unknown
past of the invincible All Might?"

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.970
To find out, we look back on
his time studying abroad in America...

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.010
I am here!

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.720
That takes me back.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.180
How many years ago was that?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.100
Hiding your age with coughing?
What are you, a maiden?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.020
That costume's from
your Young Age period, isn't it?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.350
Y-Yes...

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.940
You sure know a lot.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.280
Of course. I've been a fan
of All Might's since I was little.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.080
As expected of the Symbol of Peace...

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.370
Oh, not at all!

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.370
He says with a really smug look!

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.960
While he was abroad, the sidekick who
supported him was the young David Shield.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.290
--Is he talking about the
super famous Professor Shield?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.290
--The genius scientist who would
later win the Nobel Quirk Prize...

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.380
--The genius scientist who would
later win the Nobel Quirk Prize...

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.380
--Birds of a feather flock together,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.340
--and those at the top draw
others of the same level, huh?

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.340
--The genius scientist who would
later win the Nobel Quirk Prize...

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.970
Dave...

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.580
Oh, it really takes me back...

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.190
An email is here! An email is here!

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.600
It's about time to start the special class.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.940
Oh, already?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.810
The preparations are ready.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.820
Then, let's go train those zygotes.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.820
"Special Episode: Save the World with Love!"

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.440
U.A. High holds a special class for those
who want to train even during summer vacation.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.450
Today is the first day of that class.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.830
We're running this course with a small
number of students, holding it multiple times.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.000
This time, it's you six.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.720
Just so you know,
this will be harder than a regular class.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.010
Prepare yourselves.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.930
"Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog"

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.930
I wonder what we'll do?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.430
If we fail, will he threaten
to expel us again?

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.810
"Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.830
In this class, you will fight
and capture a hypothetical villain.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.810
"Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine"

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.600
"Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion"

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.400
"Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity"

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.910
It's a really hero-like class!

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.570
This should be obvious,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.530
"Pro Hero - Shota Aizawa - Quirk: Erasure"

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.530
but villains commit
many different types of crimes.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.490
You all will go to the scene of the crime
and determine what happened there,

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.140
whether or not it was caused by a villain,
whether or not you should fight,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.060
and train your ability to assess the situation
and your ability to deal with the situation.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.210
Your special instructors will be...

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.090
I am here coming through the back door!

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.390
All Might!

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.470
You're really muscular today, too! Muscle!

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.940
It's not just All Might.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.050
Cementoss, Midnight, and Present Mic
will also participate as special instructors.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.260
Now, let us begin the training.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.070
Everyone, meet at Ground Beta.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.940
I see cardboard cutouts of the police.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.360
This must be where the crime scene is.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.820
I will tell you the situation
at the crime scene.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.580
There has been a
villain attack at a jewelry store.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.810
The employees and customers have been taken
hostage and everyone is barricaded inside.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.130
The number of villains
and hostages is unknown.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.380
You all have been asked by the police as
pro heroes to come and resolve the incident.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.020
Mr. Aizawa!

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.980
The teachers inside the store playing
the roles of hostages and villai--

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.480
I will not be answering any questions.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.320
Verify the situation yourselves
and resolve the case.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.570
Yes, sir!

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.540
Then, let the capture training begin!

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.080
Now, what should we do...?

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.870
First, we need to see how
many villains and hostages there are.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.630
Uraraka, you go.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.290
By myself?

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.840
If we all stream in, the villains'll notice.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.720
You can just look inside through that window.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.130
O-Okay, got it.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.800
Isn't it dangerous?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.490
Then, we should distract the villains.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.280
Who's this? The police?

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.480
All Might's playing a villain.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.940
I'm a pro hero. You're
the culprit, aren't you?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.190
I wonder about that.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.070
--Tell us how many villains on your right hand,
and how many hostages on your left.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.070
--Are the hostages okay?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.910
--I wonder.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.910
--Tell us how many villains on your right hand,
and how many hostages on your left.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.660
--Okay!
--I wonder.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.830
Release the hostages.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.910
You can tell me your demands.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.040
I have only one demand.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.380
I want all the police and
pro heroes to leave the scene.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.130
If you don't follow my demands,
then the hostages will get hurt.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.880
Very well.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.480
But first, tell me about the hostages.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.890
Is anyone injured?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.600
Someone will be if you
all keep taking your sweet time!

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.140
Hurry up and disappear!

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.520
One villain, three hostages.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.400
Uraraka, stand by there!

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.430
Hide!

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.220
Ribbit!

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.070
It's All Migh--

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.030
I mean, the villain.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.290
He's checking to see if we've left.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.370
Everyone, make sure you hide well.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.420
If he sees us, the hostages
will be in danger.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.580
What should we do?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.440
Should we go around to the back of the store?

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.420
Here's the first decision they have to make.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.760
Should they attempt
to contact the villain again?

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.720
Or...

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.640
This is stupid!

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.390
Kacchan?!

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.470
Bakugo, don't tell me--?!

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.140
You're planning on charging straight in?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.560
Of course!

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.000
While I'm firing off explosions
at that damn villain,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.820
you guys go save the hostages or something!

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.070
You're being too impetuous, Bakugo.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.490
What are you saying?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.410
This is our chance, while he's by the window!

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.660
I knew it would turn out this way...

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.290
We have no choice but to go, too!

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.660
R-Right!

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.590
Sorry, but this training
isn't so you can fight.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.050
The villain's gone...!

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.630
Damn it, I won't let you have the hostages!

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.720
Oh, no! Hurry!

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.940
Why...?

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.310
You see, you guys...

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.210
...here's where the special
class really begins.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.200
This is where the special
class really begins.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.070
It'll be interesting to
see how you deal with this.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.420
The villain is... dead...

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.630
Oh...

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.760
He's not actually dead,
but it looks like he's supposed to be.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.350
Did he die from Bakugo's Explosion?

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.760
It wasn't that strong!

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.850
Anyway, weren't you watching from up there?!

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.650
I couldn't see anything because
of the smoke from the explosion.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.520
The murder weapon is
this knife covered in blood.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.960
The scene of the crime
was surrounded by police,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.800
so if we assume that no one went in or out...

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.450
Then whoever killed the villain...

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.480
...is among the hostages!

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.080
Wait, Iida.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.130
It's too soon to decide that.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.550
Let's listen to what the
hostages have to say first.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.510
He's right. We need to know
what happened at the scene.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.510
"U.A. Jewelry Employee"

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.430
I am an employee of this jewelry store.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.310
I was threatened by the villain
who suddenly appeared

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.430
and after I gave him the jewels,
he tied me up with a rope.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.440
"Big Advertising Agency Employee"

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.020
I came to buy some accessories,
but when I came in, the villain was here

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.430
and he caught me when I was
still too surprised to do anything.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.690
"Musician"

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.970
Yo, I came to find

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.950
an engagement ring, yo,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.440
for my girl, and then the villain appeared!

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.410
He hit me with a lariat,
and I was knocked out, yo!

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.660
When the villain came,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.370
was he inside the store?

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.250
Yes, he was.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.590
He was knocked unconscious
and didn't wake up for a while.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.510
When you came into the store,
were the two of them here?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.930
I didn't look right when I came in,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.510
but when he was tying me up,

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.520
I saw the two of them had been made
to sit in different parts of the store.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.770
There aren't any discrepancies
in what they're saying.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.020
Excuse me, but may
we see inside your wallets?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.500
How's it look inside Midnight's?

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.320
There are a bunch of credit cards.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.280
Present Mic's is full, too.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.120
They both had enough funds to buy jewelry.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.790
Yeah.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.000
The damn villain was killed.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.210
The culprit is one of them!

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.420
And the motive?

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.250
Huh?

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.460
The stolen jewelry, of course!

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.470
Even if that were the case, wasn't it a little
too reckless to kill the villain right here?

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.300
They'd be obvious suspects.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.470
Besides, the villain was holding the jewelry.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.850
No one took them.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.690
If the motive wasn't theft, then...

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.100
Maybe some kind of internal conflict?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.150
If there were two villains...

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.150
And during the attack, they argued
over how to split the loot or something...

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.440
So in retaliation--

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.740
If that were the case, then the hostages
should've heard their conversation.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.320
I didn't hear anything like that, yo!

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.330
I didn't either.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.200
Me, neither.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.080
Was the villain alone?

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.080
Yes.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.530
I looked in every corner of the store,

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.330
but there's no back exit,
and all the windows were closed.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.840
There's no doubt that he was acting alone.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.590
Then, the culprit must be here--

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.010
I didn't do it!

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.220
I didn't, either!

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.730
It wasn't me, yo! I swear, yo!

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.770
They haven't been able to find
definitive evidence of who the killer is.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.770
Here is their second choice...

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.860
Wouldn't it be best to tell the police
the situation and leave it to them?

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.280
You do have a point.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.030
But it's frustrating,
since we know the culprit is here...

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.140
Then...

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.160
We should just make them confess!

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:08.990
Bakugo!

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.870
Stop that!

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.870
If you do that, then the
police will arrest you.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.130
I know that!

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.130
Hey, damn Deku. You've thought
of something, haven't you?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.220
Yeah, something's been bothering me.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.450
What?

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.350
Why did the villain barricade
himself in the jewelry store?

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.690
Right? Because if he was after the jewelry,

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.860
then he should've just escaped
right after he stole them.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.780
So then, why?

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:43.950
That's because while I was putting
the jewelry into the bag like he ordered me to,

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.160
the police arrived.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.630
Did you call them?

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.580
It wasn't me.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.080
Someone from outside the
store saw it and called the police...

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.130
If that's the case,
then the one who called was...

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.500
Midnight, it was you, wasn't it?

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.800
M-Me?!

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.800
Because you were the only one
to come in after the villain entered.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.470
Wait a minute, Midoriya.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.720
Idiot, don't make it worse.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.640
Why would the person who called the
police come inside to get caught on purpose?!

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.810
That's because...

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.760
That's because I think that was the
reason why the villain barricaded himself.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.620
Midnight, you knew
the villain before this, didn't you?

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.750
On top of that, you knew
that he committed crimes.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.130
Knowing ahead of time that
he was going to rob a jewelry store,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.210
you called the police
right after he attacked.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.970
And then, before the police arrived...

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.600
...you entered the jewelry store yourself.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.530
The villain was shaken
to see an acquaintance appear,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.740
but he also understood your real intention.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.210
Even so, the villain continued the robbery,

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.860
tying you up...

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.670
While he was doing that, the police arrived,

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.030
and he was forced to barricade himself.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.330
Wh-Why would I need to
do a thing like that--?

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.370
Isn't it because you wanted to stop him?

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.440
The villain.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.810
No matter how many times you tried
to convince him to stop, he wouldn't.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.170
That's why you acted in a way
to get the villain caught by the police.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:31.890
Wait, Deku.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.560
Even if things happened the way you said,

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.850
why was the villain killed?

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.350
She just wanted to stop the villain, right?

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.920
Yeah, that's right.
She doesn't have a motive to kill him.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.480
Yeah, she has no motive.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.320
That's why the villain...

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.330
...isn't among them.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.870
What did you say?

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.330
What do you mean, Deku?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.260
Could it have been...

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.540
...suicide?

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.540
Probably.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.710
After figuring out Midnight's intention,

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.300
he still thought to escape.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.520
But because we, pro heroes,
came to the scene...

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.930
He resigned himself to his fate
and committed suicide?

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.050
That's not it.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.080
This is what the villain was thinking:

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:24.990
If I get caught, then my relationship
with Midnight might be exposed.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.290
If that happened, then a
dark shadow would fall over her life.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.670
That's why the villain...

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.500
...sealed his mouth with his own hands.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.670
Midnight didn't tell us the truth

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.810
because she realized what he was
thinking as he gave up his life for her.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.940
That's why she couldn't say anything.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.390
Deku... were Midnight and the villain...?

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:08.400
That's so sad. Midnight was trying to save
the villain because she loved him...

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.320
And the villain was trying to save
Midnight because he loved her.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.420
For that to end like this...

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.580
How ironic.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.000
This is the truth behind
the villain jewelry store attack.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.580
Ribbit...

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.840
What the hell is this joke?

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.670
Okay, that's it.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.970
Oh, that was so fun!

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.430
She's back to herself already?!

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.810
Thanks, you three. You can go back now.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.380
How was my acting?

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.770
It was a little over-the-top...

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.190
Midoriya.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.350
Yes, sir.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.190
Your deductions were exactly the same
as the scenario we prepared for this.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.820
The villain cut himself with his own knife.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.660
Good job getting all the way here from
wondering why the villain barricaded himself.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.290
Oh, Mr. Aizawa's praising you!

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.950
Good job, Midoriya!

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.250
Thanks...

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.920
But, you guys overlooked one major thing.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.670
Huh?

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.670
Therefore, your score
for this capture training is...

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.840
Zero points.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.970
What?!

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.340
What's the meaning of this?!

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:15.760
Look.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.760
What?

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.680
The villain's corpse is gone!

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.930
He's alive...!

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.630
I'm fleeing toward freedom!

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.080
You were all under the assumption that

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.280
the villain was a corpse and
didn't tie him up, so you lose.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.530
You didn't follow through at the end.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.700
No way...

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.530
That's allowed?

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.750
Didn't you notice when All Might gave you
a hint while he was playing the villain?

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.080
When Asui tickled him...

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.040
Ribbit!

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.330
Oh...

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.610
...he reacted, didn't he?

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.240
Corpses do not move. He was alive.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.090
That's it for this time's special class.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.930
Dismissed!

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:59.320
No...

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.610
That's dirty!

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.600
Wait a minute. If the villain is alive,

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:11.070
then he pretended to kill himself but was
looking for a chance to escape, right?

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:16.240
Midnight misunderstood
and thought he did it for her, huh?

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.840
Then, what about their love?!

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.700
What about their love?

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.950
Their love...?

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.060
There was no love!

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.040
The wall!

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.640
Keeping muscle form for
so long is exhausting...

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.350
Oh yeah, I had an email...

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.470
It's from Melissa...?

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.740
"Dear Uncle Might"...

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.860
It's been such a long time.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.150
It's Melissa Shield.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.980
Are you surprised to see my email?

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.700
I am writing to you because I-Expo will
be held on I-Island, where Papa and I live.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.790
Schools in Japan are on
summer vacation right now, right?

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.740
I will be sending you an
invitation to I-Expo later.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.710
Please come and see Papa.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.290
A Japanese hero who fought
with villains while studying abroad,

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.890
and his reunion with an American scientist
for the first time in so many years...

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.730
Don't you think it'll be dramatic?

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:24.180
P.S. Papa will be so shocked if you visit us.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.830
I'm looking forward to
seeing his surprised face!

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.980
The Symbol of Peace?

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.610
What I'm aiming for is a world
where everyone can live and laugh.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.540
I want to become the Symbol of Peace
that shines a light on that world.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.820
Dave...

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.120
I...

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.750
...am here waiting to ambush
Young Midoriya on his way home!

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.460
A-All Might?!

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.840
Young Midoriya, you know
about I-Island, right?

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.760
I-Island? Of course I do!

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:16.730
"mutter mutter mutter"

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.260
All the companies in the world
in the hero business invested

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.560
to create a city for the research and
development of Quirks and hero items!

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.440
It's an artificial island that was
made mobile and it's total land area is...

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.730
Do you want to go there with me?

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.020
Me... and you?

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.490
You wouldn't be going for fun.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.990
Now that you're my successor, I was thinking
of having you develop more discernment.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.290
He's doing all this for me...

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:37.480
Definitely!

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.880
Then go back to your room
and get ready for the trip.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.370
We're leaving immediately.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.100
Right now?!

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.140
Hurry, Young Midoriya!

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.230
Ahh, I'll pack right away!

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:28.070
Young Midoriya! Was the special episode
of My Hero Academia fun?!

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.990
We saved the world with love, didn't we?

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.200
Well, there didn't seem to be any love...

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.210
Oh, more importantly,
we're going to I-Island, aren't we?

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.560
What's over there?

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.210
You'll see if you watch the movie!

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.460
I see, the movie!

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.220
Those who haven't seen it yet need
to go watch it in theaters right away, huh?

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.430
Oh yeah, that was a
great response, Young Midoriya!

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.720
Now, next time will continue
from the last episode!

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.350
Can Young Midoriya and
his classmates defeat Gang Orca,

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.900
who has barged into the middle of the second
test of the provisional licensing exam?!

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.190
Will they, or will they not be able
to get their provisional hero licenses?!

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.860
Or not?!

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.530
You said "not" twice!

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.120
So, please keep supporting...

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.780
...My Hero Academia!

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.990
Ready, set...

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.830
Go beyond!

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.460
Plus Ultra!

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960
"Preview"

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.540
Here's the preview!

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.550
In the program for the final screening
of the exam, they included a villain attack.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.800
Fight, or run...?

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.880
We all have to work together
to get out of this situation!

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.050
Next time, "What's the Big Idea?"

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:36.520
"Next time: What's the Big Idea?"

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.250
Go beyond!

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.640
Plus Ultra!
