WEBVTT

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.020
The number one hero, All Might.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.520
Age unknown, Quirk unidentified.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.070
"All Might's Super Popular!"
"All Might Gum"
"All Might's Adventure"

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.620
He dashed onto the scene of the hero world

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.780
"Textbook of Strength"

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.070
and received unwavering
popularity based on his ability.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.070
"All Might Curry"
"Movie in the works!"
"All Might Chips"

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.260
Ever since he appeared,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.400
the once critically high rate of crimes
committed by villains decreased year after year,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.040
"National Police Agency Investigation:
Number of Crimes Committed by Villains"

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.770
and his existence itself became a deterrent.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.020
He became the Symbol of Peace
in both name and reality.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.150
And that man said to me--

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.680
You can become a hero.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.460
--Huh? Midoriya? No way!

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.620
--You're Quirkless!

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.550
How can you even stand
in the same ring as me?

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.680
You should probably give it up.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.060
I'm sorry, Izuku!

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.770
I wanted someone to tell me that.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
And then, the person I most
admired said those words to me.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.670
Can anything be more shocking than this?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.660
More than this...?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.500
You are worthy to inherit my power.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.220
Inherit your power?

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.040
What's with that face?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.650
It's just a suggestion.
The real show starts after this.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.030
Listen, young man. You need to decide

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.320
whether or not you will accept my power!

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.180
Wh-What is All Might saying...?

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.420
I'm talking about my power, young man.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.460
The tabloids called it
"superhuman strength" and a "boost,"

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.900
and I constantly dodged the question
during interviews with a funny joke.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.390
Because the Symbol of Peace,
All Might, had to be a natural-born hero.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.270
But young man, I will tell you the truth.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.690
My Quirk was passed on
to me like a sacred torch.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.700
It was passed on to you...?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.530
That's right. And next, it is your turn.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.000
W-Wait! Wait a minute!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.540
"Summary of what's known
about All Might's Quirk"

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.000
It's true that your Quirk
is something hotly debated

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.250
as one of the world's greatest mysteries.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.670
So much so that not a day goes by when
I don't see someone talking about it online.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.160
But, well, I don't really understand

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:17.770
"mutter mutter mutter"

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.200
what you mean by inheriting
or passing on a Quirk...

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.370
I've never heard of
anything like that before,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.790
and it's never even been
conjectured in the debate.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.390
Why is that? Is it because
since the dawn of history,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.210
a Quirk like that was never confirmed?

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.160
In the first place, it's...

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.770
You always start with denial, huh?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.480
Nonsense!

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.570
Wh...?!

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.160
I may hide a lot of things, but I don't lie!

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.440
The power to transfer power...

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.740
That is the Quirk I inherited!

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.710
I was crowned with "One For All"!

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.590
"One For All"...

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.420
That's right.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.800
One person cultivates the power

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.490
and passes it on to another person,
who also cultivates it and passes it on.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.840
It is the crystallization of power that spins
together the voices of those who need help

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.520
with a courageous heart.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.800
Why are you... Why are you
giving me something so great?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.700
I have been looking for a successor.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
And then, I thought it would
be all right for you to inherit it.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.340
You are just a Quirkless hero fanboy,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.040
but you were more heroic
than anyone else back there!

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.240
Never mind! Well, it's up to you, though.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.010
What'll you do?

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.520
He said so much to encourage me,
and even told me his secret...

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.030
Is there...? Of course there isn't...

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.690
There's no reason for me to turn him down!

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.990
I'll do it!

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.870
An immediate reply.
That's what I thought you'd say!

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.920
But it was no easy task to receive his power.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.750
"Episode 3: Roaring Muscles"

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.010
"Dagoba Municipal Beach Park"

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.010
"Two days later - Early morning"

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.720
Hey, hey, hey! This is such
a comfy fridge to sit on!

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.230
If you could move it even a little,
it would be a little easier.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.220
Well yeah, I mean,
you weigh 274 kilograms, right?

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.450
No, I lost weight,
so I'm only 255 kilograms now,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.860
in this form.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.580
Anyway, why am I dragging
trash at the beach park?

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.000
It's 'cause, you know,
you're not a proper vessel.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.630
What you're saying now is
the opposite of what you said before!

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.180
I'm talking about your body.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.850
My Quirk, One For All,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.520
is the fullest physical ability
of many people gathered into one.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.690
An unprepared body cannot inherit it fully.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.210
The limbs will come off
and the body will explode.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.990
The limbs will what?!

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.870
Then... I'm picking up trash
in order to train my body...?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.790
Yes!

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.290
But that's not all.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.620
After some research on
the internet yesterday,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.860
I discovered that part of this beach park's
coast has been like this for many years.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.950
Yeah...

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.520
For some reason, because of
the currents, objects drift here a lot,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.250
and people take advantage of
that to hide their illegal dumping...

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.480
The local residents don't
come near here, either.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.810
Heroes these days are all
after the showy stuff.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.820
Originally, being a hero
meant doing volunteer service.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.420
Even if people called
that boring or whatever.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.660
You can't waver from those roots.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.940
You will restore the
horizon for this whole section!

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.460
That is your first step
toward becoming a hero!

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.330
My first step...?

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.340
Clean... this...

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.670
All of it...?!

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.930
Young Midoriya, you want
to go to U.A., right?

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.700
Yes... Yes!

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.510
Because it's where you went!

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.900
So if I'm going to go... I thought...
it would definitely have to be U.A....

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.440
You're a go-getter fanboy!

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.200
But I've told you this before.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.800
It's not something you
can do without a Quirk.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.820
It's sad, but that is what the reality is.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.320
And U.A.'s is the
hardest hero course to get into.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.380
In other words...

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:44.330
In the ten months until U.A.'s entrance exam,
I have to complete my vessel!

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.480
That's where this comes in!

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.340
I came up with this:
"Aim to Pass: American Dream Plan"!

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.370
"Daily Schedule (Weekdays)"
"4/8~5/31 (Weekends on different sheet)"
"Phase 1"

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.470
It's a training plan to help you
finish cleaning up the beach.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.100
"Daily Schedule (Weekends)"
"Meal Menu"
"Set Plan"

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.100
I'll have you follow this
in every aspect of your life!

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.760
Even sleep time is included...

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.310
Frankly, this is a super
hard schedule. Can you follow it?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.540
Of course... I have to work
many times harder than anyone else,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.030
or else I can't do it!

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.100
And so began my ten months of hell.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.200
Carry that to the park entrance!

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.540
Put it in the truck!

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.450
Depending on size and shape, the muscles
I have to use are completely different!

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.380
I see... This is...!

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.880
Run! Run! Ten months will
be over before you know it!

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.620
Let's become athletic!

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.550
"Aldera Junior High"

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.550
Let's see... With the
appearance of superpowers,

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.920
the Building Standards Act was revised,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.010
--and the Minister of Land,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.160
--This is tough...

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.790
--Infrastructure and Transportation's...

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.790
--Ten months of this, huh?

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.650
"Proposed Independent Training Menu"

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.860
It'll be hard if I don't finish
by a week before the exam...

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.410
Which means, there are 294 days left...

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.980
Taking into consideration
a sufficient recovery period

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.860
if I rest for two days in
between, that gives me...

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.520
...about 98 days of real
training even if I'm efficient...

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:28.560
"mutter mutter mutter"

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.580
I can get in about five hours
of training morning and night,

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.840
so that's 490 hours...

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.540
Also, that beach cleanup doesn't work
out any specific parts of the body,

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.580
if I don't work out my whole body equally,
then there's no way I'll make it.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.870
Bodybuilding to create a
body able to adapt to any situation...

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.950
Literally intensive training
to become a hero...

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.370
All Might can't stay
and watch me the whole time...

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.620
If I don't do as much efficient
independent training as I can,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.350
there's no way I can
catch up the way I am now...

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.910
--Anyway, I'll have to cut--

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.910
--Midoriya, hey!

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.110
Did your encounter with
the villain make you go crazy?

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.360
It's presumptuous to think
of getting into U.A. like that.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.360
Plus, I have to study for the entrance exam.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.120
A nervous breakdown already?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.540
That's scary.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.330
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.580
There are only three months left!

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.130
You won't make it!

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.790
Wanna give up?
Wanna take it easy and rest today?

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.140
Overwork...?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.500
The "Aim to Pass: American Dream Plan"
was adjusted with your body in mind

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.770
to make sure you'd make it
in time for the entrance exam...

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.530
You haven't been sticking
to the plan, have you?

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.120
Overdoing it will have the opposite effect!

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.790
Don't you want to get in?

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.030
I do...

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.920
But I can't just get in...

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.580
I have to work a lot more
than other people...

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.000
or I won't be able to catch up...

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.970
I want to be like you.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.180
I want to become the greatest hero, like you!

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.770
Saving people with a fearless smile.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.380
Like you...!

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.820
He's looking far into the future, huh?

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.200
You go-getter fanboy!

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.700
I like that!

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.330
But if that's the case,
then you really can't rush things now.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.830
But I understand your feelings.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.830
Leave it to this old guy to adjust your plan!

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.380
You're not old... All Might...

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.640
"February 26"

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.890
And then, it was 6 a.m.
on the day of the entrance exam.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.430
Hey, hey, hey...

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.190
He even cleaned outside
of where I told him to! Seriously?

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.420
There's not even a speck
of dust left! Seriously?!

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.880
He finished at the last minute!
More than perfectly!

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.610
Oh my... Oh my...

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.930
...goodness!

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.980
Good work.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.400
All Might... I did it...

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.400
I did it!

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.090
Yeah, you surprised me, you entertainer!

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.170
Teenagers are amazing!

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.890
Here, take a look.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.670
This is...

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.630
It's you, ten months ago.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.180
You did good. You really did!

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.680
The mirage of it is finally
just barely visible,

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.060
but you have certainly
become a suitable vessel!

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.940
I feel like I'm cheating...

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.690
You did all this for me...

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.630
I'm too blessed...

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.160
What're you saying after all this time...

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.000
It was your own hard work.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.670
We'll have to fix those leaky eyes of yours.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.480
Now, it's time for the
award ceremony, Izuku Midoriya!

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.240
Yes, sir!

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.710
This is something I was once told:

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.300
"Something that you
receive because you're lucky

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.680
and something that you are
given because you are recognized

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.220
are different in essence."

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.740
Take that to heart.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.560
This is power that you earned
because of your own effort.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.950
I took the reality that would
be surprising even in comics

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.470
in my hand...

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.660
Eat this.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.390
Huh?

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.070
It doesn't really matter what it
is as long as you take in my DNA.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.480
It's too different from what I imagined!

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.420
Now, there's no time!

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.040
You'll be late for the exam!

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.190
Come, come, come!

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.690
"8:40 a.m. - The same day"

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:55.660
"U.A. High School Entrance Exam Location"

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.380
I made it...

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.710
In the end, I didn't have time to test
out the power I received from All Might.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.210
Eat this.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.480
I swallowed the hair,
but did I really receive his power...?

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.830
Outta my way, Deku!

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.100
Kacchan!

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.310
Don't stand in front of me. I'll kill you.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.380
M-Morning. L-Let's both do our best...

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.980
Hey, isn't that Bakugo?
The one with the sludge villain?

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.200
Oh, he's the real thing!

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.200
Ever since that day,
Kacchan didn't do anything to me.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.540
I was just scared of him out of habit!

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.730
I'm different from before!

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.220
Remember these past ten months!

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.960
Take the first step...

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.800
...to being a hero!

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.860
This is it!

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.420
Are you all right?

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.840
It's my Quirk. Sorry for
using it without asking first.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.330
But it'd be bad luck if you fell, right?

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.090
Aren't you nervous?

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.580
Uh...

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.420
Let's do our best. See ya!

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.960
I talked to a girl!

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.130
"Didn't actually talk"

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.890
"U.A. High School Hero Course"
"Exam Orientation"

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.340
For all you examinee listeners tuning in,

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.110
welcome to my show today!

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.730
Everybody say "hey"!

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.110
"Silence!!"

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.910
What a refined response.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:08.250
Then I'll quickly present to you
the rundown on the practical exam!

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.710
Are you ready?

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.790
Yeah!

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.210
"Silence!!"

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.710
It's the Voice Hero, Present Mic! Wow...!

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.080
I listen to him every week on the radio.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.220
I'm so moved!

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.220
--All the teachers at U.A. are pro heroes!

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.220
--Shut up.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.410
As it says in the application requirements,

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:32.560
you listeners will be conducting
ten-minute mock urban battles after this!

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:39.070
"You Are Here"

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.280
You can bring whatever you want with you.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.070
After the presentation, you'll head
to the specified battle center, okay?

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.990
"Silence!!"

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.650
Okay?!

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.080
In other words, they won't
let you work with your friends, huh?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.790
"Exam Ticket"
"Examinee No.: 2234"
"Test Location: Battle Center B"

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.640
Y-You're right. Even though our
examinee numbers are consecutive,

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.370
"Exam Ticket"
"Examinee No.: 2233"
"Test Location: Battle Center A"

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.370
we're assigned to different battle centers.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.330
Don't look. I'll kill you.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.120
Damn, now I can't crush you.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.640
Three different types of faux villains
are stationed in each battle center.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.430
You earn points for each of them
based on their level of difficulty.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.840
Your goal, dear listeners,
is to use your Quirks

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.650
to earn points by
immobilizing the faux villains.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:21.360
Of course, attacking other examinees
and any other unheroic actions are prohibited!

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.160
May I ask a question?

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.200
Okay!

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.040
On the printout,
there are four types of villains.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.370
If that is a misprint, then U.A., the most
prominent school in Japan, should be ashamed

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:35.420
of that foolish mistake.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.820
We examinees are here in this place

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.800
because we wish to be
molded into exemplary heroes.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.720
In addition, you over
there with the curly hair--

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.410
You've been muttering this whole time.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.860
It's distracting!

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.520
If you're here on a pleasure trip,
then you should leave immediately!

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.240
I'm sorry...

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.900
Okay, okay, Examinee Number 7111.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.650
Thanks for the great message.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.910
The fourth type of villain
is worth zero points.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.450
That guy's an obstacle, so to speak.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.050
There's one in every battle center--

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.320
An obstacle that will go
crazy in narrow spaces.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.040
It's not impossible to defeat,
but there's no reason to defeat it, either.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.800
I recommend that you
listeners try to avoid it.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.880
Thank you very much!

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.250
Please excuse the interruption!

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.150
I see... It's like the obstacles
you avoid in videos games, huh?

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.020
The whole thing is like a video game.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.450
That's all from me!

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:39.900
Finally, I'll give you listeners
a present--our school motto!

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.150
The hero Napoleon Bonaparte once said:

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:50.780
"A true hero is someone
who overcomes life's misfortunes."

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.880
Go beyond.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.230
Plus Ultra!

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.240
Now, everyone, good luck suffering!

"Battle Center B"

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.690
I-It's time to do it.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:21.320
It's time to give everything I got from my
training with All Might these past ten months.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.910
I will become...

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.880
...the hero I always dreamed of being!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
"Next time"

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.380
The entrance exam of U.A. High School,

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.710
the famous school that turned
out many pro heroes, is starting.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.870
Leaving aside the written exam for now,
will I be able to get through the practical exam

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.720
with the power I only
just received from All Might?

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.840
Let's do our best on the entrance exam!

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.150
Huh? Who're you?

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.020
More importantly, I talked to a girl!

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.440
Next time, "Start Line"!

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.520
I, Ochaco, will have
shiny stuff come out of my mouth!

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.780
Go beyond!
