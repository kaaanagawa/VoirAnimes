WEBVTT

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.770
A hero...

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.940
...can always break out of a tough spot!

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.700
Hey villain, have you ever heard these words?

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.740
Go beyond!

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.290
Plus...

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.870
...Ultra...!

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.760
I really have gotten weaker...

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.120
In my prime, five hits would've been enough.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.440
But it took more than 300 hits.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.500
And now... I'm out of time...

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.870
Now, villains...

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.200
I'm sure we'd all like
to end this as soon as possible.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.180
Weaker? No way.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.500
We've been completely overwhelmed.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.960
I can't believe he did that to my Nomu...

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.860
Did he use a cheat?!

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.310
Hands up.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.150
No Quirks allowed.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.030
If you use your Quirks, I'll kill this guy.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.110
Kaminari!

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.780
He got us. We let our guard down completely.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.540
An ambush after they made
us think we got all of them.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.830
I can't believe we didn't predict this.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.550
I don't wanna kill someone
who's an electric-type, like me,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.830
but I guess I have to, huh?

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.930
An electric-type...

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.220
He was probably the one Todoroki said was
jamming communications.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.880
I'm going over there.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.150
Don't move a muscle.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.860
Electric-types like you and
Kaminari are born winners, right?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.230
Huh?

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.320
What are you--

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.510
I mean, even if you aren't a hero,
there are a ton of jobs you could do.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.610
You're in great demand, right?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.910
It's just an innocent thought.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.070
I'm just wondering,
why is someone like you a villain?

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.060
I see.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.170
Jiro can attack without moving
as long as she gets her plug in.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.590
It's fine if you don't want to answer.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.550
Give it up.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.880
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.760
A kid's naïve thinking
only works on dumb adults.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.640
Novice heroes shouldn't
make light of hostages.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.560
If you two don't put up a fight,
I'll let this idiot go.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.650
Someone else's life,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.450
or your own.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.720
Now. Don't move.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.460
"Episode 13: In Each of Our Hearts"

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.170
Hey, what's going on?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.970
He's not any weaker at all.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.110
Did that guy lie to me?!

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.700
What's wrong?

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.140
You're not coming?

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.690
You said you'd "clear"
this or something, right?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.690
Come and get me if you can.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.080
All Might...

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.370
As expected, it looks like
there is no need for us to fight.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.710
Midoriya! We should get out of here now!

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.240
It'll be worse if we end up
getting taken hostage instead!

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.460
No...

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.470
He's bluffing.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.300
It's almost lost under the cloud of dust,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.010
but I can see the steam-like substance
that comes out when he transforms.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.360
All Might is...

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.440
I can't move anymore...

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.440
That Nomu thing was too strong...

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.520
Frankly, if I move even one step,
I won't be able to keep up this bluff.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.200
I'll go back to my true form.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.880
Just a little more...

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.290
Well? What's wrong?

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.040
Hesitate.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.000
If I can stall for just a little longer...

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.490
If only I had Nomu...

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.970
That guy would've been able to go up
against him without thinking about anything!

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.080
Tomura Shigaraki!

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.840
Please calm yourself.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.440
Looking carefully, I see that
he was definitely weakened

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.190
from the damage of Nomu's attacks.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.070
Besides, the children
appear to be frozen in fear.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.040
We still have underlings who can be used.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.280
There are likely only a few minutes
left before reinforcements come.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.520
If you and I work together,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.590
we still have a chance of killing him.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.590
Yeah... yeah, yeah...

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.950
That's right... That's right...

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.730
We have no choice but to do it.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.620
I mean, we have the last boss
right in front of our eyes.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.370
All Might will do something
about the main bad guys.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.030
Let's go help the others!

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.180
Midoriya?

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.900
I'm the only one who knows...

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.460
The mist guy is probably more dangerous.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.500
All Might has most likely
gone past his limit.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.500
If the mist guy toys with him, I'm sure...

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.720
You're coming, huh?

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.890
This is revenge for Nomu!

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.890
Jeez, holy shit!

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.170
Hurry!

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.860
Everyone, hurry!

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.800
He's fast.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.620
I'm the only who knows
the predicament he's in!

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.750
Midoriya!

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.800
They're broken...
even though I controlled it earlier...

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.950
But I made it!

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.390
The hidden part of his body!

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.050
As long as I aim at that,
I can blow him away!

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.390
Get away from All Might!

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.560
This hand is...

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.400
...the one from back then?!

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.190
I won't fall for that again!

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.580
Are they here?

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.480
This attack...

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.970
Could it be...?

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.970
Sorry, everyone!

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.810
Sorry we're late!

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.140
I gathered all who were
immediately available.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.900
Iida!

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.480
I, Tenya Iida, class 1-A representative,

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.360
have now returned!

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.640
Split up and protect the students!

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.820
Yes, sir!

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.090
Aw man, they're here.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.150
It's game over now.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.450
Shall we go home and try
again later, Kurogir--?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.460
Someone whose Quirk can
capture them all from this distance...

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.660
Me!

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.000
Tomura Shigaraki!

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.210
This is...

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.220
...Thirteen!

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.180
I may have failed this time,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.680
but I will kill you next time...

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.520
...Symbol of Peace, All Might!

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.960
What the pros deal with...

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.460
What they fight against...

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.840
The world of evil...

00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.720
That was an experience
that we were not ready for yet.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.780
I wasn't... able to do anything...

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.300
That's not true.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.250
If it weren't for those
few seconds you bought me,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.860
I would've been killed.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.090
You saved me again.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.250
All Might...

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.980
I'm... so glad you're okay...!

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.400
My goodness...

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.140
I can't believe we let them escape after
they made such a big show of trespassing.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.390
They caught us completely unguarded, huh?

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.660
More importantly, we must
make sure the students are safe.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.210
If this many pro heroes have gathered here,

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.800
then it looks like they did
not attack the whole school.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.920
Midoriya!

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.680
Oh, Kirishima...

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.510
Are you all right?

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.390
Young Kirishima, I applaud
your concern for your friend!

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.890
But wait, he'll find out.
Crap, wait! Damn it!

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.100
K-Kirishima, wai--!

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.180
We want to make sure
that all the students are safe,

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.070
so please gather in front of the gate.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.070
We will deal with the injured here.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.420
That makes sense! Roger that!

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.340
Hey, he said to gather in front of the gate!

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.610
Thanks.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.820
You saved me, Cementoss.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.420
I am a fan of yours, too.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.550
"Cementoss"
"Quirk: Cement"

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.550
Cementoss! Quirk: Cement.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.880
He can manipulate the
cement he touches like clay.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.230
He's super strong in modern society!

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.680
Let's get you to the nurse's office
while keeping you hidden.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.720
But man, you act recklessly every time, huh?

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.320
If I didn't act recklessly,
I would've been killed.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.430
That was how strong the enemy was.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.580
"Karaoke"

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.580
"Sauna"
"Mahjong"

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.220
Ouch...

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.200
I was shot in both arms and both legs...

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.360
We lost completely...

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.320
Even Nomu was defeated!

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.000
All the underlings were
defeated in an instant.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.370
Those kids were strong...

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.460
The Symbol of Peace was healthy...

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.870
You were wrong, Master!

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.400
No, I wasn't.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.580
We were just not prepared enough.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.180
Yes, we underestimated them.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.290
It's good that we did it under
that cheap "League of Villains" name.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.320
By the way, what about Master
and my joint creation, Nomu?

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.050
He was not retrieved?

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.920
He was blown away.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.320
What?!

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.240
More precisely, without coordinates
to his precise location,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.770
I could not find him, even with my warp.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.060
I did not have time for that.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.690
After all we did to make
him as powerful as All Might!

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.320
Well, I suppose it cannot
be helped. That's unfortunate.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.900
Power...

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.670
That's right.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.990
There was one child
who was as fast as All Might.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.080
Oh?

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.140
If he hadn't gotten in the way,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.430
we might have been able to kill All Might.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.210
That brat... that brat!

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.720
Of course you have regrets.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.090
But this was not a futile exercise.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.520
Gather the elite.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.860
Take all the time you need.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.290
We cannot move freely,

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.100
which is why we need a symbol, like you.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.800
Tomura Shigaraki.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.830
Next time, show the world
that you are to be feared.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.690
...16, 17, 18, 19.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.520
Other than the boy with
both legs seriously injured,

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.170
everyone else seems unharmed.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.500
Ojiro.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.220
I heard you were fired up this time.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.360
You were strong by yourself, huh?

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.880
I thought everyone was by themselves.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.200
I survived by using hit-and-run tactics.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.050
Where were you, Hagakure?

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.140
In the landslide area!

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.100
Todoroki was super strong. I was surprised!

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.170
Anyway, I'm glad you weren't hurt.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.950
I almost froze her...

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.150
That was close.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.780
Where... do you think I was?

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.750
I see, so the people you
fought were also just hooligans?

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.370
They underestimated us 'cause we were kids.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.620
Where...

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.780
So it was All Might who put
the hole in the dome after all?

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.540
That's some crazy power.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.040
Yeah, as expected of All Might.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.540
Where do you think I was?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.830
Where?

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:29.940
It's a secret!

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.050
Let's have the students
return to their classroom for now.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.560
We won't be questioning
them right away, anyway, right?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.100
Detective, what about Mr. Aizawa?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.100
Comminuted fractures in
both arms and a facial fracture.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.770
Fortunately, there does not seem
to be any serious brain damage.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.670
However, his orbital floor
has broken into small pieces,

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.700
and his eyes may suffer
from its aftereffects.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.820
That's what he said.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.480
Ribbit...

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.700
No...

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.890
What about Thirteen?

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.210
Thirteen has been treated.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.600
The laceration from the
back to upper arm was bad,

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.130
but Thirteen will survive.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.850
All Might will also survive.

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.570
Recovery Girl's healing
is enough to treat him,

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:18.850
so he's in the nurse's office.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.060
Deku...!

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.850
What about Midoriya?!

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.280
Midori...?

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.230
Oh, treatment in the
nurse's office is enough for him, too.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.690
Oh, good...

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.790
Now, go back to your classroom.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.320
Okay.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.040
Sansa, I also have some
business in the nurse's office.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.280
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:36.950
Yes, sir!

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.140
It's a cat.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.460
Not a dog, huh?

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.290
Damn.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.340
Bakugo! He said to go back to the classroom!

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.690
I know, bastard!

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.070
We need to make some drastic
improvements to school security, don't we?

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.850
Yes.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.310
A warp Quirk is already very rare,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.940
but for a villain to have
one, of all things...

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.610
Detective Tsukauchi!

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.720
We received word that
someone thought to be a villain

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.850
was captured in a grove
of trees on school grounds.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.310
How is it?

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.720
He has no apparent injuries and
seemed docile, not resisting capture.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.000
He does not respond even when
called out to, so he is thought to be mute.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.960
Principal, we would like to investigate
every corner of the school, just in case.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.430
Of course!

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.430
Some people might complain,
but you police have more authority.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.680
Investigating is what you're
good at. I'm counting on you!

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.600
Teams, proceed with
the investigation of the school!

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.820
"Nurse's Office"

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:05.340
Because of the situation this time,
I can't really scold you...

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.230
I'm not sure,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.920
but I think I might've shortened
the time limit of my hero form again.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.760
I hope I still have at least an hour...

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.050
All Might...

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.240
Well, it can't be helped.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.550
These things happen.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.640
Excuse me.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.250
All Might, it's been a while.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.770
Tsukauchi! You're here, too?

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.690
All Might! Is it all right
to show that form...?

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.360
Yeah, it's fine.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.150
Why?

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.780
Because he's Naomasa Tsukauchi,
my best friend in the force.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.480
What's with that introduction?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.290
Sorry to cut to the chase, but All Might,

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.650
can you give me details about the vill--

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:49.870
Wait! Please, wait!

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.110
More importantly, are all the students okay?

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.660
What about Aizawa--Eraser Head--and Thirteen?

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.460
Other than that boy, only a
few students had light injuries,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.250
and the two teachers are
in stable condition for now.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.720
I see.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.970
If you three heroes had
not risked your lives,

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.560
then the students would not have survived.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.380
You're wrong about one thing, Tsukauchi.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.730
The students also fought
and risked their lives.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.830
All Might...

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.600
Have there even been any first-years
who experienced a real fight so soon,

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.870
survived, and learned
of fear and the world of adults?

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.630
The villains did something dumb.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.910
This class is strong.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.940
They will become strong heroes.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.780
I am certain of that.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.040
"Nurse's Office"

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.680
Well then, thank you very much!

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.870
Sure. Be careful on your way home.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.580
Yes, ma'am.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.790
The attack on USJ by the League of Villains

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:31.300
was only the beginning of what
would become a major incident later.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.510
Deku!

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:45.020
But I had no way of knowing that at the time.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.540
It doesn't matter, as
long as I get to the top!

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.350
I will refuse him completely.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.210
I'm gonna go for it with
everything I have, too!

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.180
"Go beyond!"

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.920
The second season of the TV anime...

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.010
"Second season coming soon!"

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.010
...is coming!
