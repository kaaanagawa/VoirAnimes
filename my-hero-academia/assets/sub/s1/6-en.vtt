WEBVTT

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.400
With all my strength...

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.480
I'll do what I can right now!

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.030
Smash...!

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.040
It doesn't hurt as much as before...

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.800
It wasn't a throw that relied on power.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.480
He just concentrated
the power at this fingertip?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.280
Mr. Aizawa...

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.510
I can still move!

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.600
This kid...

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.610
He got over 700 meters?!

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.520
Finally, a hero-like record!

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.720
His finger's swollen!

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.660
There was the entrance exam, too.
He has a strange Quirk...

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.410
It's not very stylish.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.040
Wh-What's with that power?!

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.600
Everyone's Quirks manifest
by the age of four.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.790
This is unthinkable!

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.670
But in reality...

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.320
S-Someone told me...

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.280
"You can become a hero"...

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.680
That it was because of my own effort...

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.720
What is the meaning of this?

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.100
Hey!

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.480
Tell me what's going on,
Deku, you bastard!

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.780
What the--? These cloths are hard..!

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.280
They're weapons for capture
made of carbon fiber

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.490
woven together with metal
wire made of a special alloy.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.540
Jeez...

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.680
Don't keep making me use
my Quirk over and over.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.920
I have dry eye.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.800
It's such a waste,
since his Quirk is so amazing!

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.600
"Shota Aizawa"

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.530
U.A. High's homeroom teacher for Class 1-A,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.040
Shota Aizawa.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.080
He can erase the Quirks of those he looks at.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.600
The effect goes away when he blinks!

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.440
We're wasting time.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.310
Whoever's next, get ready.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.900
Is your finger all right?

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.260
Oh, yeah.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.240
Until a little while ago,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.780
he was just a pebble on the side of the road.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.160
You're so lucky, Kacchan.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.400
Your Quirk's so cool!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.580
I hope I get mine soon, too.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.290
No matter what Quirk you get,
you'll never beat me.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.930
A pebble...

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.430
...on the side of the road!

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.430
"Episode 6: Rage, You Damn Nerd"

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.560
After that, I fought against the pain

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.560
"Sit-ups"

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.440
"Seated toe-touch"

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.890
as we finished the rest of the fitness tests.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.450
"Long-distance run"

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.410
Okay, I'll quickly tell you the results.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.870
The total is simply the
marks you got from each test.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.580
It's a waste of time to explain verbally,
so I'll show you the results all at once.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.570
The person with the
lowest total score will be expelled.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.880
The only result I had that was
any good was in the ball throw.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.920
For the rest of the tests,
I did terribly because of the pain.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.910
"1 Momo Yaoyorozu" "2 Shoto Todoroki"
"3 Katsuki Bakugo" "4 Tenya Iida"
"5 Fumikage Tokoyami"

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.310
"11 Koji Koda" "12 Rikido Sato"
"13 Tsuyu Asui" "14 Yuga Aoyama"
"15 Hanta Sero"

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.040
"6 Mezo Shoji" "7 Mashirao Ojiro"
"8 Eijiro Kirishima" "9 Mina Ashido"
"10 Ochaco Uraraka"

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.540
Last place will be...

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.110
"16 Denki Kaminari" "17 Kyoka Jiro"
"18 Toru Hagakure" "19 Minoru Mineta"
"20 Izuku Midoriya"

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.690
...expelled?

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.660
By the way, I was lying about the expulsion.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.540
It was a rational deception to
draw out the upper limits of your Quirks.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.840
What?!

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.400
Of course that was a lie.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.590
It should've been obvious
if you just thought it through.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.090
I didn't notice...

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.020
That was a little nerve-wracking, huh?

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.970
I'll take up the challenge anytime!

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.210
With that, we're done here.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.800
There are handouts with
the curriculum and such in the classroom

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.520
so when you get back, look over them.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.110
Midoriya--

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.700
Have the old lady fix you
in the nurse's office.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.060
Tomorrow will be packed
with even more rigorous tests.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.080
Prepare yourself.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.690
I got through this for now,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.960
but there was too much that I couldn't do.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.290
"20 Izuku Midoriya"

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.690
I'm starting from last place.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.380
I have a lot to learn from here on out

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.680
in order to get closer
to what I dream of becoming!

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.720
Aizawa, you liar!

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.540
All Might. So you were watching?

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.910
Too much time on your hands?

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.790
"A rational deception" you said?

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.610
April Fools was last week.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.740
"Teacher Directory"

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.170
You punished a whole class of
last year's first-years with expulsion.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.990
You cut those you judge to be
without potential without hesitation.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.120
For a man like that to take back his words--

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.580
That must be because you also
felt the potential of that kid, right?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.340
"Also"?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.090
You seem to be supporting him quite a bit.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.120
Is that how a teacher should be acting?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.640
His potential was not zero.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.860
That's all it was.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.980
I will always cut those without potential.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.480
There's nothing crueler than
letting a dream end midway.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.530
So you're being kind in
your own way, huh, Aizawa?

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.120
But we don't really get along after all.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.730
I'm so tired...

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.510
Iida!

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.540
Is your finger healed?

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.340
Yeah, thanks to Recovery Girl.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.760
"Nurse's Office"

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.660
Wow, it's healed!

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.220
But I suddenly feel very tired...

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.680
My Quirk can only stimulate
a person's healing ability.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.060
Healing requires stamina.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.840
If you keep getting major injuries,
you'll use too much stamina

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.740
and end up dying instead, so be careful.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.200
I'll end up dying instead?!

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.560
I can't just keep getting help from others.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.870
I have to hurry up
and learn to control my power.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.660
I was really taken in by Mr. Aizawa.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.400
I even thought, "This is
the best of the best" and such.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.910
I didn't think a teacher
would encourage us with a lie.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.400
I thought Iida was scary,
but he's just earnest.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.700
Hey! You two!

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.890
Going to the station?

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.530
Wait for me!

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.560
Uraraka?!

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.520
You're the infinity girl.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.910
I'm Ochaco Uraraka.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.290
Um, you're Tenya Iida,

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.930
and you're Deku Midoriya, right?

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.790
"Deku"?!

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.270
Huh? But during the fitness test,
the boy named Bakugo said--

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.180
Deku, you bastard!

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:37.870
Right?

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:43.020
Uh... my real name is Izuku, but D-Deku
is what Kacchan calls me to make fun of me...

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.060
An insult?

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.720
Oh, is that right?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.630
Sorry!

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.620
But "Deku" sounds like the
Japanese word for "You can do it!"

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.210
so I kinda like it.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.310
I'm Deku!

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.550
Midoriya?

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.900
You're accepting it too easily!
Wasn't that an insult?

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.120
It's like a Copernican Revolution...

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.080
"Co-pe"?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.560
There are so many things I can't do.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.100
I have to work hard and do my best.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.130
But, All Might,

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.700
I can at least be happy
that I have friends, right?

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.660
You don't have time to relax, young man.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.790
The real thing starts tomorrow.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.740
The curriculum of U.A. High's hero course:

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.670
Regular required classes,
like English, in the morning.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.010
Which of these English sentences is wrong?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.280
So normal...

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.890
So damn boring.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.100
Everybody, heads up!
Let's get this party started!

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.410
--The relative pronoun is in
the wrong place in number 4!

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.560
--Okay, Yaoyorozu, come on!

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.990
Lunch is at the main cafeteria, where we
can buy gourmet food for reasonable prices.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.240
White rice is great comfort food, isn't it?

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.140
Yeah.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.490
And then, in the afternoon,
we finally have...

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.700
...Hero Basic Training.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.170
I am...

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.300
...coming through the door
like a normal person.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.050
It's All Might!

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.720
Wow, he really is a teacher!

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.860
That's a costume from the
Silver Age, isn't it?

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.140
Its style is so different,
it's giving me goose bumps.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.880
I teach Hero Basic Training.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.360
It is a subject where you train in different
ways to learn the basics of being a hero.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.990
You'll take the most units of this subject!

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.430
Let's get right into it!
This is what we'll do today--

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.660
Combat training!

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.850
Combat...

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.790
...training.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.210
And to go with that are these!

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.320
Costumes made based on
your Quirk registrations

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.880
and requests you sent in
before school started.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.310
Costumes!

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.570
After you change, gather in Ground Beta!

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.180
Yes, sir!

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.110
They say the clothes make
the man, young men and ladies.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.740
Be fully aware...

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.740
From now on...

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.620
...you are heroes!

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.740
That's great, everyone. You all look cool!

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.010
Now, shall we begin, you zygotes?

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.770
"Clothing Allowance"

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.540
The clothing allowance.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.470
Before we enrolled in U.A. High,
we submitted our Quirk registration,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.820
"I want a streamline
and versatile suit of full armor."

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.370
physical measurements, and desired designs

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.530
so a support company under
exclusive contract with the school

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.150
"Something intimidating!!"

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.350
could prepare state-of-the-art
costumes for us. It's a wonderful system.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.750
"Style for a man who can't stop sparkling."

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.200
"Three weeks ago"

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.330
I need to go to city hall to get my Quirk
registration for the clothing allowance.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.500
But I'm already registered as "none"...

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.590
Oh, what should I do...?

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.210
Quirk registration?

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.590
Oh, you can update that.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.980
Really?

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.270
Everyone is examined and
registered all at once

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.970
when they enter elementary
school and junior high, right?

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:34.480
"Sends out the water from her body"

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.940
But there are cases where people discover

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.260
their Quirks aren't what
they thought they were.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.270
"Turns moisture in the air into water"

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.170
So you're allowed to update it once or twice.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.030
They won't accept outrageous changes,

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.540
but if you had "none" before,
it's probably fine.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.660
--And by "probably," I mean I'm sure--

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.660
--I'm home!

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.410
Oh, I hung up by accident!

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.910
I'll have to apologize later.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.880
Welcome back!

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.360
Hey, Izuku--

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.060
Congrats on getting into U.A.!

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.960
I might've jumped to conclusions, though.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.320
A jumpsuit?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.830
It's not much as it is now, though.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.260
When you'd dozed off while studying,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.820
I happened to see your notebook.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:10.390
"Cool like All Might"

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.100
What?

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:16.140
The terrible thing I said kept bothering me.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.380
I gave up back then.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:25.180
But you didn't give up.
You kept chasing your dream, didn't you?

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.790
I'm sorry, Izuku. I'll support you openly
with everything I've got from now on!

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.250
These are my mother's feelings.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.500
What'll I wear if not this!

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.690
Even if it's not the most convenient
or state-of-the-art, it's fine.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.010
This is my costume!

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.430
Oh, Deku?

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.580
Uraraka!

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.020
That looks cool!

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.900
Really down to earth.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.590
I should've written what I wanted...

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.540
Mine ended up being a skintight bodysuit.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.650
It's embarrassing...

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.570
The hero course is the best.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.420
So obvious.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.670
Now, it's time for combat training!

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.020
Sir!

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.420
Oh, that was Iida.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.960
He looks cool.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.200
This is a battle center
from the entrance exam,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.680
so will we be conducting urban battles again?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.560
No, we're going to move ahead two steps!

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.740
Most of the time,
fighting villains takes place outside,

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:42.150
but if you look at the total numbers,
atrocious villains appear indoors at a higher rate.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.140
Imprisonment, house arrest, backroom deals--

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.100
In this society filled with heroes,

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.700
truly intelligent villains
hide in the shadows!

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.960
For this class, you'll be split into villains
and heroes and fight 2-on-2 indoor battles.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.500
Without basic training?

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.210
This is a real battle
to understand those basics!

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.470
However, the key this time is that
there's no robot you can just beat up.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.340
How will wins and losses be determined?

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.840
Can we beat them up anyway?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.960
Will the punishment be
expulsion like with Mr. Aizawa?

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.430
How shall we be split up?

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.890
Isn't this cape crazy?

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.150
I'll answer all your questions!

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.200
Now listen here.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.150
A script?

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.650
The situation is that
the villains have hidden

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.700
a nuclear weapon somewhere in their hideout.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.070
The heroes are trying to dispose of that.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.560
The heroes need to catch the villains or get
the nuclear weapon back in the allotted time.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.010
The villains need to protect
the nuclear weapon for the whole time

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.540
"Battle"
"Talk"
"Check"

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.980
or catch the heroes.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.940
The situation feels very American!

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.210
Teams and opponents will be
determined by drawing lots!

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.240
They're being decided so haphazardly?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.510
Pros often have to create makeshift
teams with heroes from other agencies,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.330
so maybe that's why?

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.680
I see. The discernment to look ahead...

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.230
Please excuse my rudeness!

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.400
It's fine. Let's do this quickly!

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.020
"Team A"

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.650
"Team B"

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.270
"Team C"

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.900
"Team D"

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.530
"Team E"

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.150
"Team F"

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.780
"Team G"

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.410
"Team H"

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.030
"Team I"

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.660
"Team J"

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.650
Wow, it must be fate! I'm counting on you!

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.460
Seriously?! I have to
speak properly, or else--

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.640
The first teams to fight will be...

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.710
...these guys!

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.260
Team A will be the heroes,
and Team D will be the villains.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.490
Everyone else, head toward the monitor room.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.140
Yes, sir!

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.910
Villain team, go in first and set up!

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.410
In five minutes, the hero team
will break in, and the battle will start!

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.380
Yes, sir!

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.130
Young Iida, Young Bakugo,

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.820
learn to think from the
perspective of the villains.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.180
This is pretty close to a real battle.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.550
Go all out. Don't be afraid to get hurt.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.560
Yes, sir!

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.560
If things go too far, I will stop it.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.380
Yes, sir!

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.620
Even if this is training,
it pains me to become a villain.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.440
So our job is to protect this?

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.730
It's papier-mâché.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.530
Hey!

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.570
Deku has a Quirk, right?

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.560
You saw that extraordinary
strength, didn't you?

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.750
It appears to carry a lot of risk, though...

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.080
However, you seem to be especially
angry when it comes to Midoriya...

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.710
Did he dare trick me?!

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.420
That damn nerd!

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.850
It's a lot of work to memorize
the building's floor plan.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.120
But All Might is just
the same as when he's on TV.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.440
Unlike Mr. Aizawa, it looks
like there's no punishment,

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.290
so we can relax and--

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.740
You're not relaxed at all!

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.520
Well, it's because...
we're up against Kacchan...

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.500
And there's Iida, too,
so I feel like I need to be on guard...

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.980
I see. Bakugo's the one
who makes fun of you, right?

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.120
He's amazing.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.630
I'll definitely surpass All Might
and become the top hero!

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.000
He's a piece of work,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.920
but his goal, his confidence,
his physical strength, and his Quirk

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.820
are way more amazing than mine.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.490
But that's why right now...

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.660
I don't want... to lose...

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.360
A fated battle between men, huh?

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.330
Oh, sorry, this isn't your problem, Uraraka.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.160
It is! We're a team, aren't we?

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.120
Let's do our best!

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:17.710
Now, let's start the indoor person-to-person
combat training with Team A and Team D!

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.220
Okay, everyone, you all should think as well.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.100
Young Midoriya! Here, you are
no more than a single student.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.270
I'll grade you strictly,
without playing favorites.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.930
We've infiltrated successfully!

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.960
There are a lot of blind spots,
so let's be careful.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.940
I still can't control One For All,

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.420
so I can't use it against anyone...

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.140
If I use that on someone, it'll kill them.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.760
We just have to do it with the power
I have now and Uraraka's Zero Gravity.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.120
I've got to use my head...

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.600
Those notes on indoor battles...
battles in tight spaces...

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.980
"Hero Analysis for the Future"

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.220
Remember!

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.220
Uraraka, are you all right?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.580
Yeah, thanks.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.240
Deku?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.440
It's just a scratch.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.790
Come Deku, don't dodge.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.210
I figured you'd come for me first.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.100
A surprise attack from the start?

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.620
Bakugo, that's cheating!

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.430
A surprise attack isn't manly at all!

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.170
A surprise attack is a strategy, too.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.680
They're in the middle
of a real battle right now.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.890
Midori avoided it!

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.310
There goes Bakugo!

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.400
I won't do so much damage that this fight
gets stopped, but I'm gonna get close!

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.080
Wow, he's like a martial arts master!

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.580
What's with this guy?

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.630
Did he read my moves?

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.210
Kacchan...

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.140
You usually start with a big right swing.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.140
How much do you think I've been watching you?

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.780
I wrote an analysis for all the heroes
I thought were amazing in my notebook.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.220
In the notebook you blew up and threw away.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.620
My "Deku" isn't always
going to mean "useless"!

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.810
Kacchan,

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.750
my "Deku" means "You can do it!"

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.280
But "Deku" sounds like the
Japanese word for "You can do it!"

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.170
so I kinda like it.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.930
Deku...

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.490
If you keep going, I'll never forgive you!

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.230
Even though you're scared...

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:28.410
That's what I hate about you!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
"Next time"

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.960
Midoriya, even if this is combat training,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.000
I will give it my all,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.180
so as not to embarrass the
name of the hero family, Iida!

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.640
Iida, you're going to play a villain, huh?

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.570
I am extremely evil, you know.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.830
H-He's completely in character!

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.100
Next time, "Deku vs. Kacchan"!

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.760
I didn't know Uraraka was a baseball player!

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.320
Go beyond!

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.330
"Next time: Deku vs. Kacchan"

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.060
Plus Ultra!
