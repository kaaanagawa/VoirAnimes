00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.980
The cumulative results
for the practical exam are out!

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.770
I can't believe he got
first place with no rescue points.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.690
The faux villains acquire
their targets and draw near them.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.520
In the second half,
as others were slowing down,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.660
he used his flashy Quirk to keep bringing
them close and then counterattacking.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.030
It's the result of his toughness.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.710
In contrast, there's the 7th place
student with zero villain points.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.740
There have been other examinees
who took on the large villain in the past,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.760
but it's been a while since
I last saw someone blow it away.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.010
But to suffer such a serious
injury from his own attack...

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.010
It's like he's a young child
whose Quirk just manifested.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.520
The night after I opened
my acceptance letter,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.530
that person contacted me.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.200
All Might!

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.120
Who's that?!

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.950
All Might?

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.710
No way! Where?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.680
Repeat after me. "I had the wrong person."

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.530
Oh, I had the wrong person!

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.360
Aw, what?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.250
I was hoping to see him...

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.520
Congrats on getting accepted.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.690
Th-Th-Thank you very much!

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.870
Just so you know, I didn't tell
the school about my connection to you.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.820
You're the type that would
think that's cheating, right?

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.680
I wasn't one of the judges.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.110
Th-Thank you for your concern!

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.310
But I was surprised to find out
that you were a teacher at U.A.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.530
So that's why you came here, huh?

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.300
I mean, your agency is in
Roppongi in Minato, Tokyo at--

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.660
Stop that!

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.800
I couldn't tell anyone
before the school announced it.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.470
I just happened to be offered a job from
U.A. when I was searching for a successor.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.050
I have been looking for a successor.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.960
I see. He was originally planning
on choosing one of the students.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.470
One of the students gifted
with an amazing Quirk.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.320
My body broke with one kick
and one punch of One For All.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.570
I can't control it at all.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.540
That can't be helped.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.200
It's like if you asked a person
who suddenly grew a tail to do a trick,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.980
they wouldn't even be able to control it.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.630
Wait, did you know that would happen?!

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.600
Well, there wasn't any time...

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.200
But it turned out all right.
It turned out "all might"!

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.640
Right now, you're either
at a hundred percent or zero.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.990
But once you can control it,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.770
you'll be able to you'll be able
to adjust to what your body can handle.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.190
Control?!

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.480
The more you train a vessel,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.400
the more you'll be able
to move the power freely.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.530
Like this.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.310
Wait, is that All Might?!

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.330
No way! When did he get here?!

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.920
Let's go, Young Midoriya!

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.160
Y-Yes, sir!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.840
The flame I passed on to you is still small,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.010
but in the future, it'll be exposed
to wind and rain and grow even bigger.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.270
And then, I will slowly become weak
and disappear, and I will finish my job.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.450
Yeah, that's deep.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.690
"Episode 5: What I Can Do for Now"

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.940
"April"

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.940
Izuku, do you have tissue?

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.790
Yeah.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.270
And your handkerchief?
What about your handkerchief? Your hanky?

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.670
I have it! I'm going to be late.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.450
I have to hurry.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.490
Izuku!

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.450
What is it?!

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.540
You're really cool.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.020
That was the beginning
of my high school career.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.770
I'm off!

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.680
The acceptance rate for
U.A. High's hero course

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.690
is less than one in three hundred every year.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.700
Other than the four people
admitted through recommendations,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.400
36 are admitted through the regular exam.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.900
Those 36 are split into only
two classes, with 18 in each.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.910
Class 1-A... 1-A... This place's too big...

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.910
There it is!

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.710
The door's huge!

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.080
Is it for accessibility...?

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.240
The elite chosen from
the huge number at the exam...

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.220
I hope I'm not in the
same class as the scary peopl--

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.970
Don't put your feet on the desk!

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.090
Huh?

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.360
Don't you think that's rude
to the U.A. upperclassmen

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.040
and the people who made the desk?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.640
Nope. What junior high did
you go to, you side character?

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.900
The top two?

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.110
I attended Somei Private Academy.
My name is Tenya Iida.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.400
Somei? So you're a damn elite, huh?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.840
Looks like I'll have fun crushing you.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.290
"Crushing"?

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.260
That's cruel. Do you truly aim to be a hero?

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.210
You're...

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.120
Oh, um...

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.940
Good morning!

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.120
I am from Somei Private Academy. My name is--

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.140
I heard!

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.690
I'm Midoriya. Nice to meet you, Iida.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.500
Midoriya, you realized there was something
more to that practical exam, didn't you?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.720
I had no idea...

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.560
I misjudged you!

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.610
I hate to admit it, but
you are better than me.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.570
Sorry. I actually didn't realize anything.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.360
Oh, that curly hair!
You're the plain-looking one!

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.220
--You passed, just like Present Mic said!

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.620
--It's the nice person!

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.250
--She looks good in a uniform...

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.040
--Of course you did! Your punch was amazing!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.750
--Oh, well, um, it was thanks to you going
to speak with him directly that I, uh...

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.750
--Break! Break! Bre--

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.500
Huh? How did you know about that?

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.170
Oh, uh, that's because...

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.180
I can't believe we have two students
from our school matriculating into U.A.!

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.310
Especially you, Midoriya. It's a miracle!

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.630
What dirty tricks did
you use to get in, huh?!

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.730
"The first student from
his school to go to U.A."

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.900
My future plan has already
been torn to pieces.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.090
I told you to go somewhere else!

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.060
Kacchan.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.920
Someone told me...

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.160
"You can become a hero"...

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.020
That it was because of my own effort...

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.580
Th-That's why...

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.640
I'm going...!

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.320
How dare he defy me?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.600
Something's definitely up.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.320
I wonder if today's just the
entrance ceremony and orientation?

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.240
I wonder what our teacher's like?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.440
--Aren't you nervous?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.440
--S-So close!

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.690
Go somewhere else if you
want to play at being friends.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.910
This is the hero course.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.990
S-Something's here?!

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.330
Okay, it took eight seconds
before you were quiet.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.130
Time is limited.
You kids are not rational enough.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.320
A teacher?

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.510
Which means, that person's a pro hero, too?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.510
But I've never seen a hero
who looked that worn out before.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.120
I'm your homeroom teacher, Shota Aizawa.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.930
Nice to meet you.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.000
Homeroom teacher?!

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.440
It's kind of sudden, but put
this on and go out onto the field.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.320
"Teacher Directory"

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.780
The U.A. system does not
follow the beaten path.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.740
Depending on the homeroom teacher,
even the first day can be...

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.620
A Quirk assessment test?!

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.120
What about the entrance ceremony?
The orientation?

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.170
If you're going to become a hero,
you don't have time for such leisurely events.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.040
U.A.'s selling point is how
unrestricted its school traditions are.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.970
That's also how the teachers
run their classes.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.940
You kids have been doing
these since junior high, too, right?

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.810
Physical fitness tests where you
weren't allowed to use your Quirks.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.320
The country still uses averages taken from
results from students not using their Quirks.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.600
It's not rational.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.450
Well, the Ministry of
Education is procrastinating.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.240
Bakugo, you finished at the
top of the practical exam, right?

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.530
In junior high, what was your
best result for the softball throw?

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.350
67 meters.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.630
Then, try doing it with your Quirk.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.210
You can do whatever you want
as long as you stay in the circle.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.590
Hurry up. Give it all you've got.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.970
Then, well...

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.850
I'll add a blast to the pitch.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.640
Die...!

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.980
Die?

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.620
Know your own maximum first.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.700
That is the most rational way
to form the foundation of a hero.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.580
750 meters? Seriously?

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.670
What's this? It looks fun!

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.920
We can use our Quirks as much as we want!
As expected from the hero course!

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.340
"It looks fun," huh?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.910
You have three years to become a hero.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.700
Will you have an attitude
like that the whole time?

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.600
All right. Whoever comes
in last place in all eight tests

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.480
will be judged to have no potential
and will be punished with expulsion.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.270
Huh?!

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.800
Aizawa, huh?

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.570
"Name: Shota Aizawa -
Erasure Hero: Eraser Head"

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.580
He'll be facing a lot of
suffering from the start.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.390
Punished with expulsion?!

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.440
Oh no... This is bad... In all eight tests?

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.670
I can only use One For All at
either a hundred or zero percent.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.990
I can't control it yet...

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.800
We're free to do what we want
about the circumstances of our students.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.140
Welcome to U.A.'s hero course!

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.600
A huge test on the first day of school?

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.910
What am I going to do?!

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.820
Last place will be expelled?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.080
But it's the first day of school!

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.990
No, even if it wasn't the
first day of school, this is too unfair!

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.750
Natural disasters, big accidents,

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.250
and selfish villains.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.870
Calamities whose time
or place can't be predicted.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.510
Japan is covered with unfairness.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.180
Heroes are the ones
who reverse those situations.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.240
If you wanted to go talk with your friends
at Mickey D's after school, too bad.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.190
For the next three years, U.A. will do all it
can to give you one hardship after another.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.050
Go beyond. Plus Ultra.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.200
Overcome it with all you've got.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.730
This is too serious to be hazing.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.410
However, this is the best of the best.
There is no choice but to do it.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.790
This isn't all I've got.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.420
All right, demonstration's over.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.090
The real thing starts now.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.590
"Test 1: 50-meter dash"

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.970
On your mark...

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.510
Get set...

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.080
3.04 seconds.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.090
For 50 meters, I can only
go up to third gear...

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.900
"Tenya Iida"

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.900
Tenya Iida. Quirk: Engine.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.900
As you can see, his legs are fast.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.690
Well, he's like a fish in water.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.340
It'll be worth seeing what others do.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.910
"Tsuyu Asui: 5.58 seconds"

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.200
Ribbit.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.220
Lighten up my clothes and shoes...

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.790
"Ochaco Uraraka"

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.790
Ochaco Uraraka. Quirk: Zero Gravity!

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.280
Get set...

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.970
She can nullify the gravitational
pull of any object she touches.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.980
However, if she goes over capacity,
she'll get really nauseous.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.380
5.49 seconds.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.530
7.15 seconds.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.190
Oh, but that's faster than
I was in junior high!

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.950
Everyone, you're not being creative enough.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.410
--On your mark...

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.410
--I'll show you what it's like...

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.530
--Get set...

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.320
...to be allowed to use your Quirk!

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.330
"Yuga Aoyama"

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.330
Yuga Aogama. Quirk: Navel Laser!

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.120
He can shoot a laser from his bellybutton.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.710
He's limited by the amount
of time he can shoot continuously.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.700
5.51 seconds.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.800
If I shoot for more than a second,
I get a stomachache.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.120
What the heck?

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.690
Looking at the upper limit of your Quirks
and the room for growth in each result,

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.620
it becomes clear what you can and can't do.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.030
On your mark...

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.190
Get set...

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.190
That will connect to the
creativity needed for you to survive.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.780
Explosive speed!

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.410
4.13 seconds.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.290
"Katsuki Bakugo"

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.290
Katsuki Bakugo. Quirk: Explosion!

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.870
7.02 seconds.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.140
When I use both hands, the force disperses...

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.340
Deku is...

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.230
There are seven more tests.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.340
I'm sure everyone will use their Quirks
to produce some extraordinary results.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:18.360
On the other hand, I have this power
that will break my body if I use it once.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.780
Control... Control...

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.770
Even if I have the image in my head,
when I have to actually use it...

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.620
The trick to controlling it is...

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.560
...feeling!

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.030
Wow, that's All Might for you!

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.230
You've already pulled out the 100%.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.940
It destroyed me, though.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.970
But now that you have, it'll be easy.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.890
You should've already grasped the feeling.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.000
What was it like?

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.790
It was like a "bzzt" or a "whoosh"... Um...

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.800
I know! Like an egg put into a microwave!

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.890
That's boring, but unique!

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.370
If that's the image you have,

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.890
then lower the wattage,

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.380
or shorten the cook time.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.860
Anything's fine, just focus on
the image of the egg not exploding.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.300
The image...?

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.110
You have three weeks until school starts.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.600
Keep focusing on that image.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.880
It won't happen overnight,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.170
but I'm sure you will be
able to do it someday.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.800
"Test 2: Grip strength"

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.070
The image of the egg not exploding...

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.100
Wow!

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.320
540 kilograms? What are you, a gorilla?

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.080
Oh, an octopus?

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.520
Octopuses are sexy.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.820
"Test 3: Standing long jump"

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.180
Control...

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.710
"Test 4: Repeated side steps"

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.250
"Test 5: Ball throw"

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.600
Infinity?!

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.140
That's amazing! She got "infinity"!

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.750
This is bad. It's not something
simple that I can just do right away.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.490
Everyone's leaving at
least one amazing result...

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.680
All that's left is this,
the long-distance run, sit-ups,

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.370
and the seated toe-touch.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.600
It's now or never.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.980
At this rate, I'll be last.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.140
It doesn't look good for
Midoriya if he continues like this.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.380
Huh? Of course not.
He's a Quirkless small fry, you know.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.690
Quirkless?! Are you not aware
of what he did in the entrance exam?

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.660
Huh?

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.500
It's about time, huh?

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.020
Izuku! You're really cool.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.520
You can become a hero.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.650
I'll definitely become one!

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.160
46 meters.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.000
I was definitely trying to use it just now...

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.000
I erased your Quirk.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.010
That entrance exam was
definitely not rational enough.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.100
Even a kid like you was accepted.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.760
You erased my Quirk?

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.480
Those goggles... I see!

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.060
You can erase other people's Quirks
with your Quirk just by looking at them.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.540
The Erasure Hero: Eraser Head!

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.140
Eraser? I don't know him.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.210
I've heard of him. He's an underground hero.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.160
He doesn't like media attention
because he says it hinders his work.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.560
That's right, Young Midoriya.
He and I don't get along.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.170
From what I can tell,
you can't control your Quirk, can you?

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.090
Do you intend to become incapacitated
again and have someone save you?

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.180
Th-That's not my intention--

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.950
Whatever your intention,

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.810
I'm saying that's what those
around you will be forced to do.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.680
In the past, there was an
oppressively passionate hero

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.700
who saved over a thousand people
by himself and created a legend.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.170
Even if you have the same reckless valor,

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.860
you'll just be decked and turn into
a useless doll after saving one person.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.330
Izuku Midoriya. With your power,
you can't become a hero.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.600
I've returned your Quirk.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.340
You have two turns for the ball throw.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.860
Hurry up and get it over with.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.170
--It looks like he received some advice.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.780
--Are you worried about him?

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.690
--Probably just telling him he's expelled.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.870
I'm...

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.130
...not at all.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.860
Who are you?

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.490
What should I do? Which should I choose?

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.180
Will he incorrigibly prepare for
an honorable defeat here

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.580
by using all his strength,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.410
or become intimidated
and settle into last place?

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.300
No matter which he chooses,
he has no potential.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.400
I still can't control my power.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.300
Should I let everything
I can do hang on this one throw?

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.310
Even All Might said that
it wouldn't happen overnight.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.430
This is no good! If that's my only choice,
then I just have to go all out!

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.930
Zero potential.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.940
It's just as Mr. Aizawa says.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.860
At this rate, there's no
way I'll become a hero.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.660
Hey, hey, is he serious?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.120
I have to work a lot
harder than other people!

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.860
That's why, with all my strength...

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.170
I'll do what I can right now!

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.760
Smash...!

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.600
It doesn't hurt as much as before...

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.970
Do you intend to become incapacitated
again and have someone save you?

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.820
Mr. Aizawa...

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.950
I can still move!

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.200
This kid...

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.800
I came because I was worried,
but what the heck, young man?!

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.820
You still couldn't control your power,
but you also couldn't become incapacitated.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.300
So, you propelled the ball
at the last point of contact

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.770
by sending the power of
One For All to just your fingertip,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.980
minimizing the injury
while maximizing the power...!

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.480
What the heck, young man?!

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.780
You're so cool!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
"Next time"

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.950
Hero Basic Training, a class only
available in the hero course at U.A.!

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.920
Deku, let's do our
best together in battle training.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.760
Uraraka...?! I talked to a girl again!

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.720
Looks like we're up against
Team Iida and Bakugo.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.750
I'm going to fight against Kacchan!

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.760
Next time, "Rage, You Damn Nerd"!

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.020
Deku's going to put bunny ears
on his head! It's so cute!

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.520
Go beyond!

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.520
"Next time: Rage, You Damn Nerd"

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.640
Plus Ultra!
