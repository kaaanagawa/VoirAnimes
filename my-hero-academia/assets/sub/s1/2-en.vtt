00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.160
It's fine now. Why?

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.330
Because I am here.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.550
He's so cool!

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.800
Once I get my Quirk, I
wanna be like him, too!

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.300
You should probably give it up.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.890
Even if that was true...

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.760
You're below the rejects! You're Quirkless!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.690
How can you even stand
in the same ring as me?

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.260
What the hell can you do?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.610
Even if that's what everyone thinks...

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.360
I'm sorry, Izuku!

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.180
No, that's not it. That's not it, Mom.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.560
I...

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.520
Even so, I...

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.890
Even if I don't have a Quirk,
can I become a hero?

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.110
Can even someone without a Quirk be like you?

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.010
Without a Quirk...?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.260
Oh no, holy shit, goddammit...

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.500
It might've been because
I don't have a Quirk,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.720
but I'm always made fun of...

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.310
Maybe that's why... I don't know...

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.440
But I think saving people is super cool.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.440
Saving people with a fearless smile.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.740
I want to be the greatest hero, like you...!

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.930
"Tatooin Shopping District"
"Welcome"

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.690
Wh-Where am I...? What happened...?

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.440
--Texas Smash!

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.440
--Oh yeah... That bastard...

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.850
If it weren't for that bastard...

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.920
Hey, Katsuki, aren't you
and Midoriya childhood friends?

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.340
You went a little overboard today.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.590
It's his fault for getting in my way.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.650
Don't let it get to you.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.200
It's just that it's been
my goal ever since I was little.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.070
And well...

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.240
I won't know unless I try...

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.770
He's an idiot dreaming like a kid!

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.150
Just watching him pisses me off!

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.920
Then, why don't we go to
the arcade for a change of pace?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.320
You'll come, too, right, Katsuki?

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.160
Yeah.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.330
Then let's go to the
one in front of the station.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.160
There's lots of prey there.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.920
You're terrible.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.760
What?! If we get caught,
it'll end up on my record!

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.790
Hey, look!

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.420
An invisible cloak with a great Quirk!

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.010
"Episode 2: What It Takes to Be a Hero"

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.810
Y-Y-You're deflating...!

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.600
Wait, up until now... Huh?!

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.490
Fake? A fake?! You're so skinny!

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.280
I am All Might...

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200
No way!

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.640
You know how the guys at the pool
are constantly flexing and posturing?

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.150
It's like that.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.210
No way...!

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.130
I-It can't be...

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.380
All Might is fearless...
He saves everyone with a smile...

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.930
He's the greatest...

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.830
A fearless smile, huh?

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.020
Now that you've seen me like this, young man,

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.110
make sure you don't write
about it online, even accidentally.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.240
It's an injury I got from an
enemy's attack five years ago.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.010
Half of my respiratory organs were destroyed,

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.900
and I lost my whole stomach.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.210
I've become emaciated from
repeated surgeries and the aftereffects.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.920
Right now, I can only work as
a hero for about three hours a day.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.220
That can't be...

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.680
Five years ago... Was that
when you fought Toxic Chainsaw?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.710
You're well-informed.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.180
But a punk like that couldn't defeat me.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.080
This fight was not made public to the world.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.440
I asked that it not be made public.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.550
I will save people with a smile!

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.870
The Symbol of Peace cannot
be daunted by evil.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.960
I smile to show the pressure of heroes

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.180
and to trick the fear inside of me.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.480
Pros are always risking their lives.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.180
I cannot simply say, "You can
become a hero even without power."

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.050
I see...

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.550
If you want to help others,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.880
then you could also become a police officer.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.920
They're often teased because
they get villains delivered to their doorstep,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.740
but that is also a fine occupation.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.580
It's not bad to dream.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.100
But you also have to consider
what's realistic, young man.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.020
Now, I need to quickly get this guy...

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.920
Don't tell me...

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.330
A villain!

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.830
What hero will go to the scene?

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.780
I cannot simply say, "You can
become a hero even without power."

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.530
"Tatooin Shopping District"
"Welcome"

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.490
It's a villain!

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.790
A child was taken hostage?!

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.960
You coward!

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.510
What is this?

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:38.890
I can't grab hold!

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.690
Death Arms!

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.540
Crap!

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.920
Don't come near me!

00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.680
I won't let sewage like this swallow me!

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.930
You little--

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.370
What power!

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.250
I've hit the jackpot!

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.630
With this Quirk and power,
I can get revenge on that guy!

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.000
Woah, what's that?!
Could he be a big-shot villain?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.240
She's here! The rookie hero, Mt. Lady!

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:33.230
W-Wait... I need there
to be at least two lanes!

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.650
I'm not good with explosions!

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.870
I'll leave it to someone else for today!

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.410
Thanks for that.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.300
I have my hands full fighting the fire.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.330
The fire truck's not here yet?

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.330
How are things over there?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.540
He's sticky and hard to grab,

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.210
and a child with a strong
Quirk is struggling against him.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.290
Thanks to that, it's a minefield.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.720
It's hard to do anything
against this triple play!

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.470
Crap!

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.070
It's no use!

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.790
There's no one who can take
care of this at the scene right now!

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.900
All we can do is wait for
someone with a more suitable Quirk!

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.020
Let's hold back the damage until then!

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.530
Don't worry, I'm sure
someone will be here soon!

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.560
I feel bad for that child, but
he'll just have to bear it a little longer.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.910
Damn it!

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.820
If only I had enough
power to blow that guy away!

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.280
Hey, doesn't it look kinda bad?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.870
You can do it, heroes!

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.590
It was back then!

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.840
I was too distracted by my time limit!

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.320
I can't believe I made a mistake
like this after admonishing that fan.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.660
Pathetic...

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.380
Pathetic...

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.210
"Kamui Woods"
"Best at holding back damage"
"So cool!"

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.130
He still can't face reality,

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.060
even though he's already a
third year in junior high.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.090
"Mt. Lady" "Gigantification! 20 m!?"
"Canyon Cannon"
"Huge!" "Sexy"

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.860
It's time for you to think
seriously about your future.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.180
You also have to consider what's realistic.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.640
"Hero Analysis for the Future"

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.940
Even a top pro said it.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.620
Don't cry! You knew, didn't you?

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.020
The reality.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.170
You knew. That's why you
were trying so desperately.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.000
You were averting your eyes,
not looking at reality.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.830
Is this where the explosion earlier was...?

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.670
Hang on, does that mean
I came out of habit without noticing?

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.500
Stop it. It'll just feel
meaningless right now.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.170
Why's that guy here?!

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.550
Did it get away from All Might?!

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.560
Did he drop it?

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.910
If he did...

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.900
...then it's my fault...

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.620
Why aren't the heroes doing anything?

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.400
They can't. Apparently the villain
caught a junior high schooler.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.280
It's been like that for a while.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.200
Caught...? It's been like that for a while?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.200
How can they bear that suffocation?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.490
I thought I'd die after a few seconds.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.630
Wow...

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.750
Anyway, wasn't that villain the one
All Might was chasing earlier?

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.130
All Might? No way! He's here?

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.240
I think I saw him earlier.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.260
Seriously?!

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.220
Then what's All Might doing?!

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.340
It's my fault...!

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.510
He can't do anything!

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.620
Pathetic...

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.660
He can't catch that guy.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.410
All we can do is wait for a hero
with a more suitable Quirk!

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.300
Pathetic...

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.880
Do your best! I'm sorry!

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.290
I'm so sorry!

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.590
Pathetic!

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.260
Help will arrive soon...

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.470
Pathetic!

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.330
Someone... A hero... will soon...

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.290
Idiot! Stop!

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.460
Stop!

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.960
That brat...

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.830
Deku...

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.930
Why did I run out?

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.130
What am I doing?

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.090
Why?!

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.010
Die in an explosion!

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.350
What do I do? What do I
do at a time like this?

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.700
"Pre-emptive Binding Lacquered Chain Prison:
Quickly stretch out arms (vines)"

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.140
Page 25!

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.160
"to make the opponent flinch back,
and then use that opening to restrain them"

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.140
and then use that opening to restrain them"

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.850
Take that!

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.940
Kacchan!

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.240
Why are you here?!

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.730
My legs moved on their own!

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.990
I don't know why, though!

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.580
I think there were various reasons.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.970
You should probably give it up.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.410
--It's my fault...

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.890
--How can you even stand
in the same ring as me?

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.200
--He's so cool!

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.240
--Unless I try...

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.040
--Kacchan!

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.540
--It's been my goal...

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.500
I'll do my best!

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.460
He saves everyone with a smile...

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.260
But at that moment...

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.390
You looked like you were asking for help...

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.330
Stop it...!

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.050
Pathetic...

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.960
Pathetic!

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.490
Just a little longer.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.410
Don't get in my way!

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.160
He'll die in vain! Is he suicidal?!

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.810
I really am pathetic.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.090
All Might...

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.390
Even though I admonished you,
I wasn't putting what I said into practice!

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.930
Pros are always risking their lives!

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.280
All Might!

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.160
Detroit Smash!

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.320
Rain?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.960
Don't tell me it's from
the wind pressure just now?

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.070
An updraft developed and...

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.370
He made... clouds...?

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.920
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.430
With just his right fist,
he changed the weather!

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.990
That's amazing!

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.980
That's All Might for ya!

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.490
After this, heroes collected
the scattered sludge,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.930
and safely delivered it to the police.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.700
Jeez, there's a limit to how rash you can be!

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.040
There was absolutely no reason
for you to put yourself in danger!

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.050
I got majorly scolded by the heroes,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.200
but Kacchan was praised.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.650
That was amazing toughness!

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.970
And that Quirk!

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.240
Once you're a pro,
please come to my agency!

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.300
You'll definitely be an excellent sidekick!

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:10.460
I wanted to apologize to All Might,
but he was still getting interviewed...

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.000
I'll try sending him a message
on his website when I get home.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.990
Deku!

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.980
Kacchan...?

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:28.670
I never asked you for help!

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.350
And you didn't help me!

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.190
Got it?!

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.800
I was fine by myself.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.780
You're a Quirkless failure playing without a
full deck! Don't think you can look down on me!

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.460
Are you trying to make me owe you?!

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.240
Don't look down on me!

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.450
You damn nerd!

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.330
"Toughness"...

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.880
It's just as Kacchan said.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.200
It's not like I accomplished anything,
or changed anything.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.340
But, I'm glad.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.760
Now I can think of a realistic future...

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.620
I am here!

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.310
A-All Might?!

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.620
Why are you here?

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.810
You were surrounded
by reporters until just now...

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.770
Getting away from them was a piece of cake.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.230
Why?

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.810
Because I am All Migh--

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.620
Young man. I come with thanks,
a correction, and a suggestion.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.660
If you hadn't been there...
If you hadn't told me about your life...

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.520
I would've turned into a guy
in a bodysuit who was all talk.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.630
Thank you.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.710
That can't be...
It was my fault in the first place.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.700
I got in the way of your work,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.200
and I said all those impertinent
things even though I'm Quirkless...

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.270
That's right.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:56.220
It was because it was none other
than the timid, Quirkless you at the scene

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.730
that I was able to act.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.000
Top heroes have stories
about them from their school days.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.960
Most of their stories
have one thing in common:

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:15.250
Their bodies moved before
they had a chance to think.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.850
For some reason,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.970
I remembered my mother's words.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.470
I'm sorry, Izuku!

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.360
That was true for you, too, wasn't it?

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.640
Yeah...

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.450
That's not it, Mom.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.780
Back then, what I wanted you to say...

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.540
The words I wanted to hear were...

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.970
You can become a hero.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.780
Dreams can become reality.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:27.460
By the way, I forgot to mention that this is
the story of how I became the greatest hero.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
"Next time"

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.950
Young man, you are worthy
to inherit my power.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.010
Inherit your power?

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.480
Take my Quirk, One For All!

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.140
With this, I can become a hero, too, right?

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.720
Of course not. Your body can't take it.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.450
Huh?

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.230
Next time, "Roaring Muscles"!

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.640
Young Midoriya will get buff!

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.310
Go beyond!

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.290
"Next time: Roaring Muscles"

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.030
Plus Ultra!
