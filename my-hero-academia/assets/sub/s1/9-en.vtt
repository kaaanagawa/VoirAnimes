WEBVTT

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.990
Hey, you!

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.850
How are All Might's classes?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.740
Uh, excuse me,
I have to go to the nurse's office!

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.290
Will you tell us about what the
Symbol of Peace is like as a teacher?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.310
Wh-What he's like?

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.280
Um...

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.250
He's very muscular!

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.850
What do you think of All Might as a teacher?

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.760
He made me recognize anew
that I attend an educational institution

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.430
that is the best of the best.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.790
Of course, his dignity and
character go without saying,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.430
but we students are constantly
able to see his humorous side.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.930
It is a unique opportunity

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.690
to learn about being
a top hero directly from one.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.410
Excuse me! Can you tell me about All Migh--

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.020
Oh? You're the one who was
caught by the sludge villain...

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.650
Stop it!

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.780
Um, about All Might...

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.510
Wow, you're scruffy... What's your deal?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.560
He's not on duty today.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.870
You are disturbing the classes. Please leave.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.370
I would like to speak
directly with All Might--

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.880
I feel like I've seen him before...

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.920
Don't you think you're too scruffy?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.890
I can't believe All Might was able
to work as a hero with all this.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.100
Hey! Just a little time is fine!

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.410
--Just let me see All Might--

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.410
--Ah, idiot!

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.770
Wh-What the...?!

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.980
It's the U.A. Barrier.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.280
That's what we call it.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.200
That's so lame!

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.190
What the heck is that?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.740
If someone tries to get in without
a student ID or a pass to enter,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.160
the security system kicks in.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.420
Apparently, there are
sensors all over the school.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.660
What the heck?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.730
They think they're so high and mighty.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.020
They could at least give a brief comment.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.740
Seriously, we've been here for two days,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.170
and they still won't say anything.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.090
The news that All Might had been hired
as a teacher at U.A. surprised the nation,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.980
and the media descended on the school
and caused a commotion for days.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.440
Everyone knew about it.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.080
Yeah, everyone.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.360
"Episode 9: Yeah, Just Do Your Best, Iida!"

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.620
Good work on yesterday's combat training.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.710
I saw the video and results.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.690
Bakugo, you're talented,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.270
so don't act like a kid.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.570
I know.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.980
And Midoriya.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.090
You settled it by breaking
your arm again, huh?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.090
You can't keep saying you can't help it
because you can't control your Quirk.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.900
I don't like saying the
same thing over and over.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.820
As long as you fix the control issue,
there's a lot you'll be able to do.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.920
Feel a sense of urgency, Midoriya.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.440
Yes, sir!

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.450
Now let's get down to homeroom business.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.950
Sorry about the late notice,
but today, I'll have you...

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.700
...take another special test?!

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.080
...decide on a class representative.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.710
It's actually a normal school activity!

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.960
I want to be class rep! Pick me!

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960
Me too!

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.090
I want to do it, too.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.460
It's a job made for m--

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.970
I'll be the leader!

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.340
--In a normal class, students might
feel like they're just taking on

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.220
--My manifesto is for all girls' skirts
to be 30 centimeters above the knee!

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.220
--daily duties, and this wouldn't happen,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.100
--but here in the hero course,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.220
--Let me do it! Me!

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.040
--it's a role that allows one

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.940
to practice being a
top hero by leading a group.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.150
Silence, please!

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.500
It is a job with the serious
responsibility of leading others.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.280
It is not a job for just
anyone who wants to do it.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.320
It is a calling that requires
the trust of those around you.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.030
If we want to use democracy
to decide on a true leader,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.910
then we should hold an
election to choose one.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.910
Your hand is raised the highest!

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.710
Why did you suggest that?

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.660
We haven't known each other for that long,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.400
so how can we have trust or anything?

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.380
If that's the case, and
everyone votes for themselves...

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.080
Don't you think that is precisely
why whoever receives multiple votes here

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.510
can be truly considered
the most suitable person?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.740
What do you think, Mr. Aizawa?

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.640
I don't care, as long as you
decide before homeroom is over.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.220
Thank you very much!

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.500
"Election Results"

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.070
"Izuku Midoriya - 3"
"Momo Yaoyorozu - 2 "

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.070
I got three votes?!

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.740
Why Deku?! Who voted for him?!

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.200
Well, it's better than voting for you.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.800
What did you say?!

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.160
It'll be scary if Bakugo finds out...

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.270
I give up! I give up!

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.460
Zero votes...

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.440
I knew that would happen...

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.050
That is only to be expected
of a person's calling.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.160
You voted for someone else, huh?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.280
But you wanted to do it, too.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.420
What are you trying to do, Iida?

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.850
Then, the class rep is Midoriya,
and the deputy class rep will be Yaoyorozu.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.940
S-S-Seriously? Seriously?

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.360
How vexing...

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.440
That might not be too bad.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.610
After all's said and done,
Midoriya can be pretty fired up, anyway.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.600
And Yaoyorozu was cool when
we were going over the battle results!

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.530
"Lunch Rush's Eatery"

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.770
There are a lot of people today, too!

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.020
That's because everyone in the hero course,
support course, and management course

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.630
meets in the same place.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.050
The rice is so delicious!

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.640
Even though I've been chosen as class rep,
I don't know if I'm qualified for it.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.040
You are.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.080
It'll be fine.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.380
Your courage and judgment at
critical moments make you worth following.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.640
That is why I voted for you.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.110
It was you?

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.610
But didn't you want to
be class rep, too, Iida?

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.600
I mean, you've got glasses and everything.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.320
Uraraka just talks without thinking...

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.680
Wanting to do it and being
suitable for it are different issues.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.500
I merely did what I judged to be correct.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.640
"Merely"?

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.180
You don't usually use that word...

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.220
Oh, that's...

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.750
I've been thinking...

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.840
Are you a rich boy, Iida?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.800
Rich...

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.600
I tried to change how I talk
because I didn't want to be called that.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.180
Yes, my family has been
heroes for generations.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.620
I'm the second son.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.240
What?! Wow!

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.820
Do you know the Turbo Hero, Ingenium?

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.070
Of course!

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:58.600
He's a really popular hero who has
65 sidekicks working at his Tokyo agency!

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.540
Don't tell me...!

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.400
He is my elder brother!

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400
He's telling us straight out!

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.740
That's amazing!

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.610
He is a likable hero who
honors the rules and leads people.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.470
I set my sights on being a hero
because I want to be like my brother.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.800
However, I think it is still too
soon for me to lead others.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.850
Unlike me, Midoriya realized the point of
the practical portion of the entrance exam,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.650
so he is more suitable for the job.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.700
This might be the first time
I've seen you smile, Iida.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.740
What, really? I smile!

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.900
Ingenium is to Iida what All Might is to me.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.070
But, I should tell him...

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.170
About the entrance exam...

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.160
An alarm?!

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.380
--There has been a Level 3 security breach.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.920
--What?!

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.800
--All students please
evacuate outdoors promptly.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.120
--What's "Level 3 security"?

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.120
--I repeat...

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.780
It means someone is
trespassing on school grounds!

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.940
I've never seen anything like this
in the three years I've been here!

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.350
You should hurry, too!

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.650
Don't push!

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.160
Wait, I'm falling!

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.820
I said, don't push!

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.820
Ow...

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.600
What's going on all of a sudden?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.160
As expected of the best of the best.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.870
Everyone reacts quickly in a crisis!

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.900
Th-They're so quick that
it's causing a panic!

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.390
Oh, shoot!

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.370
--Midoriya!

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.370
--Deku!

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.230
Who in the world trespassed?

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.010
That's...

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.250
...the press!

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.170
Give us All Might!

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.440
He's here, isn't he?!

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.800
We told you, he's not here!

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.360
If you just give us one
brief comment, we'll leave!

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.260
If you guys get one comment,
you'll want another. That's just how you are.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.430
They're illegal trespassers, you know.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.140
You could call them villains.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.610
You think we can beat 'em up?

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.970
Don't do it, Mic. They'll write up
a bunch of half-truths about you.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.270
Let's wait for the police.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.220
I wondered what it was,
but it's just the media.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.450
Everyone, calm dow--

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:57.950
Ouch!

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.800
Ow!

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.270
Wait, someone fell!

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.560
Don't push!

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.280
Where are the teachers?

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.870
Are they busy trying to deal with everything?

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.520
--Everyone, stop! Slow down! Slow down!

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.520
--Kirishima! Kaminari!

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.500
What the heck?!

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.510
Is there anyone here
who knows everything's fine?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.670
No one has noticed! Everyone's panicking!

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.830
Uraraka!

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.640
Iida!

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.990
What would Midoriya...
or my brother... do in this situation?

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.670
Uraraka!

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.150
Make me...

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.780
Make me float, Uraraka!

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.330
A place in everyone's line of sight...

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.840
Engine boost!

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.930
Iida...!

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.730
Be concise, clear, and bold!

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.940
"Boooom"

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.850
Everyone, everything's fine!

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.800
It is just the media!

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.360
There is nothing to panic about.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.450
Everything's fine!

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.110
This is U.A.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.870
Let us act in a way
befitting the best of the best.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.560
The police are here.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.050
Oh, good.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.420
Goodbye, bad mass media!

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.430
Come on, class rep. Start.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.150
N-Now, let us decide
on the other class officers...

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.070
But first, can I say something?

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.650
I think... that Tenya Iida
should be the class rep after all!

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.630
He was able to get everyone's
attention in such a cool way.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.910
I think it would be best for Iida to do it.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.820
I'm good with that, too.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.720
Midoriya's saying it,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.670
and it's true that Iida was
a big help at the cafeteria today.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.920
Yeah, and he kind of looked like the person

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.260
on the emergency exit signs, didn't he?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.590
You're wasting time.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.290
I don't care what you do,
just hurry up and do it.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.580
If the class rep has nominated me,
then it cannot be helped.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.720
From this day forth, I, Tenya Iida,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.090
promise to do my best to carry out
the duties of class representative.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.820
We're counting on you, Emergency Exit!

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.820
Emergency Exit Iida!

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.530
Do your best!

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.850
What about me...?

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.840
How were the ordinary members of
the press able to do something like this?

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.920
Someone instigated this.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.560
Did someone evil slip in,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.910
or was it intended to
be a declaration of war?

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.890
Listen heroes, don't come after me.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.750
If you do, I'm gonna kill
this rich family here.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.250
It's fine now, family!

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.130
Missouri Smash!

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.760
Why? Because I am here on my way to work.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.260
A hit-and-run!

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.140
It'll be bad if I'm late, but...!

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.810
I've gotten slower...?

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.220
After I gave Young Midoriya One For All,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.830
my powers have been weakening.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.620
On top of that, after
forcing myself that time,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.450
the time I can spend in that form
has gotten shorter than before.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.960
You told Young Bakugo?

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.500
I'm sorry.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.940
I didn't even tell my mom,

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.230
but for some reason,
I felt like I just had to tell him.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.920
I'm really sorry.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.320
I judged that he was
not the type to show off,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.460
so I did not admonish him strongly,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.030
but this seems to be the
result of his sincerity backfiring.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.420
Fortunately, Young Bakugo
did not seem to take it seriously,

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.840
so I'll let it go this time.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.310
But please don't do it again.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.620
Please think carefully about
what it means to have this power.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.450
If word gets out,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.300
it's clear that the world
would be teeming with those trying

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.630
to steal the power from you.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.260
This secret should be kept both
to prevent chaos in society

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.590
and for your sake.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.800
Do you understand?

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.390
Even if he is a suitable vessel,
he is still only a 15-year-old boy.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.250
I have to pull myself together.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.270
Someone's barricaded themselves in
in the neighboring town!

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.780
For today's hero basic training,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.960
it's turned into a class

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.370
with three instructors,
All Might and me, and one more person.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.660
"Turned into"?

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.100
I wonder if it's a special case?

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.250
Excuse me! What'll we be doing?

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.100
Disasters, shipwrecks,
and everything in between.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.380
It's rescue training.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.330
Rescue...

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.000
Looks like it'll be a
lot of work this time, too.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.760
Right?

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.010
Idiot, this is the duty of a hero!

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.140
My arms are ready to rumble!

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.220
No one can beat me in water, ribbit.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.850
Hey, I'm not done.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.470
You can decide if you want
to wear your costume or not this time.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.290
Because there are probably
costumes that limit your abilities, too.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.620
The training will take place
off-campus, so we're taking a bus.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.200
That is all. Start getting ready.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.080
Rescue training...

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.080
What I've admired...

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.180
It's training to get another step
closer to being the greatest hero.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.190
I'll do my best!

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.160
Oh, you're wearing your P.E. clothes.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.420
Where's your costume?

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.600
They got ripped up during
the combat training,

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.930
so I'm waiting for
the support company to fix it.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.560
Class 1-A, gather round!

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.960
Form two lines by your student numbers

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.270
in order to make boarding the bus go smoothly!

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.270
"Smoothly"

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.970
Iida's going at full throttle...

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.120
Shoot. I didn't think
it'd be this type of bus.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.700
There was no point, huh?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.340
I say whatever comes to mind.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.320
Midoriya...

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.270
Um, yes, Asui?

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.920
Call me "Tsu."

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.420
R-Right...

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.150
Your Quirk is like All Might's.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.670
Huh?!

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.120
Y-Y-You think so?

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.560
But I'm... uh...

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.930
Wait a sec, Tsu, All Might
doesn't get hurt when he uses his.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.610
They just kind of look the same.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.480
But it's nice to have a
simple augmenting-type Quirk.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.540
You can do lots of flashy stuff!

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.370
My Hardening's strong against others,

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.580
but unfortunately, it doesn't look like much.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.060
I think it's really cool!

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.800
It's a Quirk that can
definitely pass as a pro's!

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.210
A pro's, huh? But you have to think
about popularity as a hero, too, you know.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.940
My Navel Laser is pro-level
in both flashiness and strength.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.000
But it's not great that
it gives you a stomachache.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.460
Well, if you're talking
about flashy and strong,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.620
it's gotta be Todoroki
and Bakugo, though, huh?

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.260
Bakugo's always mad, so he doesn't
seem like he'll be popular, though.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.570
What the hell! You wanna fight!

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:05.180
See?

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.540
We haven't known each other that long,

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.980
so it's amazing that everyone already knows
his personality is crap steeped in sewage.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.980
What's with that vocabulary, bastard?!
I'll kill you!

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.530
Kacchan's being teased...

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.630
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.320
That's U.A. for you!

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.010
What a vulgar conversation.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.330
But I like stuff like this, too.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.680
We're here. Stop messing around.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.940
Yes, sir!

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.090
Everyone, I have been waiting for you.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.540
It's the Space Hero, Thirteen!

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.260
The gentlemanly hero who has
rescued tons of people from disasters!

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.520
Oh, I love Thirteen!

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.000
Let's go inside without delay.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.910
Look forward to working with you!

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.820
Wow, it looks like USJ!

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.030
A shipwreck,

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.120
a landslide,

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.450
a fire,

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.700
a windstorm,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.460
et cetera--

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.570
It is a training ground that I made with
different types of accidents and disasters.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.150
It's called the "Unforeseen
Simulation Joint,"

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.510
or "USJ" for short!

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.260
It really is USJ...

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.280
Thirteen, where's All Might?

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.260
He was supposed to meet us here.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.670
About that...

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:37.150
It looks like he did too much hero work
on his way to work and ran out of time,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.150
so he's resting in the lounge.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.900
Sorry... I should be able
to go for a little bit at the end.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.160
I'm really sorry!

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.410
That's the height of irrationality.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.500
Well, we took precautions just in case...

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.630
It can't be helped. Shall we begin?

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.860
Let's see... Before we begin, let me
say one thing... er... or two, or three...

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.510
--Or four... five... six... seven...

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.510
--It's increasing...!

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.150
Everyone, I am sure you are
aware of my Quirk, Black Hole.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.850
I can suck up anything and turn it to dust.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.590
You've been able to use
that Quirk to save people

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.430
from all kinds of disasters, right?

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.470
Yes, but it is a power that can kill easily.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.700
Some of you also have
Quirks like that, right?

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.540
In a superhuman society,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.390
personal Quirks have been certified
and stringently regulated,

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.830
so that doesn't seem to
be a problem at first glance.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.840
However, please do not forget

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.090
that there are many Quirks
that can easily kill with one wrong step.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.590
With Aizawa's physical fitness test,

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.850
you found out about the possibility
of your own hidden powers,

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.730
and with All Might's
person-to-person combat training,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.180
I think you experienced the danger
of using those powers against others.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.500
This class is a fresh start.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.540
You shall learn how to use
your Quirks to save people's lives.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.540
You do not have powers
so you can harm others.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.200
I hope you leave here with the understanding
that you have powers in order to help others.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.960
Thirteen's so cool!

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.460
That is all. Thank you for listening.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.910
That was wonderful!

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.390
Bravo! Bravo!

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.470
All right then, first--

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.830
Gather together and don't move!

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.580
Thirteen, protect the students!

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.030
What's that?

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:05.370
Is this like the entrance exam
where the lesson's already started?

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.420
Don't move!

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.390
Those are villains.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.150
And coincidentally, during the time

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.740
when we were supposed
to be practicing saving lives,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.980
they showed up in front of us.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
"Next time"

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.670
Asui, the villains have attacked!

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.670
Call me "Tsu."

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.930
T-T-Tsu...

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.840
N-Next time, "Encounter with the Unknown."

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.010
I know why Mineta's hair is like that now.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.830
Go beyond!

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:15.010
"Next time: Encounter with the Unknown"

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.740
Plus Ultra!
