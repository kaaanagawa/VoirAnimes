00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.380
U.A. High School's hero course.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.000
"U.A. High School Entrance Exam Location"

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.830
A training school for those
whose goal is to acquire

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.980
the necessary qualifications
needed for pro heroes.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.720
Among similar courses across the country,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.050
theirs is the most popular
and most competitive,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.620
and their acceptance rate is less
than one in three hundred every year.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.160
The hero who refused a National Honor Award--

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.420
The number one hero, All Might.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.000
The hero who resolved
the most incidents in history--

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.380
The Fiery Hero, Endeavor.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.560
The winner of the Best Jeanist
award eight years in a row--

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.700
Best Jeanist.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.230
Graduating from U.A. is a
requirement for becoming a great hero.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.600
And so, I also tackled
the U.A. entrance exam.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.650
I will take...

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.930
...the first step toward
my dream of becoming a hero!

"U.A. High School Hero Course

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.080
"Battle Center B "

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.080
What is this?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.280
It's like a city!

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.560
They have more than one
of these on the school grounds?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.920
U.A.'s amazing!

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.050
As it says in the application requirements,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.220
you listeners will be conducting
ten-minute mock urban battles after this!

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.560
Three different types of faux villains
are stationed in each battle center.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.190
You earn points for each of
them based on their level of difficulty.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.480
Your goal, dear listeners,
is to use your Quirks

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.150
to earn points by
immobilizing the faux villains.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.900
Mock battles...

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.160
How can everyone be so confident?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.670
Aren't they nervous?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.300
They even have equipment
to go with their Quirks...

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.720
Oh, it's the person I met at
the school gates! The nice person!

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.450
She was assigned to the
same battle center, huh?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.130
Oh yeah, I have to thank her for earlier.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.350
He's here, too?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.600
That girl appears to be trying to focus.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.880
What are you doing here?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.940
Are you taking the entrance exam
to interfere with everyone else?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.640
N-N-No, of course not...

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.820
That guy's the one who was about
to trip in front of the school gates, right?

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.500
The one who winced after being called out.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.410
At the very least, we have
one less rival to worry about, huh?

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.000
"Lucky"

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.480
Lucky for us.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.000
I feel like the others think
they lucked out because I'm here...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.810
Okay, start!

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.920
What's wrong? There are
no countdowns in real fights!

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.490
Run, run!

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.420
The die has been cast, you know!

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.520
Huh? Huh?

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.430
What?!

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.680

"Episode 4: Start Line"

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.940
I'm behind.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.110
Calm down, calm down. It's fine. It's fine!

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.820
"Dagoba Municipal Beach Park"

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.030
I have All Might with me.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.000
All right! You swallowed the hair, right?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.130
I don't feel any different, though...

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.300
Of course not!

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.200
What do you think the stomach does?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.790
Well, you'll feel something
in two or three hours.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.930
I'm so nervous...

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.490
I need to hurry back,
take a shower, and eat breakfast.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.690
You have become a proper vessel,
but it was one that was made in a hurry.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.300
You didn't even get
to take it for a test drive...

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.390
Prepare yourself for the physical
repercussions it'll have on your body.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.940
Huh?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.030
I don't have time to explain
in detail, so I'll just tell you this.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.040
When you use my Quirk, One For All,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.570
squeeze your buttocks
and yell this inside your heart--

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.320
"S--"

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.010
One point!

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.340
Target acquired. I'll kill you!

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.180
It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.720
Why can't I move?

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.980
Idiot, why?!

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.730
Thanks for distracting it!

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.400
A laser?

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.280
Merci! We made a good team.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.090
But I don't think we'll meet again.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.470
Adieu!

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.930
We won't meet again...?

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.830
Six minutes and two seconds left!

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.440
Oh no! Oh no!

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.460
Oh no!

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.050
Points...

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.010
I need points fast!

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.810
The nice person!

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.610
Release!

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.490
That's twenty-eight points...!

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.580
What? Twenty-eight?

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.790
Forty-five points!

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.550
Forty-five?!

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.510
That's thirty-two!

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.270
That one's mine! Don't take it!

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.180
It's first-come, first-served!

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.260
The number of enemies is decreasing fast!

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.870
Oh no!

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.550
In this practical exam,

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.450
the examinees have not been informed
of the number of villains or their locations.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.000
They have a limited amount
of time in a vast area.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.610
They have to draw the
villains out from there.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.490
Information gathering ability to
understand the situation before anyone else.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.990
Mobility that can be used
in many different circumstances.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.000
Discernment to be able
to stay calm in any situation.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.170
And pure combat ability.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.630
These basic abilities needed
to keep the peace in the streets

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.010
are turned into points in this test.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.840
Doesn't this year's group look promising?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.680
Well, we can't know for sure yet.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.880
Their true test is still to come.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.160
An obstacle that will go
crazy in narrow spaces.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.580
I recommend that you
listeners try to avoid it.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.340
Isn't it a little too big?

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.310
An overwhelming threat.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.620
How people act after they've
seen this shows their true nature.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.450
This isn't funny! I have to run away!
I'll get points as I run...

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.620
Shoot, shoot, shoot, I'm
still at zero points!

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.700
Less than two minutes left!

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.410
Two minutes?!

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.000
It'll be wasted. Everything
All Might gave me...

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.820
...will be wasted!

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.150
Ow!

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.540
It'd be bad luck if you fell, right?

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.580
There is absolutely no merit
in taking on that faux villain.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.980
But that creates the opportunity...

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.290
...for it to shine brightly...

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.420
...and rise to the surface.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.140
Squeeze your buttocks...

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.890
...and yell this inside your heart--

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.530
Smash...!

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.840
That's right. It rises to the surface--

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.760
The most important qualification of a hero--

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.760
The spirit of self-sacrifice!

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:29.160
The conditions are the same
as when I tried to save Kacchan.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.310
But it's different. This time--

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.990
One minute left!

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.050
Wait, this is All Might's power.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.130
I'm able to jump this high now.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:56.090
Landing should be a
piece of cake-cake-cake-cake...

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.920
"Break"?!

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.180
You have become a proper vessel,
but it was one that was made in a hurry.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.810
Prepare yourself for the physical
repercussions it'll have on your body.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.770
Oh yeah! I'm such an idiot!

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.650
A mere ten months was
just barely enough time.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.160
I can just barely hold this borrowed power.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.780
I was being conceited for a second!

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:31.270
I've only been given the
right to stand at the start line!

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.260
Think! What to do? What to do?

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.930
Detroit Smash!

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.440
If I aim that move at the ground...!

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.500
Both my legs and my right arm are broken.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.810
I only have my left arm!

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:49.770
And the timing--

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.100
If I'm too early or too late, I'll die!

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.730
Even if I succeed, I
still won't have any points!

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.360
If I break my left arm,
there's no way I'll pass!

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:18.960
Release...

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.880
I'm safe...

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.430
No, she saved me...

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.290
Is she all right?
She looks uninjured, at least...?

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.930
I'm so glad...

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.680
And...

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.970
...thank you!

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.540
If I can just get one point...

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.290
Time's up!

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.920
What was that guy?

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.510
He suddenly jumped at the obstacle.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.530
He seemed to have a reinforcement-type
Quirk, but that was unusual...

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.400
But if he had such an amazing Quirk,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.210
what kind of life did he
live that made him so jumpy?

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.300
Maybe he was acting to trick others?

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.050
But it doesn't look like
he gained anything from doing so.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.220
Anyway, there's no mistaking
that he's an amazing guy.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.620
They're missing the point.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.200
Didn't they see?

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.680
He jumped out to save that girl.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.080
He was aware of the
remaining time, his own safety,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.110
and the points he needed to pass...

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.570
And even so, he did not hesitate at all!

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.740
If we had not been in an exam...

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.560
...of course, I would have done the same!

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.050
Wait. "Exam"...? "Of course"...?

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.890
Wait a minute.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.060
Okay, good work.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.310
Good work, good work.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.740
Here you go. Here are some gummies.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.060
Eat some gummies.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.770
Thanks.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.110
Yes, yes, you, too.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.350
Thanks...

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.100
That mademoiselle is the backbone of U.A.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.200
Oh dear, you were hurt
this much by your own Quirk?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.830
It's as if his body is
not used to his Quirk yet.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.550
Kiss...!

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.640
"Old lady!"

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.620
Wh-What was that?

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.680
U.A. High's licensed school nurse...

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.230
...the Youthful Heroine, Recovery Girl!

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.650
Her Quirk is the
super-activation of healing ability.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:32.420
U.A. can only go through with such
a reckless entrance exam because of her.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.540
Let's finish this quickly.
Is anyone else injured?

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.790
I see! If this exam is set up like that...

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.160
Then he's...

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.930
"One week later"

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.690
Izuku...?

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.380
Izuku? Izuku?

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.870
Hey, are you all right?

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.880
Why are you smiling at the fish?

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.020
Oh, sorry! I'm fine!

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:24.010
From self-scoring, I know that
I just barely passed the written exam.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.990
But that was cancelled out by
the big fat zero in the practical exam.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.610
And ever since the entrance exam,
I hadn't been able to contact All Might.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.600
"Neighborhood Circular"

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.230
The results should arrive
today or tomorrow, right?

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.440
Yeah...

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.160
Jeez, I think it's amazing
that you even applied to U.A.!

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.580
Yeah...

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.490
"Neighborhood Circular"

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.050
I didn't even tell my mother about
what had happened with All Might.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.970
I kept that secret so he could
continue being the Symbol of Peace.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.480
There was no way I could
tell anyone, not even my family.

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:19.460
All Might! After you saw potential
in me, I'm sorry I didn't live up to it!

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.850
But I did what I thought was right.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.690
All Might, you...

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.990
Izu-Izu-Izu...! Izu-Izu-Izu... Izuku!

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.610
It's here! It came!

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.570
"U.A. High School"

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.200
It's here!

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.520
I am here as a projection!

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.160
All Might?!

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.840
Wait, this is from U.A., right...?

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.020
What?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.510
I had to do some paperwork that took
some time, so I couldn't contact you.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.700
I'm sorry.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:26.120
Actually, I came to this town to work at U.A.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.370
All Might is working at U.A.?

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.010
Hm? What is it?

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.290
Wrap it up?

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.510
But there is something
I must talk to him about...

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.910
It's going to push everything else back?

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.460
All right. Okay.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.480
Even if you passed the written exam,
you got zero points on the practical exam.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.310
Of course, that means you didn't pass...

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.290
I knew that.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.990
I knew that...

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.490
I knew that, but...

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.160
...it's so frustrating...

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.890
...if that was all there was to it.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.460
I am an entertainer, as well!

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.510
First, take a look at this video!

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.010
Excuse me, um...

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.640
The nice person?

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.220
She came to negotiate directly
in person after the exam!

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.290
Negotiate what?

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.100
Keep watching to find out!

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:39.140
Um, the person with curly
hair and freckles...

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.710
Do you know who I'm talking about?

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.070
Um... kind of plain-looking...

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.720
It's me!

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.370
Is it possible for me
to give him some of my points?

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.400
I heard him say, "If I
can just get one point,"

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.130
so I thought maybe
he was still at zero points...

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.300
What the hell can you do?

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.140
At least the points he lost because of me...

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.350
There was absolutely no reason
for you to put yourself in danger!

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.520
He saved me!

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.820
Please! Please! Please!

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.450
In addition to now having a Quirk,

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.740
your actions spurred others to act.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:33.370
The entrance exam the other day
was not graded only on villain points!

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.710
Even if you ask to,
you cannot give him your points.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.600
Anyway, there's no reason
to give him any, female listener!

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:50.630
How can a hero course reject people
who save others and do the right thing?

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.730
Call that lip service?

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.880
Bring it on!

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.400
This is a job that requires risking one's life
to put that lip service into practice!

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.320
Rescue points!

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.320
And they're given by a panel of judges.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.700
It's the other basic ability
we at U.A. look at!

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.460
Izuku Midoriya, sixty points!

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.840
And Ochaco Uraraka, forty-five points!

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.590
You both pass.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.780
This is too crazy...

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.480
Come, Young Midoriya.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.480
This is your hero academia!

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.470
Yes, sir!

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.080
After receiving a lot of help,

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.810
my life changed and will continue to change.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.360
And now, my dream
high school life is about to begin!

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.280
Izuku...!

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.040
"Food Menu"

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.040
"Next time"

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.420
Welcome, Young Midoriya!

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.670
This is U.A. High, your hero academia!

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.380
All Might, I'll do my best on the
Quirk assessment test on the first day!

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.770
Your homeroom teacher, Aizawa, shows
no mercy and expels people if they do badly,

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:16.780
so be careful!

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.180
What?!

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.260
Next time, "What I Can Do for Now"!

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.770
Oh no, Young Midoriya's index finger is...!

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.700
Go beyond!

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.590
"Next time: What I Can Do for Now"

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.340
Plus Ultra!
