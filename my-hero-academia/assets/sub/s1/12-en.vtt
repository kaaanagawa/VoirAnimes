WEBVTT

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.560
H-He got me...

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.690
Teacher!

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.570
I'm sure I erased his Quirk.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.960
That means he is just that strong.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.200
He's as strong as All Might...

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.790
Let go of her!

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.730
Smash...!

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.590
Ribbit!

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.470
We were all, even the teachers,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.730
covered by the darkness of evil and fear...

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.590
The deeper the darkness...

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.780
...the more dazzling the light shines.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.900
All Might!

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.510
I had a bad feeling,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.680
so I tore myself away from
my chat with the principal and came.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.740
I passed Young Iida on my way

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.610
and got a rough idea of what had happened.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.610
Good grief, it really makes me angry.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.590
Thinking about how frightening
it must have been for the children...

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.910
And how hard my juniors fought...

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.450
But that is why

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.170
I must proudly say--

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.550
It's fine now!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.620
I am here!

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.260
All Might!

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.820
Ribbit...

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.740
All... Might...

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.420
He's not smiling...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.980
I've been waiting, hero.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.440
You trash of society.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.950
"Episode 12: All Might"

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.660
That's All Might...?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.420
It's my first time seeing him in person!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.810
He looks so intimidating...

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.690
Idiots, don't hesitate!

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.140
If we kill that, we'll--

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.900
Sorry, Aizawa.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.580
Huh?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.570
Huh?!

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.370
What?

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.180
Everyone, go to the entrance.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.750
I'm leaving Aizawa to you.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.330
He's unconscious. Hurry!

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.500
Y-Yes, sir!

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.330
Ribbit.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.940
All Might...

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.010
It's no good... It's no good...

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.560
It's no good...

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.690
I-I'm sorry, Father...

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.600
He hit me as he was saving them.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.120
It's the violence of a government official.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.820
He's fast, as expected.
I can't follow him with my eyes.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.260
But not as fast as I thought he'd be.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.160
I guess it's true, after all...

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.640
...that he's getting weaker.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.000
All Might, you can't.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.700
That brain villain took One Fo--

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.840
He took a punch that didn't break
my arm, but he didn't even twitch.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.370
He's gotta be--

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.580
Young Midoriya!

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.220
It's fine!

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.070
Carolina...

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.020
Nomu.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.870
...Smash!

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.700
It seriously has no effect at all, huh?!

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.630
In that case--

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.890
It doesn't work on his face, either, huh?

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.810
It doesn't work because of shock absorption.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.090
In order to cause damage to Nomu,

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.580
it would be most effective
to slowly gouge out his flesh.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.740
Whether he'd let you do that
or not is a different issue, though.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.520
Thanks for telling me all that!

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.170
If that's true, then it's easier for me.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.000
Hey, hey.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.410
All right! Take that!

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.510
W-Wow...

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.260
Those guys are underestimating
All Might too much!

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.060
How did he make a
suplex look like an explosion?!

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.680
All Might's on a whole nother level!

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.040
Even though he's a rookie teacher
who can't teach without looking at his notes.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.440
It's possible they have a way to kill him...

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.450
Even so, there's nothing we can do right now.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.500
Instead, if anyone gets held hostage,
we'd be worse than in the way.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.880
Rather than wondering about the villains,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.790
we have to trust All Might!

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.040
Get 'em! Aim for the balls!

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.000
Were we overthinking it?

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.920
He's amazing.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.260
But...

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.510
But I know...

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.990
Every day on my way to school, I
read the hero news in real time.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.390
"Good morning, All Might!"
"He Quickly Resolved Three Cases This Morning"

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.150
When they were talking about
how All Might wasn't at USJ,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.320
the three fingers Thirteen
put up secretly were probably...

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.930
...because All Might was at his limit.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.650
It must've been because
he'd used too much of his power!

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.860
I'm the only one who knows...

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.040
It's an injury I got from
an enemy's attack five years ago.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.380
Half of my respiratory organs were destroyed,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.330
and I lost my whole stomach.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.630
I've become emaciated from
repeated surgeries and the aftereffects.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.790
Right now, I can only work as a hero

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.850
for about three hours a day.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.440
I will save people with a smile!

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.270
The Symbol of Peace cannot
be daunted by evil.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.300
I smile to show the pressure of heroes

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.500
and to trick the fear inside of me.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.140
I'm the only one who knows--

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.560
All Might's secret

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.590
and the predicament he's in.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.880
Is...

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.630
Is that how it is?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.420
Were you trying to keep him from moving
by sticking him deep in the concrete?

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.980
You won't be able to stop him like that.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.260
Because Nomu is as strong as you are.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.070
This is good, Kurogiri.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.320
It's an unexpected opportunity.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.560
Ouch! That's my weak spot!

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.670
Stop it!

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.220
What power!

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.620
This is your first offense?

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.140
You'd better prepare yourselves...

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.310
Kurogiri.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.380
I do not want blood and
guts overflowing within me,

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.570
but I would be happy to take
in someone as great as you.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.950
You are too fast to see with the human eye.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.030
Restraining you was Nomu's job.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:06.380
And then, when your body
is halfway in, to close the gate...

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.710
...and tear you apart is my job.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.010
Asui.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.710
What is it, Midoriya?

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.960
Trade places with me carrying Mr. Aizawa.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.880
Ribbit?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.100
Okay... But why?

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.060
No...

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.060
No, All Might!

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.310
Midoriya!

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.320
There are still tons of things

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.030
I want you to teach me!

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.740
All Might!

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.830
Young Midoriya?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.280
What are you...

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.790
How foolish.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.930
Move! You're in the way, Deku!

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.100
Take that!

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.020
He's frozen?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.020
Young Todoroki?!

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.030
All I heard was that you all
are here to kill All Might.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.160
He controlled it so that the ice stopped

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.810
just before it reached me.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.080
Thanks to that, his grip loosened!

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.540
All Might!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.920
Huh?

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.150
Damn it! I didn't get to show off!

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.130
Stop acting so stuck-up, foggy nobody!

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.050
The Symbol of Peace cannot
be killed by the likes of you.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.350
Kacchan! Everyone!

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.820
Todoroki... Bakugo...

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.460
And Kirishima.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.600
Leave this to them. Let's hurry!

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.540
Right.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.280
Everyone...

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.860
Wait, isn't that Tsu?

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.550
Hey! Hey!

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.890
Ochaco?

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.820
Hey, help us out!

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.070
He's heavy!

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.370
Mr. Aizawa?!

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.230
Let's go!

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.690
L-Leave this to All Might...

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.750
When the other teachers
get here, get to a safe place...

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.300
O-Okay!

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.720
Kurogiri, our exit and entrance,
has been overcome.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.290
We're in a pinch.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.080
You careless bastard.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.770
You're just what I thought you'd be.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.510
Only certain parts of you
can turn into a misty warp gate.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.160
The fog gate covered your actual body, right?

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.280
Back then...

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.800
Oh dear, that was close.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.920
If you were completely made of mist
and physical attacks couldn't touch you,

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.420
then you wouldn't have said "that was close."

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:46.970
Don't move!

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.420
If I feel like you're moving suspiciously,

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.390
then I'll blow you up.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.930
His behavior isn't very hero-like...

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:01.610
In addition to capturing them,
they're almost all uninjured.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.040
Kids these days are amazing.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.650
They make the League of Villains look bad.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.530
Nomu.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.630
Even though his body's broken...
He's still moving?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.090
Get back, everyone!

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.400
What?

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.770
His Quirk wasn't shock absorption?

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.200
I didn't say that was all he had.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.020
This is his super-regeneration.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.280
Nomu has been modified to take you at 100%.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.410
He's a super-efficient human sandbag.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.870
First, we need to get our gate back.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.540
Go, Nomu.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.900
He's fast!

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.070
Ow...

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.570
K-Kacchan!

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.950
Kacchan?!

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.090
You dodged? That's amazing!

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.200
No, shut up, scum!

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.620
I didn't... see anything...

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.570
Then how...?

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.210
Then that was...

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.710
All Might!

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.180
He protected the child, huh?

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.510
Do you not know how to hold back?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.890
It was to rescue my companions.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.700
I had no choice.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.100
I mean, earlier, that...

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.380
...that plain-looking one.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.530
He was about to punch me
with everything he had, you know.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.880
Violence for the sake
of others makes it admirable.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.170
Isn't that right, hero?

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:23.730
You know what, All Might? I'm angry.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.300
I'm angry at this world that categorizes

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.170
the same violent acts
as heroic or villainous,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.170
deciding what's good and what's bad.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.310
"Symbol of Peace"? Ha.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.180
You're just a device to repress violence.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.910
Violence only breeds violence.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.190
The world will know this once we kill you!

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.710
That's preposterous.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.310
The eyes of white-collar
criminals like you burn silently.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.320
You just want to enjoy this
yourself, don't you, you liar?

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.450
He's already figured me out?

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.580
It's three against five.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.790
Kacchan already exposed the fog's weakness!

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.910
These guys are crazy,
but if we backup All Might,

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.550
we can push them back!

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.380
No!

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.760
Run away.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.610
You would've been in trouble
if I hadn't done anything earlier, right?

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.460
That was a different story,
Young Todoroki. Thanks.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.970
But it's fine!

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.110
Just watch as a pro gives
it everything he's got.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.420
All Might, you're bleeding...

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.290
Besides, time's--

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.670
All Might...

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.340
Nomu, Kurogiri. Get him.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.210
I'll deal with the children.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.240
It's true that I barely have a minute left.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.220
My power has been
declining faster than I expected.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.390
Now, let's clear this and go home.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.400
But I must do this.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.070
Hey, we've gotta do this after all!

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.070
Why? Because I am...

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.580
...the Symbol of Peace!

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:41.090
Damn. Hey, you talked about his shock
absorption yourself earlier, didn't you?

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.760
Yes, I did!

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.320
A head-on fistfight?

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.440
W-Wow...!

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.610
I-I can't get near them!

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.330
If your Quirk isn't shock
nullification but shock absorption,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.940
then there's a limit to it, right?

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.210
Made to fight me?

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.760
If you can withstand me at 100%,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.430
then I'll force you to
surrender from beyond that!

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.860
He's bleeding while giving it his all...!

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.380
He's not swinging randomly.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.660
Every single hit...

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.330
...is more than 100% of his power!

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.820
A hero...

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.390
...can always break out of a tough spot!

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:30.910
Hey villain, have you ever heard these words?

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.600
Go beyond!

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.540
Plus...

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.210
Ultra...!

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.870
Wh-What's this vibration?

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.480
An explosion?

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.630
That was a villain up
there just now, wasn't it?

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.600
Y-Yeah...

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.000
This power is...

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.060
It's All Might!

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.250
There's no one else who
can do something so amazing!

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.410
Ribbit, ribbit.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.010
Yay!

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.960
Is this a comic book or something?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.010
It's like he nullified the shock absorption.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.320
His brute strength is crazy.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.350
What insane power...

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.890
Does this mean he rushed at
him so fast he couldn't regenerate?

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.900
So this is the top...

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.190
Is this... the world of pros...?

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.670
All Might...

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.120
I really have gotten weaker...

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.570
In my prime, five hits would've been enough.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.920
But it took more than 300 hits.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.430
And now... I'm out of time...

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.060
Now, villains...

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.610
I'm sure we'd all like
to end this as soon as possible.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.860
He used a cheat?!

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.960
"Next time"

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.570
The members of this class
will become strong heroes!

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.500
Next time, "In Each of Our Hearts"!

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.630
Now, yell out toward that sunset!

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.530
Go beyond!

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.970
"Next time: In Each of Our Hearts"

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.230
Plus Ultra!
