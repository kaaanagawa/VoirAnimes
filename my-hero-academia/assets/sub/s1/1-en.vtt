00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.360
That's mean, Kacchan.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.540
Can't you see he's crying?

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.780
If you keep going, I-I-I'll
never forgive you!

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.490
Even though you're Quirkless...

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.960
...you're pretending to be a hero, Deku?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.220
All men are not created equal.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.330
This was the reality I learned
about society at the young age of four.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.740
And that was my first and last setback.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.760
"Izuku Midoriya"

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.970
"Tatooin Station"

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.970
That's a huge villain!

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.280
It all began in China, in Qingqing City.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.410
There was news that a
baby that gave off light was born.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.660
"Papa"

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.540
Ever since then, superpowers
were discovered in various places,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.290
and time passed without
the cause being identified.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.960
Before we knew it,
the supernatural became normal,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.500
and dreams became reality.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.750
The world has become a superhuman society,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.180
and about 80% of the world's population
now has some kind of special trait.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.790
In this world swirling with chaos,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.740
the profession that everyone once dreamed
about and admired came into the limelight.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.530
That profession is...

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.830
Oh, it's Death Arms!

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.310
He carries out justice through
his great physical strength--

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.080
The Punching Hero!

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.630
Everyone, this is dangerous.
Stay back, stay back!

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.810
The rescue specialist,
Backdraft, is here, too!

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.190
But man, turning into
a monster's an amazing Quirk.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.620
What did he do?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.080
He stole someone's bag and
went out of control when he was cornered.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.570
A Quirk like that, and he's a bag snatcher?

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.000
I'm sorry, the train's...

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.120
Yes, I don't know what time
I will make it into work...

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.760
You can do it, Kamui!

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.500
Get away!

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.050
Who's fighting?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.790
Kamui Woods!

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.850
The young and talented rising star!

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.570
You were the one asking,
but you gave a perfect commentary, kid.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.680
You're a fanboy, aren't you?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.140
Uh, well...

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.040
Illegal use of powers during rush hour
and robbery resulting in bodily injury.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.640
You are the incarnation of evil.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.830
Oh, here it comes!

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.140
Show us something flashy, Tree-Man!

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.010
Pre-emptive...

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.260
...Binding...

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.390
...Lacquered Chain Prison!

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.770
Canyon Cannon!

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.910
Huh?

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.700
Here it is, here it is,
here it is, here it is.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.350
Today is the day of my debut!

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.620
My name is Mt. Lady.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.710
A pleasure to make your ass-quaintance.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.630
Here it is, here it is,
here it is, here it is.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.300
Sh-She's getting the credit...

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.660
Along with the superpowers
came an explosive increase in crime.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.740
As the country was stuck in the
slow progress of drastic law reforms,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.020
courageous people started performing
heroic acts from out of comic books.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.650
Guarding against superpowers
and defending against evil.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.620
Heroes were soon accepted by the public,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.440
and it was established
as an official position.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.440
Based on their performance,
they are paid by the government

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.920
and gain renown among the masses.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.710
Gigantification, huh?

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.150
She looks like she'll be popular,
and it's an amazing Quirk,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.760
but thinking about the damage to
the city that'll go hand in hand with that,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.430
its use might be limited?

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.640
No, but whether or
not she can control the size...

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.240
Hey wait, you're taking notes?
You wanna be a hero?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.810
That's great! You can do it!

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.370
Yes! I'll do my best!

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.860
"Episode 1: Izuku Midoriya: Origin"

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.750
"Aldera Junior High"

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.990
Since you're all third years, it's time
for you to think seriously about your future.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.080
I'll pass out handouts
for your future plans now, but...

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.080
...you're all...

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.120
...pretty much planning to
go into the hero course, right?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.880
Yes!

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.630
Yes, yes, you all have wonderful Quirks!

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.220
But using your powers
at school is against the rules!

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.600
Teach!

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.660
Don't lump us all in the same group.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.000
I'm not gonna be stuck at the
bottom with the rest of these rejects!

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.150
"Katsuki Bakugo"

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.800
That was uncalled for, Katsuki!

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.080
Yeah, yeah!

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.740
You all should shut up
like the extras you are!

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.410
Oh, if I remember correctly,
you want to go to U.A. High, right, Bakugo?

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.400
U.A.? That national school?!

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.510
It was in the top 0.2% this year, you know!

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.250
Their acceptance rate's
always really low, too!

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.920
That's exactly why you guys are just extras!

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.550
I aced the mock test!

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.300
I'm the only one at this school
who could possibly get into U.A.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.060
I'll definitely surpass All Might
and become the top hero!

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.440
My name'll be inscribed
on the list of top earners!

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.100
Oh yeah, Midoriya wanted
to go to U.A., too, right?

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.980
Huh? Midoriya? No way!

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.840
You can't get into the
hero course just by studying!

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.120
Th-They got rid of that rule!

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.330
There's just no precedent...

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.210
Hey, Deku!

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.280
You're below the rejects! You're Quirkless!

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.380
How can you even stand
in the same ring as me?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.910
No, wait, Kacchan!

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.950
It's not like I'm trying to
compete with you or anything!

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.140
Believe me!

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.840
It's just that it's been
my goal ever since I was little.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.690
And well...

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.640
...I won't know unless I try...

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.670
Whaddaya mean, unless you try?!

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.330
Are you taking the test for fun?!

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.440
What the hell can you do?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.500
You're Quirkless!

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.040
"The same city"

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.210
Thief!

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.330
Someone!

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.380
Catch me if you can!

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.590
Huh? There's no hero around.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.470
Normally someone would come right away.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.180
This guy's taking advantage
of the chaos from this morning.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.240
There are tons of people around who
don't know what to do with their Quirks.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.040
There's no end to them.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.100
There is an end.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.110
Why?

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.510
Because I am here!

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.710
Hey, let's go to karaoke!

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.020
Sure, nothing better to do.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.760
The incident this morning
is all over the headlines!

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.780
I wanna hurry up and go home
so I can write it down in my notebook.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.390
We're not done talking yet, Deku.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.580
Katsuki, what's that?

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.620
"Hero Analysis for the Future"

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.610
Huh? "Hero Analysis for the Future"?

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.230
Seriously?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.110
Midoriya...

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.280
I-It's fine, isn't it? Give it back!

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.620
That's mean...

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.830
What?!

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.090
Most top first-string heroes have
stories about them from their school days.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.840
I want the shine of being able to be
called the only student to make it into U.A.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.880
from this mediocre city junior high school.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.330
I mean, I'm a perfectionist.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.520
He's so petty.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.980
So anyway,

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.830
don't apply to U.A., nerd.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.890
Come on, you could at
least say something back.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:28.370
Don't say that. He's pathetic.
He still can't face reality.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.210
If you wanna be a hero that badly,
there's a quick way to do it.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.310
Believe that you'll be born
with a Quirk in your next life

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.590
and take a last chance dive off the roof!

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.930
What?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.540
Idiot! If I really jumped, that would
mean you instigated a suicide!

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.220
Think before you speak!

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.870
That's not fish food, stupid.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.370
That's my notebook...

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.660
Stupid...

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.670
"Hero Analysis for the Future"

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.000
Stupid bastard...

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.920
Mom!

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.750
Mom, the computer!

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.260
Again?

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.930
Hurry!

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.480
Jeez, you've probably added
ten thousand views just by yourself, Izuku.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.560
It's too scary for me. I can't watch it.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.270
That was an old video.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.880
A disaster that happened a long time ago.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.460
The video of a hero
that debuted right after that.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.280
Can you see that?
He's already saved a hundred people!

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.500
That's crazy! It hasn't
even been ten minutes!

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.460
That's crazy!

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.540
He's laughing!

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.560
It's fine now. Why?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.780
Because I am here.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.990
He's so cool!

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.250
Once I get my Quirk, I
wanna be like him, too!

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.630
You should probably give it up.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.150
That's... Is something
wrong with him after all?

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.770
Most of the other kindergarteners'
Quirks have already manifested...

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.140
He's the only one...

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.470
Excuse me, but you're
fourth generation, right, ma'am?

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.860
May I ask about your Quirk?

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.800
Yes, of course.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.040
I can pull small objects to me.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.110
My husband can breathe fire.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.580
Normally, by age four, he would
have manifested one of those Quirks,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.370
or some combination of the two.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.360
In the past, when the superpowers
first started showing up,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.160
the results of an early
research study were published.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.380
It became common practice to see if
the pinky toe was missing a joint or not.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.400
When parts of the body aren't used,
they're deemed unnecessary.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.140
People who didn't have the joint
were thought to be a newly evolved form.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.480
You can see by looking at this x-ray

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.600
that Izuku has two joints.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.050
It's unusual to see that these days,

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.830
but that means he has no Quirk.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.490
Can you see that?

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.680
He's already saved a hundred people!

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.740
That's crazy! It hasn't
even been ten minutes!

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.000
That's crazy!

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.700
He's laughing!

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.700
It's fine now. Why?

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.190
Because I am here.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.660
Mom...

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.430
He saves everyone with a smile,
no matter what trouble they're in...

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.500
He's such a cool hero...

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.370
Can I... be a hero, too?

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.780
I'm sorry, Izuku!

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.460
No, that's not it. That's not it, Mom.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.040
What I wanted you to say back then was...

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.060
"Watch Your Head"

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.180
You decided back then, didn't you?

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.680
That's right. Don't worry
about what other people think!

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.660
Hold your head up high and plunge forward!

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.860
A villain?!

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.840
A medium-sized invisibility cloak...

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.100
Don't worry. I'm just going
to take over your body.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.370
Calm down.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.360
It'll only hurt for about 45 seconds.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.570
You'll feel better soon.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.450
I can't... breathe...

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.450
You can't grab me. I'm fluid!

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.620
Thanks for your help. You're my hero.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.040
I didn't think that had come to this city.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.550
My body...

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.540
There's no strength...

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.380
I'm dying... Am I dying?

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.460
I'm dying...

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.270
Somebody... Somebody...!

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.520
No...!

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.380
It's all right now, young man.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.540
I am here!

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.820
Texas Smash!

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.440
Wind pressure...?!

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.350
All... Migh...

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.750
Hey!

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.730
Hey! He--

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.430
Oh, good!

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.100
I'm glad you're okay!

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:52.120
Sorry 'bout getting you
caught up in my villain fighting.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.000
I don't usually make mistakes like this,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.980
but I was in high spirits
on my day off in a new place.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.330
But, you were a big help. Thanks!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.620
I captured him safely!

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.200
The number one hero... All Might...

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.570
H-He's the real thing...

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:21.050
He looks completely different in person!

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.640
Oh, right! An a-autograph! Where should I--?

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.020
In that notebook--

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.730
He already did!

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.680
Th-Thank you very much!

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.600
It'll be an heirloom! A family treasure!

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.650
Okay!

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.400
Well, I need take this guy to the police.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.060
See you again on the
other side of the screen!

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.480
Wait, already?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.040
Pros are constantly
fighting enemies and time.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.300
Wait...

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.660
There are still... things I want to ask...

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.670
Well then,

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.830
I'm counting on your continued support!

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.560
Wait.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.560
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.460
Let go of me! Your fanaticism is too much!

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.190
If I... let go now... I'll... I'll die...!

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.980
That's true.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:26.380
I... have... a lot of things...
I want to ask you directly!

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.080
Okay, okay! I get it,
so close your eyes and mouth!

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.630
Shit.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.360
Th-That was scary...

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.000
Good grief. If you talk to the people
downstairs, I'm sure they'll let you down.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.300
I seriously am outta time,
so I really must go.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.700
Wait! Um...

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.830
No! I will not wait!

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.580
But--

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.580
You should probably give it up.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.600
I'm sorry, Izuku!

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.730
What the hell can you do?

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.730
You're Quirkless!

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.500
That might be true...

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.920
But even so, I...

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.790
Even if I don't have a Quirk,
can I become a hero?

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.000
Can even someone without a Quirk be like you?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.240
My meeting with All Might... This miracle...

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.780
At the time, I couldn't even imagine

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.790
how much it would change my fate.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.040
"Next time"

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.880
I am here for the next episode preview!

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.040
What? The villain I caught escaped?

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.340
It took a boy hostage
and is going wild around town?

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.430
But I can't use my powers for much longer.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.300
You're pathetic, All Might!

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.730
Is there another hero around?

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.310
Next time, "What It Takes to Be a Hero"!

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.060
Pros are always risking their lives!

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.560
Go beyond!

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.580
"Next time: What It Takes to Be a Hero"

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.610
Plus Ultra!
