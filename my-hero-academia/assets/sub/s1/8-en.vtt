00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.020
You're so lucky, Kacchan.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.360
Your Quirk's so cool!

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.400
I hope I get mine soon, too.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.250
No matter what Quirk you get,
you'll never beat me.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.900
He's just a pebble!

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.830
Until a little while ago,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.830
he was just a pebble on the side of the road.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.130
You've got a flashy Quirk there, don't you?!

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.090
Hey! You tricked me, didn't you?!

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.940
Was it fun tricking me all this time?!

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.400
Try and get me with it!

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.600
'Cause I'm better than you!

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.880
What the--?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.490
Improvised special move...

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.970
...Comet Home Run!

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.860
You call that a home run?!

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.880
Retrieved!

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.900
From the start, you were...

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.840
I wasn't... going to use it...

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.880
Because I can't use it...

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.680
Because my body can't handle the impact...

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.320
Mr. Aizawa said so, too...

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.150
But...

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.870
...this was all...

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.780
...I could think of...

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.240
S-Someone told me...

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.430
You can become a hero...

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.170
That's why...

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.140
I'm going...!

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.560
Indoor person-to-person combat training...

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.800
--Uraraka?!

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.950
--Hero team...

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.880
...wins!

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.900
What the heck?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.690
The losers are practically uninjured,

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.800
and the winners are on the ground...

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.590
They lost the battle, but won the war, huh?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.040
This is training, though.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.190
To the nurse's office.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.530
I know.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.060
My right...

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.900
Deku predicted it...

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.940
On top of that... he found
a way to win the exercise...

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.640
You're an amazing person,
so that's why I want to beat you!

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.830
I want to win and surpass you, you idiot!

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.880
Does that mean...

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.080
...even if we fought all-out...

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.170
...Deku would completely beat...?

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.340
Come back, Young Bakugo.
It's time to review the results.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.040
Whether you win or lose,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.430
looking back and learning from
your experiences is a part of life.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.440
"Episode 8: Bakugo's Start Line"

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.190
"Person-To-Person Combat Training"
"Battle 1 Review"

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.440
Well, even if I say that,
the MVP for this battle was Young Iida!

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.650
It's not either of the winners,
Ochaco or Midoriya?

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.540
Hmm, well... Why is that?

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.450
Does anyone know?

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.950
Yes, Mr. All Might.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.580
That is because Iida adapted
the most to the context of the training.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.280
From watching the match,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.050
it appears Bakugo acted on his own
because of an obviously personal grudge.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.960
And as Mr. All Might said earlier,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.430
it is foolish to launch
a large-scale attack indoors.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.450
In the same way, taking into
consideration the damage he received,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.690
Midoriya's plan was also rash.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.150
As for Uraraka...

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.320
She let her guard down mid-battle,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.970
and her final attack was too reckless.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.140
If she treated the
papier-mâché as a real weapon,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.660
she would not have been able
to do something so dangerous.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.620
Iida had prepared for his opponent's arrival

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.830
and assumed it would be
a fight over the weapon,

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.300
which made him late in
responding to the final attack.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.000
The hero team only won

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.460
because they took advantage
of the fact that this was training.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.640
They were practically breaking the rules.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.160
Sh-She said more than I expected.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.600
W-Well, Young Iida also has parts
of him that could be more relaxed,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.310
but well, that was correct!

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:36.870
"Start with the basics
to develop depth of learning"
"Devote oneself wholeheartedly"

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.720
We should always start with the
basics to develop depth of learning.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.840
We must strive to devote
ourselves wholeheartedly.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.260
Otherwise, we cannot become top heroes.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.040
"Momo Yaoyorozu"

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.040
Momo Yaoyorozu.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.040
One of four students admitted to
the hero course based on recommendations.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.300
All right everyone, let's change
locations and start the second match.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.160
Tackle this training after thinking
about what we just talked about.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.100
Yes, sir!

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.220
"Battle Building B"

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.220
Match two!

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.870
Team B are the heroes,
and Team I are the villains!

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.940
Ojiro.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.340
I'm going to get serious.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.190
I'll take off my gloves and boots, too!

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.760
O-Okay...

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.740
Hagakure, that's the correct
decision as an invisible person,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.660
but that's not great
for a girl, morally speaking.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.800
You can't look, okay?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.080
I can't see you even if I tried.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.590
Now, let's start the second indoor
person-to-person combat training match!

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.430
"Mezo Shoji"
"Quirk: Dupli-Arms"

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.430
Mezo Shoji. Quirk: Dupli-Arms.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.640
He can create replicas of his own
body parts on the tips of his tentacles.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.130
One in the hall on the
north side of the fourth floor.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.690
The other is somewhere on the same floor...

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.180
They're barefoot...

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.040
The invisible one is coming
to ambush and capture us, huh?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.750
Go outside. It's dangerous.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.670
I'm sure our opponents intend
to fight a defensive battle...

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.000
...but that does not matter to me.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.010
Owww... My feet!

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.840
Th-This Quirk is...

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.240
You can move if you want,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.120
but the skin on your feet will come off,
so you won't be able to fight your best.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.680
He did not cause any damage to
his teammate or the nuclear weapon,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.590
and on top of that, he weakened the enemy.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.090
He's so strong!

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.940
Hero team wins!

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.730
Heat?

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.700
It's-It's-It's hot!

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.620
Sorry.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.290
The difference in our ability was too great.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:26.670
"Shoto Todoroki"
"Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot"

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.200
Shoto Todoroki.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.670
He's another one of the four admitted to
the hero course based on recommendations.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.370
His Quirk is Half-Cold, Half-Hot.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.290
He freezes with his right
and burns with his left!

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.240
The range and temperature
of his ability is unknown?!

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.660
What is he, a monster?!

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.150
W-Wow!

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.840
What's up with that Quirk?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.600
As expected of someone who
got in through recommendations.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.350
All right, everyone gather round
for a review of the second match.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.430
Next, we will begin the third match!

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.370
Yes, sir!

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.870
"Battle Building C"

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.370
"Team J"

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.630
"Team H"

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.630
Ribbit, ribbit.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.190
"Team C"

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.190
No, no, no, no!

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.650
"Team G"

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.040
"Team F"

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.090
Yahoo!

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.800
Sorry, sorry!

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.190
Good work everyone!

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.000
We didn't have any major injuries
other than Young Midoriya, either!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.120
You guys took this on seriously!

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.740
You all did a good job
for your first training!

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.910
To have such a proper class
after Mr. Aizawa's class...

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.750
It's kind of anticlimactic...

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.780
We're free to have proper classes, as well!

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.260
Well then, I must review
the results with Young Midoriya!

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.760
Change and return...

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.920
...to the classroom!

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.760
All Might's amazing!

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.630
Why was he in such a hurry?

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.770
So cool...

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.910
Young Bakugo is a mass of pride...

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.690
...and there's nothing more fragile
than a heart that's swelled to bursting.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.710
As his teacher, I must counsel him well.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.730
But right now...

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.710
"Staff Only"

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.580
"Open | Close"

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.290
If I teach a class...

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.000
...I barely have enough time. Shit!

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.570
"Nurse's Office"

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.010
The school year has just begun,

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.570
and he's already been in here three times!

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.400
Why didn't you stop him, All Might?

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.740
I apologize, Recovery Girl.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.040
What are you apologizing to me for?

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.450
On top of his total exhaustion,
he was here just yesterday.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.870
I can't treat him all at once.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.600
I did first-aid treatment already,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.340
so after the IV is finished, we can only
wait for his body to heal slowly overnight.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.170
Jeez, I know he's your favorite and
that you passed on your powers to him,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.630
but that doesn't mean you should spoil him!

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.700
There is nothing I can say to that.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.160
Because I wanted to consider his feelings,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.260
I hesitated to stop the training match.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.980
Even so...

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.770
Will you please not talk
about One For All so loudly?

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.990
Yes, yes, Mr. Natural-Born Hero.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.760
Mr. Symbol of Peace.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.650
My injury and this form
of mine are common knowledge

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.160
among the U.A. teachers
and a certain group of pros,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.420
but the secret of my Quirk, One For All,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.540
is known only to you, the
principal, a close friend,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.130
and Young Midoriya.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.680
I know it's not like you want
to rest on your laurels at the top,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.960
but is being a "natural-born hero"

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.140
or the "Symbol of Peace"
really that important?

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.770
If I no longer am, then the
superhuman society will be seized by evil.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.630
This is the responsibility
of those of us with this power.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.560
If that's the case, then it's
even more important for you to learn

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.320
what it means to guide someone.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.940
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.170
You can become a hero.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.090
Will you accept my power?

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.720
"One For All"...

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.010
Smash...!

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.810
Come, Young Midoriya.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.690
This is your hero academia!

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.500
I have a lot to learn from here on out

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.950
in order to get closer
to what I dream of becoming!

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.530
My "Deku" isn't always
going to mean "useless"!

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.870
Kacchan,

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.460
my "Deku" means "You can do it!"

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.980
It's late afternoon...?

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.280
Are you awake?

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.850
That's all for today's treatment.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.080
Come back again tomorrow, okay?

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.200
I ended up skipping my afternoon classes...

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.170
Mr. Aizawa's gonna wrap me
in those bindings again...

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.050
Oh, Midoriya's here!

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.340
Good work!

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.540
Man, I don't know what you
were saying during the match,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.320
but you were fired up!

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.770
I can't believe you fought evenly with Bakugo,
who was first in the entrance exam!

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.260
You did a good job dodging!

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.390
You guys did that in the first match,
so the rest of us had to give it our all, too.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.970
You were far from elegant, but--

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.440
You did a good job dodging!

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.070
H-Huh?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.540
I'm Eijiro Kirishima.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.120
We're all going over the
training together right now.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.700
I'm Hanta Sero.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.170
I'm Yuga Aoya--

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.740
I'm Mina Ashido!

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.580
You did a good job dodging!

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.000
I'm Tsuyu Asui.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.330
Call me Tsu.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:27.960
I'm Sato!

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.820
Um... Er...

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.460
I'm Mineta!

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.030
--Where the heck did you pop out from?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.510
--I am Yuga Aoyama.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.240
--You did terrible in the training.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.970
--I am a man who never stops shining.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.640
--You're too loud.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.560
Tokoyami!

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.820
That desk is not a chair.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.120
Get off immediately.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.620
It's not that big a deal, is it?

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.420
Wh--?!

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.320
What's with those hands, anyway?

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.770
You people...

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.290
I cannot condone actions
that disrespect the desks

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.330
the great men and women
who are our upperclassmen once used!

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.870
You're too loud.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.370
Iida never wavers, does he?

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.840
Hey, Uraraka, wanna grab
a bite to eat sometime?

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.910
What do you like?

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:07.700
Mochi--

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.360
Wait, Deku, she didn't heal your injuries?

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.150
Oh, uh, it's because of
how much stamina I have, and...

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.220
Huh?

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.710
Um, Uraraka, more importantly...

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.120
We all tried to stop him,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.380
but he went home just
now without saying anything.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.760
Hey! You tricked me, didn't you?!

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.690
Was it fun tricking me all this time?!

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.030
You've got a flashy Quirk there, don't you?!

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.660
Kacchan!

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.520
Kacchan!

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.420
What?

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.420
It's a secret I didn't even tell my mom...

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.820
But...

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.880
There's one thing
I feel like I have to tell you.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.610
My Quirk is something
I received from someone else.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.760
Huh?

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.120
I can't say who I got it from, though!

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.890
I won't say...

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.000
But it's like a story out
of comic books, except it's true.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.080
On top of that,
I still can't control it properly.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.380
It's just a borrowed power
that I haven't made my own yet.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.840
That's why...

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.650
...I tried to beat you without using it.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.710
But in the end,
I couldn't win and had to rely on it.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.310
I've still got a long way to go...

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.730
That's why...

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.450
That's why--

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.380
One day,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.920
I will make this Quirk my own

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.140
and beat you with my own power!

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.810
I just came to tell him I didn't trick him.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.520
What am I...?

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.880
What the hell is that?

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.960
"Borrowed power"?

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.880
You're talking nonsense.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.950
What are you trying to do, make me out
to be more of a fool than you already have?

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.390
Huh?

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.820
What are you trying to say?

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.730
Today, I lost to you...

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.030
That's all it was...

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.650
That's all...

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.430
As I watched the ice guy,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.070
I thought, "I can't beat him"!

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.450
It is foolish to launch
a large-scale attack indoors.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.870
Damn it! I ended up agreeing
with what that ponytail girl said!

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.340
Damn it! Damn it, damn it!

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.350
Hey, you too, Deku!

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.190
I'm just...

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.980
I'm just getting started!

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.600
You hear?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.720
Here, I will become number one!

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.310
You won't beat me again, bastard!

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.700
There he is!

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.330
Young...

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.630
...Bakugo!

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.280
Just so you know, pride is important.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.280
You definitely have the
abilities needed to become a pro.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.050
You still have a lot of--

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.910
Let go of me, All Might.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.200
I can't walk.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:52.760
I'll become a hero that surpasses
even you without you telling me!

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.360
Huh?

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.980
Uh, right.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.280
He's gotten over it.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.400
It's hard being a teacher...

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.200
What was that?

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.320
The fated battle between men.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.580
It looked like Midoriya was just
giving excuses one-sidedly, though.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.340
The fated battle between men!

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.280
Kacchan's fuse has been lit.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.210
That doesn't change what I have to do.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.750
I just have to chase after him.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.890
Young Midoriya!

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.220
What were you talking
about with Young Bakugo?

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.090
Um, we were, uh...

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.230
Hmm... I'm so curious.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.800
Why don't you tell me in detail?

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.670
U-Um, a-actually...

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.840
A few days later, we would find out...

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.460
...how terrifying the truly cunning villains
All Might warned us about were.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.600
"All Might Becomes U.A. Teacher!"
"Closes Agency Temporarily"

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.600
Did you see this?

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.870
It says he's a teacher...

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:44.940
Hey.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.540
What do you think'll happen...

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.700
if the Symbol of Peace...

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:58.470
...is killed by villains?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
"Next time"

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.120
All heroes have their starting point!

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.280
Next time, "Yeah, Just Do Your Best, Iida!"

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.590
A lot of stuff happens and Young Midoriya
gets swept away in the crowd!

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.760
Look forward to it!

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.120
Go beyond!

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:15.010
"Next time: Yeah, Just Do Your Best, Iida!"

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.730
Plus Ultra!
