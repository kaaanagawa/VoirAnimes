00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.030
Hey!

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.350
Deku has a Quirk, right?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.110
You saw that extraordinary
strength, didn't you?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.470
Did he dare trick me?!

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.540
That damn nerd!

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.020
He's a piece of work,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.920
but his goal, his confidence,
his physical strength, and his Quirk

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.400
are way more amazing than mine.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.640
But that's why right now...

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.970
...I don't want... to lose...

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.770
Now, let's start the indoor person-to-person
combat training with Team A and Team D!

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.230
Come Deku, don't dodge.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.240
I won't do so much damage that this fight
gets stopped, but I'm gonna get close!

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.810
Wow, he's like a martial arts master!

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.700
What's with this guy?

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.370
Did he read my moves?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.050
My "Deku" isn't always
going to mean "useless"!

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.600
Kacchan,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.630
my "Deku" means "You can do it!"

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840
Because Kacchan and
I lived in the same neighborhood,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.150
we've known each other since we were little.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.410
"No Trespassing"
"You can't go in there!"

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.840
Let's go kill the enemy!

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.600
Okay!

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.250
O-Okay...!

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.060
He was the type who could
do anything he tried his hand at,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.060
a rascal who led the group
of neighborhood kids.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.050
Good or bad, Kacchan was full of confidence,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.830
and I thought he was so cool.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.500
But...

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.400
...after his Quirk manifested,

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.860
it accelerated him down the wrong path.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.910
Even though you're scared...

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.580
That's what I hate about you!

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.040
All men are not created equal.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.980
This was the reality I learned
about society at the young age of four.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.390
"Episode 7: Deku vs. Kacchan"

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.830
Hey, Bakugo!

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.140
Give me your status!

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.870
What happened?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.730
Just shut up and defend.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.810
I'm really angry right now!

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.970
I'm not asking about how you feel!

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.750
Hey!

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.280
He hung up...

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.180
Going off on his own like that...

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.650
What is wrong with him?!

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.780
Jeez!

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.990
What was Bakugo saying?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.430
Can't tell with just the cameras
in a fixed position and no sound.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.420
He's talking to his partner
over the small wireless radio.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.000
You can bring that plus
the building's floor plan,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.880
and this capture tape!

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.410
Once you wrap this around your opponent,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.140
it shows that you've captured them.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.540
The time limit is 15 minutes,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.630
and the heroes don't know where
the nuclear weapon is located, right?

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.430
Yes!

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.030
The heroes are clearly
at a disadvantage here!

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.060
Heroes should be able to turn the tables
on whatever predicament they're in.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.560
Besides, didn't Mr. Aizawa tell you, too?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.650
You know--

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.610
Here we go--

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.320
Plus Ultra!

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.620
Monsieur, Bakugo is--

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.160
Uraraka, go!

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.260
Looking away? You must be sure of yourself.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.300
The capture tape--?!

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.010
"Hero Analysis for the Future"

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.550
Hero notebook number 10, page 18!

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.550
"Erasure Hero: Eraser Head"

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.070
I'm glad I got to see
Eraser Head's moves in person!

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.820
What's next?

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.520
If it's Kacchan, he'll be impatient

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.940
and swing with his right again!

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.940
I was right!

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.670
That guy's amazing!

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.120
He's not even using his Quirk

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.150
fighting against the guy who
finished first in the entrance exam!

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.290
He was always good
at reacting quickly in a crisis.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.370
He spent years writing
his notes and internalizing them.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.800
That fanboy knowledge is now paying off

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.940
as it propels him forward.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.260
He kicked first this time to
keep me from predicting his moves.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.100
He's being cautious now.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.770
Come back here, Deku!

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.820
I can't get close to him as easily anymore.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.110
I need a plan.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.120
Hey! You tricked me, didn't you?!

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.210
Was it fun tricking me all this time?!

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.260
Huh?! You've got a
flashy Quirk there, don't you?!

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.460
Try and get me with it!

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.930
'Cause I'm better than you!

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.430
He seems real angry. It's scary!

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.710
I had heard from Young Midoriya

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.310
that Young Bakugo thinks well of himself,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.440
but this is too much.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.400
He completely ignored Uraraka and shot at me.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.120
I knew it.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.890
If they were going to send an advance guard,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.560
it would've been better to
send Iida, who has more mobility,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.380
and I'm sure Kacchan knows that.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.660
That probably means
he's running wild on his own,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.260
and the two of them aren't working together.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.120
In the first place,
our chances of winning are lowest

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.100
if we have a head-to-head
battle with those two.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.810
"Current Location"
"Villain Hideout"

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.600
If Uraraka and I both went to the hideout,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.810
that's what would happen,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.340
and even if the two of us
stayed here to fight Kacchan,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.730
we're in danger of running out of time.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.200
This is fine.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.460
All that's left is for Uraraka
to find the weapon and Iida,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.590
and then I'll head over for a 2-on-1 fight.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.080
That's how we can win.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.380
That's assuming I can beat Kacchan, though.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.890
It's fine.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.720
As long as I'm careful
of his palms, I can do this.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.800
Where are you?!

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.260
You damn nerd!

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.350
And I forgot to tell you, Kacchan--

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.720
You're Quirkless!

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.890
How can you even stand
in the same ring as me?

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.240
It's not like I'm trying
to compete with you or anything!

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.230
Believe me!

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.170
I take back everything I said!

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.050
That's why...

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.200
I'm going...!

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.040
My "Deku" means "You can do it!"

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.910
He's just a pebble!

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.420
Wow, Kacchan!

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.170
This is easy!

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.380
Ow!

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.510
Izuku, you really can't do anything, can you?

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.140
"Izuku (Deku) Midoriya"

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.140
You can read the characters
for "Izuku" as "Deku," you know.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.420
Kacchan, you can read?

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.020
You can't?

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.600
And "Deku" means someone
who can't do anything!

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.080
Really?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.650
Stop that...

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.290
Why don't you know?

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.230
Kacchan, how many times did yours skip?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.290
Seven!

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.340
Wow!

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.410
That's Kacchan for ya!

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.780
What about you, Deku?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.820
Z-Zero times...

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.260
Why can't you do it?

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.560
Wow!

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.830
Lucky!

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.850
That's so cool!

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.180
Wow, that's an amazing Quirk!

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.240
It really is!

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.350
It's a flashy Quirk just
right for a hero. Right, Katsuki?

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.110
Oh, I see!

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.390
I'm amazing!

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.760
No one is as amazing as I am!

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.620
You're so lucky, Kacchan.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.220
Your Quirk's so cool!

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.450
I hope I get mine soon, too.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.330
No matter what Quirk
you get, you'll never beat me.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.340
He's just a pebble!

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.130
Hey, did you hear?

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.380
Deku doesn't have a Quirk.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.930
What? Really?

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.840
Yeah, it's called being "Quirkless."

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.160
That's so lame.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.400
Too bad for him.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.200
He's so weird!

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.720
Don't worry about it, Izuku.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.820
You're the least amazing, Deku.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:37.940
♪ Forward march, members
of the Bakugo Hero Agency! ♪

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.690
Kacchan!

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.710
Hey, are you okay?

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.540
He's fine. Kacchan's real strong!

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.160
See?

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.750
I was fine!

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.720
Hurry up and get back up here!

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.050
'Kay, no problem!

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.010
Nothing was wrong!

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.220
Are you all right? Can you stand?

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.350
It would've been bad if you hit your head.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.900
Don't look at me with that face!

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.640
You looked like you were asking for help...

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.700
Stop it...!

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.800
I'm...

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.730
I'm better than him!

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.540
Found it.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.940
Now I just have to tell Deku
and hide until he gets here.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.420
Bakugo is a natural at being bad,

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.970
but that fits this training perfectly.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.970
Then I must also devote
myself to being a villain.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.160
That's right.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.370
This is another trial to turn me into a man
who will not bring shame to the Iida family.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.310
Become a villain!

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.220
Be dyed with evil in order to become a hero!

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.280
I am...

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.110
...extremely evil!

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.110
"Bwa-ha-ha-ha"

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.360
He's taking this so seriously!

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.770
Have you arrived, Uraraka?

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:15.440
I knew that you would come here alone
the instant Bakugo ran off by himself.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.280
Your Quirk allows you to make
the objects you touch float.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.260
That is why I put away all the things
on this floor before you arrived.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.140
Now you cannot play your little tricks!

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.860
You have blundered, hero!

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.020
He's starting to look... like a villain...!

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.230
Deku!

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.940
Uraraka! How's it going?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.530
Iida found me. Sorry!

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.290
--Right now, he's slowly...

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.620
--I'm evil!

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.280
Where are you?

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.330
The middle of the fifth floor.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.470
Almost directly above!

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.060
We probably don't have
much time left, either.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.210
If we run out of time, our opponents win!

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.040
I can't...

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.500
I can't lose this fight!

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.930
They're loaded.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.660
Kacchan.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.310
Why won't you use your Quirk?

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.140
Are you saying you can
win even if you don't use it?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.230
Are you underestimating me, Deku?

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.900
I have no choice but to do it.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.150
I can do it. I can!

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.120
I'm not scared of you anymore!

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.920
With your stalking, you
probably already know,

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.600
but my Quirk, Explosion,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.760
lets me secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat
from the sweat glands on the palm of my hand

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.420
and make it explode.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.060
If they made this the way I asked,

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.440
then these gauntlets will store
the nitroglycerin inside them, and...

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.620
Don't tell me that's...

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.140
Young Bakugo, stop!

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.660
Are you trying to kill him?!

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.980
If I don't hit him, he won't die!

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.450
This is supposed to be a class!

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.200
Young man!

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.990
Young Midoriya!

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.000
Is that... even allowed...?

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.850
Wow...

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.730
The more that's stored in these
gauntlets, the stronger the blast.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.660
Come on, use your Quirk, Deku...

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.540
I'll force you to surrender
even if you're at full strength.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.620
Bakugo, answer me!

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.710
Did you do that? What
in the world did you do?

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:03.690
--This is my chance!

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.420
--Explain yourself!

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.840
If we retrieve the weapon, we'll win!

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.340
I won't let you, hero!

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.970
We need to touch the weapon itself
for it to count as being retrieved.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.730
Can she make herself float now, too?

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.560
Release!

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.230
It's a special move that's hard on my body!

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.490
Your Quirk is not a threat
if you cannot touch anything.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.160
I'll hold out until time runs out!

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.420
Deku's trying so hard, though!

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.710
Hey, hey, what's wrong, Deku?

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.940
I didn't hit you, so you
can still move, can't you?

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.630
Come and get me!

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.580
The explosion shot out.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.890
He had his costume made so that his
Quirk would work even for long distances.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.540
Uraraka, what's the situation?

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.650
Deku!

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.880
Ignoring me again?

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.650
I can't believe him!

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.900
Sir, you should stop them!

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.580
That Bakugo's really crazy!

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.270
He's gonna kill him!

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.320
No...

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.830
I won't do so much damage that this fight
gets stopped, but I'm gonna get close!

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.160
If I don't hit him, he won't die!

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.890
Strangely enough, part of him is still sane.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.230
I don't know if it's small-minded or what,

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.170
but anyway...

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.230
Young Bakugo, the next time you use that,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.640
I'll stop the fight, and your team will lose.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.960
Huh?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.500
To attack on such a large scale inside

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.200
is inviting the destruction of the
stronghold you should be protecting.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.190
That is a foolish plan
for both heroes and villains!

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.360
You will lose a lot of points for it!

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.290
As a teacher, I should stop this.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.570
However...

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.640
Go to the pillar by the windows!

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.650
--Over and out!

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.540
--Fine, then!

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.660
Let's fight it out with our fists!

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.960
It's no good. I can't dodge it!

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.880
A counterattack...

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.300
Watch the timing...

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.170
Now!

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.550
What was that just now?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.380
He doesn't look like the type to think,

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.100
but he's more subtle than I expected.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.350
What do you mean?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.730
He changed his course in
a blast that doubled as a smoke screen

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.280
and then did it again immediately.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.830
Getting in a clean hit
while fighting against inertia

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.520
requires fine lateral adjustments
to the power of the explosions.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.290
He's too talented... Too talented... Ugh...

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.120
Look, here I come!

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:51.420
It's your favorite right swing!

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:55.260
Deku!

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.300
You are...

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.260
...below me!

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.140
He's not going to give me a chance to think.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.170
I couldn't do it after all...

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.340
He's too strong...

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.110
I have no choice but to use it...

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.810
This is a lynching!

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.360
He can capture him for this exercise
by just wrapping the tape around him!

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.580
Those are not the actions of a hero.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.440
I thought Midoriya was pretty amazing, too,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.420
but in terms of combat power,

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.240
Bakugo is definitely a
ball of natural instincts.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.340
I should stop them.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840
But...

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.530
I don't want to stop them, for his sake!

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.060
He's running away?

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.720
That's not something a man should do,

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.850
but he has no choice.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.720
But something's strange...

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.680
Why...?

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.680
Why won't you use your Quirk?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.530
Are you underestimating me?!

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.790
No...

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.560
You've been like this ever
since we were kids...

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.460
Have you been underestimating me
like that since then, you bastard?!

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.510
That's not it...

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.630
You're...

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.180
You're an amazing person,
so that's why I want to beat you!

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.320
I want to win

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.520
and surpass you, you idiot!

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.530
Don't look at me like that!

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.320
You damn nerd!

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.330
These are the first passionate emotions
he's shown other than "I want to be a hero!"

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.120
I'm sure this is necessary for
you to arrive at the future

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.570
you're looking at.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.840
Detroit...

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.330
I said, this looks bad! Sir!

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.400
Both of you, sto--

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.190
Let's go, Uraraka!

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.450
Okay!

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.450
There's still no way
I can beat you one-on-one...

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.080
But--

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.790
...Smash!

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.580
What the--?

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.770
Sorry, Iida!

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.420
Improvised special move--

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.520
Comet Home Run!

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.620
You call that a home run?!

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.750
Release!

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.060
Retrieved!

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.860
No...! The weapon...!

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.730
The weapon...! The weapon...! The weapon...!

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.260
That's what...

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.060
From the start, you were...

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.410
You are underestimating me, aren't you?!

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.100
I wasn't... going to use it...

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.990
Because I can't use it...

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.410
Because my body can't handle the impact...

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.560
Mr. Aizawa said so, too...

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.870
But...

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.540
...this was all...

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.220
...I could think of...

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.190
Hero...

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.940
Hero team...

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.790
...wins!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
"Next time"

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.190
You kids still have a lot of room to grow!

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.630
This is just the beginning!

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.920
Next time, "Bakugo's Start Line"!

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.700
Young Bakugo will get all teary-eyed!

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.430
Go beyond!

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.450
"Next time: Bakugo's Start Line"

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.360
Plus Ultra!
