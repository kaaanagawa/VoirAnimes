WEBVTT

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.450
Wh-What? My body suddenly... 
All my strength is...

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.290
It can't be... My eyes are blurring, too...

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.900
Am I finally out of time?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.410
I knew this moment would come...

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.210
But now?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.000
I must go.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.750
Go? Wait... I know Bucciarati 
and his crew have a goal.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.590
Where is he trying to go?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.500
I'm sure the boss wants to find that out.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.260
Pardon me.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.120
Can I lend you a hand?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.060
It's totally up to you, though.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.770
What? You're still here?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.460
I'm fine.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.730
Go run along somewhere.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.980
But... and excuse me if 
I'm being presumptuous,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.600
but I think it might be hard for 
you to cross that road alone.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.610
I really don't mind lending you my shoulder.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.290
I mean, if you don't mind...

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.900
Well...

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.330
That might not be such a bad idea.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.780
How far would you like to go?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.680
Um... Just to the entrance of the Colosseum.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.910
The entrance of the Colosseum...

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.480
Episodio 33 His Name Is Diavolo

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.060 line:20%
There's no time. Just to the other 
side of the road... Please...

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.620
Look out!

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.040 line:20%
You stupid-ass drunk!

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.600
Are you okay?! Where were you look—

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.290
What? Why is Bucciarati so cold?

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.750
Sorry about that...

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.250
This is a guardrail?

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.080
Did I run into it?

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.800
Could it be that... 
Bucciarati can't see anything?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.260
He also ignored that car horn
when he tried to cross the road.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.620
Does that mean he can't hear, either?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.330
That wound on your throat...

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.400
Were you hurt during that scuffle earlier?

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.020
Actually, it looks like that wound 
is from this morning or last night.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.460
It's not bleeding anymore.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.620
That's a strange place to be wounded.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.860
He can somehow see it clearly. 
But it's under my collar...

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.250
He's looking right at it!

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.380
At the wound that Risotto gave me!

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.650
Oh, you picked that up for me.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.720
Thanks. I appreciate it.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.370
Well... Ready to go?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.330
Okay... Let's go.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.170
He can hear me, too.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.730
But something seems off, 
for just being hurt in a fight.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.270
What's going on?

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.950
That's Guido Mista!

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.280
Damn! I took too much time.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.730
Of course he'd show up.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.170
Is something wrong?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.670
We haven't finished crossing yet.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.780
No, um...

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.280
Sorry, the cut on my neck 
started bleeding a little...

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.180
He's heading this way!

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.330
I apologize for being selfish, 
but I'm in a hurry.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.070
I need to hurry up and cross.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.050
No!

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.550
Don't stand up!

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.450
I mean... There's another car coming.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.130
Let's cross once it passes.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.810
No, that's on the other side of the road.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.380
We can cross.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.200
Come on.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.820
Let me cross.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.910
N-No... Mista's coming!

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.870
I'm just going to have to 
eliminate him right here...

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.220
Right now!

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.340
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.020
I wonder what that sound was.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.640
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring, 
ring-a-ling-ring-a-ling-ding...

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.070
What the hell are you doing?

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.970
What did you just say?

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.940
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring, 
ring-a-ling-ring-a-ling-ding...

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.100
Why am I getting a call right now?!

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.730
He's going to figure out who I am!

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.420
You're...

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.780 line:20%
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.750
You friggin' dumbass!

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.490
Why the hell are you calling me right now?!

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.780
Do you want him to find out?!

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.440
Trish!

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.770
Don't come outside yet!

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.170
The danger's not fully gone. 
Get back in the turtle!

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.640
You don't understand. <i>He's</i> here!

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.380
I started getting that feeling again.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.340
The same thing I felt in Sardinia...

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.060
Who... are you?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.100
The person in front of me...

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.840
You're...

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.970
<c.color481d52>Rumble</c>

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.340
Trish!

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.930
I can feel him! He's nearby.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.780
The boss is nearby!

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.230
He's nearby?

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.790
You don't know exactly where, though?

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.490
He just suddenly appeared...

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.290
But I don't know where.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.870
Thank goodness. You're safe.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.860
Well done. You did excellent work.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.050
This is why you're my most trusted 
and number one subordinate.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.310
Don't worry.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.030
Bucciarati is looking at you right now, 
but he doesn't actually see you.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.790
What do you mean?

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.820
I don't know how this happened, 
but Bucciarati is already a corpse.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.420
His heartbeat has stopped, 
and he's not breathing properly.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.490
He can't see, and his eardrums 
ruptured in his battle with Secco.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.470
All he can see right now, Doppio, 
is the shape of your soul.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.790
All he can hear is the energy of your soul.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.750
He can't see objects like guardrails,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.380
and all he can see in cars are 
the souls of the drivers.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.840
What's wrong, Trish?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.620
Did something happen?

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.060
My daughter's soul and mine 
have a similar scent.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.350
That's what I gave you just now.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.690
All Bucciarati sees is 
the form of my daughter!

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.830
Get Bucciarati to lead you to 
whatever he was seeking.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.520
Have him take you there!

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.550
Trish...

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.410
Sorry... I'm tired, so I spaced out a bit.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.540
But thank goodness you're safe, Bucciarati.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.390
Yeah... More importantly, 
was there a young man nearby?

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.340
Oh, I saw him rush off somewhere in a hurry.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.670
More importantly, Bucciarati, 
let's hurry to our destination.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.390
You're right. I hate to bother you, 
but could you lend me a hand?

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.160
I can't seem to gather enough strength...

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.970
Yes,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.630
of course.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.020
Diavolo

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.020
Emperor Crimson

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:39.210
It's rather small, but Trish, I have 
a house in the suburbs of Naples.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.520
Once all this is over... 
if you don't have anywhere to go...

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.210
You can live there.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.720
There's a school nearby, 
as well as a great restaurant.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.520
It's close to the beach, too.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.830
You've had nothing but horrible 
things happen to you,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.400
but you still have a chance 
to enjoy a new life.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.280
Thanks. But more importantly 
right now, where should I head next?

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.480
Go up those stairs...

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.490
Upstairs?

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.410
Don't turn your head, Doppio!

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.830
Keep going as though you 
haven't noticed anything!

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.200
There's someone here.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.870
Upstairs, behind one 
of the stone pillars.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.870
Someone is watching you!

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.010
It appears that his goal 
was to meet with someone.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.710
But who could it possibly be? 
I haven't the slightest idea...

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.230
Boss, how do you know they're here?

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.680
And if I don't turn around and look, 
I won't be able to tell who they are.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.100
Look at Bucciarati's eyes. 
That should be enough.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.230
He's reflecting in 
Bucciarati's eyes right now.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.390
Don't move!

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.480
Stop right there.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.780
Take even a step up those 
stairs, and our deal is off.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.160
You're right! There's someone 
hidden behind one of the pillars!

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.720
My name is Bruno Bucciarati!

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.670
I came this far because I 
trusted you when you said

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.620
you had a way to defeat the boss!

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.930
I know that.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.730
But before we get to that, 
who's that next to you?

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.420
There's nothing about them 
anywhere in my records!

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.140
And there shouldn't be!

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.460
Trish doesn't belong to the organization, 
and I only met her a few days ago.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.770
But as you can see, she's one of us.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.310
Trish? That sounds like a girl's name.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.770
Sounds like?

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.230
This isn't good... He's 
going to find us out, Boss!

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.380
Calm down. Listen to me. 
This is what you're going to say:

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.350
"Do you have a problem with me being 
a girl?" Go on, say it, Doppio!

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.580
Do you have a problem with me being a girl?!

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.300
I guess I said something I shouldn't have.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.340
It's a bit dark in here, 
so I couldn't see you well.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.960
Is she a Stand user?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.680
Of course! But enough questions! 
What I want to know is, who are <i>you</i>?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.510
Let's just get to the point of this meeting!

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.390
No, not yet. I want to see her Stand.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.120
Trish! Move slowly.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.840
I have no data on you,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.360
but if you show me your Stand 
from there, I'll trust you.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.910
B-Boss...

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.540
Who the hell is he?

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.770
He's definitely got experience fighting.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.270
He's even thinking about a Stand's range...

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.580
Who could he possibly be? 
I really have no idea...

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.240
Well? Hurry and show me from that spot.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.460
Move slowly, as if you're 
lifting up your skirt.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.090
That's... It can't be!
Why does he have that?

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.930
That arrow... There's no doubt about it.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.640
That's the arrow from back then!

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.560
Wh-What's this ominous 
murderous intent I feel?

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.890
It feels like someone's pointing 
a knife right at my heart...

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.350
I've felt something like this before...

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.190
Don't tell me—

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.280
No, wait... That's right. 
There is one person I can think of.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.790
He used the arrow to track me down...

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.570
He's—

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.670
In Egypt, I dug up the arrows that 
awaken Stand abilities within people.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.580
I knew the moment I saw them

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.030
that these arrows had some mysterious power.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.550
An old woman named Enyaba 
who had two right hands

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:28.140
told me she'd tell me how the arrows 
worked in return for shooting some.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.350
I figured one would be more than enough,

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.260
so I sold the other five for a handsome sum.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.640
Come to think of it, that old woman 
said something rather bizarre...

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.730
The arrow chooses people,

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.650
and those people are attracted 
to one another like magnets.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:55.000
In the 90s, me and my old friend 
Jotaro Kujo were investigating

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.900
these arrows that brought 
out one's Stand abilities.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.880
We heard about a young man who 
had dug up the other arrows,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.240
and we split up to be more 
efficient in searching for him.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.220
Jotaro went to America and Asia.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.930
I went to Europe and Africa.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.930
And I managed to find out 
that one of the arrows was

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.070
in a region of Italy where drug-related 
crimes had suddenly skyrocketed.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.910
I investigated an unusual 
region where drug crimes

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.660
involving young people and their 
victims had increased twenty times,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.240
and I knew I was finally close.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.040
But...

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.490
My organization was nearing 
perfection after just a few years.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.940
My subordinates swore 
their loyalty to me.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.180
I had men hiding in all branches of society.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.560
I had a notion that someone 
was trying to track me down.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.890
In the end, I would finish them off myself.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.620
That's the most surefire way.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.010
I'd already decided that.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.190
But I ended up making two big mistakes.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.030
My first mistake was that this crime 
organization was already complete.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.010
Communications, the government, the press...

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.500
Society itself had isolated me.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.630
And my second and greatest mistake...

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.750
Silver Chariot!

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.550
I guess I'll tell you, 
since you're going to die.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.780
The man who had unearthed the arrows

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.310
had powers far more sinister 
than I could have ever imagined!

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.310
The moment that anyone 
sees Emperor Crimson...

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.880
Boom

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.770
This ability...

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.320
Time... It...

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.810
...they are no longer in this world.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.180
Is there no hope...?

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.840
I'm certain that I killed him!

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.470
To think that someone I had eliminated

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.430
in the past would show 
up again with an arrow!

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.040
Bucciarati! The one next to you is—

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.340
Wh-What? Bucciarati!

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.670
Where'd the person next to you go?!

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.190
They disappeared! Don't tell me...

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.650
Where did they go?!

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.900
Where did the one you brought here go?!

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.780
T-Trish...

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.810
I'm asking you who the hell 
that person next to you was!

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.800
I didn't hear or see anything fall, 
but a piece is already behind me...

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.300
No... These movements...

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.470
Time just skipped!

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.220
Just like what happened in Venice!

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.920
We moved further up the stairs 
before we realized it!

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.270
We're not gonna make it!

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.110
The man waiting for us at the Colosseum 
just entered the boss's range!

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.490
This is a test.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.880
I've accepted this test to stand 
victorious against my past.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.930
A person grows once they are able 
to defeat their weaker self.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.270
Wouldn't you agree, Jean Pierre Polnareff?

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.730
You're...

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.980
<c.color621740>Rumble</c>

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.990
Diavolo!

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.280
It appears that no matter how 
much I tear apart the past,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.480
it still manages to wriggle up 
like a worm from under a rock.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.540
This is surprising.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.540
No wonder I couldn't think 
of anyone who opposed me.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.960
How did you get here?!

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.620
But in the end,

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:17.310
it doesn't matter how you survived after 
I scattered your remains in the ocean.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.810
What's important, Polnareff,

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.180
is what you were trying to 
tell Bucciarati and his men!

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.090
Don't you dare set foot on those stairs!

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.520
I'm up here! You're down there!

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.990
Why won't you fight yourself, Polnareff?

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.700
Because you no longer have 
the mental capacity for it?

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.410
Or are you no longer physically able to fight?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.870
What are you going to use that arrow for?

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.440
This is impossible. I'm sure 
it was a kid down there!

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.830
Diavolo... When did you get so close to me?

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.750
You're the one below me, Polnareff!

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.370
As long as you are below in Hell,

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.370
it doesn't matter what you 
plan to do with that arrow!

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.220
There! Silver Chariot!

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.700
I see your Stand ability 
hasn't lost any of its power.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.690
And it seems you've learned...

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:16.700
You've figured out how to see when time 
has skipped by counting drops of blood.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.750
I see. In just a moment's 
difference in number...

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.620
Your timing is genius, too.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.660
If I had been any closer, 
I would've been gravely injured.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.710
This is the worst...

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.080
I can't believe the first person 
to get here was Diavolo...

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.470
I won't have another chance. But I must...

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.080
I must protect hope at all costs!

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.250
You're already within my range!

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.770
You won't escape this time!

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.480
Emperor Crimson!

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.800
Now, once the passage of time resumes,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.900
you won't be able to see how 
many drops of blood there are.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.540
I've just defeated my weaker
self from the past!

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.100
Take this! The passage of time will resume—

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.420
Wh-What is this?

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.180
The arrow... The Stand...

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.800
I don't know what it's doing, but...

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.220
Take this!

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.060
This arrow... What is it doing to Chariot?!

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.980
There's some kind of 
power behind this glow!

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.070
Time, resume!

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.970
Impossible! What did you do?

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.240
The arrow does more than 
just draw out Stand abilities?

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.020
This is my gamble to keep 
the arrow from Diavolo.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.100
I didn't want to show him that,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.210
but I don't have the power to fully 
control the arrow any longer.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.580
You won't get away!

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.660
<c.color8c433f>Stab</c>

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.110
That arrow is our hope...

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:18.530
The one who can fully control that arrow 
will be the one to control the world.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.310
I-It happened again! 
It skipped! Time skipped again!

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.790
Trish! Where's the boss?

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.440
You spent years uncovering some 
incredible secret about the arrow.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.380
I guess you held out a 
pretty long time, Polnareff.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.220
But unfortunately for you, 
I have the arrow now!

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.190
It appears your heart has stopped.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:04.140
But the life you lived 
was not a complete waste,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.280
Jean Pierre Polnareff.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.850
You have been ever so useful... to me.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.290
Giorno!

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.540
L-Look over there! It's Bucciarati!

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.870
Hey, he looks really hurt!

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.710
Bucciarati!

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.800
Be careful! The boss is somewhere nearby.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.270
So you've come...

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.020
What?

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.260
Who are you?!

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.980
How long have you been standing there?!

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:50.000
Episodio 34
The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 1
