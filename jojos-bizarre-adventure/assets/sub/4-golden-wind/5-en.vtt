00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.130
Passione is a pretty big gang organization.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.980
First, there are groups made up of 
six to ten underlings, like my team.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.810
Then there are capos like 
Polpo who command those teams.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.030
They reign over a particular 
region, making it their turf.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.350
These teams include specialty teams, such 
as an assassination team and a drug team.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.290
Despite being from the same gang,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.320
I really don't want to involve myself 
with those teams or their capos.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.510
And the one who stands 
at the top is the boss.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.550
The boss only has contact with the trusted 
subordinate he considers his right hand,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.720
and we have no way of 
knowing who or where he is.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.500
Gang members in this 
city hate standing out,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560
as it can quickly lead 
to their assassination.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.870
So even the capos will dress 
normally to blend in with the crowd,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.400
and some even have cover jobs.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.760
That goes double for our boss.
He won't reveal his identity to anyone.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.130
If we go snooping around, 
we're detected immediately.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.030
I know plenty of guys this has happened to.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.500
So, Giorno, in order for us to 
get close to our mysterious boss,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.580
we need to be acknowledged.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.990
We can't defeat the boss unless 
we earn the acknowledgement

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.290
and trust of someone close to the boss.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.000
So first, we're going to get stronger.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.090
We have to climb up 
to the position of capo.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.550
Of course, the two of us can't do that alone.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.560
A team we can trust...

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.630
That's what we'll need to defeat the boss.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.740
Episodio 05 Find Polpo's Fortune!

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.990 line:20%
The news of the incarcerated Polpo's 
death spread among the other capos.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.090
According to our intelligence 
team, it might've been suicide.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.580
That's not his style.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.710
Polpo was in a special cell. 
Murder isn't possible.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.890
Maybe he was plotting to betray the boss.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.760
There aren't many capos 
as trustworthy as him.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.590
That's even less believable.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.900
More importantly...

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.280
Yeah... The problem is his successor.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.600 line:20%
How do I look?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.520
Rome 10:05 a.m.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.520 line:20%
I just heard that the capos are freaking out.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.640
Apparently, Polpo committed suicide.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.540
Huh?

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.110
Hey, watch where you're going!

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.110
I'm fine.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.070
Suicide? That fatso?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.330
I told you to watch where you're going!

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.250
So I dunno if Polpo was sad because he was in 
prison or if his obesity made him depressed,

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.830
but he apparently wasn't very strong mentally.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.040
He put his own gun in his 
mouth and blew his brains out.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.710
You sure it was suicide and not murder?

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.930
It was suicide, for sure. 
From the... autopsy, they call it?

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.890
Any expert can tell if it 
was a suicide or murder.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.220
Hey, there's a light up ahead.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.390
More importantly, have you heard 
the rumors about Polpo's fortune?

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.630
Rumors?

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.860
I don't know where the end of the universe is, 
and I don't know jack about that, either.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.010
Before Polpo went to prison,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.690
he converted some of his 
fortune into jewels and gold

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.370
and hid them somewhere.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.580
He has a hidden fortune.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.060
It's too much to even deposit in the bank, 
and he kept it secret from the organization.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.970
No one was stupid enough to look 
for it while Polpo was alive.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.340
But now that he's dead, 
that fortune doesn't belong to anyone.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.210
It's free money.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.090
It's said to be worth about five billion lire.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.730
Five billion?

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.860
If I had that much money,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.570
I'd be heading to Monaco or 
Japan with a girl on each arm.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.500
Nah, I'd rather work my way up.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.930
If I can climb up to capo with that money, 
I can taste honey that's even sweeter.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.430
But who knows where it's hidden...

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.380
No one knows?

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.330
Nah, and this is just what I'm thinking...

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.080
But Polpo was such a fatty, 
he couldn't even go outside on his own.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.670
Do you think he could hide a fortune 
worth five billion on his own?

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.670
He must've had someone do it for him.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.930
Someone who's good at 
keeping their mouth shut...

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.870
Though I'm not sure anyone 
like that actually exists.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.220
But Polpo liked Bucciarati.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.390
Bucciarati? That's one of the 
thugs from Naples, right?

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.220
Yeah. If anyone could've hidden it, it's him.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.380
And now that Polpo's dead, 
Bucciarati should be making his move...

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.950
to get the five billion lire 
that's just been freed up.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.010
I'm sure that even Bucciarati wants money.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.530
Hey, Zucchero!

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.210
That bastard Zucchero actually left!

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.920
Did he seriously believe that?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.130
If you're actually going to trail 
Bucciarati, I'd be careful.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.710 line:20%
Apparently, he and his 
subordinates are Stand users.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.630
Naples 11:26 a.m.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.640
Hey, Fugo.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.680
It's such a nice day outside.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.800
It wouldn't hurt to skip out 
on studying for one day.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.230
I'm just not feeling it today.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.000 line:20%
Thank you for waiting. 
Here's your strawberry cake.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.390
Listen, Narancia.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.390 line:20%
Set it there.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.500 line:20%
Yes, sir.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.850
You're amazing.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.480
It's hard to ask someone 
to teach you something

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.320
when you haven't really 
even been to grade school.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.370
But you even learned your multiplication tables!

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.980
You can do this. Just do as I've taught you.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.960
You've got a good head on your shoulders.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.020
Okay, ready? What's six times five?

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.690
Six times five... Six and five...

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.140
Thirty?

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.320
Correct! See? I knew you could do it!

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.430
You're basically halfway there!

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.990
I see! Six times five is thirty! Okay!

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.480
Hey, what's the deal with this?!

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.230
What do you mean? It's strawberry cake.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.860
Yeah, I can see that by looking at it!

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.480
It's obviously not chocolate 
cake or cheesecake!

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.260
That's not the point here!

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.030
There are four slices of cake!

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.200
Do they want me to die?!

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.090
Again with this, Mista?

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.260
You moron!

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.580
It's bad luck to choose one from four!

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.110
Choosing from five is fine.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.590
Choosing from three is fine.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.470
But when you choose from four, 
something bad will happen!

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.940
When I was a kid, another 
kid adopted a kitten from

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.630
a litter of four that was 
born in our neighborhood,

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.930
and then the cat scratched 
his eye right out of his head!

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.220
Of course, he beat the cat to death later.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.320
That's just an old wives' tale.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.240
If you think about it rationally,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.100
when people eat a cake one slice at a time,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.530
someone's going to have to 
take one of the last four slices.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.890 line:20%
That's the thing, though!

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.240
This is when the restaurant should be more 
considerate and just bring us three slices!

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.860
Talk about shitty service!

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.110
Jeez... Don't eat it, then.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.250
But I want some strawberry cake!

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.850
I did it!

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.580
I did it, Fugo! How's it look?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.090
You're finished? Let's have a look.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.140
What is this?

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.470
Am I right?

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.850
Crunch

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.450
You stupid delinquent! 
Are you messing with me?!

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.230
How many times do I have to 
teach you this before you learn?!

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.200
You shit-for-brains!

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.230
Oh, boy. He's lost it now.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.580 line:20%
You just said six times five was thirty, 
so why the hell is your answer even less?!

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.580
Hey, Abbacchio, are you gonna eat that cake?

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.960
What?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.570
Did you just call me shit-for-brains?

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.550
It's not good to look down on others.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.140
I'll kill you. I'll kill you, Fugo.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.550
You bastard...

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.590
What the hell are you guys doing?!

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.400
I could hear you all the 
way from the entrance!

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.930
You're bothering the other customers!

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.810
This is the new member 
I told you about yesterday.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.190
Let me introduce you. 
This is Giorno Giovanna.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.390
I'm Giorno Giovanna.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.660
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.650
I'm sorry, Fugo.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.910
No, I should apologize.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.420
Please forgive me, Narancia.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.470
I'll study even harder, so teach me again.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.340
Hey!

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.710
I'm the one who brought him 
here, so be respectful!

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.720
Mr. Bucciarati.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.500
What is it?

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.300
There's a phone call for you.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.910
All right, thanks.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.130
Make sure you guys properly 
greet Giorno! Got it?

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.150
Giorno, I'll be right back.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.360
Take some time to get to know these guys.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.820
All right.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.950
Giorno, was it?

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.080
Why don't you have a seat?

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.290
Let's have some tea and chat.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.680 line:20%
Here you go, Mr. Bucciarati.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.290
Thanks.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.750
This is Bucciarati.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.370
All right.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.160
Is something wrong?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.840
No.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.590
Bucciarati! Bucciarati, do you have a second?

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.390
Oh, hello, Ms. Menini.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.020
What's the matter?

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.560
I'd like to ask a favor. 
Could we talk outside?

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.180
Of course.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.570
Well, drink up.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.260
How old are you?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.290
Fifteen.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.660
Fifteen? Ha, you're two 
years younger than me.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.620
Thank you for the tea.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.300
What's wrong?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.220
You just thanked me for the tea that 
I so generously poured for you.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.100
Since you already thanked me for 
it, you'll just have to drink it.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.890
Or do you not want to drink 
it since it's not very hot?

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.110
Maybe he doesn't want to drink it because 
he doesn't want to be one of us.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.060
What the hell are you guys doing?!

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.240
It's nothing.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.550
He went to the trouble 
of pouring this tea for me.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.120
No freakin' way!

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.080
What did you guys do?

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.110
Gross! He actually drank it!

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.600
D-Dude, you're hilarious! 
Did you seriously drink it?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.420
No, there's no way he could have!

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.650
Hey, how'd you do it? Where'd you hide it?

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.390
Hey, come on. Just tell me! Okay?

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.690
Who knows?

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.680
You're all keeping your abilities 
secret, too, aren't you?

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.980
So he's a Stand user?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.780
What I did with the liquid in the cup is...

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.050
I used my ability to change one 
of my teeth into a jellyfish,

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.780
which is 98 percent liquid, to suck it up.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.190
Is it, like, some ability to move things?

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.090 line:20%
Open your mouth. 
There's no hole in there, is there?

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.050 line:20%
You actually drank it for real?

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.050
I'm not sure what it is,

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.850 line:20%
Was that your favorite or something?

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:18.130
but there's something about Giorno Giovanna 
that makes him hard to dislike.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.130 line:20%
If you guys tell me about your 
powers, I might tell you mine.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.050
You're cautious. I respect that.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.050
Does Bucciarati know?

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.180
Yeah.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.530
They're not exactly a team yet, 
but we don't have any time to wait.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.590
This has to be decided now.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.820
Quit screwing around. We're going out.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.230
Huh? Where?

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.500
Follow me and you'll find out. Hurry it up.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.430
Bucciarati! How are you?

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.730
Oh, Mr. Bucciarati!

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:48.830
Hey, Bucciarati.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.270
Come by my shop again sometime!

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.600
I will!

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.420
Hey, what are we going to do about a car?

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.650
We got a loaner.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.220 line:20%
Since a certain someone 
destroyed our last one.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.590
As I suspected, the citizens trust him.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.300 line:20%
Hey, I told you that wasn't my fault!

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.680
Bucciarati, this is my friend,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.960
and she's in a bit of trouble 
because her son is beating her.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.850
Right?

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.860
I see. That's rough.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.130
I'll give him a talking-to.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.570
What's your son's name?

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.440
Thank you.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.690
He's usually such a sweet boy.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.050
But lately, he's been getting into drugs...

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.070
Bucciarati, I've been living in 
this neighborhood for fifty years.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.530
But lately, I've been so anxious.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.050
Who's making them sell those drugs?

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.460
I'm so scared.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.110
Hey, you're going to protect 
us, aren't you, Bucciarati?

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.240
You're on our side, right?

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.980
Yeah... I'll take care of it.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.100
I'll figure it out.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.870
We're going cruising on a yacht?

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.990
That's awesome!

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.520
When did you get a yacht?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.610
We're going to rent one.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.360
Huh?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.870
Aw, it's just a rental.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.040
Say, Bucciarati...

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.210
Whatever you do, please don't 
rent that one with the number 4.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.650
It'll sink. I know it.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.040
Oh, come on... If that were the case, 
it wouldn't be floating there now.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.130
Shut up!

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.130
Then <i>you</i> can ride on that one!

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.890
We'd like to rent a yacht.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.490
Of course! You can use whichever one you like.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.910
Other than 4!

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.770
All right. Sir, I'd like the one on the far left.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.750
All right. Let me get you the key.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.080
For now, I'd like to rent it for three days. 
How much will that cost?

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.740
Oh, I could never ask you 
for money, Mr. Bucciarati!

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.580
Use it as long as you'd like.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.970
Thanks.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.000
Ring me up, pops!

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.250
This feels nice.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.200
Hey, Narancia... Hey!

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440
Huh?

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.370
Well, uh, you know...

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:40.450
You bought drinks, didn't you? 
Would you sell me one?

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.080
What? You always say that, but you never pay!

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.950
Oh, who cares? Gimme one! 
Come on, hurry! Gimme!

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.380
You're so helpless.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.290
You want a cola or Sparite?

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.440
I'll take a co— Actually, 
a Sparite, since it's clear.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.920
Here you go.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.260
Thanks. Could you hold this magazine for me?

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.720
Thanks, and thanks again...

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.390
Huh? What's wrong with this thing?
It just stopped working!

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.670
Why'd it stop?

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.440
I just bought it!

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.530
Damn it! How dare he sell 
me something like this?!

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.540
That stupid old guy from the electronics 
store is gonna regret this!

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:25.540 line:20%
Hey!

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:31.890
Come on, Bucciarati! Hurry up and 
tell us where this boat's headed!

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.050
Fine. We're far enough 
away from the shore now.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.730
We're headed to Capri.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.020
Capri?

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.440
We're not going there as tourists, are we?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.020
Correct.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.360
Then why are we going there?

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.070
This morning, the capo 
Polpo committed suicide.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.730
What? Suicide?! Polpo did?

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:57.540
No way!

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.330
But why?

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.780
It doesn't matter why he died.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.620
Polpo was a capo who did 
things that'd get him killed.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.760
But what does he have to do 
with why we're going to Capri?

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.010
Polpo actually has a secret fortune.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.470
It's worth...

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.000
ten billion lire!

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.060
T-Ten billion?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.630
I'm the only person who 
knows where it's hidden.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.480
I'm the one he ordered to hide it.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.770
That ten billion now belongs to us!

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.950
With that money, we can 
claim the rank of capo!

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.110
A-Awesome!

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.390
He's definitely a man 
who's going to the top.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.910
Just like I thought, 
he's going to become a capo!

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.460
He earned this opportunity

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.000
by working diligently enough to be 
acknowledged and liked by a capo.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.330
Amazing.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.460
Seriously? This took a 
sudden turn for the awesome.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.390
Where is it?

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.930
Where'd you hide that kind of 
fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.660
I can't tell you that yet.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.470
Rumors of his hidden fortune have 
made the rounds in the organization.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.500
No one can find out before 
we secure the money.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.770
B-Bucciarati!

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.350
Hey! Something's wrong!

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.250
Did something happen, Narancia?

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.030
Narancia!

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.080
What the heck are you doing?

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.450
H-Hey, come look at this!

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.040
There's only one shoe left...

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.550
Give that here, Giorno!

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.700
I don't quite understand what's going on.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.120
Where did Narancia go?

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.640
You guys didn't see it?

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:36.050
To me, it looked like Narancia 
got pulled into this box.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.420
What?

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.250
That's impossible!

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.720
He didn't randomly fall 
into the ocean, did he?

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.670
Narancia, where are you?

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.230
Hey, Narancia! If you're just 
fooling around and hiding... Hup!

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.500
Hurry up and answer us!

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.330
Narancia, where are you?

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.120
Narancia! Answer us!

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.020
Mista?

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.320
What are you doing, Mista?

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.290
Mista?

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.160
Where did you go, Mista?

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.560
It can't be...

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.700
Come on, Mista!

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.980
Why are you messing around now—

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.030
Fugo?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.130
Hey, Fugo!

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.690
What?

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.670
What's going on?

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.890
Abbacchio, Giorno, stay close to each other!

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.390
We're being attacked!

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.010
There's someone hiding 
somewhere on this boat!

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.350
This is a Stand attack!

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.510
But why now?

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.810
The money.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.670
Someone found out that I 
knew where the money was,

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.470
and they're trying to steal it.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.330
Which means they're from the organization.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.310
Does that mean they've been quietly tracking 
us ever since we were on the shore?

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.620
Looks that way.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.210
They probably grew impatient because 
I wouldn't just say where the money is.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.190
They intend to get rid of everyone but me, 
then make me cough up the location.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.440
And they can take their time, since we're 
on the ocean with nowhere to run.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.380
Are you saying Narancia 
and the others are dead?

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.860
I didn't say that.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.610
But it's for ten billion.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.850
They'd even kill someone from 
their own organization for that.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.690
No, Narancia and the others are alive.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.370
They're somewhere on this boat.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.930
I don't know if this person is 
trying to use them as hostages,

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:19.520
but they're alive.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.860
Giorno Giovanna,

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.180
how the hell can you be so sure about that?

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.080
I used my Stand to turn 
Narancia's shoe into a fly.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.540
The fly is trying to return 
to its owner, Narancia.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.130
If Narancia was truly dead, it wouldn't 
be flying around searching like that.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.520
Can you locate him?

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.510
He's alive... He's alive, but...

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.010
It's not going down into 
the cabin or in the locker.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.010
The fly's not trying to stop...

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.100
It keeps flying around that 
area looking for Narancia.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.660
What the hell is his ability?

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.450
Just shut up and listen.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.200
Narancia is somewhere near 
the entrance to the cabin.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.670
That's a fact.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.870
But for some reason, the fly 
can't find him, so it's lost.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.950
I think it's safe to assume that we'll 
find the enemy wherever Narancia is.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:17.080
Which means the enemy isn't just 
randomly hiding behind something.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.250
I see.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.400
So if we don't figure out the 
mystery behind the enemy's ability,

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.950
getting too close without 
knowing could get us killed.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.150
Correct.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.240
But the fact that their ability requires them 
to attack while hidden is a shortcoming.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.310
If we can figure out the mystery behind 
it, we'll be able to defeat them.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.980
Abbacchio, your Stand...

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.610
might be perfect to defeat such an enemy.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.440
Defeat?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.160
Can you solve this mystery with your ability?

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.830
Hard to say...

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.970
Damn it, Abbacchio!

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.270
You'd better not be hung up on 
stupid shit at a time like this!

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.670
Stupid shit?

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:58.900
No.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.400
This has to do with my safety.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.950
I can't just carelessly reveal my Stand ability

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.550
in front of a stranger that I can't trust.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.440
Bucciarati,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.120
I don't know what made you trust this guy,

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.270
but I don't consider him a part of the team.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.680
If we don't figure out the enemy's 
location, we're going to be killed!

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.280
And I'm saying that's just this 
untrustworthy brat's hypothesis.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.710
He just came up with it out of fear. 
He didn't see anything.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.610
Abbacchio!

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.770
The enemy is just hiding 
somewhere in the cabin.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.080
I'll find them and take care of them.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.570
If we get close without figuring out 
the mystery, we're going to get kil—

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.710
Shut your mouth!

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.240
You stupid little brat...

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.760
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.560
What are you talking about?

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.640
You can solve the mystery, right?

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.100
I'm counting on you!

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.060
Giorno!

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.350
What the hell are you doing?!

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.200
<c.color8a376f>Roar</c>

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.200
G-Giorno!

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.380
There's an enemy over there!

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.240
Shit!

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.850
Giorno's in trouble!

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.000
Abbacchio...

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:24.390
Giorno Giovanna... You're one crazy bastard.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.260
All this to prove yourself...

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.970
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.060
