WEBVTT

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.310
Ow...

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.780
Yeah, you're going to have 
to go to the hospital.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.910
I know that! I'm asking you to 
do something in the meantime!

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.240
Very well.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.130
H-Hey, Fugo, you aren't—

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.540
Hey!

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.010
What the hell is this?!

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.090
Staples!

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.510
But wow, it actually closed up, 
just like closing a comic book!

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.040
Narancia, could you wrap up his 
stomach with masking tape now?

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.950
Sure thing.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.510
You sure this isn't going to get infected?

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.300
Don't worry about a thing.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.210
Actually, you know, I kinda like it.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.560
Would you pipe down?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.350
Well done, you guys.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.690
Thanks to you, we were able 
to get to Capri safely.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.240
Zucchero, who attacked us on the boat,
and the guy Mista handled

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.650
are both passed out on the boat. 
No need to worry about them anymore.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.370
Then let's hurry up and go to the place 
where the ten billion lire is hidden!

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.660
Where did you hide it, Bucciarati?

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.770
A hidden safe at the bank?

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.750
Or maybe you buried it 
in a cave on the island?

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.170
Could you wait just a bit longer?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.690
Why's that?

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.050
Why are you so worried about the time?

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.510
Shh!

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.310
Hey, you guys. We're still 
in here, so how 'bout it?

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.840
Can't you do the cleaning later?

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.420
Does your name happen to be Toilette?

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.070
Huh? What was that?

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.700
If your name is actually Toilette, 
that would mean this is your house.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.000
You can boss around anyone 
you want in your own house.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.200
But if that isn't the case, 
you've got no right to boss me around.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.220
Huh? Hey, wait, dumbass!

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.960
Didn't you hear me? 
I said not to go in there!

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.780
Crack

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.840
Wh-What the hell do you think you're doing?!

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.360 line:20%
You want a piece of me?!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.360
What's going on?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.970
A new enemy?

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.220
I'll kill you!

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.140
Wait!

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.850
Everyone, stop Narancia!

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.850 line:20%
Why did you stop me?!

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.710
Could you be...

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.860
That voice...

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.100
It appears we've kept you waiting.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.150
All of you, bow.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.350
This is Mr. Pericolo, 
one of the capos of Passione.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.200
I came to accept the ten billion lire,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.270
Bucciarati.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.880
Episodio 09 The First Mission from the Boss

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.170 line:20%
I contacted him as soon 
as we reached the island.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.390
Mr. Pericolo came all this 
way to accept the money.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.890
One of Passione's capos...

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.080
Thank you so much for 
coming all this way, sir.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.720
No, no. I'm the one who said I wanted to come.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.150
All of you, lift your heads.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.330
You must be the newbie I heard about.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.990
Yes, sir.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.510
Bucciarati's told me all about you.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.730
Now that you've joined Passione, 
you're basically family.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.790
You're free to call me Mr. Pericolo.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.960
Thank you, sir.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.180
You, there. Sorry about earlier.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.090
This one doesn't like being touched.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.540
Sure.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.750
You...

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.000
You mean, "Yes, sir!"

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.310
Mr. Pericolo,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.180
why are you dressed up as a janitor?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.820
There's a perfectly good reason 
for this. I'll tell you later.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.110
More importantly, you do have it, don't you?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.950
The ten billion lire to hand 
over to the organization.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.490
Yes, sir. Right here.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.430
What? What did you just say?!

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.490
He said it's right here!

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.950
Here?!

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.710
Bucciarati, where is it?

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.270
All I see are urinals...

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.580
Plop

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.030
I-It was inside the urinal?!

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.910
I mean, that's as safe as it gets, but...

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.350
Sucks to be the guys who've been 
peeing there this whole time!

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.790
Yup... It's real.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.350
This necklace alone is worth at least 
seven or eight hundred million.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.150
Bucciarati,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.540
I won't bother asking how 
you got this fortune.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.240
All the organization cares about 
is that you have the money.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.570
Wait, you're already putting it away?

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.800
C-Could I just touch it a little?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.700
Maybe even smell it?

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:04.130
The reality this fortune shows us is that 
the owner is intelligent and trustworthy.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.730
Congratulations, Bucciarati.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.590
You've been promoted to the position of capo.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.680
H-Hell, yeah! He's a capo!

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.140
Bucciarati's finally a capo!

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.610
You'll be taking over Polpo's 
turf, now that he's dead.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.320
You'll be overseeing the 
gambling, money-lending,

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.620
and smuggling at the harbor, as well 
as the restaurants and hotels in Naples.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.460
Fifty percent of the profit will go to the 
organization, and the other fifty will be yours.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.410
That's amazing!

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.550
He earned authority just like that!

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.800
With Bucciarati's brains and popularity, 
he'll be rolling in the cash in no time!

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.510
But the ball suddenly started rolling 
as soon as this newbie Giorno joined.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.890
Is he some kind of lucky boy or something?

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.890
By the way,

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.460
I know you just took over for Polpo,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.950
but he had left one job unfinished.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:15.310
Of course, you'll be taking on any 
jobs that Polpo had, Bucciarati.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.710
Are you okay with that?

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.050
A job that Polpo left unfinished?

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.190
It's a direct order from the boss.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.740
The... boss?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.860
The boss...

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.510
The boss no one's ever met?

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.930
An order... directly from him?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.260
Correct. I'll tell you right here and now.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:45.290
You'll be guarding the boss's daughter, 
and risking your lives doing so.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.350
That's all.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.190
Daughter?

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.150
The boss...

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.130 line:20%
Did you say "daughter"? 
The boss has a daughter?

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.870
The boss we were eventually going to 
track down and defeat has a daughter?

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.700
You'll start guarding her right now. 
I've handed her over to you.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.500
Handed her over?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040
Bucciarati!

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.950
Could that guy be...

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.960
No, not "guy."

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.550
She must be the boss's daughter!

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.430
That's her?

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.780
Do you mind if I go to the bathroom?

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.770
That's fine, Trish.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.520
For now, stay by her side.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.820
The order is already in effect.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.230
Bucciarati.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.210
Her name is Trish Una, 
and she's fifteen years old.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.640
"Una" is her mother's maiden name, 
not the boss's family name.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.790
Trish hasn't met the boss once in her life.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:51.710
Bucciarati, as you're well aware, 
no one knows who the boss is.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:58.050
But of course, even the boss has a past, 
especially when he was young.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:06.810
Two months ago, a woman named 
Donatella died of illness in Calabria.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:14.560
A few days before her death, she asked 
that a man named Solido Naso be found.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.280
That man was Trish's father.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.330
I'm sure she was just trying to look 
out for her daughter's well-being,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.870
but...

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.710
Naso doesn't exist.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:32.740
Because that was one of the aliases 
that the boss used when he was young.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.010
Correct?

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.720
Beware of anyone trying to 
look into the name Naso.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.710
Anyone with any status in Passione 
is very cautious about that.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.730
Just trying to look into 
the boss's past would mean

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.190
challenging the organization itself.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.140
Word about Donatella eventually spread.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.880
Word spread even more when it 
came out that she had a daughter.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.360
Of course, the boss 
caught wind of this, as well.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.830
The boss's decision was immediate.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.290
Through a few other men, 
he gave me the order

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.420
and placed her in my custody 
soon after her mother's death.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.880
The boss must've known immediately.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.080
He didn't know she existed until now,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.430
but he knew for a fact that 
Trish was indeed his daughter.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.140
And right after I took Trish into my custody,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.190
we found out that someone was after her life.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.070
If the boss's order had come 
even thirty minutes later,

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.980
Trish most likely would've been 
kidnapped by them, and then...

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.250
murdered.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.330
Who is it? Who's after her?

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.740
People who have betrayed the organization.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.160
We don't know how many of them there are.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.710
They're trying to defeat the boss and 
take over his drug trafficking routes.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.960
Drugs...

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.370
They're under the impression that 
Trish knows a secret about the boss.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.570
They want information so that 
they can defeat the boss.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.200
But Trish is just a frail 
little girl who knows nothing.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.360
How long will we be guarding her?

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.610
One week... Actually, 
it could even be less.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.650
It's just until the boss finds those 
traitors and gets rid of them.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.160
Leave this island immediately 
and hide her somewhere.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.270
The only ones who know that Trish 
is with you are the boss and myself.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.580
Mr. Pericolo.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.050
You said that order was supposed 
to go to Polpo, correct?

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.050
Which means...

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.300
The enemies are Stand users...

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.010
I'd say that's a safe assumption.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.580
They're most likely moving as a team, as well.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.230
We don't yet know how many there are.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.340
I don't have a Stand ability.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.110
This is all I can do for you.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.310
I'll contact you again if 
I learn anything else.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.070
Um...

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.960
M-Me?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.250
Yes. Is it with you... um...

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.550
Am I going to be with you now?

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.620
Yes, that's correct.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.500
But it'll be all six of us.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.770
We will be risking our lives to protect you.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:36.880
I see.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.490
Then would you mind taking off that jacket?

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.990
My jacket? Why?

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.100
Just hurry up and take it off.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.200
It's not as if I want to see 
you shirtless or anything.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.440
V-Very well.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.400
I don't have a handkerchief, 
so go buy one for me.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.980
Also, some stockings and 
Givenchy Blush No. 2.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.550
The stockings need to be 
reinforced at the thighs.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.790
Get the latest issue of <i>Italian Vogue</i>, too,

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.350
and some mineral water.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.030
I'd rather die than drink one 
that's not from France, though.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.170
When you're done gawking at the 
scenery, go buy that stuff for me.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.630
Guard the boss's daughter, huh?

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:32.420
So we suddenly have a connection to the 
mysterious boss that I've been looking for.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.910
This is definitely worth doing.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.310
If we can see this through,

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:41.210
Bucciarati will be able to gain the 
same level of trust that Polpo had.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.060
But if we fail, it'll mean our lives.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.290
All six of us are well aware of that fact.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.270
What's your problem? Calm down.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.840
I'm just trying to pet you.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.520
At 9:25 this morning at Naples Prison, Polpo shot himself in the head.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.270
Hey, come on.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.490
Quit struggling! I can't read it. Jeez...

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:13.290
"At 9:25 this morning at Naples Prison, 
Polpo shot himself in the head."

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.190
Well, damn... I was sure it'd be Polpo.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.500
Who is it, then?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.150
Who's the one guarding 
Trish, who disappeared?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:28.210
Find them

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.370
Find them

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.100
Well, then...

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.530
"Find them," eh?

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.770
But was anyone as reliable as Polpo?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.020
Only a capo would be tasked 
with such an important job.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.480
And someone with Stand abilities.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.700
Did anyone else like that exist?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.540
Bucciarati
New Capo

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.540
Abbacchio

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.540
Mista

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.540
Fugo

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.540
Giorno

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.540
Narancia

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.540
We're just thugs right now,
but we're going to work
our way up the ladder!

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.540
If they attack us,
we'll kill them

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Bucciarati
New Capo

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Abbacchio

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Mista

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Fugo

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Giorno

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Narancia

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
We're just thugs right now
but we're going to work
our way up the ladder!

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
If they attack us,
we'll kill them

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Pericolo
Has the boss's trust.
Just a capo.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Mysterious Boss
(Villain)

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
We're going to defeat the boss and
make a killing from his drugs.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Find them and get rid of them.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Protect my daughter!

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Daughter(Trish)

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
15 yrs

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
The boss's daughter
must know something
 about him.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
We're taking her
hostage regardless

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
We were ordered to guard her.
Orders are absolute.
We'll guard her with our lives.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
We're also bad,
but we believe it's morally
wrong to profit from drugs.
(We'll find out your
true identity one day)

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Team of Traitors (Villains)

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
We don't know how many there are,
but they're definitely Stand users

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.000
Polpo's death brings
chaos to the organization
(The bow and arrow no longer exist)

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.960
And that's it for shopping.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.770
Surroundings are all clear.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.380
Let's see...

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.180
If I go this way and turn here, 
I'll end up back on this street,

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.640
and then head in the opposite direction.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.640
Okay!

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.900
Narancia, listen carefully.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.740
That's a list of food and other 
things you need to buy.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.030
These are the keys to the car.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.810
You can do this, Narancia.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.620
I know you can pull it off.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.010
Okay.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.930
Listen carefully. No one knows 
anyone is at this hideout,

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.920
not even the people at the winery 
in the vineyard out front.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:52.630
Once you're done shopping, try going in 
circles on the same path over and over again.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.460
Also try U-turning every once in a while.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.750
Check to see if anyone's following you.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.620
Then, come home after 
switching over to the other car

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.650
that I arranged just in case 
in one of the city's parking lots.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.650
No one else knows that we're 
guarding the boss's daughter,

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:16.160
but if someone's looking for us, the last 
thing we want them to do is follow us.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.430
Do you understand?

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.150
Someone needs to go shopping.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.620
It's very important.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.420
But we have to make absolutely sure 
no one finds out about this hideo—

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.900
Jeez, I get it already!

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.760
Leave it to me!

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.520
Okay, now repeat all the steps I just 
explained to you from the beginning.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.220
Huh?

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.060
Once I'm done shopping,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.470
I drive around in circles 
in the vineyard out there—

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:39.470
J<c.colorda6776>a</c><c.colord32c9d>b</c>

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.020
Ow!

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.490
Wrong! Quit messing around! 
Again, from the beginning!

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.370
Huh?

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.740
Um...

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.990
Drive around so I don't get dizzy—

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:50.970
J<c.color9f5273>a</c><c.color875793>b</c>

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.700
Urgh! What the hell is your problem?!

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.580
Come on, Abbacchio!

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.980
Tell him to stop jabbing 
me with the damn keys!

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.200
I'm older than him, damn it!

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.610
Letting him go shopping is a mistake!

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.260
You two will have to figure out whether 
or not you should be jabbed on your own.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:13.170
But with Narancia's Stand ability, he should 
be able to stop anyone tailing him.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.270
That's why Bucciarati 
ordered him to go shopping.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.060
So basically, that means I just need to make 
sure I'm not followed back here, right?

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.260
By anyone who might follow me!

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.400
Something's wrong.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.230
It doesn't look like anyone's following me,

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.490
but something feels off.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:42.980
I've got a bad feeling about switching over 
to the other car that Fugo prepared, too.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.830
Huh?

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.620
Come on already.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.470
Where exactly are you headed, huh, Narancia?

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.630
That came from below!

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.020
Hey, so, where are you headed?

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.280
You keep looking behind you.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.900
Are you being followed or something?

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.980
Who the hell are you?! Get outta the car!

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, talk about scary!

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.590
I'm the one asking the questions here.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.160
Don't answer a question with 
another question. That's rude.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.040
Shut up! Get the hell out 
of my car, you dumbass!

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.220
You're not leaving me with any choice.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.400
My name's Formaggio.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.920
I'm a member of the organization.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.960
You already know that Polpo 
died yesterday, right?

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:43.740 line:20%
Yet everyone on your team just 
happened to disappear at once.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.140
Shit... He's bad news.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.650
He shouldn't know the truth, 
but he's definitely after us.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.560 line:20%
Right when I had something important 
to discuss with you guys...

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.560
I-Is he a Stand user?

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.130
Narancia, I finally managed to 
find you, but why are they gone?

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.980
Where's Bucciarati and the rest of your squad?

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.230
Who knows?

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.830
I have no idea where they are right now.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.620
Did you check the 
restaurants around here?

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.990
This car...

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.630
It's a rental, isn't it?

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.500
Bucciarati was the one who rented it.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.000
If you didn't know that, 
why the hell are you in this car?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Well?

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.280
I-I always drive around 
in Bucciarati's cars.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.220
I'm seventeen, so I don't 
have my own car yet.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.840
That's why I'm borrowing his.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.630
Oh, yeah. Did you hear?

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.770
Apparently the mortician is trying to figure 
out how the hell to cremate Polpo's corpse.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.050
They can't figure out how to get 
his body into the furnace.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.350
They're just gonna have to chop him 
up into tiny pieces, aren't they?!

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.480
Shut up!

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.480
Hey, you think so, too, right?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.820
Huh?

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.540
What the hell? Th-There's no one here!

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.540
You actually fell for it.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.500
Man, you're useless.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.590
Say, Narancia, why are you guys

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.310
hiding somewhere when 
a capo's funeral is going on?

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.770
I'm gonna make you talk 
if I can't just follow you!

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.770 line:20%
Now you've done it, you asshole!

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.580
You're gonna tell me all kinds 
of things, right here and now!

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.050
You bastard...

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:15.730
Huh?

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.690
You bastard...

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.190
I'll murder you!

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.870
What the hell is that?!

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.710
Li'l Bomber!

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.090
So he's a Stand user... Tiny Feet!

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.700
Ba<c.colorfab341>da </c><c.colorf36d3f>Ba</c><c.colorfab341>da </c><c.colorf36d3f>Ba</c><c.colorfab341>da</c>

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.060
Shit!

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.510
Look at how badly I'm bleeding!

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.630
How dare you?! How dare you?! How dare you?!

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.210
<c.colorcf943f>Bada Bada Bada</c>

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.680
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.480
This is definitely not good...

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.980
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.400
Th-This little shit!

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.340
I'll kill you!

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.410
Sh-Shit! He's out of his goddamn mind...

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.540
He's lost it and is shooting anything in sight!

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.080
And I'm stuck in this narrow 
car with nowhere to run!

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.420
That's the most dangerous part of all this!

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.090
A-A bomb?!

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.840
Murder him, Li'l Bomber!

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.840
How do you like that? 
And that?! And that?! And that?!

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.300
Are you dead yet?

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.530
Ow! Damn it!

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.470
Did we do it?

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.850
H-He's gone!

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.300
Did the blast blow him away?

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.290
But... there's not even a 
shred of his corpse left!

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.730
Wh-Where did he go?!

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:46.320
Oh, come on... I'm right here.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.370
I can make myself small.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.130
That's my ability!

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.390
Tiny Feet... All the other guys 
say this ability is worthless.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.800
What determines if something is worthless 
or not is how you use your brain.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.470
That's how it is with abilities.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.550
What the hell? I don't see him anywhere!

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.600
How the hell?! Damn it, where did he go?

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.930
Is he here?

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.690
The same thing happened when 
he first showed up in the car!

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.350
Well, good luck in your search.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.880 line:20%
Where the hell did he just pop up from?

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.700
I'm gonna be buying some time here.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.960 line:20%
Now he's hiding somewhere!

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.700
A woman...

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.050
This bastard's bought stuff for a woman.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.410
Stockings and blush...
And it's high-end blush to boot!

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.140
Who's he shopping for?

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.690
Is it for his mom or his older sister?

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.200
No... Chicks are super picky 
about what they like,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.600
so they buy fashion and 
makeup stuff on their own.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.300
The only chick who'd have 
a guy buy stuff like this...

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.430
is a chick who can't leave 
her place for some reason!

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.910
This is becoming more and more suspicious.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.020
Looks like my gut feeling was right!

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.240
As I thought, without a doubt,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.320
the one who was ordered to guard 
the boss's daughter is Bucciarati!

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.320
In that case, I'll make sure I get Narancia 
to show me where they're hiding.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.970
My ability should start working 
on him at any moment now...

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.080
Damn it... That bastard's definitely 
somewhere around here...

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.120
I'm sure he plans to follow 
me all the way back.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.800
But...

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.730
I'm gonna find him and kill him!

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.010
I just have to make it back 
without getting followed.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.400
I'm going to follow the orders I was given!

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.260
