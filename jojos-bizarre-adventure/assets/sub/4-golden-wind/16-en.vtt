Episodio 16  The Thankful Death Part 2

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.730
Pesci! What the hell are you doing?!

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.420
Pesci!

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.280
Hurry up and stop the train!

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.000
Pesci!

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.170
B-Bro!

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.150
Stop the train!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.520
Bro!

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.010
I-I don't know how to stop it!

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.720
Now you and your aging ability 
will both disappear.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.810
Then my crew will return to 
normal, and Trish will be safe!

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.130
You bastard...

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.540
Bucciarati!

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.020
Bro!

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.070
What?!

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.830
Prosciutto!

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.500
W-Well done, Pesci!

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.460
Excellent work! That was quick thinking!

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.550
That was close...

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.800
I almost didn't make it, but thank 
goodness I managed to hook him!

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.010
Now my hook will never let him go!

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.180
B-But this is definitely 
the weight of two people!

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.810
Bucciarati must be hanging on, too!

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.550
I seriously thought I was 
done for, Bucciarati.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.780
I called you a failure of a capo, 
but I take that back now.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.910
I apologize for my rudeness.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.920
You are able to make decisions impartially.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.150
You're even able to risk your own life.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.360
The boss made the right decision, 
leaving Trish in your hands.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.130
I'm actually astonished.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.240
However, Bucciarati...

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.140
You're an unlucky capo!

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.610
Now, fall into the hell of 
150 kilometers per hour!

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.360
Zipper Man!

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.630
Did you forget?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.730
You're still aging as we speak!

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.570
Too slow!

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.370
You know... I was saved by that 
line your little bro sent out.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.640
He wasn't aiming for me.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.830
Could I actually be the unlucky one?

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.050
There was no way Mista 
should have been alive!

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.700
I fired three bullets straight into his head.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.040
The fact that he's alive

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.260
is as messed up as someone 
saying the sun rises in the west!

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.310
I happened to let him know

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.650
that the energy from an attack on the line

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.200
gets sent back to the one who's hooked!

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.510
Impossible!

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.120
Bucciarati!

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.160
It's one person lighter now!

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.490
We must've thrown Bucciarati off!

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.500
We did it, Prosciutto!

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.100
Looks like the aging is wearing off.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.420
Now we just have to deal 
with the fishing hook guy!

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.520
Yeah.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.400
Earlier, my Fisher Man's hook definitely 
dug into Bro's right hand...

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.650
His pinky was on the right 
side of the hook.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.640
But right now...

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.950
The pinky is on the left side of the hook.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.160
This is someone's left hand!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.830
What the heck's going on?

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.220
Whose hand is on the other end?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.520
How did Bro's right hand 
switch to his left?!

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.510
N-Now that I think about it... 
Bro also seems just a bit heavier...

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.510 line:20%
H-Hey, you!

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.130
Make them stop the train! 
I think everyone on this train is sick!

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.980
I'm starting to feel much better, but...

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.860 line:20%
I've lost some teeth!

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.860
Th-The aging has stopped!

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.600
Hey, are you listening to me?!

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.180
Have the driver stop the train, quick!

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.070
It can't be...

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.030
Don't tell me the weight that 
was flung from the line was...

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.040
It can't be!

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.000
It can't be! It can't be true!

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.280
Don't tell me that Bro...

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.820
Are you listening to me, you dumbass?!

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.090
I'm talking to you! You, right there!

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.960
My bro, Prosciutto!

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.450
What should I do? What should I do?

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.310
What am I supposed to do?

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.880
No way! The guys inside the turtle 
are going to come out, too!

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.040
Wh-What should I do? What should I...

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.040
What the hell are you even saying?!

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.840
I'm telling you to make them stop the train!

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.650
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.450
Shut up, damn it!

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.650
You some kind of mammoni?!

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.380
Fine. I'm starting to feel better, 
so I'll tell them my—

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.980
Wh-What's going on?

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.960
The aging hasn't stopped!

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.580
Bucciarati, y-you're...

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.800
Impossible...

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.550
Don't tell me... Don't tell me he...

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.010
What?!

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.980
Thankful... Death...

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.890
Bro!

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.340
You were right, Bro... 
You were totally right.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.090
You said we should never

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:22.260
release our Stand ability once we've gotten 
a hold of them, even if we lose a limb...

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.380
Bro...

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.460
With the mess his body's in, 
th-there's no way he can survive...

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.570
He's going to die any second now,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:38.020
and yet he isn't releasing his Stand's ability!

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.060
We have to get Trish, 
no matter what, right, Bro?

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.110
We can't turn back now...

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.990
I get it now, Prosciutto!

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.450
I understand your resolve

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.160
not as mere words,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.790
but within my heart.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.850
Once we think of killing someone, Bro,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.230
the deed has already been done!

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.210
That's the first time I did someone in.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.000
But it wasn't as big of a deal 
as I thought it'd be.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.700
And now, there's no one left

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.180
to call me a mammoni.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.920
Pesci

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.920
Fisher Man

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.840
I'm going to settle this once and for all

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.720
before Bro's ability disappears!

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.780
Bucciarati! You need to hurry 
up and remove that hook!

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.750
Yeah.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.390
You opened up your hand with a zipper.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.230
He can tell what I'm trying to do?

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.110
I'll read all of his actions!

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:18.120
I'll make the hook travel from his hand 
down his wrist and to his forearm!

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.450
The hook's traveling further up your arm!

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.000
The hook is out again!

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.570
It's no use. Whenever I try 
to get the hook out,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.520
he reads my moves 
within a few centimeters!

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.260
And he's powerful!

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.280
I'm not going to lose track of your body!

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.480
And I'm going to get Trish and make sure 
Prosciutto's will is seen through!

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.470
Bucciarati! The bastard down there!

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.890
If we finish him once and for all, 
Giorno and the others will stop aging

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.940
and take care of the fishing line guy!

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.490
I know, but that's proving
quite difficult to do, too!

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.000
I'll make you suffer the same 
agony my Bro is going through!

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.590
Bucciarati!

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.430
He's hanging on to something.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.360
In that case... You can just go up!

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.470
You're heading right for 
those electrical wires!

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.180
Get chopped in half!

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:37.370
I felt an impact, but he didn't 
get chopped in half or fall off.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.610
I feel a heartbeat through the line.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.610
Bucciarati is still alive.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.370
He's entered the train!

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.390
That was close, Bucciarati!

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.690
At this point, we're gonna 
have to face him head-on!

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.880
Yes... But that's going 
to be difficult, as well.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.460
We won't make it in time.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.600
The hook has now entered my chest!

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.640
What?!

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.990
The distance between the hook and
your heart is now twelve centimeters...

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.510
Eleven centimeters...

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.250
I underestimated the situation.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.240
The enemy that posed a 
greater threat on this train

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.340
wasn't the one who could age everyone.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.530
The one who's even more terrifying

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.070
is the guy using this fishing line!

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.430
So what are you gonna do?!

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.830
The hook's gonna dig into your heart soon!

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.840
Nine centimeters, eight centimeters...

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.040
Then I don't have any choice.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.540
In order to defeat his ability,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.490
I'm just going to have to show him

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.400
that my resolve is superior to his!

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.970
Zipper Man!

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.100
What the hell are you doing?!

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.110
Bucciarati!

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.410
He disappeared!

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.450
I can't feel his pulse or the 
vibration from his breathing...

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.090
Why?!

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.030
How did I lose his presence?

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.740
How?!

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.710
How can you do something 
so insane, Bucciarati?!

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.620
I know there's no other way...

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.230
But seriously, are you going to be okay?!

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.880
Quiet... down.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.470
Wait until he goes away.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.400
This is what it means to have 
resolve... Number Six.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.100
Damn it, I can't find him!

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.050
Bucciarati can go anywhere with his zippers!

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:37.270
Could he be heading here 
from s-some direction?

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.050
No, wait. Calm down...

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.630
Jumping at shadows is a sign of weakness!

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.530
That's what Prosciutto would tell me!

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.050
Be more confident, Pesci.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.010
It doesn't matter if 
you're on a moving train.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.790
I'm sure you can find him 
by sensing his heartbeat.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.040
That's what he'd say!

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.210
There's no way Bucciarati 
can move quickly right now!

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:04.720
He must still be somewhere near the hook!

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.270
H-He's extending the line even further!

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.540
Quickly, pull yourself together and run!

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.940
For now...

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.060
he's lost sight of me.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.780
I can make it through this 
as long as I don't move.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.950
The fact that I'm not 
doing anything right now

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.490
shows my resolve.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.620
His heartbeat, his pulse... 
Look for those two things.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.030
Borgh

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.990
Got one! But that's not him!

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.420
The weight isn't right.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.870
It must be another passenger!

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.140
This is... It's weakened, 
but that's the sound of a heart!

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.480
N-No! He's going to find your heart!

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.690
How could you do such a thing?!

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.690
He said he wasn't going to do anything,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.650
but he chopped his heart in 
half to stop it from beating.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.400
This is insane!

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.800
How long can humans live when their 
heart and breathing have stopped?

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.480
D-Damn it! It's not there!

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.130
I don't sense anything 
else moving in that room!

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.840
D-Did he move somewhere else 
using his zippers after all?

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.070
Y-You're reaching your limit!

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.560
Where the hell did he go?!

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.490
Don't tell me that Bucciarati

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.880
actually managed to finish off Prosciutto...

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.910
Once the aging stops, the rest of Bucciarati's 
guys will step out of that turtle!

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.580
God damn it!

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.900
I'm not gonna let that happen!

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.420
W-We did it! He gave up on this cabin!

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.220
Your resolve made him search elsewhere!

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.390
You managed to make it through!

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:16.170
Hurry up and zip your body 
back together! Hurry it up!

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.700
Un...believable...

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.240
How unlucky...

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.460
Bucciarati! Pull yourself together!

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.820
My only expertise is controlling bullets!

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:44.540 line:20%
I don't have enough energy to move 
stuff that's bigger than me!

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.540
He was more stubborn than I thought...

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.590
He's... won...

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.050
Stop, you damned train!

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.260
What the heck?!

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.440
B-Bro!

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.010
This was definitely a difficult path

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.360
that I wouldn't have been able 
to traverse without some luck.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.540
The path leading closer to you, that is.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.930
You're going to pay, Bucciarati...

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.930
You got close to him! 
Your resolve won out, Bucciarati!

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:46.070
...right in front of Bro, 
before he's gone for good.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.400
What the hell?!

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.030
I'm surprised you were able 
to see through that attack!

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.470
His eyes and face...

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.410
They look as if they've come through 
ten years of endless bloodshed.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.750
I feel such intensity and 
calmness from his eyes.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.750
Trickery won't work against him.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:13.670
Do it... Victory is in 
your hands... Pesci...

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:21.020
Do it... I'm watching... over you...

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.900
I will murder you!

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.190
What?!

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.610
I knew you'd do that!

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.910
Going up someone's arm to get to 
their heart was a surefire plan

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.920
I've been using because I was less confident 
and I thought I'd miss otherwise!

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.730
When I'm confident I won't miss, 
I go straight for the heart!

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.930
Right now, I'm going to go 
straight for everything!

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:01.270
I'm gonna murder you! 
I'll rip your heart out, Bucciarati!

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:19.430
You're supposed to say that 
after you've actually done it.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.780
In the world of gangsters, that is.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.080
Did I... lose?

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.620
Am I... going to die?

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.670
But... I'm not... just going to die!

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:41.120
Go ahead... and take her... and run...

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.850
I'll let Trish live...

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.740
He's got the turtle!

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.370
Wh-Where am I?

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.790
But before I die...

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.610
I'll leave your heart in despair!

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.140
The despair of losing your crew!

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.020
I'm going to smash this turtle to pieces!

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.820
Holy shit! That's not good!

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:09.210
Earlier, I saw nobility and resolve that was 
hardened like a diamond, shining in your eyes.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.710
But you've fallen.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.420
Now you're just a piece of shit.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.940
Fallen? Fallen, you say?!

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.350
The only ones who are going to fall 
and get crushed are these bastards!

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.640
You won't make it in time! 
I hope you enjoy hell, Bucciarati!

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.570
You're going to fail, no matter what, 
when you're a piece of shit.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.790 line:20%
Arrivederci.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.790
"Goodbye"

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.880
Prosciutto –Dead
  Stand Name: The Thankful Death
Pesci –Dead
  Stand Name: Fisher Man

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.370
As I figured, we won't be able 
to continue riding this train.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.140
Yeah.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.060
There's no way they haven't 
contacted the rest of their crew.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.000
I'm sure they told the others about 
our destination and the turtle.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.960
We'll have to use another form 
of transportation from here.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.590
There's something I want to ask you.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.430
Are you willing to give me an answer?

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.790
I haven't been given permission 
to answer any of your questions.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.940
Our mission is solely to be your bodyguards.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.250
You <i>are</i> going to answer me.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.770
Who am I?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.880
What the hell is this?

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.550
What's this on the ground?

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.370
Why can I suddenly see such bizarre things?

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:12.120
Why is my life in danger because 
of a father I don't even know?!

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.630
As I thought... 
The boss's daughter is a Stand user.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.460
Answer me!

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.870
Bruno Bucciarati

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.870
Zipper Man

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.750
It's currently 6:34 PM.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.600
I got here twenty minutes 
after the train stopped.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.520
Prosciutto is dead next to the tracks.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.940
Parts of Pesci's body, which has been 
torn to pieces, are on the riverbank.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.340
Judging from the scene, the one who 
disposed of them is Bucciarati's Zipper Man.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.020
I see. Where are those guys and the girl?

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.080
They're long gone.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.670
You gonna be able to track them, Melone?

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.750
Yeah.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.930
Everything the two who have fallen managed 
to do will make tracking them possible.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.880
I've managed to collect a blood sample.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.900
Bucciarati's, that is.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:42.060
