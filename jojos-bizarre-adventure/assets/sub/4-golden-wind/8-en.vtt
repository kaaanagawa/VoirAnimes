00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.110
All we need is someone to head to the 
island first and get rid of the guy.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.150
It's perfect for situations like this.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.610
I'll be going, too.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.030
Mista! He's already on the radio!

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.290
Shoot!

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.370
Bazoo

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.420
Damn it! This isn't good!

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.240
It'll be bad news if this 
truck gets away right now.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.850
Episode 08 Six Bullets Appears, Part 2

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.910 line:20%
Guido Mista's way of life ever since

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.670 line:20%
he was little was to live 
it as simply as possible.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.880
He loved to sleep and found 
joy in looking at branches

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.280
in the morning sun, 
watching the clouds go by,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.530
the scent of wine, 
and having a bite of cheese.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.740
Whenever he spotted cute girls,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.700
he would talk to them, 
even if they shot him down.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.260
If he ran out of money,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.760
he would jump any jerk 
badmouthing movie stars

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.670
in front of the cinema and take their money.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.130
At times, he'd get his ass whooped so 
badly that the police had to intervene,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.990
but Mista lived a very 
happy life nonetheless.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.580
Being simpleminded could 
be taken as an insult,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.850
but Mista always felt that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.260
overthinking things invited fear 
into one's heart, which was bad.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.970
When Mista turned 17, 
he learned from a certain incident

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.630
that people have pre-determined destinies.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.460
When they're young, 
people may find themselves

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.700
at a standstill or taking the 
long way around at times,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.710
but they ultimately end up traveling 
the path they were destined to walk.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.840
On a clear summer night, Mista was 
wandering around like he usually did.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.370
Mista!

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.360
Hey, wanna go have some fun?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.160
Sorry, we have plans.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.000
Ciao!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.810
Sure.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.000
No! Let go of me!

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.270
Shut your mouth! 
There's no point in resisting!

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.570
Shut up! Quit your screaming!

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.280
The woman being punched in 
the parked car was half-naked.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.220
She was bleeding from her nose and 
mouth, and about to lose consciousness.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.210
For a moment, Mista hesitated 
to get involved, but...

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.900 line:20%
Y-You bastard!

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.260
Because he's so simpleminded, 
his body acted on its own.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.330
You bastard! What do you think 
you're doing to our bro?!

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.600
You little shit!

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.940
No matter how close you may be, 
there is no guarantee

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.790
you'll hit your target just 
because you pulled the trigger.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.030
When you're panicked or in a hurry,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.080
you end up pulling the trigger even 
if your gun isn't facing your target.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.480
Both of the shots the hooligan fired

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.540
went under Mista's arm and 
disappeared into the darkness.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.750
The hell?!

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.210
S-Stay back! You hear me?!

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.680
Three, four, five, six shots!

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.800
Unbelievably, they all 
faded into the darkness.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.930
Then his panicked friends started shooting.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.940
At this point, this is 
nothing short of a miracle,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.270
but not a single shot hit Mista.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.990
Meanwhile, Mista was astonished at his 
own state of quiet concentration.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.190
What the hell's going on?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.490
Wh-Who is this guy?!

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.240
Bro!

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.950
Wh-What are you—

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.740
After stealing one of the 
guns and some bullets,

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.830
Mista calmly loaded the cylinder,

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.670
and pulled the trigger as calmly 
as a nurse inserting a shot

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.630
into a patient's arm.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.590
He pointed the gun at their faces 
and shot four perfect shots.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.010
Of course, this was his 
first time killing someone,

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.600
but he didn't hesitate or feel any remorse.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.980
In a helpless situation, Mista made the 
decision to cut through the shadows.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.150
Eat lead!

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.740
The driver of the truck must be its owner,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.210
because...

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.580
his right leg isn't injured.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.460
I wasn't planning to kill you, but...

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.840
O-Ow!

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.350
Damn it! You shot me twice, 
you piece of shit!

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.810
Quit moving! I'm going to aim 
properly this time, damn it!

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.180
How could I say something so lame?!

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.060
That's not what I meant!

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.610
I was supposed to ask how 
that bastard didn't die

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.360
after I shot him in the head!

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.530
Did the bullet just happen 
to miss his brain?

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.450
That was so charming of you, Mista.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.460
Your name <i>is</i> Mista, isn't it?

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.840
I heard that you have even 
more friends on Capri,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.420
but you're the only one who's seen my face.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.760
Isn't that right, Mista?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.370
After that little trap you 
set for me with the radio,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.930
I wound up getting shot twice 
in that surprise attack,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.730
but if I face you head-on 
with my Stand, Arts &amp; Crafts,

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.190
I can easily deflect a bullet 
from a puny little pistol.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.590
By the way, I was a bit too busy to count,

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.160
but how many bullets was that in all, huh?

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.120
You fired four on this truck...

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.170
And I'm pretty sure you fired two back 
at the watchhouse in Marina Grande.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.500
Right? I counted correctly, didn't I, Mista?

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.890
Now I can get close enough to beat 
the shit out of you safely, right?

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.980
Shit. I need to reload!

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.020
Wh-What the?!

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.710
Y-You're kidding me!
My left hand won't let go!

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.360
Whoa!

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.070
Hey! How long are you gonna keep driving?! 
Stop the damn truck, you dumbass!

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.870
Yeah... Someone stop it, please.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.330
Someone stop this truck! This thing is...

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.980
Think about it for a sec.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.430
Why was I nice enough to let you 
know that you were out of bullets?

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.290
Did you think it was because I'm a nice guy?

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.750
Mista...

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.760
I only told you because I knew you 
could no longer escape from this truck.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.210
The driver also can't let 
up on the gas pedal,

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.600
nor can he let go of the steering wheel.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.740
I told you because you 
won't be able to reload

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.940
with your left hand stuck to the truck.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.910
Those are the bullets that the 
bastard's Stand deflected.

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.130
They've stopped in mid-air, 
like they're fixed in place

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.280
and moving in conjunction with the truck.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.740
Fixed in place...

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.810
He must've used his ability to affix 
the bullets into place mid-air,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.580
and to affix the driver 
and me onto this truck.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.600
His ability is to fix something 
he's touched into place.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.300
The bullet I shot at him was also affixed to his skin at the opening of the wound

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.530
and hasn't actually penetrated his head. 
That's why he hasn't died!

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.310
To tell you the truth, Mista,

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.350
I'm ecstatic that you attacked me.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.070
So much that I'm willing to forget the 
fact that you shot a bullet at my head.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.780
I mean, it was up in the air if Polpo's 
fortune actually existed or not.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.740
It's just a rumor among 
some thugs, after all.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.290
But the fact that you attacked me 
means it actually exists!

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.320
I'm overflowing with hope 
and motivation! All right!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.360
I can passionately steal the ten billion 
from that bastard Bucciarati!

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.680
I told you it would be easy for 
my Stand to deflect your bullets!

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.440
Yee-haw!

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.640
Wh-What?! Another bullet 
showed up from the shadows?

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.830
He fired two bullets in a single shot?

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.290
Is that Mista's Stand?

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.240
But...

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.540
I can still deflect it somewhat!

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.790
Hell yeah!

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.270
Well done, Six Bullets 
Number 6 and Number 7!

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.470
And now that we've thrown you from the truck,

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.050
there's nothing more to worry about!

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.480
Ow! You shot me again, you bastard!

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.530
But... you're not getting away.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.950
This is for ten billion! 
You're not getting away!

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.990
There is a way to defeat him.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.300
But he's strong... That's a fact.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.810
Will I be able to do it?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.040
Sale

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.040
Arts &amp; Crafts

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.800
Blood...

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.010
A vehicle...

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.880
The enemy and Mista are in a car, 
heading toward the top of the island.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.980
Will I be able to catch up with them?

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.060
Either way, I need to find 
a car to chase them in.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.900
Four bullets?

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.210
What the hell's going on?

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.190
I only have four bullets!

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.910
Why do I only have four left? Seriously!

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.130
Mista, it's because you dropped some bullets!

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.410
You dropped them, dummy!

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.250
Four is unlucky.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.100
Don't put all four in there. 
It'll just be bad luck.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.680
I-I can take my hands off the wheel!

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.150
Yes! My feet can move, too!

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.560
Now I can finally stop!

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.430
Don't you dare stop!

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.260
Huh? B-But you told me 
to stop the truck earlier!

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.480
And what I'm saying right now is more 
correct, at least when I'm talking to you.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.730
Listen up. I want to go 
back to Marina Grande.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.810
My buddy's back at the marina.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.030
There has to be another way back there.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.610
I won't harm you. I'll even 
thank you if you take me back.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.900
Got it?!

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:10.290
That bastard stops the bullets at the surface 
of his skin so they don't penetrate his body.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.790
The ability to fix things in place...

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.590
How am I supposed to beat him?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.800
If I can just shoot into his mouth...

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.870
The inside of his body should be defenseless.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.380
He might actually die.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.210
But I only have four bullets left.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.510
Damn it, talk about unlucky!

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.390
Three would've been much better.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.250
Now that I've seen his face and know who 
he is, I don't need to do anything dangerous.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.310
It'd be much safer to meet back 
up with Giorno at the marina.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.530
I have extra bullets with 
the rest of my things, too.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.040
Th-That bastard!

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.080
Impossible! He scaled the cliff already?!

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.310
Hey, stop the truck!

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.080
Huh? Now what?

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.770
Stop the truck, I said!

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.190
Hurry it up!

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.970
Th-That's the guy from earlier!

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.940
Mista...

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.610
There's no way in hell I'm going to 
let you tell your buddies who I am!

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.500
I'm not letting you get away, Mista!

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.310
He can affix rocks in the 
air, just like the bullets?

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.500
He climbed up here 
like he was using a ladder?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.130
Why the hell did you stop 
the truck, you dumbass?!

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.700
Huh?

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.840
Drive!

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.300
Huh? Wait, what?

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.850
Full speed ahead! 
You'll be sorry if you stop!

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.770
If you want to settle things 
right here, right now...

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.390
Let's do this!

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.450
Driver, don't you dare stop the truck!

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.310
Just gotta tap it slightly with my finger...

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.050
Even if it's just slightly, 
if I tap it over and over,

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.040
it'll just keep building up force 
in the place where it's affixed.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.650
I can't hit it too hard.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:24.300
It'll throw off my aim, and my enemy will 
figure out which way it's going to fly.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.420
And then... I let it loose!

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.920
Bam

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.930
What?!

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.810
It came back to you, Mista.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:49.070
Those three Stands of yours that you 
just fired lost control and flew off.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.700
Just a little at a time...

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.450
You just keep tapping it with 
just a little bit of force.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.170
Just like tapping an SOS in Morse code.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.130
The aim's not perfect, so I can't use it 
on things that move around too much,

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.720
but I can definitely use it on you right now!

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.380
Th-This really sucks...

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.960
Talk about bad luck.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.730
Four is always the absolute worst for me.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.840
Ever since I was a kid...

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.560
There are just some 
misfortunes you can't see.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.880
Still, other than that, it's a good number.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:31.210
I only have one bullet left, 
but this means the worst is over, right?

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.120
Now the number's one, damn it!

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.190
Number 5! Number 6! Group up!

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.320
We're all gonna group up on this last shot!

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.380
This is the the last of them, 
so give it your all!

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.210
Yeah!

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.580
Stay put, Mista!

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.300
Don't you try to shoot me again, you dumbass!

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:54.700
Just look at this distance! No matter what 
abilities your Stand uses on the bullets,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.560
or how many you fire,
I clearly have the upper hand.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.450
I have plenty of time to defend myself!

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:05.660
You've realized by now that it's impossible 
to beat me, haven't you, Mista?

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.020
If I told you...

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.110
that I only have one bullet left in this chamber, would you believe me?

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.690
I'm telling you the truth.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.980
I only have one bullet left.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.420
If I shoot it and you somehow 
manage to deflect it,

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.470
I'll be out of bullets.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.920
You'll find out anyway, so I 
might as well tell you now.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:32.090
If I miss this last shot, 
you'll see that I'm out of bullets!

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.440
Though messing up is hypothetical right now...

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.430
I'm definitely going to shoot you 
with this one, final bullet!

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.240
What are you pointlessly 
rambling on about, Mista?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.460
It doesn't matter to me how 
many bullets you have left.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:55.240
Whether you fire a single bullet or 
a hundred, you can't defeat me!

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.710
It's not pointless at all.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.790
You're definitely going 
to let your guard down

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.540
now that you know I only 
have one bullet left.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.750
This is pointless.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.710
He's gonna use his Stand!

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.690
Leave it to me!

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.660
Let's go! We only have one target!

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.260
Give it your all!

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.350
You're aiming for the inside of my mouth.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.520
Am I wrong?

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.190
He opened his mouth on his own!

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.830
He's not going to defend himself!

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.690
We'll just have to charge right in!

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.850
I knew it.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.010
Ow!

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.460
I knew you were aiming there...

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.170
At the inside of my mouth!

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.330
That's what any normal person would think...

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.890
That I shouldn't be able to use my 
ability to affix things inside my body.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:08.100
It's a pain in the ass to guard myself, 
so I opened my mouth for you!

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.180
Impossible...

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.870
He can even affix things inside his 
mouth to guard against the bullet?

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.860
Damn... This really freakin' hurts!

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:24.160
But... it looks like you weren't lying 
about that being your last bullet.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.580
I see you're not shooting again.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.860
You done now, Mista?

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.430
If you're finished...

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.260
The launching power on this baby...

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.390
is more than ready, Mista!

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.430
Take this! Release!

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.940
He really did let down his guard.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.730
He let his guard down because 
Mista was out of bullets!

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.760
We just wanted to get closer to him,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.490
because the closer we get, 
the better we can aim!

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.360
Wh-What?!

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.850
Wh-When did they—

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.080
Shit! They're too close!

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.850
Here we go, boys!

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:15.800
Aim!

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.220
Arts &amp; Crafts! Defend!

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.760
The bullet split in two?!

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.300
It won't matter if he gets 
one more clean hit on me,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.760
but... he's not aiming for that, is he?

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.860
That's not good.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.980
Don't tell me... he's aiming for that!

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.940
That's—

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.110
I aimed for the same wound.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.310
If I shoot another round at the 
one that's stopped in your head,

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.630
it's going to push it just enough 
to dig further into your skull!

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.220
I mean, if you're invincible enough to 
withstand that too, I'm sorta screwed, but...

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.580
We did it!

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.500
Yes!

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.460
Yes!

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.020
Come on, Number 3.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.880
I keep telling you to not 
bully Number 5, jeez...

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.800
He's still somewhat alive, 
even though he's got a bullet in his brain.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.690
Guess your Stand really is invincible.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:59.490
Bucciarati told me not to kill you, but...

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.030
Hey, we're going back! 
Back to the marina!

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.600
What do you want?!

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.830
What the hell is with you guys?!

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.930
Damn it.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.250
Who the hell do they think I am?

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.600
Telling me to stop, then go...

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.790
I'm not a freakin' taxi, you dumbasses!

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.540
How dare you threaten me?!

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:41.280
I'll let you off the hook for now, 
but next time I'm gonna let you have it!

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.780
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm chasing someone.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.970
Could you take me to the top 
of the island in this truck?

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.020
Quit wasting time! I'm desperate here!

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.790
You're gonna drive! Got it?!

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.000
Y-Yes, sir...

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.370
Episodio 09
The First Mission from the Boss
