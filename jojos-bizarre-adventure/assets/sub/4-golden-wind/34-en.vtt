Time, resume!

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.420
<c.color8c433f>Stab</c>

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.280
What?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.130
Who are you?! How long have 
you been standing there?!

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.470
Wait! Who are you?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.080
What's that mark I can see on your neck?

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.800
Wh-What is this? What's going on?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.340
Why did the arrow fall from my hands?

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.430
You! I told you to stop!

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.290
Show me... your... face...

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.510
Why am I sitting down?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.840
He was on top of the wall 
where Chariot melted...

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.010
Could it be... the arrow's...

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.700
M-Mista! Something's wrong...

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.160
Th-This feeling...

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.550
Everyone else is also...

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.390
What's going... on...

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.760
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.190
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.230
Eternal greatness exists only within myself.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.820
Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.

Episodio 34 The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 1

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.820
Wh-What? Did I fall asleep?

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.520
What... happened?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.160
It's already dawn.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.110
Yeah. I'm not sure why, but it seems like 
we've been asleep for a few hours...

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.400
Wh-What is this?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.810
Why are my hands all wet?

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.270
Is this blood?

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.970
Wh-Why?

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.890
Were we attacked?

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.890
Are you hurt anywhere, Giorno?!

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.840
Dash!

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.730
Giorno! Get behind the wall!

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.190
You're right out in the open!

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.290
If you're hurt, you need 
to tend to your wounds!

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.740
I-Is Giorno hurt? I can't 
seem to see him anywhere.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.290
Hurry up and hide, Giorno!

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.630
Wh-Where the heck is he anyway?

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.840
I can't see him at all from where I am.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.170
Could you tell me where he is, Trish?

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.580
If he's hurt, we need to go save him!

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.970
What the hell are you talking about?

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.680
Huh?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.800
Nothing you're saying makes any sense.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.700
Wha—

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.070
What the hell is this?!

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.470
H-Hey, what the hell is going on?!

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.410
Why do I have these things?!

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.120
N-No, wait! I'm missing something!

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.830
It's totally gone!

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.920
What I'm missing is way more important!

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.560
Hey, Giorno! What's up with 
the blood on your hands?!

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.510
Where the hell are you looking?! 
You! I'm talking to you!

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.050
Y-You're talking to me?

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.560
I mean, I was surprised earlier, but whatever 
this blood is, I don't feel any pain.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.770
It must be from when the mold attacked.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.510
I had Giorno fix it for me, but the 
wound hasn't completely closed,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.700
so I think the blood is from my shoulder.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.890
The mold's attack?

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.020
But you...

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.250
What... in the world...

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.790
happened?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.500
Did I fall asleep?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.660
I feel strange.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.500
<c.color278197>Rumble</c>

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.300
Wh-What the...

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.940
Th-This face...

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.780
G-Giorno's body and my body...

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.610
No, wait. It's our souls, our minds.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.120
Could it be that while we were sleeping, 
Giorno and I, and Mista and Trish...

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.410
Each pair's minds have been swapped?!

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.110
Oh, no... I... I...

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.640
What's with this face?!

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.100
This body!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.600
I stink!

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.230
My armpits...

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.320
smell so bad!

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.770
H-Hey, come on, Trish!

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.350
That's not the problem right now!

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.780
We were attacked by a Stand.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.950
It's definitely not the 
boss's Emperor Crimson,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.280 line:20%
Why me? No!

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.530
but our minds have been 
swapped for some reason!

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.590
Damn it! Could it be another 
one of the boss's elite guard?

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.650
No, Narancia.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.430
The boss is already somewhere 
near the Colosseum,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.290
so I don't think he'd rely on 
one of his subordinates.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.010
Plus, Mista and Narancia mentioned an attack, but is that really what this is?

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.300
Our minds have been swapped, 
but we're not hurt.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.540
What could have...

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.540
H-Hey, Giorno.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.180
No matter what happens, 
I-I'm still older than you. Got it?

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.070
Oh, my gosh! I have hair 
growing on my fingers!

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.320
And my nails are so gross and malformed!

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.070
And they have so much dirt under them!

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.660
I can't deal with this!

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.940
I knew it! That stinks, too!

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.130
Why? Why did I have to be Mista?!

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.220
H-How am I supposed to know?!

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.210
Probably because we fell 
asleep near each other.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.710
And is that really what you think about me?

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.820
Do I smell that bad?

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.860
Hey!

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.100
What the hell are you touching there?!

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.100
H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.110
I wasn't trying to touch it! 
It's just itchy around the elastic...

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.340
Don't stick your fingers in my panties!

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.320
Okay, I got it...

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.530
If you spread your legs any 
further, I'll kill you.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.380
Okay, I get it! But you're wearing panties 
to make your butt look firmer,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.740
so everything's so tight and itchy!

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.770
You're even wearing a push-up bra.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.340
Just so we're clear!

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.170
The next time you stick your hand 
into my skirt, I'll kill you!

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.880
I'm going to

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.340
curse you to death!

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.990
Narancia!

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.900
Tch. Don't you get it? That's Giorno.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.810
And so what, you're going to kill yourself?

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.800
Stop that!

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.550
Hey, guys...

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.890
I, um, have a question.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.610
So, Bucciarati...

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.100
Um, so it's me and Giorno, 
and Mista and Trish.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.450
If we swapped minds with 
whoever was closest to us,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.890
then who did Bucciarati...

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.260
I've been watching him, 
but he's not moving at all.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.630
Is he okay?

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.830
Stay away from him, Narancia!

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:12.420
Huh?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.230
There should be someone else 
inside Bucciarati, too.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.420
And we don't know who that is.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.890
Is that what you're saying, Giorno?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.850
It all comes down to what went down 
at this Colosseum before we got here.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.790
Who was near Bucciarati?

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.660
And what happened to the boss and the 
man waiting for us at the Colosseum?

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.190
Narancia, scout the area with Li'l Bomber!

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.900
I've been trying... but...

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.750
Something's wrong. Li'l Bomber isn't...

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.740
M-My Stand ability...

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.680
Appear! Li'l Bomber!

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.640
It's no use! Li'l Bomber won't come out!

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.300
D-Don't tell me our Stands—

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.240
No, Narancia. That's not it.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.320
Take a closer look.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.590
Li'l Bomber!

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.370
I-It's so fast! It's so fast, 
I couldn't even see it!

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.550
But what the hell?!

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.440
I don't know what's going on, 
but I feel so refreshed!

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.200
I don't know what's going on, but...

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.570
...we're so full of energy!

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.000
My Stand is still with me, 
but it seems to have powered up!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.530
I destroyed six iron 
railings in a single shot!

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.990
My mind is on point!

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.500
What in the world is this Stand ability 
that can swap people's minds?

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.480
What's the purpose of this?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.120
This Stand user...

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.330
As much as I don't want to 
believe it, are they our enemy?

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.970
There's no one else nearby.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.560
I can't tell if any of them are the boss.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.490
Everyone around the Colosseum...

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.350
is fast asleep.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.350
Even with my radar, I can't 
really tell how far it reaches.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.230
No, wait...

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.920
Some of them are moving just a little bit.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.570
Some are even waking up!

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.200
Man, that was a great dream.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.910
Wh-What the hell is this?!

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:13.590
I assaulted some female cop 
and even handcuffed her.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.840
Tweet, tweety tweet.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.920
Arooo!

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.760
Waaah! Waaah!

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.350
So all the passersby got swapped, too?

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.480
Yeah, it looks that way. 
There's confusion everywhere.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.570
What a weird ability...

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.650
Hey, Giorno. What are you doing?

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.700
I should be able to sense a soul's 
energy through the ground.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.160
But I can't... Who is it?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.830
Who did Bucciarati swap with?

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.210
Narancia... I mean, Giorno.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.160
If you're thinking that the boss 
and Bucciarati got swapped,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.330
there's one thing that's clear.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.130
That's not it. 
That's definitely not the boss's soul.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.150
If it were him, I would 
be able to sense him.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.460
But the strangest thing is that I'm 
certain the boss isn't nearby, either.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.810
The boss disappeared somewhere.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.230
Bucciarati...

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.050
You're saying we won't know 
about him until he wakes up?

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.600
Until then, we can't take 
our eyes off of him.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.950
It hurts...

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.370
Without question, the enemy is Diavolo.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.000
Got it?!

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.130
I-It hurts...

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.300
But listen to me, Narancia... No...

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.380
Are you Giorno Giovanna?

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.470
Golden Wind!

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.690
No... I'm not speaking from inside the turtle.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.400
It's me. I'm the one speaking.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.210
My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.240
I was the one who arranged to 
meet you here at the Colosseum,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.460
but Diavolo backed me into a corner,
and I could no longer fulfill my promise.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.960
Who swapped with who

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.960
Mista                Trish

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.960
Giorno         Narancia

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.960
Bucciarati

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.960
Turtle         Polnareff

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.680
Who the hell is this guy? Who's "Polnareff"?

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.550
Let me just say this first...

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.280
I only did this because Diavolo 
left me with no other choice.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.850
This strange phenomenon that's 
happening to all of you right now...

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.940
is a part of the arrow's power,
the arrow I was supposed to give you.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:52.300
I'm desperately hanging on to my 
soul... so I can tell you this.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.140
The arrow?

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.080
So you're saying this was 
caused by that arrow?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:02.380
To be more precise, it's because my Stand, 
Silver Chariot, took hold of the arrow.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.640
My body is already dead upstairs.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.840
The reason I was able to swap souls 
with this turtle and survive is

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.720
because of that arrow.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.040
There's definitely someone in the 
hallway on the second floor.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.100
There's a dead guy who's been 
knocked out of his wheelchair!

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.150
It's only my body? Where's Diavolo?

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.290
Hey! If everything you're saying is true,

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:32.110
your Chariot can return 
us to normal, too, right?

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:39.160
No... I currently don't have the power 
to control Chariot or make it disappear.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.370
I don't even know where it is right now.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.590
Chariot has basically gone berserk.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.550
Your own Stand went berserk?

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.710
How irresponsible can you—

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.260
No. More importantly, 
what happened with the boss?

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.580
What happened to him?

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.600
Where is Diavolo right now?

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.470
I don't know.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.730
Diavolo was right in front 
of me, but he disappeared.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.860
All of you, listen very carefully.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.570
The arrow is not your enemy, 
nor is it your friend!

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.880
What I'm about to explain to you is hope!

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:20.690
Such a trivial... trivial coincidence 
happened two years ago.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.170
After I was incapacitated by Diavolo,

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.230
I somehow managed to survive 
and hid in a small farming village.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.150
That's where the trivial thing occurred.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:39.820
The arrow we had retrieved in Egypt fell 
between the wall and some furniture.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.270
It's truly an insignificant thing.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.270
Normally, one would just stick their 
arm back there and pick it up.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.580
But for my body, it was an arduous task.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.920
I thought about just leaving it there,

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.450
but I figured that Chariot 
could get it for me.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.060
That's when it happened.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.460
Chariot hurt its finger on the arrow.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.540
It was mere coincidence.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.950
The arrow draws out Stands from 
those who have potential.

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.880
But if it happens to pierce a Stand...

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.050
I don't know how old that arrow is,

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.640
but I'm starting to understand what the 
person who created it was thinking.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.540
There's more to the power of a Stand!

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.730
Something that goes far deeper!

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.610
Suddenly, the birds in the sky fell,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:39.140
bugs hid beneath leaves, 
and cattle laid on the ground.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:44.290
And the farmers started 
sleeping in the streets.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:50.670
I felt a slight change, but a much 
bigger change had taken over Chariot.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.940
I had a bad feeling, so I immediately 
took the arrow away from it...

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.700
before it could go berserk.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.960
Everything went back to normal, 
as if nothing had happened.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:15.110
Then I realized that if someone who had 
enough power were to use this arrow,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.360
they would have the power to control 
the minds of all living creatures!

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.000
But I currently don't have 
that kind of power.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.460
And that's why I waited...

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:34.600
for someone like you who was 
searching for Diavolo's true identity.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:38.840
Though, in the end, 
Diavolo was able to outdo me.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.210
So this controlling minds thing...

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.250
Do you mean the thing going on right now?

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.810
It's just swapping souls?

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:47.690
No.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.940
Remember when I said that this 
was just a part of its power?

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.900
I can't control it, so I wasn't able 
to see its potential beyond that.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.340
But it definitely exists!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.990
Go retrieve the arrow!

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.290
Stop Chariot before the boss can, 
and reclaim the arrow!

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.660
The only way to defeat Emperor Crimson

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.210
is for you to use the arrow 
to its full potential!

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.250
So in order to take back the arrow, 
you're telling us to kill Chariot.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.260
Am I assuming too much?

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.570
That's fine.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.270
Once you take the arrow, 
Chariot will be destroyed regardless.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.790
Besides, I've already been finished off.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.230
There's one other unbelievable and 
important thing that I need to tell you.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.140
Are you the girl called Trish?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.730
Yes, though I currently have hairy knuckles.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.240
I see...

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.000
The boss is a duo.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:58.190
There was a kid who was somehow able to 
transform into you and trick Bucciarati.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.260
Diavolo and this kid were like 
a well-coordinated team.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.130
What? B-But how?

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:07.330
But that's impossible.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.520
The boss trusts no one. That's how he 
kept his identity secret for so long.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.010
I'm not sure what happened, either...

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.230
But there was definitely a mysterious kid.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.820
If it wasn't for that kid, there's no way 
I'd have let Diavolo get that close to me.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.790
Two... So the boss is a duo?

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.180
What's...

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.040
Giorno! Something's moving!

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.920
Nine o'clock. Uno signal.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.310
It's a person!

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:41.090
There's a person heading in 
from the gate on the right!

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.570
H-He's...

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.040
That face!

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.670
The boss! No... Diavolo!

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:09.950
Narancia...

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.800
Get Li'l Bomber behind him—

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.790
Giorno, wait!

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.670
The left! Look to the left, in the shadows!

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.460
So there it is!

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.380
That's my Stand, which the arrow evolved...

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.910
Chariot Requiem!

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.640
He's—

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.100
Th-This isn't good!

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.810
Diavolo was looking for Chariot!

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.940
He's trying to get the arrow!

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.610
Giorno, wait!

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.350
Don't attack just yet!

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.090
That Stand!

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.530
It's Zipper Man!

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.970
Th-That's Bucciarati!

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.620
It's Bucciarati's...

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.800
soul!

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:50.000
