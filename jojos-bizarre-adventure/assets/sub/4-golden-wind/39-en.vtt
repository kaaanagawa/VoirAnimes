00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.990
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.410
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.590
Episodio 39 The Sleeping Slave

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.430 line:20%
Bucciarati? This stone is 
definitely shaped like...

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.260
Hey! Are you the sculptor?!

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.560
Who the hell are you?!

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.190
Don't you dare try anything!

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.570
I didn't kill you because 
I was ordered not to,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.320
but now that I know you're a Stand user,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.910
there's no guarantee that I won't add 
another hole between your eye sockets!

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.740
Who the hell are you?

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.150
How do you know Bucciarati?

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.560
The florist's daughter falling 
to her death is concerning,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.880
but why did you follow 
me from the restaurant?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.910
Daughter?

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.430
Are you a police officer?

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.390
No, the police wouldn't—

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.910
Listen up, you sick bastard! 
I'll be the one asking questions here!

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.960
You just need to answer!

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.790
Just concentrate on that.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.690
Got that? Don't even think about 
saying or doing anything else!

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.730
That also includes lying to me. Got it?

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.100
All right... I'll ask you 
one question at a time.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.260
First off, are you in a gang?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.500
Do you belong to some organization?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.350
I can find out later if I look into it, of course.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.750
N-No... I'm just a sculptor.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.470
I'm not famous, but I 
make a living off of it.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.250
Then how did you become a Stand user?

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.180
I don't even know what a Stand is.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.520
If you mean this ability...

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.400
It just started happening 
while I was still a child.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.210
Was it the same for you?

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.940
Hey!

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.390
Next question. Why did you 
follow me from the restaurant?

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.910
And how do you know Bucciarati?

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.660
Bucciarati...

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.250
Bucciarati... Is that his name?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.800
Let me see him, please! He came 
with you to this building, right?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.240
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.250
You didn't answer my question, you moron!

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.610
I-It's probably not an answer you'll like...

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.410
But this rock moves on its own, 
regardless of how I think or feel.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.350
It's been like that ever since I was a kid.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.980
It's a power that I have no control over.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.870
The rock didn't follow you.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.520
It was following him... Bucciarati.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.500
Oh, is that so?

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.400
Do you want me to make it so you 
can never hold a chisel again?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.830
Sorry to break it to you, but Bucciarati's 
far away from here, you dumbass!

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.600
You're the one who's lying.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.170
Bucciarati should be in 
this apartment building.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.500
Let me see him. His life depends on—

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.900
Don't mess with me!

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.720
Why did you kill the florist's daughter? 
What are you after—

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.320
What the hell are you doing?!

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.940
I told you to not try anything funny!

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.650
The rock has left...

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.610
What?!

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.040
One of the greatest sculptors in 
history, Michelangelo, once said...

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.440
"I don't have any thoughts when 
I take hold of a marble slab.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.590
Every block of stone already 
has a statue inside it,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.300
and it is the task of the 
sculptor to discover it."

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.720
What the hell are you babbling 
about, you bastard?!

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.090
You're going to die if you don't hurry 
up and bring that rock back here!

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.610
Michelangelo was saying that the ultimate 
statue is not created from an idea.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.400
It already dwells within 
the stone as its destiny.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.780
He was an artist who could see
that destiny as he sculpted.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.060
It's not that I sculpted that rock 
into the shape of Bucciarati,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.150
and neither did your bullets.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.630
That is the shape of destiny.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.960
The statue had a hole in its 
chest that was gushing out blood.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.210
I don't know if it's in a few 
days or in a few months,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.640
but that's going to be how 
Bucciarati eventually dies.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.070
We're all slaves to fate.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.730
That's the meaning behind my 
ability, Prophecy Stones.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.310
This is your last chance! 
Bring the rock back here now!

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.690
If you die, so will your Stand! 
You get that, don't you?!

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.590
If he touches my Prophecy Stones,
he can die without suffering.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.370
I wanted to see him so I could 
at least hear his last words...

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.990
Wh-What the hell is this guy's problem?

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.360
Is he mocking me?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.010
How the hell can he be so calm, damn it?!

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.220
Fine! You want your brain splattered 
onto that rock so badly?

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.800
Look! There are three shots left.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.720
This is how you use destiny!

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.540
You're apparently trying to 
do something to Bucciarati,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.620
so bring that rock back here right now!

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.240
You're the one who doesn't 
have time or chances!

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.140
I told you. There's nothing more I can do.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.330
Bring it back here right now, God damn it!

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.920
The florist had a hard time walking, right?

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.520
He doesn't know it yet,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.760
but it's an early symptom of some 
disease in one of his internal organs.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.410
He'll most likely survive, though.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.380
When his daughter died, 
her organs were preserved.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.040
He'll receive them as transplants.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.860
The girl found out from the rock

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.490
that she'd contract the same 
disease in a few months.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.480
She understood that and believed it.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.920
She decided to die while she was 
healthy for her father's sake,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.610
rather than die in pain later.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.200
So she accepted the rock, and...

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.310
The rock allowed her to 
die without suffering,

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.590
and in a way in which her 
organs weren't crushed.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.890
You have some nerve saying that when 
you're the one who killed her!

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.700
Wh-What?!

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.470
It's a misfire, Mista!

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.190
That bullet was a dud!

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.900
That's impossible!

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.660
That bullet is Number 5's responsibility!

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.120
Aw, why me?

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.570
I cannot die yet.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.280
Because the rock hasn't carved my death yet.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.240
Y-You think you're going to get 
two duds in a row, you jackass?!

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.500
You caught a glimpse of destiny just now.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.190
You no longer have any 
intention of shooting me.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.090
Am I wrong?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.460
Wh-What's with this guy? Damn it!

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.190
What the hell is he talking about?

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.640
Is he still messing with me?

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.650
Hello, Fugo?

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.760
Tell Bucciarati that this 
sculptor is a Stand user!

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.690
What?

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.860
This bastard keeps mentioning Bucciarati,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.740
but I can't really tell 
what's going on by myself!

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.730
What are you talking about, Mista? 
You still haven't met up with him?

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.490
Huh?

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.900
Bucciarati headed to that 
apartment building a while ago.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.710
He followed you right after 
you got out of the car.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.670 line:20%
Hello? Mista? What's wrong?

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.290
What?!

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.060
Bad luck

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.060
Prophecy Stones

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.060
Scolippi

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.860
Wh-What's the number, 
Fugo? I have to find him!

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.900
What's the number to the phone 
Bucciarati has right now?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.530
Are you all right?

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.120
The one you're calling 
right now is Bucciarati's.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.360
Hello, Mista? Hello?

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.290
Hurry, Bullets! Find Bucciarati!

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.290
Mista? Hello?

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.150
Hey, wake up, you sculptor bastard!

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.300
How can I stop that rock?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.110
Hey, wake up, would you?!

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.470
Answer me, God damn it!

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:21.600
What do I need to do to stop that 
rock from getting to Bucciarati?!

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.980
P-Please... Tell me.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.060
I'm starting to understand what you told me.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.270
But what the hell am I supposed to do?

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.500
I can't let Bucciarati touch 
that rock, no matter what.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.490
I can't.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.520
Please, tell me.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.500
It'd be better and easier...

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.460
if you two didn't defy the rock...

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.960
No one's been able to do it before, 
but if you're able to destroy that rock

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.980
or change its shape, then...

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.140
We found him, Mista!

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.800
We found Bucciarati!

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.530
We got a report from 
Number 1 that he found him!

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.390
Bucciarati's on the seventh floor!

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.730
The stairs! Bucciarati used the stairs!

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.190
What?!

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.110
Th-This isn't good!

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.700
The rock! The rock is on the stairs, too!

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.160
The rock is right in front of Bucciarati!

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.820
Stop him, Number 1!

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.330
Tell him not to touch that rock!

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.910
It's no use, Mista!

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.170
Number 1's bullet doesn't have enough 
power left to fly over there.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.010
Bucciarati!

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.640
Yee-haw!

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.310
Bullets?

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.760
We did it!

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.030
That was close!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.760
Its shape is falling apart!

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.150
That's great and all...

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.540
B-But I have a feeling we 
might've made things worse...

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.830
Bullets, what in the world is going on here?

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.130
Is that a Stand?

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.560
And its shape...

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.520
Run, Bucciarati!

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.480
Zipper Man!

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.520
Don't attack it!

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.940
It's bad news if you touch it!

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.610
Run down here, Bucciarati!

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.630
Mista!

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.050
You can't touch that rock!

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.910
If you lay even a finger on it, you'll die!

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.410
What do you mean?

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.500
I'll explain the details later!

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.750
Is that rock a Stand?

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.080
Hurry and get downstairs!

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.420
Get out of this building and 
get as far away as possible!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.050
What? This happened in 
the elevator earlier, too...

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.030
Sh-Shit! These stairs are dangerous!

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.210
We need to find another way down.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.920
Going down these stairs is a bad idea!

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.310
Go up, Bucciarati!

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.560
Wh-Where is it?

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.260
It's not here! Damn it!

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.710
Where did it go?!

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.300
Mista, what's going on?

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.950
Sh-Shit!

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.540
Above you, Bucciarati!

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.320
Bucciarati!

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.810
Wh-What's this face on this rock?

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:03.400
If we can destroy the rock 
or change its shape...

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.530
Mista!

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:10.410
If I just smash it into the pavement 
from here, it should break into pieces!

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.490
Damn it!

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.000
You're not getting away!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.750
That's impossible! Mista!

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.460
Damn it... What that 
sculptor bastard said...

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.690
turned out to be true...

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:45.880
If you don't appear in the rock, 
then it's not your time to die yet...

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.200
What the hell have you been doing, Mista?

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.720
You left the tape recorder 
on the car seat, you dumbass.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.250
Hey... It's you, Fugo...

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.430
What <i>was</i> this rock?

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.840
Mista, what chain of 
coincidences led to this?

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.120
Uh... You should be fine now.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.180
I, uh... don't even know 
how to explain all this.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.290
Anyway, about the florist's 
daughter's death...

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.080
The sculptor was sort of the suspect,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.970
but not exactly the suspect...

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.060
I hurt him enough to land him in the 
hospital for a couple of months, though...

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.280
I still have no idea what the 
hell you're talking about.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.580
Was he an enemy or not?

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.680
Was it suicide or not?

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.620
Explain it all in a more orderly fashion!

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.060
That's just it, though...

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.590
It's really, uh... hard to sort 
everything out in my head.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:59.060
Simply put, we destroyed the 
rock, so everything's over now.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.360
Hey, Bucciarati, I'll look into 
the incident with Leaky Eye Luca.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.060
No, it'd probably be quicker 
to look into it myself

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.650
than have you try to explain what happened.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.110
It's a job I can do on my own.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.110
Fugo, try to get a decent explanation 
out of Mista so we can explain

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.320
what happened here to the florist.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.140
Bucciarati, I'm willing 
to do anything for you,

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.670 line:20%
I'm not sure how I should say this...

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.630
but do you really think I can 
understand what he's saying?

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.220 line:20%
You can stop thinking now.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.200 line:20%
We'll just use Abbacchio's Moody Jazz.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.200
Over...

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.640
Everything is over, you say?

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.210
If you had just accepted Prophecy Stones, 
everything would've ended peacefully...

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.500
We're all slaves to fate.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.430
We cannot change what has 
already taken shape.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.890
I don't know who they are, but now 
they're going to face a difficult path,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.780
and some of them will lose their lives.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.510
But...

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.760
Are they all like this?

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:15.130
He jumped from up there to destroy 
the rock for his friend, Bucciarati.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.810
The path filled with hardships 
that they're about to walk

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.020
might have some meaning.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.270
Their hardships may end up 
being someone else's hope,

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.440
and might be the beginning 
to some greater meaning.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.340
I can't wish for their safety, but I 
pray that they are sleeping slaves.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:45.240
Sleeping slaves who will find 
some meaning once they awaken.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.520
Hey, hurry up!

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.120
Who's gonna heal Bucciarati's 
injuries if you don't hurry up?

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.060
Hey, Giorno!

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.640
Whoa, be careful, Trish.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.560
Thanks. Something suddenly 
appeared near my feet...

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.720
<c.colorcf78d6>Menacing</c>

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:19.870
Trish?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.330
Hey, Trish! Wh-Where'd you go, Trish?

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.590
Trish!

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.290
Hey, Giorno! Where the hell is Trish?!

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.380
Unbelievable... Trish is right there, Mista.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.580
Mista, Giorno, I'm right here.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.180
I didn't trip on this rock. 
It's what was in its shadow.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.050
Don't leave me behind.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.530
If you leave me behind,

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.270
I don't know how many days it'll 
take me to get to the Colosseum.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.370
Polnareff?!

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.690
Mr. Polnareff.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.250
You're still alive.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.480
But if all our minds were switched back,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.580
then your soul... and the turtle...

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.950
My body is dead.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.110
But the moment my soul got sucked out,

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.300
I was able to hang on to this turtle Stand.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:18.170
I can't leave this key, but I decided 
to live here for a while as a ghost.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.830
Well, it's great and all that you're okay,

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.390
but it's not over yet.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.550
We're going to the Colosseum 
to heal Bucciarati's wounds.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.270
Bucciarati? But his soul...

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.330
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.980
Oh, uh, sorry!

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.620
I was just thinking that you're right...

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.440
I think I might actually smell weird.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.620
So this is what I smell like?

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.350
Maybe I'll start using cologne...

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.250
Really?

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.690
I might've said something weird back then,

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.250
and maybe it's because I was panicked, 
but it doesn't bother me anymore.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.640
It almost even feels nostalgic.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.900
Really? Really?

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.340
Yes. But your fingers are still weird.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.530
What are you going to do with that?

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:30.500
Those who carry on the will of those who 
have passed must keep moving forward.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.920
I won't destroy this arrow.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.510
Keep the arrow inside the turtle.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.970
That will do, Giorno.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:48.790
That is the duty of those who have survived.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.820
Let's go

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.250
to the Colosseum.
