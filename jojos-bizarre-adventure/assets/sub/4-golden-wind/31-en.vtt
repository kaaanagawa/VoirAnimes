00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.640
By that time,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.290
my life...

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.180
had already ended.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.070
What?!

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.240
Above us! It's a helicopter!

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.490
Now they're cornered.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.850
And whoever Bucciarati and 
his men were meeting in Rome

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.330
will be dealt with by Green Tea.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.940
We have to take care of him before the 
mold's killing spree reaches the Colosseum!

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.010
Bucciarati,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.260
we can leave the guy beneath 
the ground to you, right?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.900
Go, Giorno!

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.410
Run, Mista!

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.760
All right! Let's go, Giorno!

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.980
Either way...

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.940
I'm taking care of you first...

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.390
Buccia... rati...

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.960
Episodio 31 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 2

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.360 line:20%
Bucciarati...

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.610 line:20%
How dare you ambush 
me back at that village...

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.130
I'm never falling for that again.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.180
How dare you do something so cleaver?!

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.580
No, wait...

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.060
Something so lever... no wait.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.900
Something so beaver... 
wait, or was it sever? Griever?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.440
You mean "clever"?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.500
I knew that, damn it! 
What are you, a language teacher?!

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.780
Y-Y-You jerk!

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.390
Oh, yeah. I need to record a video.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.250
It shouldn't take me too 
long to take care of you.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.710
Let's see...

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.960
Zipper Man!

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.510
H-He's... His power and speed...

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.350
I-If we're doing this one-on-one...

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.440
I don't even need to dive into the ground.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.860
Th-This ability...

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.740
It surpasses my Zipper Man...

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.400
both in speed and in power!

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.740
It's recoil. He's hitting 
the ground with his elbows.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.140
He's using the ground to give him elasticity

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.370
and increasing his power with that recoil.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.130
That's why he's fast!

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.360
Just like a boxer using the ring ropes 
to increase the power of his punches!

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.840
Sanctuary!

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.550
Take this! I'm out of time!

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.480
As I thought... There's 
no mold growing on you,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.080
even though you fell.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.510
Cioccolata's Green Tea will 
kill any living creature.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.290
What the hell's going on with your body?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.570
I mean, I guess I'll just have to pulverize

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.730
every last inch of your body 
until you can't move anymore...

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.720
w-w-with my Sanctuary!

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.600
Giorno Giovanna!

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.230
I heard that he's a newbie.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.530
He has the ability to give objects life.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.940
The bullets that missed...

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.700
The plant that has a hold on this 
helicopter must be his plant!

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.490
They're coming.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.530
How dare they underestimate me?

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.860
Your life force energy is 
no match for my Green Tea!

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.930
I'll rot all of these vines!

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.400
We're making this helicopter 
take off, Green Tea!

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.120
Spread your mold! 
We're breaking free of these vines!

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.070
Wh-What?!

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.940
I can't take off!

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.890
It's not moving at all!

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.270
Th-That's not good!

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.270
Okay, looks like it's grown to its full size.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.020
It's turned into a tree! 
Now that helicopter is secured.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.860
Mista! We're gonna climb up the 
tree to get to the helicopter!

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.460
There's no need, Giorno.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.700
It's well within range of my bullets.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.000
Yee-haw!

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.910
Go, Bullets!

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.460
Your target is his head!

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.140
What?!

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.320
Mista! The others are saying they can't 
find him anywhere in the helicopter!

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.010
Where is he?! What the hell?!

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.890
There's no way he can hide!

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.520
He can't get out, either!

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.150
Everyone, look for him! Find hi—

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.650
Number Two! Number Three!

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.720
N-Not good! Mista, hurry and 
call everyone back! Hurry—

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.390
Mista!

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.370
Number Two! Number Three! 
What happened to you guys?!

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.390
Th-That's impossible!

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.620
Why isn't he here?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.960
Each Stand should only have one ability!

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.030
His ability is to attack you 
with mold if you drop down to

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.260
a lower position than 
where you currently stand.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.430
That should be the only one!

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.480
Run, Number One...

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.260
Number Six! Seven!

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.020
We can't... defeat him...

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.990
Hurry up and get out of this helicopter!

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.360
He's—

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.850
...too dangerous!

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.870
Mista! Hurry up and call the Bullets back!

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.710
Undo your Stand ability!

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.880
I can't... I can't call them back...

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.940
He got the Bullets...

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.550
I-I underestimated him...

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.010
Mista!

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.330
Mista! Send me over there!

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.180
I'll go bring everyone back!

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.100
No, it's no use, Number Five.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.060
He's captured the Bullets 
that he's destroyed,

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.600
because he knows Mista won't be able 
to heal unless he gets his Stand back.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.840
I can't heal him.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.320
N-No...

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.800
And he's probably waiting for you to come.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.040
If he manages to destroy you, 
the final Bullet, Mista will die.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.630
He's someone we should've faced head-on!

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.940
Mista! I'm leaving Trish and Narancia here.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.510
Right...

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.230
Watch over them!

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.480
Mista! Mista...

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.850
Follow him... Number Five.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.430
Back Giorno up...

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.440
Take this bullet.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.370
Okay...

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.680
I feel a life force...

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.980
Why couldn't the Bullets find him?

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.790
I don't know his exact location, 
but he didn't leave the helicopter.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.250
In that case...

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.200
Golden Wind!

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.020
There's no effect?

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.150
What is he doing?

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.470
How is he hiding in there?

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.440
Medical supplies?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.220
He's a doctor?

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.910
The aftermath of the mold...

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.530
It's spreading to the Colosseum!

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.370
There's no more time! I have to defeat 
him immediately or all will be lost!

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.170
Th-The enemy's true identity is...

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.540
Come over here, Number One!

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.840
Don't go any closer, Giorno! It's a trap!

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.690
Useless!

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:42.820
What?!

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.070
Wh-What the hell is that thing?

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.200
Giorno, be caref—

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.680
Giorno!

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.510
Curiosity...

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.920
is the most important 
factor for mental growth.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.510
I've never been so grateful

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.090
as I am right now for all the experimentation 
that was conducted on me as a child.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.480
I made very close observations 
on what parts of the human body

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.310
I could sever and still keep that body alive...

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.870
Of course, I'm quite aware of which veins

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.060
need to be closed off to 
prevent bleeding out, too.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.390
And if I cover the parts that 
I sever with Green Tea's mold,

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.260
I can continue moving around,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.070
despite being in pieces, 
and hide wherever I need to.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.480
You can't fall, Giorno!

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.390
If you fall any further, 
the mold's going to attack you!

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.220
G-Giorno!

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.970
Secco

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.970
Sanctuary

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.140
Hurry and climb up!

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:14.720
There are times when you truly feel 
blessed, aren't there, Giorno Giovanna?

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.780
I believe there are two situations 
in which you feel blessed.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:24.950
The first is when despair changes 
to hope... You feel blessed.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.270
When your plant grabbed on to this helicopter,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.240
I actually panicked because 
I thought I was in danger.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.000
I was in utter despair.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.500
But I got through it.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.520
I was able to turn that despair around 
with my experience and mental strength.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.760
And that makes me feel 
truly blessed right now.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.640
Golden Wi—

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.460
Don't you dare climb up here!

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.270
Giorno!

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:59.060
Did you forget that both of 
my legs were still hiding?!

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.130
And the second situation that 
makes one feel blessed...

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.640
is when you look down upon 
someone who's in utter despair!

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.170
I've won!

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.090
By the time you hit the ground,

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.920
the mold will tear your body to shreds!

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.770
Giorno, take this!

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.980
Jump in there, Giorno!

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.940
Hurry and return to the helicopter!

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.030
Grazie, Number Five!

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.360
Pound him!

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.110
How pitiful.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.870
Nothing's changed, Giorno Giovanna.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.690
I, Cioccolata, am still going to win!

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.020
The branch you just grew is also living.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.550
Meaning if it drops even a few centimeters,

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.920
mold will attack that branch!

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.260
Jump onto the helicopter, Giorno!

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.760
Hurry!

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.770
Giorno!

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.940
I did it! Now, show me that expression!

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.490
Show me despair!

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.540
Show me, as clear as can be,

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.240
the moment you lose all hope and die!

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.230
Show me your despair as 
you fall to your death!

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.050
Bene.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.700
The angle I calculated toward the 
helicopter's propellers was perfect.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.190
Because it was alive, the branch 
was destroyed by the mold.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.260
However,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.190
the part of the branch that fell 
from its root no longer holds life.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.640
It's just a piece of wood.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.480
Because you destroyed it, 
the branch returned to being a bullet.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.570
By the way, all that bullshit about being 
blessed that you were yapping about...

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:08.700
I can't say I feel blessed at all, 
even though I'm looking at you.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.740
Because I've been winning 
against you from the start.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.790
You did it! I can't believe it, Giorno!

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.540
That was close!

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.390
You defeated him before the 
mold got to the Colosseum!

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.090
Please take care of Mista's 
wounds, too, Giorno!

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:35.220
That was close! Now the rest of 
the Bullets will be back, too.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.100
Could you move just a little 
to the right, Number Five?

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.060
Huh?

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.700
I might just be worrying too much, 
but... What was his name? Cioccolata?

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.620
He might actually be...

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.680
You're just pretending 
to be dead, aren't you?!

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.330
And you're thinking.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.450
Giorno?

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:05.210
If you can move your body just a few 
centimeters before I climb up there,

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.680
you can slip beneath the trench and escape.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.200
You'll be able to activate the mold again,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.930
and you'll win. That's what you're thinking.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.850
To be honest, I have a hole 
in my right lung right now.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.400
My subclavian vein has been 
severed, and four of my ribs,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.240
my right humerus, and my right 
hand bones have been shattered.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.790
I'm honestly not sure how 
fast I can get up there.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.540
But my Stand is Golden Wind.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.050
It's a power type with a range of two meters.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.770
If I just take a moment, 
I'll be able to end you.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.800
H-He's dead! You shot him through the head!

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.910
Good point.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.900
If you continue to stay still, 
I'll incapacitate you,

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.810
but I promise you I won't do anything else.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.670
I'm giving you a choice.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.500
So, what are you going to do?

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.990
I'm going to start climbing now.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.750
Stay away from me! 
Look behind you, you moron!

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.090
I've taken Mista and the turtle hostage!

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.220
You dumbass! While you were busy talking,

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.600
you apparently didn't notice 
that I snuck my right arm

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.930
up from under the tree's shadow!

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.930
I'm going to chop off Mista's neck now!

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:46.030
If you come after me, 
you won't be able to treat Mista!

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.860
Mista!

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.210
I'm the winner, after all!

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.790
Take this!

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.120
It's true.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.880
I kept talking because I 
wanted to buy some time.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.600
The time I needed to make 
the bullet that went through

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.830
your head earlier evolve 
and return to your wound.

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:13.090
The piece that remained in your head lured 
the bullet and returned to being a stag beetle.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.910
When I aimed for the propellers,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.830
I imbued it with Golden Wind's life force...

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.100
so that I could finish you for good,

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.690
whether you were dead or alive.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:34.450
B-But you said... th-that if I stayed 
still.... y-you wouldn't do anything...

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.320
Oh, please.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.030
Did you really think you'd be that lucky?

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.330
A piece of shit like you?

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.390
Y... You're so mean!

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.010
Giorno!

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.130
Mista's waking up!

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.300
Mista! Mista!

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.880
What's that doing there?

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.290
Is that Cioccolata's... Don't tell me...

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.230
Was he actually on the 
phone during the battle?

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.190
But with who? What was he telling them?

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.670
Why, though? Cioccolata...

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.740
Why aren't you answering your phone?

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.090
But I'm calling you...

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.710
Um, it's flashing...

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.680
What's this mean again? Um...

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.200
O-Oh, right!

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.440
It does this when I have voicemails, I think!

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.820
How many do I have? Two! 
When did he call?

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.180
Was it when I was chasing Bucciarati?

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.350
It's me, Secco.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.600
I-It's Cioccolata!

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.190
I finished off the gunslinger Mista.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.170
Yes!

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.150
Now it looks like the newbie, Giorno Giovanna, 
is trying to climb up to the helicopter.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.930
But it doesn't matter. I win.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.120
You concentrate on Bucciarati.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.830
I'll scratch your back when you get back.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.010
I'm sure you want some sugar 
cubes, too, don't you?

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.340
I'll throw you some.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.560
You deserve a treat.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.010
How many would you like?

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.050
Um... Um...

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.380
Two?

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:06.000
No! I want more! More! Mooooooore!

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.640
I'm only kidding. I'll throw you five.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.140
I'll throw five at once.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.230
Think you can catch them all with 
your mouth? No using your hands.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.650
Listen well, Secco.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.570
We are invincible.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.770
The strong have the right 
to rule over the weak.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:32.750
No, I should say that the strong 
have a duty to rule over others.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.340
Even if that includes the boss.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:42.050
I plan to surpass the boss 
during this battle, as well.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.360
You're going to do this, too, Secco.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.820
You are strong.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.690
Giorno's here. I need to hang up.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:49.920
But that's why...

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.010
I love you.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:55.900
Let's go.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.040
This should be far enough. 
I should've lost that underground guy...
