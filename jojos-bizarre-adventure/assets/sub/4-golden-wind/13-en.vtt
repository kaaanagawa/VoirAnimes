00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.270
What are you looking for here?

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.460
I have no intention of telling you.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.560
I see.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.040
Very well. There are still two others.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.410
I just need the last one 
standing to tell me.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.740
You're finished. Take this!

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.580
Footsteps... Someone outside 
the mirror is running.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.380
Does that mean your friends decided to

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.670
abandon you so that they 
could go get something?!

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.870
They're heading toward the dog mosaic.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.390
That settles it.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.820
Fugo, you're basically done for already.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.190
I'm going to go get whatever 
that thing is first!

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.530
W-Wait, you bastard!

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.170
Abbacchio... Giorno...

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.250
Where is it? Where is this key?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.450
There it is. That must be it.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.840
A mirror?

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130
Has that always been there?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.770
What is that? A key?

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.520
What?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.750
I see.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.650
I guess I just have to 
take that key from you.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.650
That's... It couldn't be...

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.100
Now that you've seen me,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.020
you're finished, too!

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.710
Episodio 13  Mirror Man and Purple Smoke

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.920 line:20%
Sh-Shit!

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.730
Damn it...

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.840
I'm starting to understand 
the enemy's ability.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.400
So he's inside the mirror...

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.060
Assuming that's even possible.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.250
Fugo must've been dragged into 
the mirror and disappeared,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.360
separating him from his Stand.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.070
Regardless, right now, 
I need to grab that key!

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.740
Shattering the mirror actually 
worked in my favor, Abbacchio.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.920
Anything reflected becomes 
an entrance to this world.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.710
Now that it's in shards, I have even 
more entrances to grab you from!

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.210
And I'll give you, and only you, 
permission to come into the mirror!

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.340
There! I've brought you in.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.600
I'll be taking that key, too!

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.890
Wh-What?!

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.400
O-Only a Stand can grab the 
neck of another Stand!

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.390
There's no way you could grab Mirror Man's neck
when I'm the one who dragged you in here!

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.680
Shattering the mirror didn't 
actually work in your favor!

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.280
It just means the space you can look 
outside from became smaller!

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.000
You couldn't see who you 
dragged in here, could you?

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.760
You gave permission...

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.400
for just me to enter?!

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.040
Th-That's...

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.510
Grazie! I'll happily get dragged in!

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.220
Moody Jazz!

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.560
Shit! That's a Stand!

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.440
Inside the mirror...

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.220
So it's a world where everything's reversed.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.850
Of course we couldn't know.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.720
There's no way we'd comprehend this 
ability until we were actually attacked.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.360
Fugo must be in here, too.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.040
So, how do we get out of here?

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.120
If I have to kill you to get 
out of here, that's fine.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.630
That's why I sent Moody Jazz in there!

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.260
The ability to transform into others...

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.260
Well, shit. You got me.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.040
Looks like your Stand 
itself isn't that strong.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.900
So, what? Can it only 
defeat powerless humans?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.370
Well, what are you waiting for? 
Get on your feet and come at me!

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.970
Listen up... Like I said at the start, 
you're already done for.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.410
I must say, I was a little surprised 
when it was your Stand that came in,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.040
but that doesn't change a thing!

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.510
The reason I'm not standing is 
so that I can crouch down.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.630
I'm crouching because I need to!

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.880
Well, yeah.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.390
You're bent over to make it easier to kick you.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.680
I was crouching so I could pick 
up this shard of the mirror!

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.360
Hey, why are you so surprised?

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.090
Is it because I have this arm?

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.610
I'm sure you're very familiar with this arm!

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.500
I told you! Anything that 
reflects becomes an entrance!

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.360
If I can get your reflection 
with a different shard,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.330
that becomes another entrance!

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.910
Do you get it now?

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.150
It's your arm that I dragged in here!

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.960
To make sure you can't move about, 
I'll only allow half of your body to come in.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.990
As for your Stand, 
I permit half of it to get out!

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.680
Now your Stand won't be able to move!

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.140
The key's mine!

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.510
Damn it. He's going to take the key.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.850
That doesn't just mean 
we failed the mission.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.360
It also means that Giorno 
will end up being correct!

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.850
And I humbly decline!

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.930
We're going to solve this mystery, 
save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.750
That's the best way to 
ensure we're all safe!

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.960
Damn it... My pride's not 
going to stand for that!

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.380
I'm not letting him have that key!

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.440
I swear on my pride and my dignity 
that I, Leone Abbacchio,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.590
will protect this key!

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.880
It's true. Because Mirror Man uses 
all its energy to drag someone in,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.390
it doesn't have much destructive power. 
That is indeed one of its traits!

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:53.030
But if I do this to you, we don't exactly 
need strength to kill you off instantly!

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.200
If we just stab this in with the strength 
of a four-year-old child, it's pretty easy.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.040
I win! Thanks for telling 
me where the key i—

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.890
Something wrong? Go on, finish me off!

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.690
What the hell are you doing, Abbacchio?!

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.720
How dare you hide it from me?!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.820
Even if you can move with your 
current body, it won't be much!

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.980
I'll be able to tell immediately! Get it?!

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.190
Hide?

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.970
What are you talking about?

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.240
What exactly did I hide, and where?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.830
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.360
Let me see that hand!

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.510
Seriously, what the hell are 
you doing, you bastard?!

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.090
Did you lose something?

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.800
Did you find what you 
were looking for? Well?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.540
Why did he do that to his own hand?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.980
Wait... If he chopped off his own hand,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.370
his Stand's hand outside the mirror is...

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.520
It can't be...

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.860
Its hand is gone!

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.860
Don't tell me...

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.610
I-It has the key!

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.160
And it's going back!

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:23.080
If I remember correctly, a newbie named 
Giorno is just around the corner!

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.850
He chopped off that hand 
to give him the key?!

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.790
You should've sliced open my 
throat when you had the chance.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.710
If you had, my Stand's hand 
would've stopped moving.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.260
Whoops, so close. But you're a bit too late.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.470
That was the sound of the key 
falling to the ground.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.850
The key is going to get picked up!

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.800
That's some bullshit you pulled off!

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.070
But I'm not letting that 
brat named Giorno get away!

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.450
I'll drag him in here, too!

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.620
Do you understand now, Giorno, you shithead?!

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.700
All that matters is that 
one of us returns safely.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.210
If you return safely with the key...

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.140
The most important thing 
is to fulfill the mission.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.920
Hey, Abbacchio.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.930
Can you even imagine what's 
going on over here?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.430
You sure have a loyal companion.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.970
After you worked so hard 
to deliver the key...

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.590
What do you think's going on over here?

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.740
Not a damn thing!

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.260
That brat's not running away at all!

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.610
It looks like he doesn't 
have a clue what's going on.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.110
Giorno! Get the hell out of here!

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.880
Take the key and run!

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.760
He won't hear you when you're 
screaming inside this mirror!

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.100
Sh-Shit...

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.100
Now then, there are two 
possible actions I could take.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.640
First is disposing of Giorno 
after I get the key.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.820
Second is slitting Giorno's throat first, 
then safely retrieving the key.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.780
Let's see...

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.740
I guess I'll slit Giorno's throat first!

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.960
He's noticed me.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.420
I'll allow only Giorno to enter!

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.510
I've dragged him in!

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.930
Slice open his throat, Mirror Man!

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.430
Wh-Wh-What?!

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.600
H-He's... That's impossible!

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.820
It's the virus! G-Giorno...

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.470
He's been infected by Fugo's Purple Smoke!

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.450
You're not getting the key!

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.750
And Fugo, Abbacchio, and I... 
will safely return to the others!

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.990
Pannacotta Fugo

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.990
Purple Smoke

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.000
Giorno Giovanna... That brat 
doesn't understand anything!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.170
You're going to die if you infect 
yourself with Purple Smoke's virus!

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.270
My heart died along with him back then.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.430
I don't feel anything anymore.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.600
I don't feel a damn thing, 
even though I've lost my hand...

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.730
The only time I can feel at ease

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.810
is when I'm following the orders 
of something great and absolute.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:45.130
Because then, all I need to do is be a 
soldier who doesn't have to think for himself.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.410
Meaning...

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.430
Getting the key and protecting 
the boss's daughter...

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.080
Carrying out this mission is 
the most important thing.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.540
And yet Giorno... That stupid brat...

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.140
He chose to put himself in danger to

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.220
save Fugo and me, rather than 
taking the key back safely!

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.400
Damn you, you stupid brat!

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.340
How dare you come in here infected?!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.390
Are you out of your damn mind?!

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.110
Now I'm infected, damn it!

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.470
Ah, yes. You seem to be experiencing 
the same symptoms as me.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.700
Apparently Purple Smoke's virus infects 
your whole body within thirty seconds.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.660
It's over now.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.180
It was over as soon as you dragged me in.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.180
Shards of the mirror that 
Purple Smoke shattered...

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.740
Did Giorno put them back together?

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.490
When the enemy chased after Abbacchio, 
he took some shards with him.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.550
Giorno must've realized that!

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.760
He then figured out the 
enemy's ability from that,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.120
then infected himself with the virus and

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.350
allowed himself to be 
dragged into the mirror!

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.270
Because there's no other 
way to defeat this enemy!

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.290
Damn it! Of all the underhanded...

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.730
But don't underestimate me.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.400
It's not too late yet.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.660
I need more resolve, 
but it's not too late yet!

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:17.170
Mirror Man! Allow only me 
to leave this mirror!

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.490
But don't allow the virus!

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.550
The part of me that's infected 
is not allowed to leave!

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.730
That's not good!

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.640
If he gets outside, the virus 
will be separated from him!

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.940
Abbacchio lopped off his 
own hand to get the key.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.860
So, I, Illuso, c-can do the same thing!

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.570
This is nothing!

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.660
Giorno! Grab him!

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.220
He got away...

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.910
Giorno... After you...

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.480
risked your own life to come in here...

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.260
So... he stepped outside the mirror.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.810
Th-That was really close, but, ha!

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.210
My resolve... My resolve wins in the end!

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.150
This is nothing!

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.110
I figured he'd go outside.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:29.250
That's for the best, though. 
He's going down, no matter what.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.950
Now that he's stepped outside, 
there's a chance I might survive!

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.660
Fugo! Now that he's outside, 
Purple Smoke can follow him!

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.300
Finish him off!

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.270
I can't, Giorno.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.090
I can't tell where he is from inside here.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.430
I have no way to attack him!

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.720
I know where he is.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.850
Golden Wind, who's outside, 
turned that brick into a snake.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.880
That's why it's moving.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.990
Snakes can tell where humans are 
by sensing their body temperature.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.340
Got him!

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.110
What?!

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:43.720
A-After I built up the resolve to chop 
off my own arm and came out here...

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.690
This... This can't...

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:53.360
S-Stop it! Stop! Damn it!

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.580
I'm going to be infected! 
I-If that virus capsule bursts...

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.030
I-It looks like luck hasn't 
completely abandoned me!

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:10.000
If Mirror Man can stop this thing's 
punch even for a moment...

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.600
If I can just block it once...

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.720
Let him have it, Purple Smoke!

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.720
Mirror Man! Use everything you have left!

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.270
I...

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.380
I did it...

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.690
I stopped it! 
Now I just need to take this arm...

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.840
into the mirror!

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.570
Huh?

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.140
What?!

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.990
What?!

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.830
B-But I blocked its punch...

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:51.170
After I built up the resolve... 
to leave the mirror!

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.600
W-We did it! We're outside the mirror!

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.700
We defeated him, so his ability disappeared!

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.340
B-But Giorno, Purple Smoke's virus has 
already spread throughout your body.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.120
Once you've been infected, 
even I can't do anything about it.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.580
Yes, Fugo, and this is how it should be.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.310
This...

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.270
Him leaving the mirror 
worked out for the best.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.410
Once I was infected and he 
dragged me into the mirror,

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.480
his defeat was inevitable.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:00.520
But I was glad when he refused to 
admit defeat and left the mirror.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.490
Since the mirror world 
was undone before I died,

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.210
I was able to encounter this snake.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.050
Th-That snake...

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.430
It's alive, even though it's 
surrounded by Purple Smoke's virus!

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.630
I created this snake from the brick where 
Purple Smoke's capsule was broken.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:25.010
Since it was born from a place that was 
covered with the virus, it won't get sick.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.100
Do you know what that means?

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.850
That snake has immunity!

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.730
And if we take blood or cells 
from something with immunity...

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.340
We can create a serum that'll 
stop the virus from spreading!

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.650
Golden Wind!

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.720
Extract the serum from this 
snake and inject it into me!

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.550
Giorno Giovanna...

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.760
I thought he was some newbie 
that I just couldn't figure out,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.230
but he comes up with the most insane 
ideas and pulls them off...

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.170
And there's something 
I can trust behind that.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.330
It's not something that's spoken.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.490
He has true loyalty within him!

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.990
Just like Bucciarati did back then!

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:31.290
Giorno! You have my utmost 
respect after risking your life!

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.700
No, Fugo...

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.970
I'm not the one who risked my life here.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.050
I just made a prediction 
and followed through.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.640
The one who truly risked his 
life here... was Abbacchio.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.310
His hand is in grave condition right now.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:55.730
He's the one who risked his 
life to protect the key...

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.320
And if he hadn't carried 
the key all the way here,

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.970
we couldn't have defeated the enemy.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.930
Please don't worry about me... 
and go tend to his wounds...

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:07.940
Giorno!

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.630
Are you okay, Giorno?!

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.790
Damn it, Giorno...

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.480
I was going...

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.800
to beat the shit out of you...

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.990
But with my hand like this, I guess I can't.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.620
I'll just have to do it later...

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.280
Thus, they got the key 
they were ordered to retrieve!

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.480
