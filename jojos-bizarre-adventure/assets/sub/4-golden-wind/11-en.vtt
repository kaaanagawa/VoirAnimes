00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.570
I think it might be worth it to shoot 
the shit out of that fatty there!

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.310
Yes!

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.300
Th-That was close...

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.320
If I hadn't returned to my normal 
size, I would've been done for!

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.060
If time hadn't passed to the 
point of you becoming so small

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.190
that your Stand power 
was rendered useless...

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.620
I would've been a goner!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.010
I-I didn't get him!

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.920
D-Damn it.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.780
If I'm getting smaller and smaller,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.360
does that mean Li'l Bomber's 
power got smaller, too?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.680
That bastard's on the move!

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.430
Come back, Li'l Bomber!

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.480
Th-This really pisses me off,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.230
but I need to hide somewhere.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.420
The dude's desperate.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.790
If he finds me, he'll do everything 
he can to get me to tell him

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.570
where the boss's daughter is.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.860
I-It's so far!

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.290
The sidewalk's so damn wide!

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.580
Move! You're in my way, damn it!

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.290
Damn it...

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.810
Now I've got you.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.980
Well, shit...

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.650
You've caused me so much trouble.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.150
Once you've been hit with Tiny Feet's 
ability, you can never get away.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.700
Now, you're going to tell me

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.290
where Bucciarati and his guys 
are hiding the boss's daughter.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.660
K-Kill me!

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.780
Damn it, just kill me already!

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.420
Do you really think I want to live so badly

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.990
that I'd tell you where 
my friends are? Huh?!

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.530
Narancia Ghirga was born 
in 1984 and is a Leo.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.580
When he was ten...

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.280
N-Narancia...

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.610
I'm right here, Mom.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.130
Mom...

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.260
Hey, Dad...

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.960
Mom's eye disease...

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.510
You shithead...

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.620
That was the beginning of the path 
that led Narancia to where he is now.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.690
Episodio 11  Narancia's Li'l Bomber

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.760 line:20%
Hey, I need to ask for directions.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.880 line:20%
How many minutes would it 
take to walk to this place?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.300
Narancia rebelled against his father.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.160 line:20%
Minutes? That'd take you hours.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.530
He'd sleep over at his 
delinquent friends' houses,

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.690
and get by daily by eating the 
food he had stolen that day.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.690
It all went as planned!

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.330
It's all because you told 
us about that shop, Bro.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.810
You sure you don't need to go to school?

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.050
You actually come from a decent home.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.260
Like I give a shit about that home.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.970
The most important thing in 
this world is friendship!

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.630
Yeah.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.640
You should dye your hair blonde like mine.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.020
Then the chicks would be all over you.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.630
Yeah!

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.470
What? Seriously?

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.270
What do you think?

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.570
You look so dumb!

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.800
Hey, where's Bro?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.120
Who knows? I haven't seen him in a few days.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.590
Huh...

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.620
But the next day...

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.550
You bastards!

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.120 line:20%
Put both hands on the wall!

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.680 line:20%
You little shit! 
You're going to juvenile hall!

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.680
What the hell are you talking 
about?! Me, a robber?!

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.460
Of course I'm no—

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.670
Quit lyin'! We have a witness!

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.460
Wha—

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.300
That's him! That blonde brat is the suspect!

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.380
N-No, I'm not!

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.820
I'm sure of it! He beat me 
up and took my money!

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.230
Quit lyin', you old hag! 
I didn't do anything!

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.850
Just admit to your crimes, you little shit!

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.690
Hey! That's going too far!

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.420
You saw him, Counselor.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.620
He was about to hit her again!

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.500
A robber...

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.240
A blonde brat...

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.580
Don't tell me...

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.460
No, that's not possible!

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.760
Stop thinking up shit like that, damn it!

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.980
A year later, when Narancia left 
juvenile hall, his eye was afflicted.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.190
After the officer hit his eye,

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.840
the eye wound up infected 
and never got better.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.960
When he returned to town, 
strange rumors were going around.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.480
Look at that.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.090
I heard his mom died from 
an eye disease, too.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.210
How do they know that?

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.390
I only ever told Bro that...

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.210
Wow, they already let you out?

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.800
I don't want to get infected.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.010
Stay the hell away from me.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.840
It couldn't be... But Bro is...

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.180
He felt trapped, so he used me as a scapegoat...

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.400
The one most afraid of these rumors 
concerning the eye disease

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.650
was Narancia himself.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.090
This is fate...

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.860
Soon... just like Mom...

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.070
I'm going to die from this eye disease!

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.520
That's what he believed. 
He had nowhere to go.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.130
He was all alone.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.810
Narancia had given up on 
life at the age of fifteen.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.190
How awful. He's just a child.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.060
It's a pity, but we shouldn't get involved.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.490
The boy brought Narancia into a restaurant,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.880
then told his friend at the 
table and the shop's host...

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.280
I'd like to feed him some spaghetti!

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.640
You don't mind, do you?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.280
His friend at the table 
didn't ask any questions,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.990
nor did he give him a look of disgust.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.950
He just set the plate of spaghetti 
he'd ordered for himself

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.670
in front of the filthy child.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.500
He then had the kid receive 
the treatment he needed.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.570
Three weeks later...

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.240
Why are you doing all this for me?

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.590
There's no reason.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.460
If you want, you can stay at my house.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.350
But kids like you should go 
back home to their parents.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.810
Also, go to school. Got it?

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.650
U-Um, are you in a gang?

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.250
I don't want to go back home.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.620
Please let me work for you!

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.700
Don't be so naïve, you little shit!

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.250
If you say that again, I'll punch you!

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.170
As instructed, Narancia went back home 
and even started going back to school.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.870
But he could never trust his father again.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.270
Why did he get so serious about scolding me?

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.310
There's nothing special about me.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.870
But...

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.550
That rage didn't come from hate or disgust,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.740
and it didn't feel like it 
was meant to insult me.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.700
It was totally different from when 
my dad or those cops got mad at me.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.710
When I think about how he 
acted, I feel confident.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.670
Real men...

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.200
should work for guys like him!

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.940
Six months later, Narancia went to see

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.090
one of the capos of the organization, 
Polpo, without Bucciarati knowing...

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.080
and he passed the test.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.100
Narancia, if you're going to 
tell me where that girl is,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.280
now is probably the best time to do it.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.870
The girl you're trying to kidnap doesn't 
belong to a gang or anything like that!

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.450
She's just an ordinary girl!

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.620
Bucciarati hates shit like that, 
even if it's an order!

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.700
No decent person would like that!

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.200
We said we were going to protect her,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.850
so we're going to protect 
her, no matter what!

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.770
Would you quit with your worthless drivel?

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.840
Well, shit...

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.750
All this crap about your friends 
and protecting this chick...

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.810
That's not what we're talking about here.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.450
I'm talking about the fact 
that if we defeat the boss,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.020
we'll have a drug route 
worth hundreds of billions.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.730
Y-You bastard!

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.940
Hundreds of billions!

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.450
That's an amount worth a 
few people dying over!

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.610
It's going to be ours! 
There's no turning back now!

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.540
Since she's the boss's daughter, 
she's bound to have a Stand ability!

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.960
The boss doesn't want 
people finding that out!

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.800
We'll definitely be able to figure out who 
the boss is through his daughter's ability!

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.510
His daughter is a hint for defeating the boss,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.970
whose identity we don't even know!

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.430
What? That girl's a Stand user?

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.680
Did you know...

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.480
In South America, there's a spider 
called the southern black widow.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.940
Apparently its venom can even kill humans.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.590
This spider isn't deadly.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.780
I actually caught it in the sewers 
earlier. It's completely harmless.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.410
But...

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.710
Even a normal spider's bite is venomous.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.680 line:20%
Y-You aren't gonna...

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:32.960
More than venomous enough to paralyze 
tiny little insects and eat them!

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.000
Li'l Bomber!

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.630
Whoa, there!

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.340
I told you, your Stand is powerless now!

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.780
This bottle is gonna be the ring, Narancia!

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.270
Y-You bastard! Hey!

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.240
It's looking at you! 
It's looking right at you!

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.410
It's watching you carefully 
with all eight of its eyes!

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.330
Open up! Open the bottle!

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.700
Damn it!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:14.080
Listen carefully. Even if it bites 
you, you won't die instantly.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.880
First, its venom will paralyze your body, 
so you'll no longer be able to move.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.680
But once you can't move and it 
traps you, you're in real danger.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:28.120
Then it'll start injecting you with even 
more venom and digestive juices.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:34.860
Those digestive juices will slowly melt your 
insides to the consistency of a milkshake

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.110
so it can suck you right up.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.790
And you're going to be 
conscious the whole time.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.120
If you finally feel like talking, you can 
still talk while you're being eaten.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.030
But you're probably better 
off telling me right now

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.960
where the boss's daughter is.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.290
I really don't want to see a person 
end up melted and eaten by a spider.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.590
I-It's fast!

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.130
You bastard!

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.550
A shard of glass?!

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.010
He somehow got it and kept it on him?!

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.470
W-Webbing?

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.390
When did...

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.610
It bit him!

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.100
You can't move anymore because 
your muscles are spasming.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.850
Just hurry up and tell me.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.390
This is your last chance 
if you don't wanna die.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.790
Damn it... Like hell I'm gonna tell you!

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.440 line:20%
Damn it!

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.760
Looks like it's injecting its 
digestive juices into you now.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.510
It's gonna melt you...

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.010
Huh?

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.800
What's that?

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.360
You dropped this when you took that shard

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.520
of glass out of your pocket, 
so I picked it up...

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.940
Maybe... I don't need 
you to tell me anymore.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.100
This is a map of this city.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.610
It's a driving map. Not only that...

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.380
There are things marked on here with pencil,

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.320
so you wouldn't get lost!

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.840
How stupid are you?!

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.540
If I follow these directions in reverse, 
I can see where you came from!

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.890
A vineyard!

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.790
You came from a vineyard that's 
about twenty kilometers southeast!

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.250
Grazie, Narancia!

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.720
Now you can get eaten or have that 
thing lay eggs in you or whatever,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.930
you moron!

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.930
Tiny Feet

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.930
Formaggio

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.130
Twenty kilometers southeast!

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.560
The boss's daughter Trish
is somewhere in that area!

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.730
I did it! You don't have to talk anymore!

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.870
My Li'l Bomber has the ability to 
detect and pursue carbon dioxide.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:02.680
But carbon dioxide doesn't just 
come from living creatures.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.590
It's also produced by burning things.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.920
I just remembered...

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.510
When I was chasing you with Li'l Bomber,

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.970
I also shot at the car.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.890
I'm pretty sure I shot the gasoline tank...

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.670
But I can't really tell 
where the hole is from here.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.440
Still,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.690
I was thinking that since the bullet 
hole is technically burning, it'll have

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.080
carbon dioxide coming from it,
so I can find it using Li'l Bomber.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.360
So I shot at it.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.790
See, it wasn't the spider 
I was shooting at earlier.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.610
But it's a small hole,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.810
so it took a while for the fire to actually 
start, and I was getting nervous!

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.840
What?!

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.310
Damn it!

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:07.970 line:20%
All the shopping bags got burned to a crisp!

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.230
Narancia's Height: 5.5cm -&gt; 170.5cm (His normal height)

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:13.800
But it feels great to be back at a 
size where a spider bite won't matter.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.950
How dare you?!

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.500
I'm gonna murder all of your friends!

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.020
Hideout... Blergh!

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.330
Vineyard... Blah!

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.670
Just you wait, Narancia!

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.640
Tiny Feet!

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.100
Wh-What?!

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.930
He put out the fire with the blood 
that squirted out of his wrist?!

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.610
Damn it! This isn't good!

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.690
Letting him get away now is not good at all!

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.030
I have to find him using Li'l Bomber's ability!

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.330
Sh-Shit!

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.920
Th-The radar...

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.810
These flames...

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.580 line:20%
Y-You bastard! Where are you?!

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.420
Is this lucky or unlucky?

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.080
Narancia, because you set the car on fire,

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:12.340
you can't track me because of all the 
carbon dioxide coming from the flames!

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.030
I guess if this comes down 
to winning or losing, I've won!

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.180 line:20%
You're not getting away!

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.380
I know where the boss's daughter is.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.770
Now I just need to get out of 
here and let my buddies know.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.730
We'll murder you all!

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.510
Assassinations are our specialty!

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.500
Assassinations?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.020
I'll make sure I pay you back for this soon!

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.120
You won't be able to find me anymore!

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.860
I win!

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.230
<c.colorce714c>Boooooom</c>

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.170
If I can't track your breathing...

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.790
If the flames are too big...

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.010
I'll just make them bigger!

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.620
If I set the whole damn street on fire,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.370
you'll burn up and die because you're so tiny!

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.700
You're not getting away, Formaggio!

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.700
Are you mad, you bastard?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.410
You actually set the whole street on fire!

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.370
Are you sane? You bastard!

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.000
Huh?!

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.590
I guess I don't need to set 
the whole city on fire now.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.540
When I asked if you were sane,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:40.510
what you basically did was tell me that you 
want me to kill you as soon as possible.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.430
Thanks to the flames, I was 
able to get this close to you.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:46.810
Did you forget?

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:51.700
At this distance, 
my Stand is faster than yours!

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.670
It might be.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.070
Bring it, Narancia...

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.480
Tiny Feet!

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.790
Well, shit...

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:24.140
I guess your little shopping trip wasn't 
as easy as you thought it'd be,

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.800
was it, Narancia?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.130
Now things are going to get more difficult...

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.090
for you bastards!

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.110
"Go shopping," they tell me...

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.120
Mission... incomplete.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.000
Both the money and the stuff I bought...

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.880
went up in flames...

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.210
Narancia, repeat it one more time.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.130
I told you, the shopping—

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.460
Not that!

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.250
You just said the enemy 
found out where we're hiding.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.640
But I took care of him right after—

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.770
That's not the issue here!

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.920
Bucciarati, we should get 
the hell out of here.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.040
After I warned you so many times...

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.500
You fool!

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.270
I think Narancia did a great 
job stopping the enemy.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.710
I think he did everything he should've done.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:26.440
And now that the Hitman Team knows 
about us, if he's a reasonable boss,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.540
he should give us a method of escape.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.110
I don't think we should leave 
until we hear from the boss.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.840
Well, aren't you clever?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.800
Do you think you're an advisor now?

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.750
And how do you know that the 
boss will contact us soon?

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.720
No one cares about your damn hunches!

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.550
Bucciarati!

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.060
I think we got a message from the boss!

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.470
Message for Bucciarati

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.940
This is how the boss always 
sends his orders to the capos.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.900
This is the first time 
Bucciarati's received one!

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.110
I'll check out the message.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:13.780
"Head to the Pompeii Archaeological Park. 
I've hidden a key near the dog mosaic."

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.920
Look into that immediately!

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.460
"That key is for a vehicle that'll 
bring my daughter safely to me."

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.390
Vehicle? What does he mean by a safe vehicle?

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.240
A helicopter!

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.750
That must be a key to a helicopter!

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.690
We can go anywhere in a helicopter 
without anyone following us!

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.260
It's a bit less than fifteen kilometers 
from here to Pompeii.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.210
An hour should be plenty of time 
to get over there and get the key.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.970
Fugo! Abbacchio! Giorno!

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.780
You three head to Pompeii and get that key!

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.540
Mista, Narancia, and I will remain here 
and protect Trish from the Hitman Team.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.750
Retrieve the key, and if 
it seems safe, contact us.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.670
Then we'll take Trish and 
head to over to that vehicle.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:04.730
I'm counting on you.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.980
Episodio 12
The Second Mission from the Boss
