WEBVTT

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.900
Let me see the key we obtained again.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.180
Go to the drinking fountain with a turtle

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.780
and use this key.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.900
Don't tell me he...

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.570
The Thankful Death!

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.450
Just the driver... It doesn't look 
like anyone else is in here.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.680
There it is!

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.000
Something took the bait!

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.450
Wh-What the hell is this needle-like thing?!

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.460
A d-different Stand than 
the one that's aging us?

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.270
Bro, where did you go?!

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.150
Episodio 15  The Thankful Death Part 1

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.060
Why aren't you here?!

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.390
Bucciarati and his crew were on this train!

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.300
But I wonder who I hooked. 
It's definitely not Trish.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.070
The strength pulling on 
this rod belongs to a man.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.360
The needle dug into his left hand.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.620
He weighs 68 kilograms!

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.400
I'll reel you right in!

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.090
Whoa, hang on a second... 
Th-This needle's sinking in deeper!

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.380
It's so fast!

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.760
It's moving up my arm at incredible speed!

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.520
Th-This line...

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.460
This must be Mista!

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.030
The thing that tried to cut 
the line was a bullet!

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.280
The gunslinger is Guido Mista!

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.940
You can't cut my Fisher Man's line!

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.540
I wonder where the impact that 
hit the line will end up going?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.170
I'm gonna reel you right in!

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.440
I need to get this line out or I'm finished!

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.720
Damn it! It's going to make 
its way up to my brain!

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.800
Sh-Shit!

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.230
Six Bullets! Grab this hook and stop it!

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.720
I-It's no use! We're being pulled!

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.650
We can't stop it with our power!

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.360
Sh-Shit... I'm just going 
to have to look for it.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.540
I'm just gonna have to find it!

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.580
Find it!

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.870
Find it!

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.890
We need to find it, no matter what!

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.910
Find it!

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.060
What was that?

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.420
Was that Mista's pistol?

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.250
Who the hell are you even shooting at?

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.470
What if you hit one of the other passengers?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.150
Or did you shoot in hopes 
that you'd actually hit me?

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.020
It's no use!

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.610
The hook is about to travel 
deep into your ear!

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.660
We have to aim lower or the ice 
won't get blown out of the glass!

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.710
A bit lower! Aim a bit lower!

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.590
Over here! Blast right into it!

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.800
We found the ice!

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.880
Shatter it, boys!

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.760
What do you think you're doing?!

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.600
I knew that bastard would 
be cooling himself, too,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.690
to the point that he'd lose his mind!

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.200
Damn it!

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.780
How could you?! The ice...

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.700
He's all pale and screaming.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.700
My ice!

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.930
Could this guy be...

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.710
It's him!

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.330
He's the guy with the line and hook!

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.790
That fishing-rod-looking thing is his Stand!

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.920
R-Run for it!

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.590
Ice! I need to find some ice, 
or I'm going to die of old age, too!

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.470
H-Help me...

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.170
O-Out of my way, gramps!

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.060
Get your zombie hands off of—

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.540
My body feels so heavy, 
I don't want to move...

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.030
I ordered the really fatty steak,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.510
but now I don't want to eat it anymore...

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.820
Don't touch me!

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.350
Woohoo! We got his hand!

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.870
Call Mista over here now!

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.530
Mista!

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.330
Hurry up and get over here, Mista!

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.250
Mista, over here!

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.980
We found the enemy Stand user!

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.030
Six Bullets, all of you 
come back to the bullets.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.300
It doesn't really matter 
if you answer me or not,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.900
but I'm going to ask you one very, very...

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.220
simple question.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.960
If you don't answer within two 
seconds of me asking the question,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.230
I'll shoot a bullet into each of your eyes.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.930
"Uno, due..." I won't wait any longer than that.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.020
Got it?

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.800
All right. Here's the question.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.020
Where the hell is your friend?

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.360
Uno...

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.870
H-Hell if I know! 
I don't know where he is, either!

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.340
Due... All right. Then die.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.410
Hey... Please help me...

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.050
I've always loved fatty steak so much,

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.350 line:20%
but now I don't wanna eat it anymore...

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.510
Hey! Get out of the way! You'll want 
to eat meat again soon enough!

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.340
No, I can't eat anything anymore...

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.970
Or rather, <i>you</i> won't be able to,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.060
Mista.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.140
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.930
Thankful Death...

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.570
Huh? Wh-What?

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.450
W-Wait! Are you...

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.300
You bastard!

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.080
It works even faster when 
I directly touch you.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.630
Its power is at full strength...

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.050
when Thankful Death touches you.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.830
B-Bullets...

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.630
Th-This speed... Shit...

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.130
I-Is that you, Bro?

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.680
Are you my Bro?!

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.440
I-I didn't notice at all!

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.870
Y-You were there the whole time?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.950
I-I can't believe you aged yourself to 
blend in with the other passengers...

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.550
Bro! Prosciutto! You're so awesome!

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.760 line:20%
S-Stop! Why are you so mad, Bro?!

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.610
You friggin' moron! 
What the hell was that?! Huh?!

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.620
I didn't know he was going to ambush me!

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.350
What could I do?!

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.270
You still don't get it? 
Pesci, you friggin' mammoni!

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.150
Please stop hitting me, Bro!

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.910
Listen up! The reason I'm mad is 
because you're so weak-minded, Pesci!

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:24.160
Of course, they did blast away 
your ice, so you were in shock.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.420
This is aging me, too, so it's bad news.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.750
But if it were any other guy from our team,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.560
they wouldn't have made their 
Stand go away when they were

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.640
that close to finishing off an enemy!

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.890
Even if they lost an arm or a leg!

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.930
You're a damn mammoni, Pesci.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.900
You freaked out. You're such a baby.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.780
It's not because of the ice.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.570
You're actually scared 
deep inside your heart.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.310
Grow up, Pesci.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.510
If you don't grow up, 
we'll never get our glory.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.010
We'll never defeat Bucciarati and his crew.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.540
And just so we're clear...

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:09.200
Our team isn't some buddy-buddy 
club with a bunch of losers

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:18.130
who just talk about killing people 
while trying to cheer each other up.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.690
Once we decide in our hearts 
that we're gonna kill someone,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.180
the deed's already been done!

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.240
Let's go, Pesci.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.040
Here, have some ice.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.030
You mentioned earlier

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:47.080
that you sensed another presence 
in the driver's cab, didn't you?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.710
I don't know how they're hiding in there,

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.820
but the girl's in the driver's cab!

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.970
Prosciutto

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.970
The Thankful Death

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.280
Don't worry about Narancia!

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.650
Save the ice in the glass for yourself!

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.820
You need to keep your body chilled.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:25.420
Fanning air and the chill from 
a cold towel aren't enough.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.750
There's no effect unless you use ice.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.620
At this rate, he'll be the first to die.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.370
Narancia and the rest of us are willing to 
risk our lives to follow the boss's orders.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.140
You just need to think about your safety.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.300
That's our job.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.220
You're not here because you 
want to be here, after all.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.640
And as for the enemy who's 
causing us all to age...

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.400
Mista will take care of him.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.600
I'm sure... he'll do something...

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.510
Mista...

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.200
Where and how are they hiding?

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.210
I'm finally getting it.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.300
I need to start thinking in 
four dimensions to find them.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.800
Bucciarati received something black at 
the station platform from the boss.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.310
That's it. That's what I need 
to find in this driver's cab.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.460
Hey, Pesci.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:44.070
What do you think that presence 
you felt in this driver's cab was?

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.240
You don't feel it now?

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.280
A-About that... Bro...

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.600
You shouldn't expect much from me.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.290
I'm not the brightest.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.700
Pesci, Pesci, Pesci, Pesci...

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.630
I believe in you.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.920
If you're still concerned about 
me yelling at you earlier,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.010
you just need to be more confident.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:13.480
Your Fisher Man is unbeatable 
when you actually apply yourself.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.540
Right?

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:20.320
That presence you felt earlier 
is extremely suspicious.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.930
It's do or die time, Pesci.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.240
It's okay to be confident in your ability.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.660
R-Really?

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.070
Yes!

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.750
Try to remember. It doesn't 
matter how trivial it seems.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.420
Did anything seem strange?

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.380
Like maybe something black?

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.340
Huh? Something... black?

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.110
That's it, Bro!

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.430
I meant to look under 
the driver's seat earlier!

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.650
There was something weird!

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.440
S-Sorry... I guess I was just imagining it.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:07.080
So, yeah... You shouldn't count 
on me or my intuition, after all...

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.990 line:20%
No, I don't think you're wrong.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.040
Say what?!

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.780
Excellent work, Pesci.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.760
The mystery's been solved.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.580
I now understand everything thanks to you.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.460
B-Bro? Wh-What are you...

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.840
Why is there suddenly animal 
shit under the driver's seat?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.130 line:20%
I don't understand at all!

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.830
This isn't mouse shit, either.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.980
If it were a mouse, it'd be dead by now.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.070
This shit's not old. 
It looks like it was just left here.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.270
So what does that mean, huh?

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.480
Stand abilities don't only belong to humans.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.490
And that means...

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.460
This animal is moving through the shadows!

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.490
Thankful Death!

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.690
Wh-What the hell is that?!

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.500
I-It's a turtle? It's a friggin' turtle?!

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.090
We found her! It's Trish!

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.710
I can see the others, too!

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.010
Just as I thought, they're all about 
to die of old age, except for Trish!

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.530
That settles it!

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.680
I'll send even more of the 
aging ability into the turtle!

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.870
Thankful Dead!

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.390
Wait a sec, Bro!

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:21.600
Isn't there... one guy missing?

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.730
There's someone missing in there!

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.690
Mista! Please get up!

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:53.510
This is all the ice I have left, 
but please feel better!

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.680
I'm not sure if it's thanks 
to my attentive nature,

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.160
or if I was just lucky...

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:11.370
But because I put that piece of ice 
I'd picked up earlier into my hat...

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:19.340
Number Five... It seems you 
were able to reverse the aging.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:26.240
Thanks for stopping those bullets 
for me... All three of them.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.670
Number Five... I have one more request...

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.610
If you want to send one of us to Bucciarati,

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.850
I already revived Number Six, 
and he went on ahead!

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.640
He took the ice in your pocket and

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.060
went to tell them that two enemies 
were heading for the turtle!

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:54.590
That's perfect... I don't 
need the ice anymore...

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.170
after all...

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.040
Mista!

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.870
It's Bucciarati, Bro!

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.790
Bucciarati's the one missing!

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.480
It doesn't matter if Bucciarati's 
in there or not!

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.050
All that matters is that we take Trish alive!

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.260
Thankful Death!

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.090
What the hell?!

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.560
You're pretty intuitive... And fast, too.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.020
I just have to defeat him, right?

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.270
The one in black!

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.180
That's right, Bucciarati!

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.850
If you defeat him, 
everyone's aging will be reversed!

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.380
What the hell is Mista's Stand doing here?!

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.770
I personally blasted three 
holes into his head...

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.000
So why is that thing here with an ice cube?!

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Don't let that thing touch you!

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.380
If it does, you'll age way, way faster!

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.690
Get 'em!

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.370
H-He's fast...

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.610
Bro!

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.360
Don't worry about me!

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.400
Deal with the guys in the turtle!

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:20.020
Hurry it up! Kill the rest of his crew!

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.920
That was a little naïve, 
wasn't it, Bucciarati?

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.550
After Mista went to all that 
trouble to warn you...

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.760
Defeating me, even if it costs the lives 
of your crew, to protect the girl...

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.430
Isn't that your mission?

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.520
You fail as a capo. Take this!

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.270
What?!

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.150
I will complete this mission,

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.500
and I will also protect my crew.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:11.080
It won't be hard for me to do both 
if I'm only facing the likes of you.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.780
It's fast...

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.750
It's definitely fast...

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:23.690
Your... Zipper Man, was it?

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.810
It's definitely faster...

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:34.190
But you're the one who doesn't seem 
to understand speed, Bucciarati!

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.390
I seem to be out of breath...

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.950
But the same goes for you, Bucciarati.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:56.150
Since we used our Stands at full speed, 
we both used up a lot of energy.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.330
You didn't comprehend that and 
tried to go as fast as you could,

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.440
even though you're still aging
despite standing still!

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.320
The more horsepower a car has, 
the warmer it gets!

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.070
That's because you're burning calories.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:19.390
You're a smart guy, so I'm 
sure you can figure out...

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.740
what'll happen when your body gets warmer!

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.450
B-Bucciarati!

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.170
Th-The ice is starting to lose its effect!

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.110
So what are you going to do now, huh?

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.920
This zipper you gave me 
is starting to close.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.010
The zipper on my chin is already gone.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.440
What's the matter?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.970
Exhausted from your stiff shoulders?

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.690
Zipper Man!

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.610
I can see your movements! 
You're too slow, Bucciarati!

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.750
I've got you! Now you're all finished!

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.570
And then we'll be taking 
the boss's daughter!

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.620
I was aware of what would
happen if my body warmed up.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.300
I was also prepared to get caught.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.400
I will complete this mission.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.940
I will also protect my crew.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.220
One of the hardest parts of being a 
capo is the fact that I have to do both.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.420
Are you prepared?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.340
I am.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.140
Wha—

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.560
Y-You can't mean...

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.960
You bastard! You can't be serious!

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.430
Doing both is simple,

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.570
if I can get you off this train.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.800
If I can just undo the aging, 
my five subordinates will be back,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.240
and we'll be able to protect Trish!

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.780
You bastard! Y-You can't be serious! Let go!

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.340
We're moving at 150 kilometers per hour!

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.450
Oh, come on, now. You're 
the one who grabbed me.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:04.160
Are you trying to die?! You bastard!

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:42.170
