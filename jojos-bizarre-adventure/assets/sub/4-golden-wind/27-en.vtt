WEBVTT

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.560
Doppio...

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.300
Did you forget that I gave you a portion 
of my Emperor Crimson's power?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.080
Now is the time to use it!

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.250
You have Emperor Crimson's arms and Eulogy!

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.700
Calm down and look carefully for movements.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.730
And then try to predict the future 
movements that will occur around you.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.740 line:20%
Look carefully and predict the 
future movements that will happen

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.390
Episodio 27 Emperor Crimson vs. Metallic

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.370 line:20%
ten seconds from now.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.980
B-Birds!

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.430
Birds went flying, just like what I saw!

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.730
B-Boss! I just saw him!

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.260
He was blended into the footage of ten 
seconds from now that Eulogy showed me!

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.090
It looked like a person had blended 
into the rocks in the background!

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.660
B-But I can't see him right now!

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.380
I can't tell where he is by looking directly!

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.800
That's Risotto.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.390
He's somehow hiding his appearance.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.800
Could it be...

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.770
He normally isn't visible, but you can 
see him because you saw the future.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.480
Look a few seconds into the future to 
see how he's going to attack, Doppio!

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.650
Th-There he is!

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.540
H-He moved!

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.830
Wh-What?!

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.090
Th-This is awful, Boss!

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.300
In ten seconds, s-scissors are 
going to c-come out of my throat!

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.330
Calm down, Doppio.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.470
What you saw wasn't you dying.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.760
Risotto is the assassin that no one 
in the organization could find.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.020
You should expect a little bit of damage.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.810
You need to see how he's going to attack you

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.840
a few seconds in the future!

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.030
The fact that he gets close to me

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.300
means that it's definitely not 
a remote-controlled Stand.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.240
Th-This footage showing that there'll 
be scissors inside my throat...

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.270
Does it mean this future 
is unchangeable, Boss?!

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.690
Correct.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.960
Now that you've seen that footage, 
you're going to have to prepare yourself.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.190
It's true that you're going to have 
scissors shoved down your throat.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.610
But see through it!

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.440
See through how he's going to attack you!

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.180
If you can see through his methods, 
you'll find his weakness!

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.310
And then, get within two meters of him

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.610
and strike him with 
Emperor Crimson's arm, Doppio!

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.850
Damn it!

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.560
There you are! Take this!

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.610
You're sloppy.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.140
But then again, in all my 
years of being an assassin,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.700
you're the first one to ever land 
a blow this close to my location.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.580
How truly interesting.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.200
How did you know?

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.410
I'm curious about your ability.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.420
But still... you're going to die!

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.880
I-Impossible!

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.460
How did he get the scissors under my skin?

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.140
He hasn't laid a finger on me, 
and I haven't opened my mouth.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.710
H-His Stand hasn't even touched me...

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.470
But the scissors are opening on their own!

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.610
A-At this rate, he's going 
to chop open my throat!

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.310
<c.color311067>S</c><c.color480775>t</c><c.color640258>a</c><c.color810030>b</c><c.colorab000f>!</c>

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.320
I need to get them out!

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.330
Those movements...

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.360
I thought I'd be able to slice open his throat,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.670
but it's as if he knew I was going 
to place those scissors there.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.560
He just put his hand to his 
throat and defended himself.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.610
There's something going on.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.140
I need to be more careful...

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.630
so I can finish him off 
completely in my next attempt.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.820
God damn you!

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.310
Damn it... I couldn't tell.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.260
The boss is going to be upset with me.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.360
I still don't know how he's invisible.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.650
B-But this damage... 
I-I'm losing strength in my legs...

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.760
Th-That's—

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.420
What's the matter, Doppio?

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.520
Were you able to see his attack?

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.640
B-Boss!

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.260
You couldn't see it?

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.750
Then move away from there immediately.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.310
Figure out exactly where he 
is by having him chase you!

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.680
Y-You bastard!

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.100
I've made up my mind.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.720
I'm definitely going to see 
through him next time.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.420
Damn it.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.110
I'm going to get within two 
meters of him, no matter what!

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.040
You just saw Emperor Crimson's 
next footage, didn't you?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.110
What did you see?

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.090
I'm asking you a question, Doppio!

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.420
What did you see?

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.750
My right foot, Boss.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.570
For the next move, in a few seconds,

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.850
it's going to be scissors again.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.100
It went flying off.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.170
My foot is going to go flying off.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.180
What did you say, Doppio?!

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.680
H-He's coming! I saw a glimpse of him!

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.250
Get away from there right now!

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.030
Why didn't you move immediately 
after seeing the footage, Doppio?

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.070
Risotto Nero, the assassin.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.840
While his movements are careful, 
he's already made preparations to kill me.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.880
I can't get my legs to move.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.500
I'm not sure if I can run.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.350
Razor blades, scissors...

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.620
He was preparing for me 
to lose all this stamina!

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.510
Shit. Doppio won't be able to win now.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.970
It's going to take me at least 
ten seconds to come out.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.890
This isn't good.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.830
The damage he'd endure from losing 
his foot would be less than ideal.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.280
I need to minimize the damage somehow.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.550
I'm telling you to move away from there now!

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.220
You're going to be killed!

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.060
But, Boss, if I may interject...

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.200
That's exactly why I shouldn't move.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.740
I've used up my stamina.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.370
That's why it's easier 
to tell if I don't move.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.320
All I've been thinking about is 
where he was attacking me from

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.050
with the razor blades and scissors.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.010
But I was going about it the wrong way!

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.020
There you are!

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.230
His ability...

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.150
is to use the iron within 
a living creature to create

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.990
iron razor blades within their bodies!

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.660
The fact that this frog and I are 
so worn out gave me the answer!

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.800
You use your Stand ability

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.290
to use the iron within a living 
creature to create razor blades!

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.800
And given that the razor blades came out 
of the frog before they came out of me...

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.260
That's the direction you 
were approaching from!

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.770
Th-This bastard...

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.140
Looks like the prediction was correct.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.170
Someone's foot went flying off.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:12.270
And the mystery behind the enemy's form 
is slowly becoming apparent, Boss.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.310
Huh? Boss?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.790
That's strange. I could've 
sworn I was holding a phone...

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.370
Where did I drop it?

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.580
I mean, that's a frog...

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.290
Oh, there it is!

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.570
How the heck did I drop it down there?

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.430
It's underneath all these rocks, 
and now it's covered in sand.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.760
Oh, jeez. And I need to report 
to the boss immediately, too...

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.300
D-Did it break?

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.640
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.430
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.980
Yes!

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.150
As small as they make electronics these 
days, I guess they're pretty sturdy!

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.820
Hello? Praise me, Boss. 
He can't move anymore.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.530
Impossible...

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.290
Well done, Doppio.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.360
My Doppio...

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.820
Am I going to be the one to finish him off?

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.460
Or should I wait until you get here, Boss?

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.910
I want to make sure that Risotto 
Nero is finished off for good.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.050
I'll take care of him myself.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.930
Get closer to him, Doppio. 
Get within two meters of him...

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.560
And then, I'll go there.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.640
Until then, get closer to him.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.270
You got it! I'll get closer to him, Boss!

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.890
Inside the wound where 
his foot was severed...

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.260
They're wriggling.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.320
Risotto's Stand is inside his body!

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.780
You have precognitive powers, don't you?

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.980
You had a decent idea of what would 
happen and how I would move.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.750
Otherwise, there's no way you could've 
predicted my position or my attack.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.940
It's true that, at first, you were a beginner 
who couldn't do anything on your own.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.860
But... who are you right now?

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.720
Your personality is now 
filled with confidence.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.900
And what's that look on your face?

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.020
Those eyes don't belong to a young man.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.690
It's as if there are two of you.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.020
<c.colorcdd2da>Shink</c>

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.950
Could that be what's going on?

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.860
No, that's not it.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.060
There's no doubt about it.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.740
I'm much closer than I realize...

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.910
to the one I'm after right now!

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.500
Two years.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.800
It's been two years since we were

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.590
basically pups who had been 
collared, shaking in fear.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.640
You're definitely something more 
than what we've been looking for.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.180
I'm certain of it.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.270
I want to know what you are.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.210
I want to see your true form.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.630
I want to know what you are when 
I kill you... no matter what!

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.990
Risotto Nero

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.990
Metallic

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.630
Solido Naso... That's probably 
one of the boss's aliases.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.750
Otherwise, he wouldn't hide 
his daughter so quickly.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.770
We came all the way here, 
but it's just a waste of damn time.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.510
Damn it.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.970
But if we're able to get his daughter,

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.970
we might find out who the boss is!

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.370
Right, Bro?

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.620
We haven't been able to make a move

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.650
ever since what happened 
to Sorbet and Gelato.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.460
I wonder who's guarding his daughter.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.190
Pericolo's not a Stand user, 
so maybe it's Polpo.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:45.160
Then maybe we should head 
toward Naples and ask him.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.570
Don't get ahead of yourselves.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.470
It's times like these that you should 
remain calm before doing anything.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.150
I understand how you feel,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.580
but you need to lock away what 
happened to Sorbet and Gelato.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.550
Failure equals death.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.470
I'm excited, but...

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.990
The one who gets too excited in 
this situation is the one who dies.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.100
The foot I chopped off!

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.020
I was right. Risotto Nero...

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.650
I can now see your powers! Magnetism!

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:24.250
You're controlling your Stand at 
that distance with magnetism!

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.830
You took control of the iron inside me

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.360
and made me spit out those 
razor blades and scissors!

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.410
The way you make yourself disappear 
is by covering yourself in iron powder

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.190
and camouflaging yourself to 
match the scenery around you!

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.670
Correct.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.770
You may have figured out what 
Metallic is, but it's too late.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.420
Because you are already complete.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.370
Iron.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.580
You can find iron anywhere in this world.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.840
Of course, it's in sand,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.810
as well as spring water and plants.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.730
And of course, iron is also 
found within humans, as well.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.030
<c.colorec2241>S</c><c.coloree413d>t</c><c.coloree6340>a</c><c.colored9d31>b </c><c.colorec2241>S</c><c.coloree413d>t</c><c.coloree6340>a</c><c.colored9d31>b </c><c.colorec2241>S</c><c.coloree413d>t</c>ab

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.280
What are you doing, Doppio?

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.700
You predicted his movements!

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.740
I will not allow you to 
receive further damage!

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.230
Th-This is... B-Boss!

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.340
You saw through my ability, 
and my foot got chopped off.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.440
But you are already complete.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.430
There's nothing you can do about that.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.260
Large amounts of iron can be found in

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.970
vegetables like spinach and meats like liver.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.250
It's an important substance 
that's within your bloodstream.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.010
What happens when all the iron within 
you leaves your body at once?

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.020
To put it simply, your blood turns a 
horrible shade of yellow and you die.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.610
The iron in your blood 
captures the oxygen

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.710
that enters your body when you breathe,

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.870
and carries it throughout your body.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:39.750
Without that, the precious oxygen doesn't 
reach your fingertips or your brain.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.840
Which means, now that you've 
been robbed of so much iron,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.470
despite how hard you're breathing, 
oxygen isn't entering your body.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:53.380
Your body is going to become 
a corpse before you actually die.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.490
Now, then...

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.390
I wonder what I should do next.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.600
Should I wait until you croak, or...

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.060
We seem to be out of time anyway,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.520
so should I just go over 
there and finish you off?

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.440
B-Boss...

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.360
That's...

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.740
They're near the mansion!

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.160
It's Bucciarati!

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.240
He finally showed himself!

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.490
Narancia's also there, and... 
Abbacchio's there, too!

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.460
What? Abbacchio's there?

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.400
We're out of time.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.920
Doppio, finish him off with your next move!

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.960
Predict Risotto's movements in the footage!

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.370
I'm already looking!

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.010
Risotto will come around 
my right side, and then...

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.600
He disappears! I can't see him!

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.180
I-It can't be...

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.870
What do you see, Doppio?

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.310
What do you see?

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.980
I'm gonna turn the tables, damn it!

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.740
I'll finish him off, Boss!

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.450
A few seconds before what happens 
in this footage happens...

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.580
I'll blow off his head instead!

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.660
Just like I chopped off his foot earlier!

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:06.790
H-Here he comes!

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.340
Don't do anything else, Doppio!

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.720
There's nothing else you can do.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.180
Listen well, Doppio. This is important.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.260
Don't waste any more energy.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.640
I'm heading there right now.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.390
It'll be a few more seconds, 
but I'll deal with Risotto.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.900
A few seconds?!

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.940
But it'll be too late! 
He's going to attack me any second!

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.950
Deal with it!

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.080
If my full abilities get there,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.110
I can just erase the time 
you saw in the footage!

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.110
But I'm the one who's going to be attacked!

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.080
So I'll finish him off!

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.310
Doppio! This is the only way!

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.660
This is the only way you're going to survive!

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.450
Your body can't take any more.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.720
I won't allow you to waste any 
more energy on my behalf!

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.510
You're going to finish him off?

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.050
Risotto Nero is not someone 
you can find twice!

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.120
But what if I can, Boss?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.160
If I know where he is...

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.480
If his ability is going to try to steal 
even more iron from my body...

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.000
H-Here he comes! He's attacking!

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.180
He should have the strength to pull...

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.670
He should have the strength 
to pull the iron from my body!

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.410
The scalpel is pointing in the 
direction of the magnetic force!

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.990
You're right there, Risotto!

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.290
I figured that's what you'd do.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.520
Magnetism pulls at the iron.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.040
If you can figure out which 
way it's being pulled,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.390
you thought you could figure out my location.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.480
However, unfortunately...

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.970
What you sensed was

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.520
the magnetism that Metallic is producing 
in the foot you chopped off.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.810
I left it there.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.980
I learned from my mistake of 
letting you chop off my right foot.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.780
I need to make the best of that situation.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.220
There's barely any oxygen left in your body.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.250
You are complete.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.250
You shouldn't even be able to move an inch.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.390
You're different from before.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.690
Now you're brimming with confidence.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.170
The excessive physical changes to your body,

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.800
and the way you're talking to yourself...

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.760
It all makes sense now.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.760
I finally figured out who you really are!

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.770
Yes, this had already been confirmed 
in 16th century Germany.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.000
There are people in this world 
who have multiple personalities.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.310
In some cases, it doesn't 
just affect them mentally.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.860
Their body... Their physique can change, 
as well as their way of speaking.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:48.110
I had just thought that you were the 
boss's most trusted subordinate.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.960
But you...

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.040
To think that you...

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.770
I can't wait.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:58.460
I can't what to see what your 
face will look like once you die!

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.930
There's nothing else you can do.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.260
I'm keeping my distance.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.310
You have no strength to resist.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.810
There's nothing you can do!

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.180
I've won!

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.020
I'm going to chop off your head!

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.860
This is the end! Take this!

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.020
Metallic!

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.200
Wh-What?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.480
Risotto,

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.980
I told Doppio...

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.560
that you were no longer 
an enemy he could handle.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.850
Don't tell me...

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.830
I knew it. The enemy was already here.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.560
But I shot right through him! 
I hit him good, too!

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.630
Y-You...

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.010
If the blood in my body 
that's been robbed of iron

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.300
isn't going to carry oxygen 
throughout my body...

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.540
It's the same thing as if 
my body wasn't breathing.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.790
Which means that the only thing 
Li'l Bomber can track right now...

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.260
How many enemies are there, Narancia?

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.210
Just one!

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:20.300
There's only one person 
breathing on that cliff!

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.010
...is your breathing, Risotto.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.740
I see.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.270
This is the same thing that happened in 
the footage that Doppio saw, but...

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.430
I was winning...

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.610
I would've won...

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.320
But you had thrown the scalpels at them...

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.660
Boss...

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.940
Episodio 28
Beneath a Sky on the Verge of Falling
