00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.730
Come on, guys! Hear me out!

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.890
Would you cool it already?
Okay, what do you want?

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.070
I was thinking about this last night...

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.780
So, if you were to eat human flesh, 
would it taste good or bad?

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.930
Come on, Mista. 
Don't talk about stuff like that.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.830
Why the hell would you bring 
that up out of the blue?

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.460
Get outta here! Go eat by yourself!

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.720
Useless! Useless! Useless! 
Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.300
Scrunch

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.300
Kapow

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.190
You won't be heading anywhere.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.120
In particular, you will never 
arrive at the truth.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.530
Why, you little brat!

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.240
Useless! Useless! Useless! 
Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.180
Useless!

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.970
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.390
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.780
Episodio 38 Golden Wind Requiem

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.740
Y-You did it! At last!

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.170
Your Golden Wind evolved 
with the arrow, and...

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.420
I couldn't see what it did, 
so I don't really know how,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.880
but you finally defeated him!

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.190
But... wait a sec.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.720
Did he float up anywhere?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.270
Hey, where is he? Where's his body?

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.140
Damn it!

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.600
Where is he?! Find him, Giorno!

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.480
Where is he?!

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.080
I'm just...

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.800
barely... still alive...

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.840
somehow...

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.360
But...

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.670
What was that?

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.640
My prediction clearly showed 
my victory... and yet...

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.310
What in the world... was that Requiem?

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.310
I need to escape... into this sewer for now...

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.220
I still... have enough strength left for that...

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.220
I did it...

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.960
Was I just lucky?

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.740
You jackass!

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.270
I-I'm not g-gonna let you 
s-snatch my precious c-coat!

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.270
It's not happening!

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.730
What? You wanna fight?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.780
Well, do ya?! Don't mess with me!

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.430
I'll take you on anytime!

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.020
Come at me, ya dickhead!

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.940
What?!

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.560
Come on! Come at me!

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.760
I-Impossible!

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.410
This can't be...

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.830
You're never gonna get my coat!

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.990
I can't stand up!

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.080
S-Someone...

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.330
You ain't getting it...

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.710
I-I can't... Not here...

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.710
You ain't getting it...

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.290
I-I'm Diavolo!

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.190
Not at the hands of a guy like him...

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.720
I'm fading...

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.220
Where am I?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.990
Why am I sleeping on a bed?

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.590
I fell into the river, and then, 
when I got into that sewer...

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.700
Let's see... Today's date is the 25th.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.780
11:20 AM.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.690
File number 68.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.270
I, Dr. Monica Ultello, 
will be handling this case.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.610
We have an adult male, 
between the ages of 30 and 40.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.090
His identity is unknown.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.660
Judging from the state of his skin, it's been about 48 to 54 hours since his death.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.140
I will now begin the autopsy to 
determine his cause of death.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.350
Hey, woman... What are you talking about?

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.110
Although his body was found near the river,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.570
Where am I? What am I doing here?!

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.160 line:20%
he had barely any water in him, 
so he couldn't have drowned.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.160
Hey, woman!

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.920
I can't move...

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.290
M-My fingers...

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.920
My body...

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.170
What in the world is...

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.760
Hey, woman! Are you listening to me?!

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.280
Who the hell are you?

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.090
What are you doing?!

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.440
Why won't my body move?!

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.240
A-And this pain...

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.190 line:20%
I-It hurts!

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.320
The cause of death is a stab 
wound reaching his liver.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.190
There are no marks indicating hesitation, 
so we can rule out suicide.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.770
Next, I'll dissect his abdomen 
and check inside, just in case.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.220
His liver is very healthy. 
It's a very nice color.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.710
I-It was just a dream?

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.160
Am I just dreaming?

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.690
But...

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.600
I-It's happening again.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.940
What time is it? Where am I?

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.480
I was in the Tiber River in Rome...

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.460
And that feeling...

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.580
That unimaginable pain I experienced 
in the autopsy room...

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.910
I-It was too real to be a dream...

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.620
Hello, sir?

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.300
Are you all right?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.010
Why are you hunched over like 
that? Are you not feeling well?

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.960
<c.colore39b3c>Jump</c>

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.970
Hey, stop that!

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.780
What in the world is this?!

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.310
Something's wrong!

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.580
I-I couldn't possibly die 
in such a stupid manner!

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.860
Don't tell me that this is...

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.020
Golden Wind Requiem's—

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.160
We have to find him!

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.490
I can sense that he's still alive!

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.820
I can't relax until we know for sure!

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.960
No, there's no reason to look for him.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.840
What?

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.270
Everything's already over.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.560
I wasn't able to clearly see 
Requiem's ability myself,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.590
but I know deep in my heart that it's true.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.550
He won't be heading anywhere ever again.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.470
In particular, he'll never arrive at the truth...

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.840
He'll never even arrive at 
the truth behind his death.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.150
Why are you hunched over, mister? 
Does your tummy hurt?

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.850
Eternally.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.260
B-But he's alive...

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.280
His end is that there is no end.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.790
That's... Golden Wind Requiem's ability!

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.990
H-How many times am I going to die?!

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.440
Wh-When am I going to be 
attacked next, and from where?!

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.010
S-Stay back!

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.050
Stay away!

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.010
S-Stay...

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.850
Stay the hell away from me!

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.280
So we finally did it?

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.310
We're the ones who won?

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.460
Hey, come on! Let's hurry 
back to the Colosseum.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.240
Bucciarati might've gotten his 
soul back, but his body is hurt.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.740
He's probably wondering what the hell 
happened to us at the Colosseum!

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.720
Right.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.960
Giorno, come on! 
We're going back to the Colosseum!

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.990
Let's heal Bucciarati's wounds and head home!

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.280
Yeah...

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.760
Let's go.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.850
I'll be right there.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.180
Giorno, that's how it should be.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.820
Don't worry about it.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:18.540
What we've accomplished up to 
this point is an absolute victory.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.710
Fate is a sleeping slave.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.020
And we've set that slave free.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.820
That's what our victory is.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.090
Giorno Giovanna

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.090
Golden Wind Requiem

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.210
Just hear me out!

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.920
Taking time to <i>really</i> think 
about what you're eating

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.680
is connected to whether or not 
you're living a happy life.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.270
That's why I think it's really important.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.020
So, there are animals 
that are carnivores, right?

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.070
You know, like lions, cats, and vultures.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.830
You won't find meat from carnivores 
like that at a restaurant.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.740
Why is that?

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.980
Because it's too smelly to eat!

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.160
It's disgusting!

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.830
Listen up, guys! 
Cats are too disgusting to eat.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.190
Are we on the same page so far?

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:21.130
I'd never eat a cat, even if some culinary 
expert said it was the best thing ever!

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.150
On the other hand, have you 
heard of a fish called "sweetfish"?

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.420
Sweetfish don't eat bugs. 
They only eat algae.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.110
They're vegetarian.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.350
Usually, fish guts are too bitter to eat, 
but sweetfish guts are delicious.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.420
It's because they're not carnivores.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.100
So with that logic in mind,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:44.030
all the meat we consider delicious 
is from herbivorous animals!

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.360
Cows, pigs, and chickens!

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.740
The better their feed, 
the better they taste!

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.630
Which leads us to this conclusion...

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.750
Humans would taste gross 
because they eat meat!

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.970
Well? How do you like the 
opinion I came up with?

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.710
I see. That's actually rather convincing.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:05.110
That whole thing that comes up in 
novels about human flesh tasting good

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.930
is a flat-out lie!

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:12.140
I, uh... I actually eat a lot more vegetables 
and fruits than meat, though...

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.460
Then you might actually be pretty tasty!

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.730
Narancia, don't egg him on!

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.820
Hey, you're late, Bucciarati.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.110
You know Leaky Eye Luca, who's in 
charge of the airport, right?

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.700
His dead body was just discovered.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.580
I've been ordered by the 
capo Polpo to check it out.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.400
I hate that guy. He deserved to die.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.610
He had no qualms about tormenting the weak,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.940
and he sold drugs to kids.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.920
He probably got high and 
hit his head or something.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.720
Narancia, you may feel that way deep 
inside, but don't actually say it.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.520
Think about the world we live in.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.930
Do you want me to look into this?

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.430
You're going to be a capo someday.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.990
You don't need to trouble yourself
with such trivial matters.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.500
No, I'll be looking into this myself.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.940
By the way, Fugo...

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.900
Oh, right. You have a guest.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.570
He's been waiting for you all morning.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.810
He's a civilian who runs a 
flower shop in Monsanto Plaza.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.410
I've looked into him already.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.790
He's an ordinary, responsible gentleman,

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.040
but he lost his only 
daughter six months ago.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:30.610
Mr. Bucciarati... As you can see, 
my legs don't work so well,

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:36.090
and I came here without my wife, 
who usually accompanies me,

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.020
so I apologize for coming here alone.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.650
Do you pay your taxes?

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.480
I beg your pardon?

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:50.780
Do you always honestly pay the taxes 
you owe to this country on time?

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.440
Of course I do...

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.960
I don't know what you came 
here to talk to me about,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.280
but a civilian like you shouldn't be here.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.210
If you properly pay your taxes,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.970
you should go talk to the police or 
anyone else who deals with the law.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.880
The moment you start talking 
to me, you'll end up in

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.470
far deeper debt to the organization 
than you can even imagine.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:23.400
I, just like everyone else in this country,

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.080
have worked hard for my family, 
believed in the law,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.780
and raised my child with proper morals.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.990
She was my only daughter.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.500
She had turned seventeen last September.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.900
I apologize if I sound overbearing,

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.750
but I'd like to continue this 
conversation with you in private.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.490
If you want to continue 
this conversation...

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.020
They all trust me greatly, 
and I also trust them.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.310
And you're asking me to interrupt their 
meal and tell them to go outside?

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.020
I can't do that.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.730
This happened a few months ago...

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:12.270
My wife told me that my 
daughter had a boyfriend.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.740
I heard that he was a young sculptor 
who was just getting started.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:22.390
That was fine and all, but despite the 
fact that he was older than my daughter,

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.320
he never came to introduce 
himself to us, her parents.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.620
That got to me.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.220
And shortly after...

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.650
my daughter jumped off the roof 
of his apartment building,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:39.220
holding a strange rock sculpture he had 
made, and plunged into the courtyard...

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.730
I'm terribly sorry for 
losing my composure...

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.990
Why do my tears hurt so much?

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.840
My daughter was my hope...

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.200
My daughter shone with youthful beauty...

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.330
I want you to avenge my daughter!

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.170
Please make that man pay!

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.110
Hang on a second.

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.430
Are you saying this was murder?

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.810
Are you implying that this boyfriend 
pushed her off the roof?

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:25.060
If a murder happened in this town, 
I would have heard about it.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:31.160
The police refused to look into 
it further and ruled it a suicide.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.620
Even my lawyer!

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.660
But there's something that 
only her family knows...

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.260
My daughter would never commit suicide!

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.040
Both my wife and I can say 
that with confidence!

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.350
Please! I want you to settle 
this once and for all!

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:54.900
Please make him, the bastard who's still 
living his life as usual, experience

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.550
these tears of despair that I'm crying!

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.710
Life is full of hardships.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.140
I feel for you, but I can't agree to this.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:08.480
Are you trying to imply that we're some 
assassins who would lynch just anyone?

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.540
Everyone in this town relies on you.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.950
I'm just asking for the rightful punishment!

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.570
The rightful punishment?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.470
Florist, earlier, you asked 
if we could talk privately.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:27.040
That was because you knew how 
dangerous this conversation is, wasn't it?

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.510
But what you said about something 
only her family would know...

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.470
I can't take that lightly.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.220
To think that no one involved 
with the law was moved by

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.480
those words in the past six months...

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.070
I find that rather unbelievable.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:51.190
I can at least try to make 
this boyfriend talk.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.500
I'll only ask for that payment once 
we confirm that he's actually guilty.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.880
Does that work for you?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.880
Mr. Bucciarati!

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.580
Mista.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.910
I'd like you to look into this.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.870
Sure.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.250
Bad luck

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.510
What the heck...

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.200
<c.color231d18>Bad luck</c>

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.550
is this rock?

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.420
Kill me

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.650
Mista, make sure you put that back.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:34.420
Uh... Did I knock this rock... off of its stand?

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.570
Was it always here?

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.100
Be careful when you stand up.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.780
Make sure you don't hit that rock.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.740
Mista, Bucciarati says we 
can drive you partway.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.200
Right...

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.340
Mista, here's the address 
to the apartment building.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.570
Here's a picture of the boyfriend.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.550
Find him and make him talk.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.090
You can get a little rough 
with him if you need to.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.810
Make sure you get a confession.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.760
You've got a tape recorder, right?

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.710
Yeah... But how far should I go?

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:17.900
I mean, if he actually ends up being 
a murderer and killed that girl...

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.250
We aren't assassins.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:24.620
Make it so he can't walk for four or five 
years, and leave the rest to the police.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.740
I'm sure that'll satisfy the 
florist's need for revenge.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.650
<c.color7c45c0>Menacing</c>

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.540
Hey, where are you going?

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.880
Hurry up and get in the car. 
I'm gonna leave you behind.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.550
Mista! Do you want a ride or not? 
Are you taking a piss?

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.600
I'm not! Yes, I want a ride! 
I'll be right there!

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.120
What's been bothering you, Mista?

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.690
Well, there's something that's been 
bugging me about the florist's story.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.530
He mentioned that when his 
daughter jumped off the roof,

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.860
she was holding some kind of rock, right?

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.660
Did he mention what kind of rock it was?

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.080
A rock?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.240
Like, the shape of it...

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.920
How big was the rock? 
The boyfriend is a sculptor, right?

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.130
He said it was a strange-looking rock.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:24.720
Yeah, but what exactly did this 
strange-looking rock look like?

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.110
He only said it looked strange.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.310
What are you getting at, Mista?

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.140
Wait, that stone back there...

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.730
S-Stop the car for a sec, Fugo! 
Stop the car!

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.390
Why?

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.990
Just stop the damn ca—

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.440
Why do you want me to stop the car?

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.460
E-Er, never mind...

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.890
I was just seeing things.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.420
It's nothing.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.210
Are you all right?

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.630
How much wine did you have earlier?

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.650
Hey! I'm not drunk!

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.510
Sorry for saying something stupid!

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.240
I'm terribly sorry for all the trouble!

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.400
That's his apartment building, right?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.020
You can drop me off here.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.770
Oh, for crying out loud...

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.420
Shouldn't someone else go 
with Mista on this job?

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.420
Should I accompany him?

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.090
No, I'll go with Mista.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:38.170
I just remembered the rumor about Stand 
users gathering in this town for some reason.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.830
You take care of the investigation 
of Leaky Eye Luca.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.010
Understood.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.180
So the guy's apartment is 
on the seventh floor...

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.180
And above that is the roof.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.720
His name is Scolippi...

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.110
The courtyard...

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.610
So this is where the florist's daughter...

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.030
That's a Stand!

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.910
This incident involves a Stand user!

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.790
And what the hell is this rock?!

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.460
Bucciarati!

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.690
Episodio 39
 The Sleeping Slave
