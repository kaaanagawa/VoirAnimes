00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.360
Any luck?

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.570
Try checking Interpol or even 
the Sardinian police records.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.500
Do these fingerprints match any records?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.400
It's no use. There are no hits.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.780
Even if the boss had a previous record, 
odds are he made sure it was erased.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.120
But it has to be somewhere...

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.920
That's why he tried to eliminate

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.090
his own daughter and fears letting 
anyone know what he looks like.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.650
Why don't we look through 
the records of the dead?

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.300
The boss might've faked his own death.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.090
Let's give it a shot.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.980
We can't let him get away with this.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.120
A moment ago, just for a little while, 
I felt the same thing I felt in Venice.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.480
The one who got close to Abbacchio was...

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.260
my father.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.900
This man finished Abbacchio 
with his own hands.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.740
Are you saying that the boss is here, Trish?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.920
Yes.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.620
I don't know where he is 
right now, but he's nearby.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.450
Bucciarati!

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.450
Not right now!

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.370
If we don't find out the 
boss's identity for sure

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.920
and kill him, we're going to lose.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.880
We have to track down his identity first!

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.730
No hits.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.050
It's no use... The boss is meticulous.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.320
It's impossible to track 
him down any farther...

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.480
That's not true!

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.760
You have already tracked him down.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.530
What?

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.920
All that's left now is to 
find a way to defeat him.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.210
Episodio 29 Get to the Roman Colosseum!

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.170
I've been waiting so long

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.380
for people like you, who'd do everything 
they could to track this man down!

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.790
Screech

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.760
Someone tracked <i>us</i> down instead!

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.260
Giorno, cut the connection, quick!

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.100
Wait! Don't cut me off!

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.720
I'm on your side!

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.680
You want to defeat Diavolo, don't you?

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.100
Diavolo?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.310
Please believe me.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.940
I knew deep in my heart that someone who

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.880
wanted to defeat Diavolo 
would eventually show up.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.530
That's why I always kept this line open.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.240
I've been waiting for so long...

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.200
I waited for years, filled with hope.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.790
I'm on your side!

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.500
I don't know about that.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.080
Diavolo?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.910
Just because you said that name

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.580
doesn't guarantee that you're on our side.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.130
Giorno, cut the connection.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.050
His Stand is able to skip through time!

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.510
Did you know that?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.660
Though I'm sure that

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.230
you're in a hurry to find out 
who he is because you know that.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.520
He's on our side...

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.410
This guy's on our side.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.560
No underling of my father's could've 
survived knowing his Stand ability.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.800
Be quiet, Trish.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.290
We can't reveal more 
about ourselves just yet.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.560
All right. Let's hear what you have to say.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.450
First, tell us your name.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.970
My name doesn't matter.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.900
My body is already in a state 
that prevents me from fighting.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.670
What's important is whether or not 
you are actually able to defeat him.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.740
His ability to erase time has no weaknesses.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.140
I'm sure you're planning 
to assassinate him,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.060
but you are certain to fail!

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.270
Are you saying you know of
a way to defeat the boss?

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.980
His Emperor Crimson is invincible!

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.230
But I do know of a slight 
possibility to defeat him.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.920
It's just a possibility, though.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.280
You will have to obtain that possibility.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.280
Obtain it?

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.830
Come to me. Come to Rome!

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.750
If you do that, I can give 
you this possibility!

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.750
Do you really think we'll go to you?
We don't even know if we can trust you.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.630
I'm sure at least some of 
you know what this is.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.000
Screech

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.140
That's...

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.390
the arrow!

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.250
At least, it looks just like it!

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.120
Why do you have that?

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.690
I'll tell you that later.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.770
You must come to my 
location to retrieve this.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.230
He doesn't know the true 
way to use this arrow.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.910
This arrow doesn't just awaken 
Stand abilities in people.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.690
There is hidden wisdom within it.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.210
I will tell you what it is.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.560
Come to Rome.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.920
This arrow will defeat him.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.630
It is your last and only hope!

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.590
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.180
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.250
Hey, you there!

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.750
What the heck do you think you're 
doing, answering my phone?!

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.270
That call's for me!

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.560
Give it here! You stupid brat!

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.400
Hello? Yes, this is Doppio!

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.260
It's strange, Doppio.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.400
What is, Boss?

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.510
Bucciarati and his crew.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.790
They've lost Abbacchio, so they should 
be at a loss as to what to do now.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.990
But that's not the case.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.450
They've fled with no hesitation whatsoever.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.590
They're on that boat with a goal in mind.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.290
Look into it.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.760
Return to Abbacchio's last 
location and look around.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.390
Something's not right.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.950
Look around?

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.600
But what am I supposed to look for?

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.810
Fear is born

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.870
from an unexpected past.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.110
This is what I've been fearing

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.660
ever since I found out that I had a daughter.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.700
There's nothing suspicious, boss.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.210
The statue's been destroyed, but that it.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.750
I know it. I can tell.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.330
Those traitors... There's no doubt about it.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.050
They figured something out 
that I don't know about.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.590
They figured something out?

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.340
What could it be? 
They didn't have that kind of time.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.130
It's something that I'd never expect!

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.270
That's enough, Doppio.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.320
Go after them immediately.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.280
You have to track them down yourself.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.600
Yes, sir!

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.350
Also...

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.890
Cioccolata and Secco...

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.360
Have them stop Bucciarati and his crew.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.280
I didn't want to ask for help from such 
filth, but I have no other choice.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.860
This is the last time.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.700
Listen well, Doppio. 
One must destroy their fear.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.130
The moment is now.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.170
We must get through this 
right now, no matter what.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.240
That is what it means to be alive.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.440
Who the heck is this guy 
waiting for us in Rome?

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.420
Can we really trust him?

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.850
Who knows? But Bucciarati 
decided we're going.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.820
What other options do we have?

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.310
Let me tell you a little 
story from the past.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.280
In Greenland, there's a place called 
Cape York where only Inuit people live.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.980
It's famous for having a crater 
created by a meteorite.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.090
It's said to have fallen tens 
of thousands of years ago.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.870
In 1978...

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.830
Two men from a team that was surveying 
for natural resources within the crater

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.550
contracted an unknown illness.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.510
They both ended up with blisters 
all over their bodies,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.680
and eventually, they died
looking like tomato sauce.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.910
On top of that, one of them suddenly shot 
a jolt like a stun gun from his finger

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.390
and accidentally burned a few 
fingers off the doctor treating him.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.200
In later investigations, 
it was discovered that a virus,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.910
which was tens of thousands of 
years old, had been trapped

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.330
within the meteorite inside the crater.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.770
That virus may have flown 
here on the meteorite.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.690
A virus?

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.050
What about it?

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.170
I tracked it down!

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.100
This arrow is made from the same material 
as the meteorite found in Cape York!

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.650
Centuries ago, a man who craved 
absolute power like that of the gods

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.860
found out about this rock and created 
arrows from it. This is one of them.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.220
This killer virus culls lifeforms.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.290
This is a theory called "viral evolution."

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.890
Most people who contract this virus will die,

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.580
but some possess something 
that lets them survive.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.950
And as if it were rewarding them,

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.260
the virus gives them a new life ability.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.240
This has already been proven, 
with your own bodies.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.540
So that's what Stands are...

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.770
That is the root and 
principle of that arrow.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.020
I see. I understand that now.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.440
But what's this secret way of using the arrow

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.690
that we're supposed to retrieve?

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.530
I can't tell you that until 
you come see me in Rome.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.620
On top of that, I can only 
tell one of you what it is.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:49.600
Because no one else can ever find 
out about this secret power.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.140
But once you find out that method,

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.010
I guarantee that it will take 
you to another dimension.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.390
It is the only way to 
defeat Emperor Crimson.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.590
There's no guarantee that 
your story is true.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.990
But if the boss hears about this, 
he's definitely going to eliminate you.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.480
I'll trust you.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.070
How do you want to meet?

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.560
Come to the Colosseum in Rome.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.190
Once you get there, you'll know.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.770
It doesn't matter what time. 
I'll be waiting.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.020
Everything will be revealed there.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.590
Come on! Get up, damn it!

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.660
Shut up! I'm gonna take a piss!

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.330
Seriously!

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.330 line:20%
I'm gonna do it!

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.780
This isn't the damn bathroom!

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.650
There's no toilet here!

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.020
This is it, right here.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.040
Damn, that feels good!

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.610
I'm gonna do it!

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.660
Let's go up on land once those drunks leave.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.120
Then we'll acquire a car immediately.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.900
From there, we'll be in Rome 
within 45 minutes.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.290
All right, got it.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.080
Perfect timing.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.660
The moon's hidden behind the clouds, too.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.470
Look, Mista.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.890
There are some drunks 
sleeping over there, too.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.430
Damn it! Was there some 
kind of party tonight or what?

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.820
Come on! You're gonna get in trouble.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.570
Come here!

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.020
Let go of me!

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.190
I said I'm gonna do it, 
so I'm gonna do it, damn it!

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.240
You can't! This isn't a bathroom!

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.040
See? It's right here.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.100
Hey.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.080
How the hell am I supposed 
to reach like this?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.880
How am I supposed to open my fly?

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.500
Wh-What the hell is that?!

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.360
Don't touch me!

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.580
Splash

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.300
What'is going on?!

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.140
That's a Stand attack!

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.020
What?!

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.470
They were waiting for us! 
There's an enemy here!

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.220
Listen well, Secco.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.390
The thing you have to worry about 
most is running out of battery.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.180
Finding out later that it didn't record 
pisses me off more than anything else.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.140
You sure it's recording?

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.750
Excellent.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.820
Cioccolata, 34 years old. A former doctor.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.530
About two years ago, he let a 
patient die due to a simple mistake.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.140
Once he was laid off from the 
hospital, Passione took him in.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.270
He could be considered a failed elite,

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:05.740
but the boss found out his true nature 
after he became a Stand user.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.290
It wasn't malpractice.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.740
He had killed patients on purpose.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.560
He diagnosed countless people 
who were perfectly healthy

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.780
as being sick and operated on them.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:25.380
He'd reduce the anesthesia so the patients 
would wake up during surgery, as well.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.970
Ever since he was a young boy, 
he had always gotten top grades.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.730
When he was fourteen, he volunteered 
to take care of the elderly.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.060
However, in reality, he was administering

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.900
unknown drugs to the 
elderly people he looked after.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.280
Also...

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.530
Your family hates you.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.200
No one's going to come visit you.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.710
He would say things like that every day,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.080
driving people to suicide.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.540
On his bookshelf at home,

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.810
he had 25 video tapes of the 
expressions the elderly made

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.260
when he told them those things.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.640
After driving nine elders to suicide,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.990
he decided he'd become a doctor.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.530
The thing that Cioccolata loved 
most was to observe people dying.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:27.470
The reason he became a doctor was so 
he could observe people's pain and death.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.950
While watching someone die,

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.450
he felt superior to the rest of humanity,

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.720
and felt as though he truly understood 
the psychology of the human race.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.900
Cioccolata's one and only partner was Secco.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.720
The only thing known about him is that 
he's Cioccolata's former patient.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.430
For some reason, they got along, 
and Secco only follows Cioccolata's orders.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.930
Even among the various Stand 
users that exist within Passione,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.250
this duo stands out as a pair of monsters.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.480
That's who Cioccolata and Secco are.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.870
It appears that their 
destination is Rome, boss.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.180
I just received word that they 
arrived at a local fishing village.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.830
Listen well, Doppio.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:23.300
Have Cioccolata stop and eliminate 
Bucciarati and his crew.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.350
But... you must catch up to 
those two, no matter what.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.200
Those two... yes.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.810
It's rare that I ever feel repulsed by others,

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.870
but Cioccolata is the worst piece 
of shit on the face of the earth.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.920
He'll probably make a mess 
of Rome before he's done.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.190
So you think he'll go berserk?

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.230
That's why you're going to 
catch up to them, Doppio.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.440
You must take control in the end.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.470
You must not let those two 
find out what Trish knows,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.280
nor what Bucciarati and his crew 
are looking for in Rome.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.040
You're the only one I can trust.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.130
Do you understand? You're number one.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.420
I understand, boss.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.510
That is what I live for.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.680
Sorry, was that call too long?

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.510
Thank you very much, little girl.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.850
Um, hewwo?

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.270
What the hell is that, Mista?! 
When did that get on you?

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.260
<c.color122130>Rum</c><c.color66693a>ble</c>

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.870
I have no idea!

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.810
Just hurry and find the user, Narancia!

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.740
Find out where the enemy is!

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.450
Li'l Bomber!

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.970
This isn't good! There are a ton 
of civilians already down!

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.790
The enemy's range is basically 
the whole village!

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.470
They actually involved innocent people in this?

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.420
This is going to make 
looking for the user...

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.090
Damn it! I can't tell them apart!

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.090
Explain the situation, Mista!

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.290
My hand just suddenly bubbled up.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.550
I have no idea when this shit got on me.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.260
It's almost like mold... 
It's making my skin rip open...

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.980
It looks like it's coming out 
from underneath my skin!

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.860
The same thing came out of the villagers, 
and their bodies have fallen apart!

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.010
Th-This isn't good, Bucciarati!

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.360
We can't go up on shore.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.900
There's no way we'll make it up 
the stairs to the parking lot.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.070
We're better off getting away 
from the shore on the boat for now.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.820
Are there any signs of 
breathing on the shore?

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.980
There's no one on the shore!

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.240
Wait, Bucciarati!

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.460
Until we know what attacked, 
it's too dangerous to move.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.980
I <i>know</i> that if we go up on shore, we're gonna 
be attacked by whatever this thing is!

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.210
Giorno!

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.710
Fwoosh!!

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.170
It's on me?!

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:46.370
This is...

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.290
Wh-Where the hell is it attacking from?!

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.670
M-Mista!

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.550
Grab on to me!

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.540
Mista! Don't stretch out your hand!

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.240
This Stand has something like a switch 
that gives it the chance to attack!

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.360
Chance to attack?

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.830
What does that mean?

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.640
As soon as I lowered my hand, 
the attack began!

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.740
Come to think of it, 
it first bubbled up on my hand

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.760
after I reached into my boot to get my gun.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.300
That drunk jumped down from 
the stairs and got attacked.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.290
<c.colorb39191>Splash</c>

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.850
The other one had gone down the stairs...

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.670
And Narancia had jumped down into the boat.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.140
Fwoosh!!

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.810
<c.color413174>Menacing</c>

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.580
So the attack begins when our 
bodies move down to a lower location?

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.310
B-But...

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.270
<c.color4f2967>Menacing</c>

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.150
<c.color3e3c55>Guuush</c>

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.150
At this rate, you guys will be...

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.860
He's not going down.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.430
He's not boarding the boat 
to save the other one.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.330
I guess he's already figured out...

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.620
exactly how...

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.780
my Green Tea works.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.680
Mold...

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.340
I've read about this before...

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.270
There's a particular type of mold 
that inhabits the inside of a bug.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.010
When that bug moves to a lower location, 
it propagates inside it and kills it.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.690
Entomopathogenic fungus 
and caterpillar fungus.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.640
This is very similar to that!

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.730
If you move to a lower location from where 
you originally were, it reacts and attacks!

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.260
This is a Stand!

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.230
Why in the world would it work like that?

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.200
To expand the Stand's range even further!

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.100
Just as the mold spreads 
from within the dead bug,

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.910
the corpses produce more corpses.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.120
If the people move a bit further before dying, 
the mold's range just keeps growing.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.200
That's exactly what they want.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.000
Because the Stand ability is 
the user's unconscious will.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.470
Climb up, Narancia!

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.130
Get off the boat and back on shore!

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.870
Mista!

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.850
Hurry up! Move forward more!

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.510
My foot!

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.060
Throw the turtle, Narancia! 
Throw it toward Mista!

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.560
<c.color79100f>P</c><c.color691e0d>l</c><c.color4f4217>o</c><c.color4e3e10>p</c>

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.160
Okay, Narancia.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.080
That's perfect. That spot's just fine!

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.200
Bang

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:11.490
Bang

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:11.740
Bang

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:11.950
Bang

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:12.200
Bang

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:12.370
Bang

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.750
You and the turtle are in 
the absolute perfect spot!

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.620
Booom

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.630
Yee-haw!

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.420
Well done, Mista!

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.740
As long as we move upward, 
their attack won't begin.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.980
They made it back up.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.500
All of those bastards made it back onto the 
shore without a single one of them dying.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.620
Interesting.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.400
Good. Excellent.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:50.000
