00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.050
You're not leaving me with any choice.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.810
My name's Formaggio.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.680
How do you like that? 
And that?! And that?! And that?!

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.560
I'm sure he plans to follow 
me all the way back.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.030
But...

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.160
I just have to make it back 
without getting followed.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.520
I'm going to follow the orders I was given!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.580
Did you hear that loud noise?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.830
I wonder what that was.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.740
Come back for now, Li'l Bomber!

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.280
That bastard is somewhere nearby, 
but I should get away from here.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.690
With all these people gathering, it'd be 
a bad idea to attack with my Stand.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.980
Huh? The bleeding's stopped already.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.320
I thought he cut me really good, too.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.160
Huh?

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.460
Where'd this knife come from?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.870
This isn't mine.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.850
My knife's not this big.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.710
Where'd mine go?

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.710
These shoes aren't mine, either! 
They're way too big!

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.440
Where the hell did my shoes go?

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.000
There's something

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.680
weird about this seat...

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.140
A-And this steering wheel.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.520
I-I can't reach!

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.420
My foot won't reach the pedals,
and this seat is huge!

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.980
I can't see through the windshield!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.260
What the hell?! This car isn't mine, either!

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.450
Where'd it go? Where'd the 
car I came here in go?!

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.790
I can't get back without it! Damn it!

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.480
Is he actually that stupid?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.210
Get a damn clue! You're shrinking!

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.500
The effects of the wound I gave 
you are finally starting to show!

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.780
W-Wait, these <i>are</i> my shoes and knife.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.340
Which means...

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.000
Did you finally figure it out, you moron?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.600
But it's too late now.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.810
You won't be able to drive like that!

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.770
S-So this is that stalker guy's Stand ability?

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.040
You're gonna tell me where 
the boss's daughter is.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.260
The battle's already begun.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.180
No one can turn back now!

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.710
Episodio 10  Hitman Team

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.960 line:20%
Hey, did you guys get my mineral water yet?

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.290
I'm thirsty.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.400
I'm about to die from thirst.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.490
I'd actually like to have lunch soon myself.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.640
I mean, I'm fine, but I need 
to feed these little guys.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.110
Feed us!

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.320
Narancia is indeed taking a while.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.530
This is why I was worried about him going.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.120
Drop it, Fugo. How many times 
must you bring this up?

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.980
I'm not going to drop it! After I—

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.790
I-I apologize.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.100
Anything cut by my Tiny Feet becomes small.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.810
It does take a little while for the 
ability to go into effect, though.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.270
The clothes and bandana you have 
on now are shrinking with you.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.470
Your shoe and knife, which were separated 
from your body, have stopped shrinking,

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.410
which means that the more you shrink, 
the fewer things you'll be able to use.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.390
O-Oh, yeah! I need to get a hold 
of Bucciarati and the others!

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.680
Ow! What the hell's with 
that automated door?!

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.350
I'm still shrinking?

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.810
This door...

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.190
I've become so light that it won't open!

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.670
Exactly, you moron.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.690
Still...

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.510
I have to get to that phone as soon 
as possible so they can help me!

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.830
It opened, damn it!

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.400
It's useless!

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.710
It looks like you haven't realized this, but 
your clothes and wallet are shrinking with you.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.260
You need a telephone card or 
coins to use the pay phone!

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.520
It only takes coins that are the right size!

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.230
Narancia's Height: 62.5cm

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.000
This guy might be smarter than I thought...

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.540
This isn't good.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.580
Having his friends find out my 
ability is the last thing I need.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.840
And if Bucciarati finds out about this,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.550
he'll move the boss's daughter somewhere else!

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.510
That definitely can't happen!

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.720
I'm not gonna let that happen!

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.480
H-He's here! That bastard's 
gotta be around here somewhere!

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.270
Where are you? 
Are you hiding under the phone?

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.230
Come out here, damn it!

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.460
This is perfect.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.390
Are you over here?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.530
In a few more minutes, he'll shrink 
down to the size of a cockroach.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.530
Where are you?!

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.520
Narancia's Height: 58.0cm

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.820 line:20%
His Stand's size and power will 
get so small, it'll be powerless,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.120
and then I'll be able to 
torture the shit out of him.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.500
Then I'll win!

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.080
I guess I don't have a choice.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.220
He shouldn't be able to find me, 
but I just have to wait a little longer...

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.220 line:20%
I finally figured it out, you bastard!

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.970
You're in my right ass pocket!

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.990
Now I've got you! 
The ability to become smaller?

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.660
Were you in my pocket this whole time?

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.190
Damn it. But you sure are tiny...

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.570
Wait... How did he figure 
out I was in his pocket?!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.660
Shoot him dead, Li'l Bomber!

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.410
T-Turn back!

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.270
Wha—

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.700
A b-ballpoint pen?!

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.040
Narancia's Height: 53.0cm

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.000
Damn it! Where'd you go?!

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.540
What the hell did you do?!

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.470
That stalker bastard! Where are you?!

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.350
That was a close one.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.170
When my Tiny Feet shrinks 
something other than myself,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.750
it takes a while because 
of the energy it needs,

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.650
but when I turn things back to normal size,

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.690
I can do it instantly, like I 
did with that ballpoint pen.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.550
The repulsion it created in that moment

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.910
was enough to send me flying over here.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.530
But how'd he figure out 
that I was in his pocket?

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.380
Did I move around too 
much and tickle his ass?

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.300
I-Impossible!

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.840
I hid immediately! How'd it find me?!

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.020
There you are! You're not getting 
away, you stalker bastard!

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.060
It's coming after me!

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.120
Th-This is bad! Tiny Feet!

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.090
Wh-Where'd that bastard go?!

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.820
That was way too close.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.020
If the air pressure from the tire hadn't 
sent me flying, I would've been done for!

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.480
But I'm sure it won't find me down—

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.570
Y-You can't be serious! Shit!

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.990
This Stand's ability isn't 
just shooting endlessly!

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.500
It's somehow finding me, 
and it's definitely following me!

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:14.900
And it's not like it's seeing or 
hearing my movements.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.710
That wouldn't explain how it 
figured out I was in his pocket

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.130
or how it knew where the tire's 
air pressure sent me flying.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.230
I found you! You're down in that drain!

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.250
I-It can even find me underwater?!

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.270
Tiny Feet!

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:02.720
D-Damn it! Think, think, 
think, think, think!

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.470
I can't die here!

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.210
The Hitman Team has nine members.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.990
Formaggio is one of them.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.450
2 years ago / Naples

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.780
I'm planning to address the trash 
problem at next week's assembly.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.890
Are you sure it'll be okay?

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.560
Don't worry. I'm just going to tell the 
Minister of Tourism the right answer.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.040
It's the same thing as usual.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.070
I always worry that you might 
be pushing yourself too hard.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.530
Dear, don't you think you're 
drinking too much today?

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.780
What the hell, Pesci?

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.820
Are you drinking milk again?

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:09.940
B-But my stomach sorta turns 
when I drink espresso.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.680
That's why you're such a mammoni, Pesci!

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.840
Just by drinking that milk, it's possible 
you're making us lamer by association.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.790
Why do you think we even 
bring you along, anyway?

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.680
You need to correct things like that first.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.370
O-Okay...

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.310
So, Formaggio, how are things going?

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.820
That's all yours, Pesci. 
A little gift from me to you.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.310
Looks like things went well.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.530
Yeah, the job's basically done.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.410
Now we just have to watch it happen.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.420
Let's get this over with 
and watch a soccer match.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.000
Narancia Ghirga

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.000
Li'l Bomber

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.900
It was delicious.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.280
Thank you very much.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.260
We'll be waiting for your return.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.340
All right, let's finish things off.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.190
That was wonderful.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.700
I'm glad I went with the white tod—

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.520
What's the matter, dear? Are you in pain?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.330
Hey! What the hell are you 
doing parking here?!

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.900
Get outta the way!

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.470
W-Wait, what's that coming out 
from underneath the car?

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.710
Th-Th-That's blood!

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.110
All right, let's go home.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.600
What's the matter, Pesci? 
Did your knees give out?

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.310
We're back!

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.850
How'd it go?

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.570
Perfectly!

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.160
The guy's been blown to bits.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.570
But you ended up killing the chick 
he was with in the process, too.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.040
I guess this job was perfect 
for your useless Stand ability.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.120
Whatever, man. If you got a problem, 
take care of this yourself.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.950 line:20%
As much as I'd love to, 
the leader wants me to conserve

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.320
Melone, how much was this job?

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.820 line:20%
my ability until we absolutely need to use it.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.890
Twenty million lire.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.330
Damn, that's cheap!

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.830
Ghiaccio, calm down. 
We'll talk about money later.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.670
More importantly...

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.850
Where are Sorbet and Gelato?

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.590
Are they playing hooky?

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.500
Maybe they're getting it on somewhere.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.790
They're a couple, aren't they?

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.100
And you call my Stand ability useless?

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.570
No, something's definitely wrong.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.560
Gelato's one thing, but Sorbet would 
never miss out on a chance to get rich.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.860
He's always made sure to 
show up to claim his share.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.050
Once an organization is established 
and starts to mature as a group,

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.800
there will always be people within 
that group who want to rebel.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.640
When smuggling cheap drugs 
coming from Central Asia

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.310
to various countries in 
Europe as well as America,

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.670
they make a profit that's 
tens to hundreds of times more.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.140
Which means it's not the least bit strange

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.250
that there will be those 
who show up and try

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.110
to take over the boss's territory, 
even at the risk of their own lives.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.690
Did you find them?

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.560
No, there's no sign of them.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.890
They must've been dealt 
with because they were

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.030
trying to find out who the boss was!

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.530
It's definitely possible.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.570
They're two crazy bastards.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.950
Polpo's in control of all the gambling,

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.550
and the jerks selling the drugs 
are also making a fortune.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.460
But the only thing that we, the Hitman 
Team, get is our pay from the boss!

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.390
This ain't fair!

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.380
We're the best there is in the 
whole damn organization!

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.990
We deserve way better!

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.530
He suffocated?

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.090
Yeah... Just Gelato, though.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.810
Sorbet's corpse isn't here.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.520
"Punishment"

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.000 line:20%
Punishment...

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:23.710
A few days later, a bunch of packages with 
no sender were delivered to the team.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.960
Seriously? Again?

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.380
Who the hell's the sender?!

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.350
Frames?

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.300
They're not paintings, though.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.830
Is this what they call 
modern art or some shit?

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.890
There's something weird in them.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.100
Hey!

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.980
Th-That's the same color nail 
polish that Sorbet always wears!

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.510
I-I've seen it before...

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.710
He and Gelato use the same shade!

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.870
Get the frames out and line them up.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.500
There were a total of 
36 of these art pieces.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.620
Oh, hell no...

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.930
You can't be serious... This is...

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.970
I don't want to see any more!

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.970
Shut up!

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.910
That's...

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.750
They were pieces of Sorbet's body, 
chopped up and preserved in formalin.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.150
When they put his face together, 
they saw that it was distorted in fear.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:48.960
He was likely cut into pieces by a 
very sharp knife, starting with his toes.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.960
It was a rather intense 
way of getting killed.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.890
That day, the Hitman Team 
came to a new understanding.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.600
D-Do you think that Sorbet

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.560
was sliced up right in front of Gelato?

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.610
Yeah. And he was so overcome 
with fear and despair

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:14.680
that he choked on his 
own gag and suffocated!

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.120
This was a silent message from the boss.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.120
All of you...

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.460
Forget all about Sorbet and Gelato.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.730
From then on, they ended up 
getting the cold shoulder.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.680
They never tried to find out 
the boss's identity ever again.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.220
At least, not until...

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.710
they found out that the 
boss had a daughter.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.070
Damn it! I'm not going to 
die in a place like this!

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.620
We're gonna kill the boss and 
take over his drug route!

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.700
We're gonna claw our way 
up from this hellhole!

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.250
It's riddled with holes?

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.460
He shot that rat to death? Why?

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.830
C-Could it be...

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.100
It went the other way.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.360
It's looking around for me.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.820
Breathing?! So that's it!

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:42.030
Narancia's Stand, Li'l Bomber, 
detects its target when they breathe!

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.950
Mosquitoes find animals to suck 
blood from by searching for

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.330
the CO<font size="16">2 </c><font size="24">that they exhale.</c>

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.070
This is the same thing!

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.540
So that's how he found 
out I was in his pocket!

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:58.170
Come to think of it, when all those 
randos showed up in the alleyway,

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.160
he stopped searching for me.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.680
There was a chance he would've 
shot one of those randos!

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.390
It had detected my breathing!

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.350
There you are!

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.860
He shot again!

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.270
Looks like he can't tell the 
difference between me and the rats.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.270
In that case...

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.570
Look at those creepy little shits...

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:29.410
Th-These numbers... 
and this movement pattern...

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.460
The ones that are breathing must be rats!

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.390
Their speed is the same!

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.290
They're all going the same direction!

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.460
A threat... You were only a threat 
when I didn't know how you worked.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.580
How were you finding me?

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.720
Now that I know that, you're more 
harmless than a mosquito,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.890
Narancia!

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.840
I win, Narancia!

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.120
I'm gonna get the hell outta here and 
wait for you to shrink into nothing!

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.700
H-How?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.830
The same movement...

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.830
All of them are moving the same way,

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:14.870
but there's only one rat 
who's breathing really hard...

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.310
Are you tired? You're out of breath.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.720
Is there something heavy on top of you 
that's making it hard to breathe?

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.470
I think it might be worth it to shoot 
the shit out of that fatty there!

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.390
Shit!

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.520
Yes! A clean shot!

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.930
Th-That was close...

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.280
If I hadn't returned to my normal 
size, I would've been done for!

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.930 line:20%
If time hadn't passed to the 
point of you becoming so small

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.490
Narancia's Height: 13.2cm

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.030 line:20%
that your Stand power 
was rendered useless...

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.770
I would've been a goner!

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.040
I-I didn't get him!

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.050
Did I become so small that Li'l 
Bomber's power also shrank?

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.330
My attacks won't work anymore!

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.680
Episodio 11
Narancia's Li'l Bomber
