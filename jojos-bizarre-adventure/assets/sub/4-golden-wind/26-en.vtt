Episodio 26 A Little Story From the Past ~My Name Is Doppio~

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.360 line:20%
This is a little story from the past.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.310
Summer, 1965

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.860
We're going back to the summer of 1965.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.910
Prisoner 696! What's going on here?!

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.040
Prisoner 696!

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.540
Did you eat something bad?

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.770
She's pregnant?

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.800
This is a women's prison on a remote island.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.080
There are only women here!

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.860
Not to mention, this prisoner

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.690
was sentenced to ten years 
for bank robbery and assault.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.750
She's been here for two years already.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.750 line:20%
Push! Just a little bit more!

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.660
When could she have gotten pregnant?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.010
She wasn't big earlier today.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.820
And now...

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.450
Hey, you! Who the hell's this kid's father?!

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.820
He's... dead...

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.690
For over two years... now...

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.560
You can't be serious.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.040
A barnacle growing in your knee 
would be more believable than that.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.340
Looks like the baby made it.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.380
Yes... But something's strange.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.150
The baby's eyes have been 
open ever since he was born.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.690
And he's not crying at all.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.090
This goes without saying, 
but we can't raise a baby here.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.870
We'll find someone to take him.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.720
Where are you from?

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.500
Sar...di...nia...

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.600
A priest at a small church 
there took the child in.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.700
Time passed, and the boy 
became known as someone

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.990
rather cowardly and a bit slow.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.720
June, 1985

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.680 line:20%
Well, I'll be going now. 
See you later, Mr. Frog.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.310
Hey, watch it!

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.880
Oh, it's you.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.570
Walk closer to the edge, you dumbass!

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.380
Don't you dare tell the priest about this.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.640
Th-That was close...

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.260
But I'm glad you didn't get squished.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.120
Do you like frogs?

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.780
I like frogs, too.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.700
I hate bugs, though.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.170
I also don't like guys who smell.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.130
I hate everything that's not beautiful.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.770
Are you from around here?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.020
Y-Yeah...

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.970
Say, it's a bit hot out. 
Want to get something to drink?

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.530
Well...

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.240
That's not a bad idea.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.570
Then I want sparkling water.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.300
Hard water from France.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.450
I hope you're treating.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.070
You want to become a sailor?

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.250
Yeah...

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.710
Well...

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.310
You're a simple man.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.180
That's probably best for you.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.480
Oh?

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.650
He walked all this way?

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.450
Good on him.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.780
<i>It might be a good idea to get him a car.</i>

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.810
In order to build a garage next to his room,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.660
the priest started digging 
into the floor with a pick.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.330
What's this?

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.530
A corpse?

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.510
No, it's...

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.220
As he carefully picked at the concrete...

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.880
The person he discovered was a woman.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.740
It was the woman who gave birth 
to the boy the priest took in.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.390
Sh-She's alive...

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.860
She couldn't move nor talk, 
but somehow, she was being kept alive.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.400
How many years had it been?

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.380
The woman had no sense of time.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.160
Hatred? Love?

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.330
Her heart was dark.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.690
This hair color...

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.530
That night, the whole village burned,

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.750
with strong winds carrying 
the fire to every single house.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.270
No one knows how it started.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.370
Seven people died, and others went missing.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.190
On the list of the deceased were

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.200
the names of the priest
and the boy he'd taken in.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.730
Olbia, Sardinia: Present Day

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.690
Why, you!

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.500
Hey, kid! Look out!

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.040
Shut up. I know.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.460
There's a truck coming, right?

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.110
You bastard!

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.970
Where the hell do you think 
you're walking, you dumbass?!

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.060
O-Ow...

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.650
Aw, man... Ow.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.550
Guess I had the wrong idea.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.690
Looks like you're down on your luck. 
Having a bad day?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.620
Or have you been having 
a streak of bad luck?

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.780
I'd say so. I've had one problem after another.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.310
Why not let me tell your fortune?

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.010
I'll make it cheap.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.050
Huh? Nah, I'll pass...

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.790
Sardinia is your home, isn't it?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.940
And it's been a while since you've 
been back here, hasn't it?

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.650
I wouldn't call that fortunetelling.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
You can tell I'm a traveler 
just by looking at me.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.900
Anyone could figure that out.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.880
You're... living with a secret.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.490
Light and shadow, 
what's inside and what's out.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.170
You could probably call 
it two separate lives.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.910
But you take advantage of that secret 
and have an unyielding personality,

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.790
which has earned you nothing but victories.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.550
What?

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.640
Oh, please forgive my rudeness.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.140
There's something about your face that is 
very intriguing to someone in my field.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.210
Please, let me tell you your fortune.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.110
I'll make it 20,000... no, 10,000 lire.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.830
Everyone has their secrets.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.150
That's a pretty broad statement.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.310
You're looking for someone.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.620
You're currently looking for 
someone very important to you.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.350
Seriously...

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.430
Everyone spends their 
lives looking for someone.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.210
A beautiful girlfriend or a good friend...

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.050
But I guess it's nice to 
hear these things at times.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.810
How do you go about doing it?

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.170
With that crystal ball?

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.560
No... I've already begun.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.350
I can tell just by looking at the shape 
of the mud splatter on your pants.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.620
It's been said for thousands of years 
that in Romani fortunetelling,

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.090
the best results come from looking at the 
shape of something that formed coincidentally.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.030
Because that is the symbol of fate.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.490
Your daughter...

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.930
Yes.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.510
The person you're looking 
for is your daughter.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:25.460
You came back to Sardinia to find the child 
of the woman you left fifteen years ago...

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.200
Huh?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.170
Huh? Er... Something's strange.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.850
You're rather young...

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.090
I know what I just said, 
but this is strange...

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.600
Whose child? Mine?

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.430
But you have one. I'm sure of it.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.020
Let me see your palm!

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.510
Hey!

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.750
Please! My pride as a fortuneteller 
is on the line here!

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.780 line:20%
Let go of my hand... Don't touch me...

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.800
I won't ask for payment... 
Actually, I'll pay you!

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.590
20,000... No, I'll pay you 100,000 lire!

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.520
Please!

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.900
You're friggin' annoying! Don't touch me!

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.490
What good would it do 
for you to see it, huh?!

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.700
Considering you're about to die!

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.840
Your face... Your age...

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.420
It appears you're not a Stand user.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.680
You have the wisdom to see people

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.830
for who they really are, 
and you made that your business.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.640
That was your greatest failing.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:26.850
No one in this world is allowed 
to know who I really am.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.010
But I now know that you are indeed 
an excellent fortuneteller.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:37.600
Out of respect for that, I'll be sure to kill 
you instantly so you don't feel any pain.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.820
So answer my question...

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.100
This man's name is Risotto.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.580
He's a traitor.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.230
He is also looking for my daughter 
and trying to find out my true identity.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.790
I want you to tell me where he is right now.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.830
Where he is?

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.230
I can't tell that much...

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.010
But I'm sure you'll encounter him soon.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.800
He's here in Sardinia...

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.960
He is filled with vengeance,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.310
and you will certainly encounter him here.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.560
I see. Very well.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.180
That's plenty.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.240
I knew it!

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.550
I was right! Light and shadow, 
what's inside and what's out.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.070
Two personalities!

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.260
As long as you bear this secret, the death 
of people will bring you good fortune,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.900
and you will never lose your splendor!

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.080
What a beautiful palm!

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.540
I've never seen a hand like this before!

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.860
Huh? Something's wrong. 
It suddenly looks strange.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.240
The lifeline is totally different...

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.550
I see!

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.520
This is my own hand! 
It changed before I even realized it!

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.730
Emperor Crimson.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.040
You...

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.830
I'm so glad you weren't squished.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.830
It's dangerous to be on the sidewalk.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.290
Go on, shoo.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.390
Be careful. Go on.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.310
Huh?

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.700
Where to, sir?

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.200
Costa Smeralda, please.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.980
You got it.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.160
And now for our next story,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.360
the investigations involving the site of 
the crash off the Olbia coast in Sardinia.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.370
However...

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.670
Driver, do you have a cell phone?

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.790
Mine broke...

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.900
No, I don't. Sorry.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.270
I see...

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.930
C-Could you stop for a sec, driver?

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.360
I'll get out here! This is fine!

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.500
I'll get out here.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.240
That's the building.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.350
There's no doubt about it.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.270
I just have to keep an eye out over there.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.190
Costa Smeralda in Sardinia.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.340
This area was forgotten by history 
until about half a century ago,

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.120
when a certain millionaire from India was 
enamored by the scenery of this coast,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.870
where the winds and cliffs met,
and started living there.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.190
Hey, wait a sec!

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.050
There seems to be an extra 
digit on your meter...

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.270
So you actually think I rigged the meter

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.140
because I wanted more money?

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.930
Is that what you think? Huh?!

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.260
N-No... But 800,000 lire to get from 
the city to here seems a bit...

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:53.920
I don't have that much.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.390
Like hell a guy on vacation doesn't have money!

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.360
I know you hid some in your pocket earlier.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.940
I saw you hide an envelope in your pants.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.150
Don't—

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.780
Come on, let me see.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.370
Don't touch me... I-I'm getting a headache...

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.950
See? I knew it.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.870
You friggin' idiot!

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.620
Those who have seen what 
they shouldn't have seen

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.300
don't need to exist in this world!

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.810
Y-You bastard...

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.920
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.980
Hey... Did you just hear a phone ring?

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.600
Huh?

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.140
Where did it come from?

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.910
Hey! I asked you a question!

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.980
That phone's busted, so there's 
no way it could've rung!

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.860
H-Hell if I know! What are you—

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.570
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.070
There it is again! Where is it?

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.470
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.480
Where is it?

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.700
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.620
Hey, what the hell? You have a car phone!

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.230
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.550
Hello? Yes, this is Doppio.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.530
Boss... Yes, I just arrived.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.350
It's the spot in the photo.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.930
I just need to keep an eye 
on this place, right?

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.220
Huh? The driver didn't see 
what was in the envelope,

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.030
so I don't need to finish him off?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.100
If I may interject, Boss,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.280
I believe he saw the photo that 
he wasn't supposed to see.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.430
Right. I'm very sorry, Boss.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.200
Yes, I'm about to start watching the building.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.430
You're about to watch the building?

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.660
No, my Doppio.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.390
Take a good look. Slowly... Naturally.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.470
Don't do anything suspicious.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.130
The one who's being watched...

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.400
is you, Doppio.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.470
Th-That's Risotto! The traitor assassin!

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.430
He appeared just like 
the fortuneteller said!

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.660
Apparently, due to the plane crash,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.360
he came to notice the existence of this 
photo of Sardinia that was at Trish's house.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.370
We need to take care of him first.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.570
Otherwise, he'll interfere 
once Trish arrives.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.950
I'll be the one to finish him off.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:19.060
We need to get close to him without 
him figuring out my true identity.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.330
Risotto's ability is a 
mystery to me, as well.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.230
Draw him out about two meters away from you.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.800
Then he'll definitely be within 
Emperor Crimson's range.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.600
You can do it.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.490
I'm hanging up, my Doppio.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.750
Yes, I understand, Boss.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.520
Beep.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.640
What's this? My head... It hurts.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.710
O-Oh, yeah. I don't have time 
to worry about a headache.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.690
I just had a call from the boss.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.700
My mission is to keep an eye 
on that building and... uh...

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.410
What was it again?

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.550
Get closer?

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.950
Right! I have to get closer!

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.910
But to what?

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.830
I won't get closer to you.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.260
Look over here.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.500
Wh-What the?!

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.350
But I think I've seen him before...

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.560
Wh-Who is he again?

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.810
Move your hand.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.750
Otherwise, I can't see your face.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.810
I-I don't have any money!

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.880
B-Blood!

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.570
Why does this always happen to me?!

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.870
Maybe I just imagined it.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.160
The ignorance and fear in his 
expression are not an act.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.500
If he was from Passione, 
he wouldn't act like this.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.670
Not to mention, he's more 
unguarded than a baby.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.520
He must be a civilian.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.100
Please don't!

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.610
Stop fussing. I'm just 
going to pick up my knife.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.970
I don't care about you anymore.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.480
I-I don't feel so good... My head hurts...

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.480
T-Two meters...

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.450
That's right.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.400
There was just one thing you 
did that seemed like an act.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.100
When you fell,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.280
you reflexively hid the envelope 
so I wouldn't see it, didn't you?

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.120
It's right under your left shoe.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.910
What are you hiding?

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.550
If I'm satisfied with what I see, I'll leave.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.050
What is your deal?!

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.520
I-I don't have any money! Just let me go!

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:40.210
It wasn't murderous intent or hostility, 
but your expression there seemed fake.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.930
Stand up, move your left leg, and show me.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.350
I told you to stand up! Stand up!

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.520
Oh, so it's just an envelope.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.860
There's nothing in it.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.770
Your trembling certainly isn't an act,

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.030
and I can tell you're a 
coward who can't lie.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:08.460
But now... I'm even more interested in you.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.680
You're definitely a Stand user.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.500
You heard that sound, too, didn't you?

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.670
Just now, you glanced over toward that sound.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.260
That's the sound of scouting.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.790
It's carefully scouting the area.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.390
That sound and shape...

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.730
is Li'l Bomber!

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.060
They've finally made it here!

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.360
And who are you to show up to 
such an important location?

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.710
It must mean that the 
boss trusts you greatly.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.020
But there is true fear in your heart.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.990
You're a walking contradiction!

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.350
Shut your trap!

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.660
You're the one who's about 
to be shaking in your boots!

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.720
I see.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.130
Since you're running toward me, 
you must be a close-ranged power type.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.400
Your range is around two to three meters.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.300
As long as I know that, 
I know how I'll kill you.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.310
What... the... M-My throat!

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.470
Th-These are...

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.230
actual razor blades?!

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.070
T-Two meters, damn it!

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.530
I'll shove these razor 
blades right up your ass!

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.740
I told you, I know how I'll kill you.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.750
Impossible! I'm not done yet, damn it!

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.130
H-He disappeared?

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.840
That's his... That's his assassin ability...

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.840
But how...

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.100
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.770
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.850
There's a phone ringing somewhere!

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.000
Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.630
I can't believe it!

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.940
There just happens to be a 
pay phone in a place like this!

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.570
Click!

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.040
Beep!

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.910
Hello?!

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.830
My Doppio...

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.370
Wh-Where are you, Boss?

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.330
Are you nearby?

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.030
If you are, please come quickly!

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.420
I cannot.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.420
I cannot go there until you 
get close enough to him.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.410
Because everything will be over

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.140
if he happens to see me and 
then manages to escape.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.370
B-But—

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.970
You need to get closer. You need to 
get within two meters of Risotto!

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.670
Boss! I don't know what his ability is!

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.440
He could attack me again at any second!

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.270
Doppio...

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.990
Oh, Doppio...

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.760
My adorable little Doppio...

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:48.820
Did you forget that I gave you a portion 
of my Emperor Crimson's power?

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.730
Now is the time to use it!

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.630
Episodio 27
Emperor Crimson vs. Metallic
