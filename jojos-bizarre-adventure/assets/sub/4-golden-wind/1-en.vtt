00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.530
Hey, mister! This is the best deal 
you're going to find in town!

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.500
That's exactly what the other guy said.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.780
Then as a bonus, I'll give 
you a tour of the city!

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.870
Seriously?

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.350
Hilarious!

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.730
Huh? What?

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.720
What's wrong?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.060
My bag is gone!

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.830
What?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.290
Here you go.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.110
So, any changes lately?

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.560
Not at all, thanks to you.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.670
I see.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.020
Sorry to bother you.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.960
This is what you want, right?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.930
Yeah!

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.900
Oh, but this is all I have right now.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.390
Then this is all I can sell you.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.870
Naples: a city located in southern Italy.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.430
It's a famous tourist spot so beautiful that

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.010
people say you should see it 
at least once before you die.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.390
Pardon us.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.460
How do you get to Santa Chiara?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.360
Oh, to get to Santa Chiara, go straight, 
and then, at the first light—

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.010
See? I told you!

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.570
I told you it was over there.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.020
My bad...

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.850
Thanks so mu—

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.140
Whoa, there.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.650
Are you all right?

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770
Th-Thank you...

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.770
Um, I'm sorry about that.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.440
Be more careful.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.700
Let's go.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.430
Hey.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.190
You dropped this.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.330
Thank you so much!

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.640
No problem.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.710
Hey, wasn't that guy super cool?

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.780
I should've asked for a picture.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600
Did those just come out of my bag?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.350
What? They probably just 
landed on it for a second.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.730
Yeah, you're right.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520
You can't let your guard down in this city.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.150
Pardon me.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.370
Could I get a cone with a scoop of 
chocolate and a scoop of pistachio?

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.630
Make that two.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.600
You got it.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.390
Episodio 01   Golden Wind

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.900
Hey! How many times do I have to tell you

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.970
that you can't run your business 
here without a license?

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.630
Move your car!

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.930
Honestly...

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.390
You only moved one car length away!

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.370
So, whaddya say? It's faster than lining up.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.620
What do you think?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.320
I'll get you into the city real cheap.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.360
Really? How cheap?

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.730
L-Luca!

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.590
Didn't I tell you that you need to pay

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.960
the protection fees you owe me 
before doing any more business?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.620
You can't be serious!

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.020
I told you that you need to pay 
the protection fees you owe me

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.570
before doing any more business, right?

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.000
But...

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.190
Right?!

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.760
But I have a family...

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.880
P-Please stop!

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.060
You should think more about your 
friendship with me than your family...

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.710
Got it?

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.360
I'm not the only one ignoring 
you to keep doing business!

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.230
Well, who?

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.030
Who is it?

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.280
I-It's Giorno! Giorno Giovanna!

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.760
Giorno?

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.280
That kid's been making a fortune lately!

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.780
Giorno?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.630
Well, I'll deal with him later.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.470
Hey, you!

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.530
You can't run your business 
here without a license!

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.600
Go somewhere else!

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.410
Buon giorno!

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.230
I'm finally here!

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.670
That flight was so long!

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.340
The air sure is different here!

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.650
Now, then, time to get to work.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.620
Haruno Shiobana... That's an unusual name.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.810
First, I need to get to my hotel.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.950
I want to dump my luggage so I can 
move around a bit more freely.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.100
Let's see... Where's the taxi pick-up...

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.920
Whoa, that's amazing!

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.020
I know, right? That trick is amazing!

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.800
This shouldn't be possible!

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.750
How are you even doing that?

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.670
That's so gross!

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.660
How'd you stuff your whole 
ear into your head?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.600
Man, that was entertaining!

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.560
Thanks.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.760
Don't attract too much attention 
with your job here.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.430
Looking for a taxi?

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.560
No, n-not really...

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.280
You sure?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.910
I'm just finishing up my part-time job and 
about to head home, so I'll make it cheap.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.540
How about 180,000 lire to 
get you into the city?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.670
180,000? That's... about 10,000 yen.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.920
That's way too expensive!

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.910
The basic rate is about half that!

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.340
Wow, you speak the language perfectly.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.080
Huh?

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.820
Did you used to live in Italy?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.790
No, I just had Rohan-sensei make it 
so I could speak... Never mind that!

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.350
M-More importantly, you're saying you'll drive?

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.790
You look like you're only in 
middle school or high school.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.960
And I saw you give the 
security guys something.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.500
I'm pretty sure I saw some money. 
What's that about?

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.070
Come on, now. You don't need 
to worry about those things.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.200
Okay, how about for 10,000 lire?

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.500
I won't even ask for a tip.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.110
I'll take you into the 
city for exactly 10,000.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.940
Huh? 10,000 would be about... 500 yen?!

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.040
No, it's okay.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.310
I'll just wait at the taxi pick-up...

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.580
Are you sure?

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.740
You'll really only charge 10,000?

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.910
Yup.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.220
But you'll have to load your 
luggage on your own.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.550
Since I'm not asking for a tip.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.770
Put your luggage up front. 
You can sit in the back.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.000
Just so you know,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.150
you'd better not think of me as some 
Japanese tourist who's not used to traveling.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.560
Just get me to my hotel in earnest.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.320
Yes. I'll get you there in earnest.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.780
Or should I say... 
I'll get your empty luggage there.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.700
Huh? Wait... I didn't even get in yet...

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.430
Keep your mouth shut!

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040
Don't tell me...

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.520
Hold it!

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.590
Ciao!

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.670
Reverb Act 3!

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.690
Too bad for you...

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.990
Didn't I tell you not to underestimate me?

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.570
You can run if you want.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.030
As long as my luggage is safe, I don't care.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.280
Look at that! Giorno actually screwed up!

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.170
That's what he gets for trying to trick

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.960
a Japanese tourist when he's 
half Japanese himself!

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.660
Though people would never 
be able to tell he's Japanese,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.500
with that hair color and a 
name like Giorno Giovanna.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.050
It couldn't be...

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.500
Huh? It's gone! How?!

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.220
Is this some kind of egg?

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.800
I-Is it a Stand?! But that's impossible!

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.400
Would one show up the 
second I get to Italy?!

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.660
That's not a Stand! The way that frog felt...

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.540
It's actually alive!

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.550
But seriously, how'd my suitcase disappear?!

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.440
He didn't have any time to hide it!

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.790
This is horrible!

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.880
This is only a hunch, but...

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.490
Excuse me!

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.800
Could I ask you some questions 
about that taxi driver?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.740
I think it's about time...

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.770
Are you Giorno Giovanna?

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.820
This is the first time we're meeting.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.530
Do you know who I am, Giorno?

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.000
Leaky Eye Luca.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.580
I heard that

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.250
even after someone stabbed a knife deep 
into your face, you didn't stop fighting.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.430
And because of that,

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.840
even though your wound has healed, 
your eye is always watering.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.050
Hey, why don't you have a seat right here?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.980
Come on, sit down.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.300
It's tiring having to look up at you to talk.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.800
How old are you?

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.500
Fifteen.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.430
Fifteen?! Wow, you're just a kid!

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:19.290
Say, Giorno, there are three "yous" 
to remember in friendship.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.580
Three "yous," got that?

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.890
The first one is you don't lie.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.930
The second one is you don't hold grudges.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.830
And the third is you respect the other.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.300
Sounds good, right? Those are 
the three "yous" of friendship.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.130
Can I help you?

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:40.090
Smack

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.310
<i>I'm</i> the one talking right now!

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.100
Who said you could ask 
questions, you dumbass?!

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.180
I heard you've been working 
part-time around the airport...

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.130
I, Leaky Eye Luca, haven't received

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.810
any of the gifts that you should've 
given me out of respect yet.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.110
How do you expect our 
friendship to last like that?

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.920
Let me take a peek at your wallet.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.820
Luca.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.830
I already paid my protection fees. 
I don't have any money.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.810
To the security guards?!

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.380
That has nothing to do with me!

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.000
What's this? A photo of a family member?

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.900
Where's my money?

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.880
I want the money! Show me your wallet!

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.010
Luca...

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.300
Don't make me say the same thing twice.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.580
I told you, I already paid, 
so I don't have any.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.640
Don't make me say it a third time.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.360
You little shit!

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.080
What the hell is that creature?

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.280
It came back.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.450
Smack it off!

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.070
This frog has nothing to do with this.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.780
I won't smack it off.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.620
I gave you an order, and I told 
you to pay me a protection fee!

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.420
So you're going to disobey both of those?

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.840
You're going to tell me, Leaky Eye Luca, 
"no" to both of those things?!

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.860
This is a living creature 
that has its own conscience,

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.720
and it's thinking on its own.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.430
You really shouldn't.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.520
You're... You're...

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.530
I could never just smack it off.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.470
Don't! It's harmless as long 
as you don't do anything!

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.050
You're finished!

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.610
Whack

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.190
I told you not to.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.910
It's not even that loyal to me yet.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:32.310
It's just trying to protect itself. 
It has its own life.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:43.100
Any attack on it becomes an attack 
on oneself, and it's fatal.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.010
And...

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.980
I asked you not to make me say it a third time.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.770
Making me say the same 
thing over and over again

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.000
is useless.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.730
And I hate that because it's useless.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.670
Totally useless.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.130
A piece of this guy's skin?

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.430
Yeah. I want you to get a sample 
of it and send it to me, Koichi,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.340
so the Speedwagon Foundation 
can check its composition.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.960
Its composition? Who is this guy?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.870
His father, who died, was a bit special.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.760
That's why we want to investigate.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.430
It can be thin. I just need 
you to get me a piece.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.860
That's it.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.180
I see...

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.570
I'll cover all your expenses for this trip.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.390
What?! All of them?

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.610
Hmm...

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:42.010
I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but this 
guy sort of looks like you, Jotaro.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.920
The address on this picture 
is somewhere around here...

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.770
How careless.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.540
You don't need to worry about them.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.920
No one around here is dumb enough 
to try and steal their briefcase.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.090
Oh... I guess this is a nice neighborhood.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.040
Hey, can I sit next to you?

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.500
Would you like to come in for a meal, sir?

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.800
No, I'm going to sit next to him!

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.480
N-No, it's okay!

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.180
Hey, Giorno! Have some tea with me!

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.540
What? Wait, I'll pay for you!

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.600
You guys are too loud.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.600
No, me! Me!

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.100
I like being alone. Go away.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.570
Fine...

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.440
See you tomorrow, Giorno!

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.740
Ciao!

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.280
Th-That's—

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.700
Hey! Whose money is that?! 
Are you using my money?!

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.690
You?! How'd you know I was here?

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.930
Give me back my passport! 
Where's my luggage?!

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.170
It hurts me to say this,

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.540
but they're gone. 
I sold them off, unfortunately.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.170
So stop following me.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.340
You're not getting away this time!

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.150
What's with this weight?

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.220
Wait... So that wasn't 
a malfunction earlier?

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.120
Don't tell me... he has the same 
kind of powers as me...

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.110
What did you just say?

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.900
It's heavy!

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.030
Golden Wind!

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.700
Life, spring forth!

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.040
Bring forth new life!

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.960
I think I just caught a glimpse of something.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.330
Act 3!

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.050
That bastard disappeared.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.160
That's impossible!

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.770
There's no way he'd be able to escape 
3 Freeze's range that easily!

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.350
I'll say this one more time. 
Don't even think about coming after me.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.460
I hate saying things twice 
when I shouldn't have to.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.780
Because it's useless to say it twice.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.290
I'll say this for your own good.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.400
You shouldn't do things that are useless.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.020
Knock him down, Act 3!

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.680
Th-The attack on the tree 
came back to me...

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.330
I took something of yours,

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.840
but I can tell you held back 
when you were trying to hit me,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.720
when I see what that damage has done to you.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.930
You're a good person.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.670
There's no doubt about it.
Giorno Giovanna...

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.770
He's a Stand user!

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.950
Giorno Giovanna

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.950
Golden Wind

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.410
Hello?

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.400
Jotaro, it's me, Koichi!

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.760
Oh, Koichi. Did you get to Italy?

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.880
I found him!

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.820
The guy you asked me to find! 
Haruno Shiobana!

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.720
That was fast.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.250
Where do I even begin?

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.410
I immediately ran into him at the airport...

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.890
And, yes, it's safe to say...

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.850
He's a Stand user!

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.970
He goes by the name Giorno Giovanna in Italy.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.820
You mentioned before that

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.610
Stand users are drawn to 
other Stand users, right?

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.370
We seriously met by coincidence!

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.240
He's a student, but he 
acts like a delinquent.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.910
He stole my money and my luggage!

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.400
And it appears his Stand's ability is

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.380
returning his opponent's
attack right back at them.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.990
Sorry about all this.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.060
I'll get you a hotel and wire you some money.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.520
Thank you.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.210
Also, his hair was blond, 
unlike in the picture.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.800
After asking some people 
who knew him about it,

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.890
they said that he didn't dye it. 
It just suddenly turned that color.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.010
Something about his dead father's genes.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.120
Who's his father?

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.980
Are you and his father somehow related?

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.030
I'm the one

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.130
who killed his father.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.540
His name is DIO Brando.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.700
DIO?

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.120
You mean the one involved 
with the bow and arrow?

00:16:59.580 --> 00:16:59.870
Stab

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.800
I found out this year that 
DIO may have had a child.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.000
That's why I wanted to find out for sure

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.680
if Giorno Giovanna was really DIO's child, 
and if he's somehow inherited his body.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.180
But doesn't DIO's body belong 
to the Joestar bloodline?

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.990
The fact that his hair turned 
blond may be a sign that

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:26.270
the DIO blood in him, his Stand 
power, recently awakened.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.730
There might have been a trigger...

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.570
like a powerful Stand user being in that city.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.130
A powerful Stand user?

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.200
Don't go near him anymore.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.770
It's dangerous to take this further.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.280
Understand?

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.500
Just one last question...

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.820
Is he our enemy?

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.210
Or is he a friend?

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.530
What do you think?

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.550
You're the one who actually met him.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.310
What was your impression of him?

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.320
I'm not sure.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.470
But, um...

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:06.040
He seemed like a very eloquent person.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.240
Did you drop this?

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.160
No.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:27.710
I see.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.370
Guess it's mine now.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.590
Let's say you found a bag 
with 100,000 lire inside.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.980
would you take it to the authorities?

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.220
No way. I'd totally take it.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.040
Well, aren't you honest?

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.550
But what if I was a plainclothes 
police officer and saw you take it?

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.080
I'd give you half and have you 
look the other way... probably.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.160
Wow, that's great!

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.910
And I'm sure that's actually what you'd do.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.910
You're not kidding or bluffing.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.420
I can tell! You're telling the truth.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.990
You see... I can tell if people 
are telling the truth or not.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.370
I'm almost certain.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.380
You know how your skin gets 
shiny when you sweat?

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.300
That's how I can tell.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.760
I think I'll have an even better 
idea if I taste your sweat.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.850
Who are you?

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.840
Leaky Eye Luca was found on the ground 
near the airport after having

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.170
his own spade buried in the back of his head.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.460
It's a rather serious injury. 
He won't be regaining consciousness.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.840
I'm trying to find out who's responsible.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:49.000
Giorno Giovanna, no one knows why 
Leaky Eye Luca was at the airport.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.220
But the airport security guards

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.820
let me know that you were at the airport.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.660
That's why I figured I'd come see 
you and ask you some questions.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.050
Are you actually a police officer?

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.500
Of course not.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.900
Luca's no ordinary crook. 
He's a gang member.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.020
There are plenty of reasons 
he might've been taken out.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.950
He knew how to get people to hate him.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:17.820
But that's not what his boss is thinking about.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.760
The boss feels like his name was

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.660
personally tarnished since 
one of his own was taken out.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.280
That's why he told me to find out who 
took him out and settle the score.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.650
I'm asking you...

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:33.620
Did you happen to run into 
Leaky Eye Luca at the airport?

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.090
No. I don't know who you're talking about.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.280
You're not sweating.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.490
All right, I'll believe you.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.560
That does it for my questions.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.010
Sorry to have bothered you, Giorno Giovanna.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.480
What is that?

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.580
My hand was clenched the whole time.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.250
That's Luca's right eye.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.970
He's unconscious anyway, so I just brought it.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.140
This taste... is the taste of someone 
who's lying, Giorno Giovanna!

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.350
Well, well, well, well...

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.850
I said I was done with my questions,

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.240
but the situation seems to have 
changed, Giorno Giovanna.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.300
You told me a lie.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:46.990
And now, I'm going to have to find 
out why you lied to me, aren't I?!

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.380
What are you looking at?

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.820
Are you jealous?

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.820
Did you want to hit him, too?

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.970
My name is Bruno Bucciarati.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.820
Answer me.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.380
Your questioning has already 
turned into torture.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.720
Well? This is a pretty 
creepy ability, isn't it?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.160
Th-That's...

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.850
Those are Luca's fingers.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.160
To tell you the truth...

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.670
Leaky Eye Luca was disposed of by our boss.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.780
He said that there's no point 
in him living anymore.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.070 line:20%
I took his fingers for torturing.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.070
It's happening again! What the hell?

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.580
Is he also like that Japanese tourist?

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.810
Other than being able to tell if people 
are lying or not, I can also do this...

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.760
I can put whatever I want in your mouth.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.040
For example...

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.470
I can even put that fire 
extinguisher in your mouth.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.290
Though I'm afraid you'd die if I did that...

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:55.810
Talk!

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.730
You know who's responsible.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.590
Were you told not to tell anyone?

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.440
Let's have you tell me who did Luca in.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.930
There's no doubt about it... 
He has a similar ability!

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.750
If you don't hurry up and tell me, 
your torture is just going to get worse,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.740
Giorno Giovanna!

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.540
This guy's bad news!

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:25.990
In that case...

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:32.620
I'll have to use Golden Wind 
and dodge his attacks!

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.310
