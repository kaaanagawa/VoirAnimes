00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.970
"Head to the Pompeii Archaeological Park. 
I've hidden a key near the dog mosaic."

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.360
"That key is for a vehicle that'll 
bring my daughter safely to me."

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.460
Fugo! Abbacchio! Giorno!

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.540
You three head to Pompeii and get that key!

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.160
Episodio 12  The Second Mission from the Boss

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.550 line:20%
The city of Pompeii was known to the Romans 
as a peaceful, prosperous health resort.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.170
It was then abruptly destroyed 
by the lapilli and lava

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.100
that came from the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.270
on August 24th, 79 AD.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.700
Later, archaeologists discovered 
that all the houses, streets,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.800
wine bottles, and even 
carriage tracks left behind

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.610
were preserved as they were when 
the volcano erupted 1,800 years ago.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.470
The dog mosaic we're looking for

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.540
is located near the entrance of the 
House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.830
Oh, Fugo,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.340
you were supposed to turn right 
at that corner, not left.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.140
You should've told me sooner, Giorno.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.330
What point is there if you 
tell me that after I turn?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.220
You're exactly right.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.310
I apologize. I'll be more careful next time.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.600
That's not the point here, damn it!

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.920
Hey, Fugo.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.090
We're in a hurry, so don't lose it now.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.240
I know that!

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.800 line:20%
Damn it...

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.580
Well, Fugo's always like this.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.370
I'm more concerned about 
this newbie, Giorno Giovanna.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.440
If Bucciarati insists that I treat him 
as one of us, I'll follow his orders,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.840
but there's just something 
I don't like about him.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.260
This guy's going to do something...

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.550
Something that might get us killed.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.760
Pompeii, huh?

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.650
I haven't been here since 
I visited on a field trip as a kid.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.650
Abbacchio, Giorno, let's hurry.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.760
The place we're looking for 
is about 100 meters ahead.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.190
It should take us about thirty 
minutes to get what we need

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.260
and get back to the others.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.140
Abbacchio, Giorno, be on your guard.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.640
To think we'd be found so soon...

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.040
How many are there?

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.510
One... for now.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.380
He's peeking around that 
stone pillar behind us.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.480
Pillar? Which one would that be?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.360
Wake up, Giorno.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360
There's only one pillar.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.960
Can't you see it?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.370
Fugo, there is definitely a single pillar,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.720
but I don't see anyone, either.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.500
Quit messing around! 
He's heading right toward us!

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.310
Fugo?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.250
There! The guy walking over here!

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.870
H-He was right there...

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.470
A guy came out from behind that pillar!

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.850
I saw him in this mirror!

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.890
Wh-What?!

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.000
There! He's right there! He's coming out!

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.520
H-He's inside the mirror?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.350
He's revealed his Stand! 
Who's going to fight him?!

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.500
Hold on, Fugo. I have no idea 
what you're talking about.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.250
Is something wrong with the mirror?

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.500
This isn't good! He's going to attack!

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.210
Get away from the mirror!

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.380
What?

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.340
Giorno! Abbacchio!

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.160
Wh-Where are you, Giorno? Abbacchio?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.390
Where did you go?!

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.810
The guy who was in the mirror is gone, too.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.310
What did he do?

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.070
It was bizarre to have a mirror hanging 
in a place like this to begin with!

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.490
What in the world is this ability?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.280
I don't...

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.990
I don't know what it is...

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.800
But there's something 
off about this scenery.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.830
I'm right here.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.710
What?!

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.260
Pannacotta Fugo...

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.090
Highly intelligent, with an IQ of 152, and 
entered university at the age of thirteen.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.860
But he went berserk on a professor there

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.780
and beat him senseless with 
a four-kilogram encyclopedia.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.730
From then on, he spiraled 
down to where he is now.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.740
The ones who accompanied him are the 
former cop Leone Abbacchio and...

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.950
No documents on the 
other guy. He must be new.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.560
I think I heard you call him Giorno.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.250
What did you do to them?

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.160
Y-You bastard...

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.330
Where did you hide them?!

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.880
My watch is backwards?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.220
Also, I was wearing it on my left 
wrist, but now it's on my right?

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.800
D-Don't tell me this place is...

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.930
Your ability is—

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.810
I guess you're pretty quick on the uptake.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.400
One at a time, Fugo...

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.820
It didn't really matter who was first,

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.530
but we'll start with you, since you 
were the first to look at the mirror.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.600
I-It wasn't Abbacchio and 
Giorno that disappeared...

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.150
W-We're inside the mirror!

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.400
It was me!

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.330
I'm the one who was dragged in!

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.060
Fugo!

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.720
Where did you go, Fugo?!

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.580
Hey, Giorno!

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.040
Didn't you see anything?!

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.080
I'm not sure.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.540
It looked as though he suddenly 
disappeared to me, as well.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.270
Fugo! Where did you go?!

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.020
Before he disappeared, Fugo yelled 
at us to get away from the mirror.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.610
And he asked whether we could see the 
man walking from behind the the pillar.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.650
This mirror...

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.280
Is there something... about this mirror?

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.030
The question is...

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.390
Where did you hide the boss's daughter?

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.870
That's the most important question...

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.520
But I'm pretty sure I also need to know why

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.840
you three came to Pompeii, the city of death.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.800
I figure you're here to look for something...

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.890
And if that's the case, you came here to get 
something that'll help you protect the girl,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.970
isn't that right?

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.720
If you turn just up the way, it'll lead 
you to the famous dog mosaic.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.980
Is there something there?

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.930
Well?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.700
I'll be taking it!

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.610
Tell me what you came here for, Fugo!

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.610
I refuse!

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.320
Then die!

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.690
No...

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.160
You'll be the one dying when 
you witness my ability!

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.040
Purple Smoke!

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.570
My Stand won't appear?

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.590
I see... So your Stand 
is named Purple Smoke.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.730
Something's wrong. My Stand did come out.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.510
I can feel it... So why?

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.770
Hey, Giorno...

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.940
Slowly walk toward me.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.050
Slowly what?

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.120
Just come over here, you dumbass!

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.240
Forget the "slowly" part! Just get over here!

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.740
What?! Th-That's—

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.640
Giorno! Forget about that!

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.410
That's not our enemy! That's Fugo's Stand!

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.890
Just hurry up and get away from it!

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.320
Don't get any closer!

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.720
Fugo's—

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.380
Get away from Purple Smoke!

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.100
Hurry up!

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.600
Your current location is inside the mirror.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.230
I'm sure you can figure out exactly 
why I dragged you in here alone.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.320
If I'd brought you in here 
along with the others,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.690
who can fight, it'd put me in danger!

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.650
I control the inside of the 
mirror... That's my ability.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.540
All the things in here are 
objects that have no life.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.700
You and I are the only living beings here.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.840
That's because I didn't allow anyone else.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.310
I only allowed you, and you alone, to come in.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.880
Which means... your Stand 
ability was left outside!

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.970
This is my Mirror Man!

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.570
Purple Smoke has appeared 
outside the mirror.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.300
Then there should be some way to fight!

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.990
Mirror Man

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.990
Illuso

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.890
Pannacotta Fugo was born 
into a wealthy family

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.000
that owned a huge home 
in the suburbs of Naples.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.370
On top of being born into a life of luxury,

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.520
he was born with high intellect, 
having an IQ of 152.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.630
It appeared as though he 
lived the perfect life.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.140
But the weight of the expectations 
that his parents and others

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.430
put on Fugo were slowly 
crushing his young heart.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:16.150
At times, Fugo would experience fits of 
rage that even he didn't understand,

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.180
but he would do everything he 
could to control them and get by.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.430
Then, when he entered university 
just after turning thirteen,

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.580
that rage went out of control 
in the worst possible way.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.870
Fugo.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.340
Professor.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.460
What are you doing here so late?

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.470
I'm working on the assignment due next week. 
I couldn't find the right judicial precedent...

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.810
Oh, come on.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:50.730
I told you that if there's anything you didn't 
understand, you could come to me anytime.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.150
No, I shouldn't keep bothering you...

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.780
My job is to teach and lead young people 
like you in the right direction.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.520
How about it?

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.480
Why don't you come by my house 
again for dinner, and...

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.030
Please excuse me.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.720
Now, wait just a moment.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:13.210
I wouldn't mind telling you what's 
going to be on the next test...

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.630
It'll be fine. Just relax, now.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.630
Stop... Stop...

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.590
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop!

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.590
I'll be gentle.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.010
I told you to stop, damn it!

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.770
I looked up to you!

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.600
You piece of shit!

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.230
Did you hear?

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.260
Apparently Fugo's <i>really</i> close 
with one of the professors.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.540
Are you sure he wasn't 
the one to lead him on?

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.110
That's probably how he got 
into this school, too.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.350
Fugo's parents used their money 
to ensure he was found not guilty,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.470
but they then treated him 
like filth and disowned him.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.810
All alone, Fugo started shoplifting 
and picking pockets to survive.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:04.930
Ironically, this lifestyle actually let him 
use his intellect to its full potential.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.890
You little bastard! 
How dare you try to dine and dash?!

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.860
I'm gonna make sure they throw you in jail!

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.910
No, that won't be possible.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.360
Are you familiar with the De Sica 
vs. Argento case from 1982?

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.870
Going by that judicial precedent,

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:25.070
there's a very good chance that the court 
will see this as me acting out of necessity.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.910
Mr. Bucciarati! 
Please say something to this brat!

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.200
Well, that sounds interesting.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:40.090
That was right around the time Bucciarati 
was thinking about creating his own team.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.300
That basically sums up my life story.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.050
Please don't pity me.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.480
I don't think of myself as unfortunate.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.770
I see. But, well... 
I think our meeting is fate.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.350
Would you like to join my 
team, Pannacotta Fugo?

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.730
I want your intellect and knowledge.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.340
Mr. Bucciarati, was it?

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.490
Joining a gang doesn't sound so bad, 
but I've already made up my mind.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.710
I'm going to live on my own, 
not bothering with anyone else.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.240
Oh? And why is that?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.730
I told you.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.420
When I lose my temper, 
I do horrifying things.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.250
If I were to join your team, 
I might even end up killing you.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.220
In that case, let's see if 
that'll actually happen.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.410
Come with me, Fugo.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.350
I'll bring out the best in you,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.430
including that fierce, 
impulsive rage of yours.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.190
Those words moved Fugo's heart.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:47.330
After that, Fugo underwent Polpo's 
test and gained Purple Smoke.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.570
So this is Fugo's Stand...

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.080
Fugo's not here, but his Stand 
appeared for some reason.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.810
Since that thing appeared, Fugo must 
be okay for the time being, but...

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.540
Damn it! Where the hell is Fugo?

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.280
How's he protecting himself?

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.130
Get back, Giorno!

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.980
Get back even further!

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.290
Fugo rarely lets this guy out.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.560
He only does when he's in serious trouble.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.770
Which means that Fugo's 
trying to fight somewhere!

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.190
Get further back, Giorno!

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.370
He seems to be more worried about 
that Stand than about where Fugo is.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.280
He acts like he feels threatened.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.450
What the? It just started 
attacking out of nowhere!

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.960
This isn't good. We really shouldn't stay here.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.710
We're getting out of here! Come on!

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.250
I don't know what you're talking about!

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.300
There's something in that mirror!

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.780
We need to find where Fugo is!

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.000
That's far more important right no—

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.940
Stop talking back to me, you little shit!

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.630
I don't care what happens to you,

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.390
but I'm trying to be nice and warn you, 
since you don't know what's going on!

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.560
It punched it! Run, Giorno!

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.310
I see.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.320
So you activated your Stand 
outside the mirror.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.110
But... that doesn't mean a thing!

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.680
It doesn't matter what your Stand 
tries to do with its ability.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.580
It will never be able to hit me.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.040
But I can hit you as many times 
as I like and finish you off!

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.250
A crow?

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.610
Why did a crow fall?

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.750
A crow just suddenly...

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.310
Stay back.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.980
When Purple Smoke uses its 
fists, no one can stay nearby.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.040
What the hell is with these corpses?

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.780
It's a killer virus.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.600
That's Fugo's Stand, Purple Smoke's ability.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.310
A virus?

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.540
Look at its hand.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.180
When it hits something with its 
fist, that capsule breaks open,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.630
and the virus comes spilling out!

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.090
The virus disperses into the 
air and enters your body

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:15.480
through inhalation or skin contact.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.630
It then multiplies rapidly.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.100
It infects its host within thirty 
seconds, then kills them instantly.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:27.960
And once the virus spreads, it doesn't 
matter who's nearby, be they friend or foe.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.630
Just like those crows, all of your 
metabolic functions will shut down,

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.630
and you'll die as you 
rot from the inside out.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.280
That includes your Stand, too.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.800
What's its range?

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.080
Five meters.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.800
Right now, Fugo should be 
controlling his Stand

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.770
somewhere within five 
meters of his opponent.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.130
That's definitely important, 
but what's the range on the virus?

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.760
How close do you have to be 
to be infected by the virus?

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.510
At this distance, we should be safe.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.770
The virus that comes from that capsule dies

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.800
within a few dozen seconds of exposure 
to an average indoor level of light.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:05.270
So those crow corpses will soon 
be disinfected by the sunlight.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.270
Savage!

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:13.200
It attacks like an explosion, 
and then disappears like a storm.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.990
It's a Stand that personifies 
Fugo's violent nature.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.530
What's it doing?

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.580
I think it's trying to wipe off the 
drool that dripped on its leg.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.990
It always looks pissed off, 
but it's apparently

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.540
really high-strung, and really 
cares about being clean.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.520
I guess you could say that's 
the Stand's idiosyncrasy.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.560
It doesn't look like the Stand 
itself is very intelligent...

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.200
It's just a reflection of his violent side.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.130
That would also mean Fugo's 
isn't able to see Purple Smoke.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.580
He's not controlling it properly at all.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.490
If he was, he wouldn't let it do that.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.750
This corpse...

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.450
This crow...

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.120
Is it sick?

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.420
Was it infected by some virus or bacteria?

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.380
I knew it... Fugo's unable to control it.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.420
It just attacked some random spot again.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.230
Wait, is it actually random?

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.110
There must be something in that mirror!

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.190
Now the mirror got attacked 
from the outside...

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.080
But it's no use, Fugo.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.280
That's just a normal mirror,
the kind you can find anywhere.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.920
No matter what your Stand 
is doing out there...

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.920
No matter what ability it may use...

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.920
Not even viruses can enter 
Mirror Man's world!

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:03.400
Abbacchio, Giorno, please get my message...

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.440
Please make sure you don't 
get dragged into the mirror!

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.910
We need to hurry, Giorno!

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.400
Hey, Giorno!

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.730
Don't just stand there! Let's go!

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.140
Let me ask you this... Where are we going?

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.200
To get the key?

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.210
You're willing to abandon Fugo, 
who's in danger right now?

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.790
Watch your mouth, you bastard.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:38.780
Listen up. Our mission is to get the key 
and safely get that girl to the boss!

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.210
I want to save Fugo as much as you do,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.430
but getting that key is paramount right now!

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.790
Even if I was the one currently 
being attacked instead of Fugo,

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.890
I would want you guys to abandon me.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.070
I beg your pardon...

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.360
but I don't believe that's true!

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.040
Fugo is indeed in danger, 
but he hasn't lost!

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.650
We should risk our lives and save him!

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.940
And making any movements when 
we don't know the enemy's ability

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.280
is dangerous to us, as well.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.630
No! All three of us being taken out 
is the worst possible outcome!

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.080
I'll say it again! We're moving on! Come on!

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.300
And I humbly decline!

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.390
We're going to solve this mystery, 
save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.670
That's the best way to ensure we're all safe!

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.240
I have seniority here, so in this 
situation, what I say goes!

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.050
Are you still going to decline?

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.530
You'd better be prepared!

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.760
That is, if you manage to survive!

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.990
I'll ask you one more time, Fugo.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.990
What are you looking for here?

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.140
I have no intention of telling you.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.200
I see.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.670
Very well. There are still two others.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.170
I just need the last one 
standing to tell me.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.960
You're finished. Take this!

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.490
Episodio 13
Mirror Man and Purple Smoke
