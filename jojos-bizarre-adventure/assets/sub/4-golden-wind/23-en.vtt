WEBVTT

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.270
None of his friends realize 
that there's another Stand.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.130
Yes, they don't realize that my Stand,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.800
Talking Mouth, is attached to 
your tongue and making you say

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.320
the exact opposite of what you mean.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.090
Narancia,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.050
there must be some reason 
you can't tell us the truth.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.300
Giorno!

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.890
Giorno's getting pulled under!

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.260
Even though the water's so shallow!

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.290
Li'l Bomber!

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.030
The bastard is teleporting 
from liquid to liquid

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.220
while still holding on to Giorno's body,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.400
despite there being so little water!

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.700
Yes! I got him.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.840
If we first take care of Giorno Giovanna, 
who controls life and can heal his friends,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.510
it'll be a piece of cake to eliminate 
the rest of his friends one by one.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.710
Yeah, it's all going according to plan.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.710
But we should finish off 
Giorno immediately, Squalo.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.600
Huh?

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.590
According to my information, 
Narancia's Li'l Bomber can track carbon dioxide.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.330
Even though Giorno's 
unconscious right now,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.730
if he's breathing, your Crush, 
which bit into him, will be tracked down.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.330
Even if you jump from liquid to liquid.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.850
It won't be good if Li'l Bomber tracks 
down your location and gets ahead.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.050
It'll track us down.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.960
All right, Tiziano.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.740
I'll stop Giorno's breathing.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.490
Right now.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.810
Episodio 23 Crush and Talking Mouth

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.800
This isn't good.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.020
I can't let them take Giorno away!

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.820
This enemy...

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.960
So there were already two Stands here?

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.670
Shit! The more I miss,

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.610
the more I'm spreading the water around 
and giving them the upper hand!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.870
I have to get ahead of them!

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.260
Where are they? Where'd they go?!

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.960
There!

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.640
They may be able to teleport, 
but if I can get ahead of them,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.930
I can fill them full of holes!

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.530
He's got his radar out.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.430
As I figured, he's going to try 
to track us down and shoot us.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.040
We should stop Giorno's 
breathing immediately.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.770
Quit being so pushy. I know, Tiz.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.690
But it sure is hard to attack 
Giorno while teleporting!

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.870
I got the timing down! Now!

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.880
Wha— Into his neck?!

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.750
Giorno! I-I didn't mean to shoot you!

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.800
Wh-What? His breathing...

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.170
The symbol indicating Giorno's breathing...

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.480
It disappeared from the radar!

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.170
Shit! They got away!

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.820
Excellent. Crush went into the sewers.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.770
I'm just going to continue down into the 
canal and dispose of Giorno's body.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.000
Hold it. What was that, Squalo?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.820
I said I'd take his body to the canal and...

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.360
No, I'm talking about Narancia.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.030
I almost didn't hear it, 
but he definitely said it!

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.210
He said, "They got away!" With his voice!

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.510
As long as my Talking Mouth is on his tongue,

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.520
he should only be able to say 
the opposite of his intent.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.380
But he said, "They got away!"

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.150
He even said the radar symbol disappeared.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.860
Squalo! Move from there immediately!

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.820
What are you talking about, Tiziano?

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.360
Giorno's not breathing at all!

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.980
There's no one else who 
can track down my Crush!

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.720
He said, "They got away!" on purpose!

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.910
It was to put you at ease!

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.700
It was to stop Crush's 
teleportation for even a moment!

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.800
I don't know how, but he's 
definitely tracking you!

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.490
Back then, Giorno moved on 
purpose so I'd shoot him.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.580
That way, there'd be residue from the 
gunshots, and I could actually track him!

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.580
I can see him.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.010
I can see him clear as day!

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.020
Here we go! I'm gonna fill them with holes!

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.330
Here I come, you bastard!

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.390
This means Giorno's not dead yet!

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.280
If we can resuscitate him within 
a few minutes, he'll be saved!

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.990
This isn't good, Squalo!

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.380
Now that he's fired at you twice,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.970
he's going to go after the 
residue from your bullet wounds!

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.820
I did it! I got him out of the sewers!

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.510
It's no use, Bucciarati.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.050
I can't replay this enemy any further.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.030
I know for sure that they were 
in this cup on top of this table.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.410
But they were only there for a moment.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.460
From there, Moody Jazz can't 
transform, nor go forward.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.330
What do you mean, Abbacchio?

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.720
I don't know. Maybe they can teleport.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.720
But I don't have the answer.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.110
The replay for this enemy...

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.510
It won't go any further, 
like a video tape that's been torn.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.290
I can't believe Narancia would go this far...

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.350
No, it's Giorno.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.610
This all happened because 
Giorno intentionally got shot

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.900
by Li'l Bomber's guns.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.320
Shit! I can't get rid of the residue!

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.940
Even in the water!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.800
Because the bullets were from a Stand.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.440
I have to disappear somehow.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.070
Somewhere he can't detect me!

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.520
I've been watching...

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.730
and this shark bastard is pretty damn 
fast for a remote-controlled Stand,

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.670
but it looks like it can't get 
very far in a single leap.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.550
Looks to be about two to three meters!

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.650
Shit!

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.570
H-His attacks are becoming more precise!

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:31.050
It could be due to injuries, 
but their speed's getting slower!

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.160
Squalo!

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.990
Yes! Now I just need to end 
this with a finishing blow!

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.460
Take this, you fishy bastard!

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.720
Th-This smell...

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.500
There's a gas leak!

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.380
This is all according to plan, Narancia.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.340
Because you shot,

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.610
hot water spilled from the pot
and extinguished the burner.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.510
Now Li'l Bomber won't be 
able to shoot its guns!

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.520
Now you can't track me!

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.600
If one of the sparks from your 
gun happens to ignite the gas,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.660
you may survive, but everything 
around there will burn,

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.290
filling the room with carbon dioxide, 
and you won't be able to find me anymore!

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.580
Narancia, just go ahead and try to shoot

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.100
those guns!

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.310
We've won!

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.290
You know, if I can't shoot...

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.760
I have other ways of killing you!

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.090
Yes! I got the enemy!

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.760
Bucciarati! Mista! The enemy's here!

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.440
Abbacchio, the enemy's able to 
move from liquid to liquid!

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.690
Giorno's breathing again!

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:54.980
Huh?

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.760
Wait. What did I just say?

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.220
Why was I able to speak the truth?

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.490
Squalo, I've released Talking 
Mouth from Narancia's tongue,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.450
just like you planned.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.000
You're pretty badly injured, but I'm 
sure the boss will be satisfied.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.710
Did you just yell something, Narancia?!

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.440
Did you say the enemy's over here?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.640
But the release of Talking 
Mouth is only temporary.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.460
Giorno's... That must be the enemy!

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.530
Wh-What?!

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.870
W-Wai—

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.950
We win, Squalo.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.390
Yes... This is all according to plan!

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.610
Here we go, Six Bullets!

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.830
Shoot, Mista!

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.410
Wh-What?!

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.410
Sh-Shit! My radar!

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.090
I can't track them! They're going to attack!

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.060
Giorno's going to be taken 
because of my lie!

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.890
N-Narancia!

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.810
L-Look for it!

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.030
G-Giorno!

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.700
Don't go after the Stand...

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.000
Go after the user!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.700
Giorno!

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.660
Hey, Narancia!

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.450
You bastard! Why'd you tell me to shoot?!

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.880
This room was filled with gas!

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.860
Look out! It's the enemy! 
The enemy's above!

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.180
No! Below! The enemy's below!

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.030
What?!

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.110
Guys!

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.080
It's no use! I can't stop 
myself from talking!

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.700
I have to stop talking!

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.770
It disappeared!

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.160
They're planning to eliminate 
Giorno before anyone else!

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.170
Don't go after the Stand...

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.130
Go after the user!

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.030
Giorno!

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.550
Giorno told me to find the user.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.190
Right... They're hurt.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.360
Because they're hurt, 
their breathing is probably labored.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.010
So that's what he means.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.470
He wants me to use my radar to find them.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.530
I'm alone in this. I have to do this alone.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.440
Someone who's breathing hard...

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.540
They have a remote-controlled Stand,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.860
but they have to be somewhere around here.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.750
There's no time! I have to 
be quick and find them!

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.960
Talking Mouth

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.960
Tiziano

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.410
Okay, this is all according to plan.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.100
With Giorno gone, there's no 
one to fix their injuries.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.920
Now, finish off Giorno.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.390
For good.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.320
Yeah, I'll do it.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.400
I've been injured,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.980
but I have plenty of strength 
left to attack him.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.330
Hey, look. It's Narancia.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.030
What's he doing out here?

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.020
Where is Crush right now?

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.880
Over there.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.100
It exited the restaurant's sewer pipe 
and is heading down the canal.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.870
He shouldn't be able to track it anymore...

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.970
Don't tell me he's trying 
to find me instead!

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.340
My breathing...

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.410
Calm down, Squalo.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.730
That's impossible.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.290
He's just struggling because 
he's run out of options.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:55.520
How many people do you think there 
are within hundred meters of here?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.650
Fifty? A hundred?

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.120
There's no way he could tell 
you apart from the others.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.130
But I'm injured.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.830
If he's trying to find someone 
with labored breathing...

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.460
Don't panic, Squalo.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.800
Look at the bottom of the stairs.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.770
There are many with even more labored 
breathing than you in that square.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.260
Calm yourself and your breathing.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.710
If we hide your injuries and head into the 
square like nothing's wrong, we'll be safe.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.220
We still win!

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.410
Yeah, you're right... You're exactly right.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.740
There's no way he'd find us.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.230
I found you!

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.980
You're right there!

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.940
Wh-What?!

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.940
Shit! I have to retrieve Crush!

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.290
Calm down, Squalo! Think this through!

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.400
He can only say the opposite of 
what he's thinking right now.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.610
He said he found us, 
meaning he hasn't found us!

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.330
Don't forget that!

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.380
Then why did he bother saying that?!

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.920
He wants you to panic and make your 
breathing even more labored!

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.590
Please calm down. If you panic, 
it's exactly what he wants.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.550
There's no way Narancia can single you out.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.300
This is just his futile, last-ditch attempt.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.520
Calm your breathing.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.470
I found you...

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.690
There you are.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.330
I finally... found you.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.440
He said it again!

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.940
Please, calm down.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.660
He hasn't found us. That's fact.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.570
He's definitely lying!

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.900
My Talking Mouth is still 
definitely on his tongue...

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.670
H-Hey, look!

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.370
Wh-What?!

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.070
He cut out his own tongue!

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.920
With his own knife!

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.140
That's impossible!

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.020
No one can survive after 
cutting out their own tongue,

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.110
let alone speak!

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.420
I found... you!

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.180
H-He has another tongue!

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.950
The ladybug became a tongue!

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.200
It can't be!

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.280
It's Giorno!

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.340
Giorno Giovanna!

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.290
Just as the boss had said, 
he's the biggest problem!

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.000
That bastard Giorno must've created a tongue

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
for Narancia in the kitchen 
and given it to him!

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.550
He's coming! He's heading this way!

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.200
So he was tracking my breathing!

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.260
It's the opposite!

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.730
If he was actually tracking you, 
he would've attacked already!

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.980
Considering the number of people out 
here, there's all kinds of breathing.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.600
Labored breathing, slow breathing...

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.070
There's so much that I 
can't single anyone out.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.430
But I've been waiting...

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.810
I've been waiting for this...

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.800
For the moment when someone's breathing 
drastically changes suddenly!

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.250
For someone to change their 
breathing drastically

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.840
after seeing me cut my 
tongue out with a knife!

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.590
For someone to see their Stand 
hanging out along with my tongue

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.210
and panic bigtime!

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.000
That's what I've been waiting for!

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.470
Just when I thought I'd lost you 
guys and was about to give up!

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.030
You, over there!

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.080
Your breathing just fluctuated, didn't it?!

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.900
Yeah, you! I'm talking to you!

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.860
I'm talking to you, long hair!

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.590
This can't be!

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.070
He actually cut out his tongue to track me!

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.250
Which must mean the shark user 
is the dude next to you!

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.790
He seems pretty damn pale.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.200
Squalo, retrieve Crush!

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.220
I'm already on it!

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.260
It's traveling through the sewers 
and heading toward that well.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.550
But... there's no water here!

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.750
There's no liquid that Crush 
can jump at Narancia from!

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.970
You must be him!

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.150
The guy who dragged Giorno away!

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.440
Tiziano!

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:28.280
Now you have some liquid... Squalo.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.360
This didn't... go exactly 
according to plan...

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.950
But this doesn't change our victory.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.290
We're still going to... win...

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.780
I don't give a damn about the 
boss's orders anymore.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.860
I'm not going to kill you because I was 
ordered to as one of the elite guard.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.570
Tiziano... I'm going to 
eliminate him for you!

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.280
I'll kill all of Narancia's friends, too!

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.390
I'll rip them to pieces and make them pay!

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.990
I'll make them all pay!

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.210
Crush! Rip out his throat!

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.560
Do you think... I'm going to falter?

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.900
Because of... Because of something like this?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.450
We're...

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.570
going to get the hell out of Venice,

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.800
completely safe and sound.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.410
See ya...

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.150 line:20%
Volare via.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.710
</i>"Go flying"

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.470
You're a damn traitor...

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.850
You're supposed to be 
eliminated by the boss...

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.990
You're supposed to have no choice 
but to fear your future...

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.810
What in the world is driving them forward?

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.230
Why does it seem like they have hope?

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.320
Wh-What could it...

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.270
Someone just collapsed!

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.330
Giorno!

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.750
Y-Yes! He's breathing again, faintly!

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:53.040
Giorno, wake up! Giorno! Giorno!

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.110
Narancia...

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.950
Abbacchio doesn't think too highly of you,

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:08.530
but we all end up moving 
under your direction,

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.830
as though you're leading us...

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:15.430
We might actually have some hope 
for this journey... with you around.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.380
Giorno, let's get back to everyone else.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.310
How long has it been 
since the attack began?

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.510
Four to five minutes?

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.390
Anyway, it's hard to imagine 
that another assassin

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.270
from the organization is 
in Venice right now.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.060
It should be wide open.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.260
Let's head toward the airport!

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.610
We'll get a plane!

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.490
We're going to get a plane and head 
to Sardinia, no matter what.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.650
We must find out about the boss's 
past as quickly as possible...

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.610
or we lose.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.010
Episodio 24
Notorious Chase
