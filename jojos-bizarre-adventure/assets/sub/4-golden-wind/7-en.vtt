00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.560
O-Ow! Hey, right here...

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.860
Hey, Fugo... Could you 
take a look right here?

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.700
Oh, dear. You've definitely got one.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.000
It's pretty big.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.760
Ow! That hurts!

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.830
Quit it! Don't touch it!

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.540
God damn it, you bastard!

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.750
You're gonna pay for 
that, you piece of shit!

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.120
I've got a bump on my head because of you!

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.690
I hope you're prepared!

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.840
Take this! And this!

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.250
Seriously! Who do you think you are?!

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.780
You bastard!

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.750
Hey, something fell off him.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.730
Let's see...

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.070
Mario Zucchero. His home address is in Rome.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.280
So he's a gangster from Rome.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.210
So is that thing on your face garbage?

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.290
Or is it a piece of seaweed?

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.900
It looks like it could be seaweed, but it 
also looks like it could be a piece of plastic.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
It'd break my heart if 
it's actually garbage,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.140
because it'd mean that this 
beautiful ocean is polluted.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.330
Mind if I take a closer look at it?

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.420
Hey.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
I asked you if you'd mind if 
I took a closer look at that.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.030
Answer me when I ask you 
a question, would you?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.630
Capri.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.100
When the ancient Greeks colonized 
various lands in the Mediterranean Sea,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.690
they looked for places with the 
most beautiful scenery in the world.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.480
One of those locations happened to be Capri.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.420
Its blue sea, its sparkling sky...

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.840
But in sharp contrast, 
it also had a shoreline

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.310
made up of white precipices, 
making it look like a fortress.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.870
During the age of the Roman Empire, 
there was an emperor who made

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.560
this island his vacation home and 
didn't return to Rome for ten years.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.870
Bruno Bucciarati and his crew 
are about to land on this island

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.430
in order to claim Polpo's secret 
fortune of ten billion lire.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.710
Episodio 07 Six Bullets Appears, Part 1

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.340 line:20%
Bucciarati, let's start to 
make a course toward land.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.360
I've been looking for a while now, 
but there isn't a single boat following us.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.330
No one should know that this 
boat is heading to Capri.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.430
Yeah, there are no boats, but...

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.900
The problem is whoever that guy 
heard about the secret fortune from.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.120
I have a hard time believing 
he followed us on his own.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.790
You seem very interested in these, 
but they're not mine.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.040
They were inside the boat.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.630
Which would you prefer me to use?

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.670
The glasses or the fishing line?

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.290
We need some answers from you.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.050
If we don't get some, we'll be in danger.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.940
You have a partner, 
don't you, Mr. Zucchero?

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.000
And they're also a Stand user, aren't they?

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.890
That's why I'll be using these.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.420
You don't even want to bother telling 
me which one you'd like me to use?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.670
If you won't pick one...

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.280
I'll just have to use both!

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.830
Well? Do you feel like talking now?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.910
Ma-ri-o Zuc-che-ro. Heaven, Hell, 
or the 9th Circle of Hell...

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.520
Heaven, Hell, or...

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.560
The 9th Circle of Hell!

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.590
He's headed for the 9th Circle of Hell, 
according to this name divination!

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.460
If you're not going to tell us the name of

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.190
your partner who's coming after 
us and their Stand ability...

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:27.100
You should probably start worrying 
about your other eye, Mr. Zucchero!

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.420
Quit playing around, you dumbasses.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.620
Damn it, come here and look at this.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.080
He was using the radio on the boat.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.150
Sounds like you found something 
with Moody Jazz's replay.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.670
Let's have a look.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.150
This whole boat was flat, 
but we'll be able to see him

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.760
in 3-D now that it's back to normal.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.380
Giorno!

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.650
I have no intention of showing you my Stand!

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.930
Turn around.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.880
I'll do you a favor and let 
you hear its voice, at least.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.430
When I was watching the replay of him, 
he started using the boat's radio.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.830
He's contacting someone.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.010
I've already made four of them my hostages.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.670
All that's left is Bucciarati and one other.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.620
I'll have this taken care of in no time.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.580
They were heading...

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.950
to Capri!

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.550 line:20%
They haven't mentioned where 
the money's hidden, though.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.710
Hey, what do we do about this?

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.550
He told them where we're heading!

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.760
After I get rid of his five friends, 
I'm gonna make Bucciarati cough it up. Over.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.760
Was that yacht named </i>Lagoon<i>?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.470
What's your current location?

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.730
We're about two hours out from Capri.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.540
Bucciarati is wary of anyone following him, 
so he's taking a very roundabout route.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.780
Got it.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.490
I'll take a high-speed boat 
and wait for you at Capri.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.830
Dock at Marina Grande. Over and out.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.790
That's the end of the conversation. 
The radio cut off.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.500
How could this be?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.540
This isn't good. With a high-speed vessel,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.630
they can get from Naples 
to Capri in thirty minutes!

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.860
That means they're definitely 
already on the island!

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.390
Who is it? Who the hell was on the radio?

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.520
I'm going to make this guy tell 
us who it is, no matter what!

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.160
No, he's a hardcore gangster.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.020
It'll probably take some time 
to get anything out of him.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.480
He probably won't say anything today.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.280
Besides, he might not know what 
his partner's Stand looks like.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.610
It's very possible his partner's 
kept it secret even from him.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.240
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.550
What if we just come ashore like this?

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.040
If they find out we're the ones on 
this boat instead of Zucchero...

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.790
Also, if this boat doesn't arrive at 
Marina Grande in about an hour...

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.620
They guy on the radio is sure to think 
something happened to Zucchero.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.810
If that happens, who knows if 
we'll be able to get the money?

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.670
In fact...

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.220
I have my doubts we'd make it 
back to Naples in one piece!

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.730
What are we going to do, Bucciarati?

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.130
There's no time to hesitate.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.310
We should at least outfox the guy.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.110
I'll somehow get to the island first and—

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.870
Before this boat docks,

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.540
all we need is someone to head to the 
island first and get rid of the guy.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.750
What the hell are you talking about?

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.590
Are you sure you're not stupid?

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.090
Get to the island before this boat?

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.300
What are we supposed to do? Swim there?

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.070
Yes.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.800
Huh?!

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.270
I can change this ring buoy into a fish.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.650
If I have it pull me, I'll be able to get 
to the island faster than this boat.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.570
Of course, since it's my Stand, 
I'll be the one going.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.380
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.090
I want that ten billion lire.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.980
We have to use that money 
to make Bucciarati a capo

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.000
and move our way up the ranks.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.170
Giorno...

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.540
You're going to go? All right, fine.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.030
You've got some good ideas, boy.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.100
But sadly, you don't know this 
guy's name or what he looks like.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.510
Capri is filled with tourists.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.500
How the hell are you going to find him?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.150
I agree with Giorno's plan.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.740
Even if we don't know who this guy is...

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:44.320
If he's waiting for Zucchero 
to arrive in this boat,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.040
I think there's a high possibility 
that we can attack first

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.210
rather than wait for him to attack.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.840
So how many people can 
that fish pull, Giorno?

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.060
My Stand, Six Bullets, is made for killing.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.650
It's perfect for situations like this.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.370
I'll be going, too.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.030
Six Bullets

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.030
Guido Mista

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.170
It took us quite a while to swim 
from the yacht to the island.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.510
We have 20 minutes before the time

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.370
Zucchero was supposed to meet 
up with the man on Capri.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.690
That's about all the time we have left.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.180
Giorno, how does the marina look?

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.560
Not good.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.340
Just as Abbacchio said, 
there are a lot of tourists.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.400
And they all look like they're 
waiting for someone.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.110
They're probably just waiting 
for sightseeing vessels, but...

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.190
Mista, you have a plan to find the 
guy among that crowd of tourists

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.740
in the next 20 minutes, right?

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.970
What... are you doing?

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.390
It's way past lunchtime.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.850
I'd prefer to go to that 
restaurant over there,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.780
but it's probably a bad idea 
to have lunch at a restaurant

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.440
right in front of the marina.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.190
I don't know what this guy looks like,

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.930
but he probably knows what I look 
like since I'm on Bucciarati's team.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.860
That goes for you, too.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.200
I have no idea what you're talking about,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.850
but listen, Mista.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.000
I know we said about 20 minutes,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.170
but if he's the panicky type, 
we might only have about ten.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.510
Maybe even five.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.460
He may get suspicious when the 
<i>Lagoon</i> doesn't come into port

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.640
and figure out that something 
happened to Zucchero.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.450
If that happens, we won't 
have a chance to find him.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.750
We have to make our move imme—

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.930
And I told you, this is my lunchtime!

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.350
Lunchtime is for lunch!

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.690
Even boutiques and bookstores in 
this country honor lunchtime.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.680
No one works if they don't have their lunch.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.490
I'm not saying <i>I'm</i> like that,

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.660
but these little guys pretty much expect it.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.750
Lunchtime!

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.750
Give us food!

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.060
Here you go, guys. Lunch is served.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.340
Tuscan salami is delicious!

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.600
Delicious!

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.760
This is the best!

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.830
Hey, gimme that!

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.610
Hey, come on now, Number 3!

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.220
Stop making Number 5 cry!

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.940
Stop fighting. There's enough for all of you.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.960
They all believe that they do the most work,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.280
so they have the right to 
eat more than the others.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.400
I work so hard not to play favorites.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.990
Number 5! Quit crying already!

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.510
What are they?

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.410
How many of those things do you have?

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.860
Hey, don't call them "things."

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.500
They get pissed off when 
they're treated like pets.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.860
There are six of them,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.820
and there isn't a Number 4 
because four is bad luck.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.860
There's one for each bullet.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.220
For each bullet?

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.680
This guy here keeps rushing us.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.220
Could you guys take your nap 
after your work is done?

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.680
Hell no!

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.150
Hey, Number 3!

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.520
I keep telling you not to hit the others!

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.370
Mista!

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.720
I'll convince these guys to work.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.120
So, Giorno...

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.580
You get the radio out of that plastic bag.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.140
There'll be a feast after we do this job!

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.800
Let's do this, you guys!

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.870
Listen up. I'm going to sneak up 
to the security watchhouse

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.270
and hide in its shadows 
so that no one sees me.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.280
Is there anyone waiting for 
a yacht named <i>Lagoon</i>?

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:37.250
We've received a transmission from 
a Mr. Zucchero on the <i>Lagoon</i>!

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.620
Please come to the boat watchhouse!

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.840
Is there anyone waiting for 
a yacht named <i>Lagoon</i>?

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.150
We've received a transmission from 
a Mr. Zucchero on the <i>Lagoon</i>!

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.500
He might decide to be cautious 
and not answer the radio call...

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.340
Please come to the boat watchhouse!

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.230
Or he might get excited and run 
out, thinking the hiding place

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.200
of the ten billion lire has been found.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.730
This is a gamble,

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:05.060
Is there anyone waiting for the Lagoon?

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.830
but the one who comes 
to the boat watchhouse

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.650
to answer that radio call is our guy.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.570
We've received a transmission 
from a Mr. Zucchero!

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:13.030
Giorno, if anyone comes near the 
watchhouse, give me a signal.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:15.540
If you're waiting for the Lagoon, 
please come to the boat watchhouse!

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.160
I'm gonna shoot the guy 
who takes the radio call!

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:23.120
But Bucciarati told me to not kill 
him, so I'll miss any vital points.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.480
Or at least, I'll try.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.400
No one's making a move yet...

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.590
No one's heading over there.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.830
Is there no one?

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.540
No one's waiting for the <i>Lagoon</i>?

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.720
There's a transmission from Mr. Zucchero!

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.900
No, there's no one. Nothing.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.590
He's supposed to be 
somewhere on this island.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.070
Is he just being too cautious 
to answer the radio call?

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.160
Did something happen, Zucchero?

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.530
Why did you request an announcement?

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.330
Is there a problem? Over.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.000
What's going on?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.510
No one's heading toward the watchhouse.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.750
He's there! How?!

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.280
This isn't good. Does that 
watchhouse have a back entrance?

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.180
He's already inside the watchhouse!

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.630
It's too dark to see his face.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.440
Mista hasn't realized he's in there!

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.850
At this rate, the guy's going to 
realize this is a trap and run!

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.900
I have to let Mista know!

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.250
What? The guy's coming to 
answer the radio call?

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.660
Which one is it?

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.750
Who's heading toward the watchhouse?

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.360
N-No!

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.340
He's not heading there!

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.410
He's already inside!

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.810
Don't come out!

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.970
He's by the window!

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.940
That guy is...

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.890
one of Bucciarati's guys!

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.410
Didn't Zucchero take care 
of him on the yacht?

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.450
Mista! Behind you!

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.370
He's on the radio! Mista!

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.350
Damn it! He can't hear me.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.170
It's better than him not noticing!

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.210
He's already there!

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.990
Mista! He's already on the radio!

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.900
Come on! Pass, pass, pass!

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.230
Go, Six Bullets!

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.930
Menacing

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.940
Here we go!

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.140
Shoot!

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.290
Bazoo

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.510
Yay!

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.780
Heck yeah!

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.300
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.850
D-Did he get him?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.840
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.310
Wh-What was that noise?

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.790
Gunshots.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.820
Did it bother you?

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.310
It probably wasn't as loud as in the movies.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.950
But if it did bother you...

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.490
I'm sorta busy right now,

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.160
so I'll listen to your complaints later.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.750
Guess Giorno just can't wait.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.560
So there was a rear entrance...

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.610
Meaning he came through this 
door and got on the radio.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.480
Either he was being cautious

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:07.080
or he's just used to always 
going through the back door.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.390
Still...

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.810
Good job, Bullets!

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.810
Yay!

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:11.980
Leg!

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.490
Leg! Hey, hey!

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.490
We got his right leg!

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.980
We shot him right through his right leg!

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.720
Yeah, you sure did.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.030
Now he won't get away!

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.080
There are a bunch of people outside...

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.400
And this side is basically a cliff.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.250
There's no way he could climb up.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.360
He must be scurrying about right now.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.460
If he were to hide somewhere...

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.430
He must be in that truck.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:55.700
If he's a Stand user, his Stand is probably 
close-range and extremely powerful.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:01.740
If he was a remote-control type, 
he would've attacked me by now.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.970
In that case, the guy who 
just got shot in the leg

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.800
is probably hiding behind the truck,

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.300
trying to lure me as close to him 
as possible so that he can attack.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.460
Well, it's not like he's going to 
get me, even if I get close to him.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.800
He's probably just beyond there.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.680
But so long as we don't 
know what his Stand is,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.700
going over there alone 
isn't a safe plan at all.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.260
I should wait for Giorno and—

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.690
Well, I guess that option's out.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.600
The guy's in the driver's seat.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.770
He must've jump-started the engine.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.610
It'll be bad news if this 
truck gets away right now.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.070
Damn it! This isn't good!

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.420
I haven't seen his face yet!

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.950
Giorno probably hasn't, either!

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.820
I don't know what his Stand is 
yet, but I don't have a choice!

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.910
This is for the ten billion and Bucciarati!

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.240
Eat lead!

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.860
Mista!

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:41.850
