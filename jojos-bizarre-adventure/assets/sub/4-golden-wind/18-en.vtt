WEBVTT

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.190
I should be able to meet up 
with Melone in about an hour.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.110
Ghiaccio, I'll leave the 
situation to you and Melone.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.440
You can never be too careful.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.870
I'll stay here and try to figure 
out where they're headed.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.740
Got it, Risotto.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.060
How much longer are you going 
to make me wait? Hurry up.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.440
You should have no problem restoring this.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.760
Risotto.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.550
Do you really think you can get 
away with betraying Passione?

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.000
We're a bit short on time.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.660
Next will be your left eye.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.990
As long as you have your right hand 
and right eye, you can still work.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.400
You should know better than anyone!

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.590
Anyone who betrays the boss will be erased...

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.210
Episodio 18  Head to Venice!

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.460 line:20%
What?!

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.970 line:20%
The hand that I cut off has already 
become another living creature

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.670 line:20%
and invaded your body.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.050
As you can see, it turned into a piranha!

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.070
There's a huge hole that goes 
all the way to its head...

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.650
and it can still move?

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.750
Wh-What's wrong, Babyhead?

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.200
Answer me! Hey!

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.450
This is turtle shit...

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.190
This is literally shit that 
the turtle left behind!

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.620
Why the hell do I have to go through this?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.540
Damn it!

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.820
This pain in my heart...

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.400
You're going to make up for this

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.970
by dying in disgrace! I'll see to that!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.930
If Bucciarati and Trish won't turn back 
to normal unless I destroy you...

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.710
then I'll do it!

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.520
You're not getting away. 
Next, I'll go for your head!

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.370
Go ahead and try it...

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.730
you dickhead!

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.730 position:20%
Dickhead
I'll kill you...
Go ahead and try it...

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.970
Damn it...

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.380
The only problem with auto-tracking is 
that it won't listen to me 100 percent.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.580
You bastard!

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.730
You got me three times already.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.080
I know the range of your attacks!

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.370
That bastard's range...

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.510
just grew!

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.690
It's gotten taller?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.020
It must've grown even more 
because it got pissed off!

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.770
Di molto!

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.860
I knew choosing that woman as the 
mother was the right choice!

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.490
Simple is best.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.660
I'm going to kill this bastard 
exactly how I want to kill him!

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.370
Bring it back, Golden Wind!

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.750
Die!

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.960
Useless!

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.220
A direct hit.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.470
You should get your eyes checked.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.850
You didn't hit my head!

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.430
I've won! This is the end!

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.020
I told you, it's useless.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.400
Wh-What the hell?!

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.810
Look again.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.240
The hand that Golden Wind 
brought back wasn't its own.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.650
It's the bike.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.490
I gave the bike life and had 
it return to us as a hand.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.860
Crush

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.860
You just took that bike into your body,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.800
as a part of you.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.980
This is nothing...

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.160
I'll just split apart and get away aga—

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.360
Think about it.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.350
There's gasoline in bikes.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.140
I'm pretty sure I can cause a big enough 
explosion to keep you from splitting apart

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.480
in time to escape.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.190
What?!

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.510
<c.coloraa35a8>Ka</c><c.colore21b66>boo</c><c.color9e34a1>om</c>

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.660
Sizzling... Burning...

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.790
Looks like doing what you 
wanted was useless...

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.290
in the end.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.290
Burn burn burn burn burn burn burn...ing...!

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.270
I-It disappeared?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.070
My contact with it disappeared?!

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.180
Damn it! This is unbelievable!

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.470
Curse you, newbie!

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.370
He did it.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.200
It should be somewhere around here...

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.420
My car is gone!

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.300
Where's my car? Was it stolen?!

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.790
That's Melone's bike...

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.630
I was told to leave no stone unturned and

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.250
take a leaf out of someone's book if 
I have to, in order to find them...

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.650
I get the "leave no stone unturned" part.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.320
I totally get it.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.970
I mean, you have to turn 
stones over to find stuff.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.450
But what the hell does it mean to 
take a leaf out of someone's book?!

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.190
What's a leaf doing inside a book?!

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.350
Damn it!

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.780
What's that supposed to mean?!

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.160
Why the hell is there a leaf in a book?!

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.420
You think I'm stupid?! Damn it!

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.240
Hey, Melone! Bucciarati and his 
crew are nowhere to be found!

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.200
Are you listening?! Hello?!

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.500
I hear you...

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.020
But I haven't completely failed just yet!

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.390
I still have Bucciarati's blood!

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.750
I can create an infinite number of Juniors!

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.710
I'll have them track Bucciarati 
down immediately!

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.170
You'd better, Melone.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.640
We need to be extra careful with the newbie.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.640
We should get rid of him first.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.100
I'll find an even better mother

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.300
and create an even more 
powerful and invincible

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.020
Junior to go track them down.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.340
What the hell was that?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.700
It looked like a snake...

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.820
What? What's wrong?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.160
What's a snake doing at a station in Rome?

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.540
I-It's burning!

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.090
This is... that newbie's ability...

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.260
He must've used Junior's corpse to—

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.760
Hello?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.150
Hey, Melone! What's wrong? Hey!

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.570
The venomous snake I left 
at Roma Termini Station

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.850
reverted to being one of 
the enemy's components.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.520
We disposed of the user.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.630
That makes five.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.820
If the information we have is correct,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.660
there are only two members 
of the Hitman Team left.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.870
Still, we can't let our guard down.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.400
Let's haul ass to Venice!

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.540
Now Melone, too?

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.100
Shit! Shit! Shit!

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.510
Shit!

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.610
Hello?!

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.210
It's me. I've managed to 
get that thing analyzed.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.850
Huh?!

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.310
I'm sending the data right now.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.280
We've received a new order from the boss.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.380
Abbacchio, could you come 
over here by this chair?

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.360
Me?

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.620
Here's the order.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:27.000
"Have Abbacchio use his Moody Jazz 
near the chair and rewind 14 hours."

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.400
Someone was inside this turtle 
before we got here.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.710
I think that's what this suggests.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.030
Got it.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.970
Then I'll search from around 15 hours back.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.270
It transformed.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.620
Hey, I've seen that geezer before!

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.230
That's the capo, Mr. Pericolo.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.280
So he was the one who placed the turtle

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.990
next to the water fountain at Naples Station.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.950
And approximately 14 hours 
ago, he entered this turtle.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.920
I'm continuing the replay.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:08.330
Bucciarati and team, I will now 
give you your final order.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.130
Final order?

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.470
The reason we're using this method to give 
you information is to prevent leaks.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.790
I'm about to tell you something of utmost 
importance that no one else must learn:

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.350
how you're going to hand 
Trish over to the boss.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.210
How we're going to...

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.350
...hand Trish over?

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.860
Well, here it is.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.060
Once you safely get to Venice,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:36.440
go to this sculpture and retrieve 
the OA-DISC that's inside.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.070
It contains the data on how 
you're going to hand her over.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.720
Hey! He set it on fire!

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.370
Abbacchio, pause it!

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.180
Right.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.040
I'm pretty sure this is the 
entrance to Venice...

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.130
Right in front of Santa Lucia Station.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.000
The lion statue is from there.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.640
That is all.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.480
Make sure that you obtain the OA-DISC.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.050
They've already found out about me.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:09.840
The most important thing is to 
deliver Trish safely to her father.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.210
We mustn't leave any kind of evidence.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:20.400
Thanks to the boss, I was able to live a 
very wealthy, blessed, and fulfilling life.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.910
My mission is now over.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.370
I pray from the bottom of 
my heart that you stay safe.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.090
What the hell?!

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.290
Mr. Pericolo...

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.590
They should've received the order by now.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:07.620
Obtain the disc, or getting to me 
is going to prove rather difficult.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.120
The most important thing is 
what awaits at the end...

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.700
Bring my daughter Trish here...

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.320
to Venice.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.780
The marine fortress city on the water, 
visible in the morning haze: Venice.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.720
There is only one road by which one can 
travel there from the mainland by car:

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.530
the Ponte della Libertà, which stretches for a 
length of 3.5 kilometers over a shallow ocean.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.450
The station lies just beyond the bridge.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.510
The lion statue where the disc is 
hidden can be found in a square there.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.830
Giorno, there's no one tailing us so far.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.250
Yes. There's no one coming 
from the front, either.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.200
The city is still asleep.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.590
We're the only car on this road.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.730
Why do the windows keep 
fogging up so quickly?

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:09.180
Ow!

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.140
What the hell?!

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.400
I apologize.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.480
The tires just slipped a bit.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.730
On a straight bridge like this?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.610
Be more careful, damn it! 
Do you even have a license?

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.590
No. I'm only fifteen.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.990
What's that thing stuck on the window?

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.970
It's on the inside.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.950
I didn't notice it when 
I was looking outside...

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.330
No, wait...

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.130
That shape...

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.380
It's a finger!

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.310
Let's open the windows a bit.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.770
It's morning, so the different temperatures
inside and outside the car are fogging them up.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.230
Wh-What?! What's with this wind?

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.520
At first, we were scared frozen... But...

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.210
With the help of a computer, 
it wasn't too hard to recreate

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.200
the ashes that were lying next 
to Pericolo in the photo.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.080
You guys are naïve!

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.170
There's no way you can get 
away from the Hitman Team!

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.330
An enemy?! They somehow got 
onto the roof of the car!

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.840
Mista, what are you doing?! Shoot the roof!

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.680
This car is being frozen 
at an insane speed.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.980
It's so cold that my finger 
got stuck to the window

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.060
and broke off before I even felt the cold.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.020
If I don't peel my face off of it, 
my brain's gonna freeze up.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.800
But I'm not sure if I want to 
sacrifice my face, either...

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.830
Where's the turtle?

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.360
I don't see the turtle inside the car.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.340
You two aren't with Trish and Bucciarati?

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.080
If you're actually bothering to split up...

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.950
I got it!

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.960
That means you must be on a mission 
to get something extremely important.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.610
The location in the picture...

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.830
There must be something 
at the station in Venice!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.550
Blood finally spurted from my hand!

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.510
Yeehaw!

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.710
<c.color22d348>Bonk</c>

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.060
I-Ice!

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.730
The guy's encased himself in ice and 
froze himself to the roof of the car!

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.660
The bullets can't get through to him!

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.570
What's wrong?

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.690
C-Crap! We're starting to freeze, too!

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.400
Save me!

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.700
Number Two!

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.740
Don't go!

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.910
Number Two! Number Three!

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.740
<c.color20baf4>Fwooooo</c>

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.310
What?!

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:46.420
A-All I did was blink... and now 
my eyelashes are stuck together!

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.510
He must've waited for this to happen 
before getting on the roof...

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.290
This car is currently going 
80 kilometers per hour.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.980
Which means...

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.180
It's the same as being stuck in wind 
blowing at 20 meters per second.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.100
The effective temperature drops by 1° Celsius 
for every meter of wind velocity,

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.030
so we're currently freezing at -20° Celsius.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.570
Then stop the damn car!

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.240
Why the hell are you still flooring it?!

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.780
Yes. I've been trying to stop it.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.540
But the brake pedal is 
frozen and won't go down!

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.020
I'm losing the steering wheel, too.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.960
The engine's running and doesn't 
seem like it's going to stop.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.510
The surface of the car has 
reached -100° Celsius for sure!

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.510
And at incredible speed! 
So this is... the enemy's ability!

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.140
Th-The blood that was spurting 
out of my hand froze...

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.190
The moisture from my breathing caused 
my nostrils to freeze together...

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.330
And now, my lips...

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.860
Shit! I can't breathe!

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.950
S-Stop the car, Giorno!

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.290
You can turn the car into a 
frog or something, can't you?!

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.370
Do something with your ability!

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.850
I've already tried that, as well.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:04.090
But there are no organisms that 
can be born at -100° Celsius!

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.800
You know Paris, France?
In English, they pronounce it "Paris,"

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.690
but everyone else pronounces it 
without the "s" sound, like the French do.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.390
But with Venezia, everyone pronounces 
it the English way, "Venice."

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.560
Like <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> 
and <i>Death in Venice</i>...

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.980
Why, though?! 
Why isn't the title <i>Death in Venezia</i>?!

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.230
<c.color4011c6>Sm</c><c.color8f009b>a</c><c.colorbb0078>c</c><c.colorbc005e>k </c><c.color4011c6>Sm</c><c.color8f009b>a</c><c.colorbb0078>c</c><c.colorbc005e>k </c><c.color4011c6>Sm</c><c.color8f009b>a</c>ck

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.720
Are you friggin' mocking me?!

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.610
It takes place in Italy, so use 
the Italian word, damn it!

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.250
That shit pisses me off!

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.820
Bunch of dumbasses!

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.710
Looks like it's finally becoming 
a bit difficult to drive.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.890
Mista...

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.590
My Golden Wind needs heat.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.920
So sadly, all I'm really 
useful for right now...

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.890
is picking up bullets.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.350
You won't be able to fill 
the car with any more holes.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.560
I'll just freeze you to an even lower tem—

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.120
When you fire bullets, 
they heat up, don't they?

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.810
So when I fire the bullets that 
Giorno picked up for me...

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:20.940
It creates heat!

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.610
I guess I'll go ahead and shout 
this for Giorno, while I'm at it...

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.500
Golden Wind!

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.170
We did it!

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:44.180
Plant roots have the energy to prop up 
asphalt in roads and even shatter rocks!

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.660
Keep hold of the steering wheel, Giorno!

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.410
We're gonna get the hell outta here!

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.890
<c.color1339f3>S</c><c.color2c78fa>h</c><c.color56b1ff>i</c><c.colorb7e1fd>n</c><c.colordeeef7>k</c>

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.390
Tch.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.990
So that must be the ability of the 
newbie Melone was talking about.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.950
But you're not getting away!

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.750
Seriously? That bastard!

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.710
He's still coming after us!

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:15.210
I'm gonna be the one who gets his hands on 
whatever's at the station, no matter what.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.620
You're wasting your bullets.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.980
My ability, White Ice, freezes the moisture 
in the air to an extremely low temperature,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.020
which I then wear like armor.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.630
This also allows me to skate,

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.480
but I'm also wrapped in something so 
strong that even bullets can't pierce it!

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.570
Go faster, Giorno!

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.220
I can't go any faster!

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.010
The tires are still slipping.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.990
Even worse, they found 
out about the station!

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.410
They haven't found out about
the turtle where Trish is,

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.910
so depending on how you look at it, 
that's kind of a bright side.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.870
You're always so optimistic, aren't you?

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.170
You're very unusual.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.420
He's coming! Floor it! Faster!

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.750
I told you, I can't!

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.260
If we slip, we're going 
to lose even more spee—

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.840
Just do it, damn it! 
I said floor it, so floor it!

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.060
I told you! This is useless!

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.110
Number Three and Number Two 
up on the roof, come back!

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.430
I hope you get to share a hot, 
passionate kiss with the road.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.320
Your face will be well-acquainted 
with it at the speed you're going.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.040
Yeah!

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.200
Good. We managed to lose him.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.160
Now get us into the city and
head straight for the station!

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.450
Before he can catch up to us, we're going 
to get our hands on the thing and hide!

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.720
Giorno!

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.650
You're not getting away!

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:50.100
There's no way you guys are 
going to make it to the station!

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.600
He's freezing the moisture 
from the car's exhaust!

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.810
What kind of temperature do you 
have to freeze it at to do this shit?

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.190
You bastard! Eat lead again!

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.110
He opened the trunk! Which means...

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.370
Sh-Shit! He got into the trunk! 
Stop the car, Giorno!

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.580
He's gonna freeze the brake pedal 
so it'll be useless again!

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.020
There's no need for that...

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.010
Gunslinger Mista.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:23.010
Seeing as Trish isn't here, this is what 
I was planning to do in the first place.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.130
Shatter—

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.480
G-Giorno!

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.180
It only cracked?

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.170
Is he invincible?

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.780
How can I destroy this armor?

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.360
Giorno! Get away from him!

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.160
No! Not yet!

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.780
We made it to Venice!

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.370
I'm diving into the canal!

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.100
Episodio 19
White Ice
