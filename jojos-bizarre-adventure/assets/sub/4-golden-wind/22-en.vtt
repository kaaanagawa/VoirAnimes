WEBVTT

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.060
It doesn't look like anyone's following us.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.220
Bucciarati, are we not leaving Venice?

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.880
The boss has his own personal elite guards.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.170
I'm sure they've already 
learned of our betrayal.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.130
They're probably... going to 
be coming after us next.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.290
But we don't know what kind 
of abilities they have.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.380
Correct. If we try to cross 
the sea unprepared,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.520
they might strike us there.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.520
Let's wait and see for now.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.470
Understood.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.980
Mista!

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.830
We're hungry!

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.860
I'm starving!

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.630 line:20%
Feed us!

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.490
Our guts are running on empty!

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.320
Calm the hell down!

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.150
I know this is really bad timing,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.460
but could we stop by a 
restaurant or something?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.240
Well...

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.360
I guess we need to refill our guts, as well.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.600
Episodio 22 The "G" in Guts

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.630
You guys have heard of vegetarians, right?

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.510
Are they allowed to eat, like, cheese?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.880
Probably not.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.720
I mean, milk and eggs come 
from cows and chickens.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.170
That means they probably can't have 
cake that uses whipped cream, either.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.910
What?! They can't have cake, either?

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.010
I wonder if their bodies actually 
function better, then.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.400
Then what do those guys do 
about shoes or handbags?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.200
Those are made from leather.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.540
Well, if they're vegetarians 
because they feel bad for animals,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.760
they probably wear sneakers 
and carry backpacks instead.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.170
Man, they're intense.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.630
So would you have old ladies dressing 
like basketball players, then?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.680 line:20%
They'd never let them into a 
restaurant looking like that.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.000
Giorno, being all scared won't 
make anything happen.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.570
Let's just eat for now.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.530
Yes, I know... 
Still, we need to be on our guard.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.870
For example, there's a possibility 
someone could've poisoned our food.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.730
Y-You bastard! What the hell 
do you think you're doing?!

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.440
Huh?

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.220
What are you gonna do about 
this, you little shit?!

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.840
You think you can pay for this?! 
This suit cost four million lire!

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.820
Let's take this outside!

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.260
<c.color1e7aa6>S</c><c.color0e9c77>m</c><c.color058b3a>a</c><c.color80bec8>s</c><c.colore6caf0>h</c>

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.290
You must be an enemy!

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.170
What?!

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.840
You an enemy?! Huh?!

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.060
Well, are you?!

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.440
You an enemy?! Take that! And that!

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.020
Hold it, Narancia, Mista.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.820
I don't think this guy's an enemy.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.780
He's unconscious.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.520
He's totally just a random civilian.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.500
What? Are you serious?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.700
Crap! What am I gonna do?

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.750
Yeah, this stain's gonna 
be hard to get out.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.990
A single drop of wine on a 
white suit really stands out.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.160
I can't pay for this shit!

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.000
Well, the location of the stain 
might make it look like a button.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.750
If he puts a button there, he can hide it.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.800
While we're at it, let's get him to make 
sure there isn't any poison in our food.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.940
That's a great idea!

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.730
Hey, that's enough.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.170
More importantly...

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.970
What's going on with Bucciarati right now?

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.600
After that battle with the boss, 
Bucciarati's heart definitely stopped.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.450
And when he got hurt back there, 
there wasn't a single drop of blood.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.280
What about now?

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.920
But right now isn't the best time to find out.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.960
I'll keep this secret to myself for now.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.200
So, Bucciarati, what are 
we going to do now?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.300
The boss's Stand makes time disappear,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.510
and the boss is the only one who 
can move freely in that state.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.540
He's invincible.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.860
It doesn't matter who it is.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.100
Anyone's attack becomes 
useless before that Stand.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.620
However...

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.390
That'll change once we find 
out who the boss is!

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.900
Because if we find out the boss's identity,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.880
we might be able to assassinate him.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.570
And to do that, we need to find out

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.050
who he really is.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.300
But how are we going to find him?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.380
The boss is the type of guy who's 
gotten rid of any trace of himself.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.250
Trish.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.510
There must be some kind 
of hint involving Trish.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.360
Everyone was after Trish, and the 
boss was trying to eliminate Trish.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.410
Right?

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.940
A-About that...

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.950
I don't really want to involve 
Trish in this anymore...

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.340
Th-This feeling sucks.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.070
Trish doesn't know anything!

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.040
If she finds out her actual father tried 
to kill her, she'll be in shock.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.320
Bucciarati, please!

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.000
Let's not talk about the boss's identity 
and stuff like that in front of her.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.960
There's no need for that, Narancia.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.960
I've already known that... for a while.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.170
T-Trish...

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.020
I remembered something when you said 
he got rid of any trace of himself.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.120
My mother had mentioned that 
she met my father in Sardinia.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.820
Sardinia...

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.030
When I was little, my mother told me

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.030
that they had met while she was vacationing,

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.790
and he told her he'd be right back...

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.230
But then he disappeared forever,
leaving nothing behind,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.930
not even a photo or his name.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.500
Before he became the 
boss of the organization...

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.820
Fifteen years ago...

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.380
Then was he born and raised in...

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.680
I'm not sure about all that, but...

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.840
Sardinia. His past and true 
identity should be in Sardinia.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.000
Why are you telling us that?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.820
We might end up killing your father!

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.020
No, we are determined to defeat him!

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.410
You defeating him or not isn't my problem.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.670
But... I want to know!

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.090
I want to know who I came from!

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.940
I'm not about to die 
before I find that out!

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.670
Hey, Narancia.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:11.380
Looks like she's way stronger than you thought.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.760
Fine.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.040
Sardinia...

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.000
That's our next destination 
after we escape from Venice.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.760
That's where we'll find out 
who the boss really is.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.400
I was under the impression 
that Trish was like me,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.460
but I guess she'd already made up her mind.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.270
I just followed on a whim, 
so I still don't know

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.430
if there's any hope in this trip or not.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.180
Huh?

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.750
An enemy! There's an enemy nearby!

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.880
There's a shark in my soup!

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.700
Li'l Bomber!

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.230
Giorno! Get Trish inside the turtle!

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.720
Abbacchio, cover the right! 
Mista, guard the left!

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.750
Where, Narancia? Where are they?

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.410
Inside the soup! 
They were somehow already in it!

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.060
Where are they now?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.650
But they were there!

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.730
There was something like 
a shark in my soup!

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.700
I don't see anything strange about it.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.910
Does that mean we lost them?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.000
<c.color6a71bc>Sw</c><c.color92a8d3>oo</c><c.colordbecf7>sh</c>

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.710
Narancia!

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.540
What happened?!

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.270
Narancia! Were you attacked somewhere?

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.460
Where did they get you?

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.320
Narancia, what's wrong? What's there?!

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.940
I'm asking you what's wrong, Narancia!

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.400
Hold it, Mista. 
I don't think Narancia can talk...

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.230
What? You can't talk?

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.720
What's wrong, Narancia? 
What are you pointing at?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.290
Water? You want a sip of water?

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.900
H-Hey! Th-This is bad! Look!

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.570
Narancia's tongue! It's gone!

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.900
On top of that, I don't 
think he's breathing!

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.750
This isn't good.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.610
I can use Golden Wind to 
create parts for his tongue,

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.440
but it'll take time to finish.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.050
Hey, come on! He's about to suffocate here!

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.000
Mista, do you have a pen?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.500
A pen?! Y-Yeah, I have one...

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.170
<c.colord95e02>Stab</c>

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.130
Looks like he's breathing.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.440
I'll give life to this pen to 
create parts for his tongue.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.350
That way, he can breathe 
while I create his tongue.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.080
I see...

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.750
So that's Giorno Giovanna.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.790
Now I'm starting to understand the 
information the boss gave us.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:19.160
We're going to have to be the most 
careful around that newbie kid.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.880
Yeah... I'm a bit surprised 
he saved Narancia.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:29.850
I thought my Crush would 
be enough for this job,

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:35.900
but apparently, I'm going to need your 
help eliminating all five of them,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.570
Tiziano.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:43.370
As the boss's elite guards, 
we're going to have to defeat him here.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.660
Are you ready, Squalo?

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.810
All according to plan.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:53.200
As long as we can lure them to 
water, Crush is invincible.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.610
Our plan will decide everything.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.640
We'll take care of them 
one at a time, Tiziano.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.790
Yeah, Squalo...

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.990
We'll use Narancia.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.970
Crush

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.970
Squalo

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.390
Are you all right, Narancia?

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.480
Yeah...

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.980
You guys saved me.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.520
What did you see?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.200
How did the enemy Stand attack?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.100
It... c-came from the soup...

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.140
Narancia, don't force it.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.080
I-I'm fine. I can talk.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.160
Hey, Narancia, what's the enemy like?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.540
Where'd he run off to?

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.800
He was...

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.630
He was like a pebble!

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.050
He was huge, and he ran into the restaurant!

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.400
Huh? Huge like a pebble?

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.860
But earlier, you were saying 
it was in your soup!

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.180
You're contradicting yourself.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.300
Huh? Did I just say that?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.740
So, then... is the enemy about this big?

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.910
Nope.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.220
Huh? No, wait!

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.290
Then, like, this big?

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.000
U-Um...

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.870
No? Then, like, this big?

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.350
Yup, exactly.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.690
So something this big was in your soup,

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.290
and it went running into the restaurant?

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.230
Yup.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.260
Huh? What?

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.230
We can't get a clear picture 
of this enemy at all.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.730
Does that mean it was really fast?

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.710
Nope! It was slow!

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.270
What?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:34.930
Huh?!

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.270
If it was huge and slow, 
why didn't we see it?

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.910
Did you actually see a Stand?

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.060
Of course I did... n—

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.560
You keep contradicting yourself!

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:55.530
You're not trying to act tough 
because the enemy got you, are you?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.530
I... I...

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.150
Answer me, damn it! 
You didn't actually see anything, did you?

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.250
Of course I did...

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.150
not...

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.210
So you didn't actually 
see anything, after all!

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.430
This is no time to screw around!

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.470
There's no one suspicious nearby.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.400
Apparently, it's a remote-controlled Stand.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.610
That must mean that the user 
is watching us from somewhere.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.810
In that case, we should 
leave here immediately.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.710
Let's follow the channel out to the sea.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.140
Yeah, Giorno!

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.300
Let's do it! Let's use the channel!

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.520
Yes, Narancia. That's what I just...

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.190
Narancia?

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.820
Narancia, why do you keep 
covering your mouth?

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.280
Let me see it.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.600
What the hell? It's completely normal.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.350
Yup! I'm totally fine!

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.340
There's no problem at all, Mista!

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.810
So, what are we going to do, Bucciarati?

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.330
Are we going out to sea?

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.280
No. Let's not follow the channel just yet.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.020
This is our chance.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.870
We're going to use it to defeat that enemy!

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.760
The boss wasn't expecting our betrayal,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.560
which means there probably aren't that 
many members of his elite guard here.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.940
If we defeat him now,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.710
I'm sure we'll be able to get through 
the seas of Venice just fine.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.010
I see. You have a point. I agree.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.930
Yeah, I agree.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.410
Very well, Bucciarati.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.880
If you say so.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:47.060
Abbacchio, could you use your 
Moody Jazz to replay what happened?

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.850
Yeah, sure.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.680
Where do you want to start?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.610
From when the soup was still on the table?

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.190
Yeah.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.450
What the hell, Narancia?

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.280
Guys! The enemy's right over there!

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.880
Over there? You mean inside 
the restaurant's bathroom?

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.290
Narancia, you damn well better 
have seen something this time!

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.060
Yup, I did!

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.510
After them. We'll settle things 
with this enemy here and now.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.720
Come on, Giorno. Let's go.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.660
Right...

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.680
Well done, Narancia.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.900
None of his friends realize 
that there's another Stand

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:50.490
besides Crush, which travels 
from liquid to liquid.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.450
Yes, they don't realize that my Stand,

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:57.090
Talking Mouth, is attached to 
your tongue and making you say

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.550
the exact opposite of what you mean.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.960
All right, I'm gonna go kill 
the rest of them. Grazie.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:06.980
Schwing

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.950
S-So that's what was going on! Damn it!

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.910
They were using me to get everyone 
near the water, one by one.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.850
How dare you underestimate me?!

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.600
I don't sense anyone here...

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.200
Let's at least figure out 
what the enemy looks like.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.110
Moody Jazz!

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.160
Transform into whoever was in here a 
few dozen seconds ago, and pursue them!

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:34.760
Narancia!

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.270
Seeing who the enemy is 
through Moody Jazz is fine,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.400
but don't pursue them!

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.780
If it gets into water, 
they don't stand a chance!

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.630
In that case, I'll do everything I 
can to keep them away from water!

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.850
Over here...

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.930
Moody Jazz is transforming.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.600
Water's bad news! Don't look in there!

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.200
Look at me! Look in here!

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.050
What the hell? That's disgusting!

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.920
Come over here, Abbacchio!

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.300
Look in here!

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.580
What are you talking about? 
Have you turned into some kind of pervert?

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.050
We're trying to investigate because 
you said you saw the enemy in here!

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.050
Did you really see them in here?

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.670
Of course, I—

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.750
Seriously, what is your problem?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.750
Bucciarati, there's a chance Narancia 
was just seeing things in here.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.830
We might be better off looking at 
the table if we want to pursue them.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.080
Yeah.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.580
Cut the crap, Narancia!

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.030
I'm not gonna let you take us all down!

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.450
Narancia, what happened to your finger?

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.670
Did you snag it somewhere?

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.080
Here, I'll stop the bleeding.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.110
That bastard's going to try 
to use my blood to move.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.140
N-No! S-Stay back, Giorno!

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.560
Yeah! Fix me right up, Giorno!

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.510
There's definitely something strange.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.610
Is something wrong with 
the inside of your mouth?

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.850
They attacked your tongue earlier. 
Does that have anything to do with it?

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.110
Great job, Giorno! You're so intuitive.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.020
Just a little more...

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.580
Just a little more, 
and Giorno will figure it out.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.360
But you're bleeding really badly.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.420
First, let's take care of that wound.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.080
Now, let me see it.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.650
No! You can't touch the blood!

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.360
Come on, Narancia.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.320
This is bad! Stay back!

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:49.680
Hurry!

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.850
Li'l Bomber!

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.680
Damn it...

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.150
Narancia,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.140
you seem to be under attack by something,

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.670
but there must be some reason 
you can't tell us the truth.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.680
Yes! He figured it out!

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.770
Was there something left in your 
mouth from the first attack?

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.930
Like, an ability that makes you say 
the opposite of what you mean?

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.940
Yes! That's it, Giorno!

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.500
Sh-Shit! There's water from the pipe!

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.950
Giorno!

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.380
Episodio 23
Crush and Talking Mouth
