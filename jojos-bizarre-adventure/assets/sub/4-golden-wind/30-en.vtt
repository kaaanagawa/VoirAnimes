WEBVTT

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.690
That's perfect. That spot's just fine!

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.270
Bang

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.560
Bang

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:04.810
Bang

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.020
Bang

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.270
Bang

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.440
Bang

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.270
Booom

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.990
Yee-haw!

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.190
Well done, Mista!

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.440
As long as we move upward, 
their attack won't begin.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.870
I see...

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.550
I think I understand how they survived 
so long after betraying the boss.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.740
You got the footage, didn't you, Secco?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.140
The desperate looks on their faces as 
they were fighting for their lives?

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.310
Good!

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:58.560
Good, good, good, good, good, good, 
good, good, good, good, good...

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.700
Well done, Secco!

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.930
The more curious someone is, 
the stronger they become mentally.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.670
Humans are far more curious than any other 
creature, and that's why they evolved.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.670
I can't wait to see it...

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.770
I can't wait to see guys like him die.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.440
Oh, right. Forgive me, I'd forgotten.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.680
You get a treat for taking 
such a good picture.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.300
How does two sound?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.900
Three, you say? You want three sweet ones?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.360
You little glutton.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.700
All right. You can have three.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.540
Here it comes, Secco. Here comes three!

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.960
Oh, my bad.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.980
Good!

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.270
Good, good, good, good, good, good, 
good, good, good, good, good...

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.560
You're such a good boy, Secco!

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.140
Now, go!

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.150
You go to Bucciarati and the others, Secco.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.270
You and your Stand, Sanctuary.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.370
Episodio 30 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 1

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.990 line:20%
What are we going to do, Bucciarati?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.350 line:20%
We can't go back out to sea.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.340
If that mold's range is extended by 
the corpses, as Giorno guessed,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.690
then instead of tracking down the user,

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.340
we're better off finding a car and 
getting out of this village.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.760
Our number one priority 
right now is to get to Rome.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.280
Giorno, how's Narancia's treatment going?

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.220
It's hard to treat him in this village.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.810
There's living mold in his wounds.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.240
All right, Mista, climbing up is fine.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.790
We're going to go up those 
stairs and get ourselves a car.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.230
That's a bit cruel, Bucciarati.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.960
He didn't even ask Narancia 
if he was okay or not.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.720
Not to mention, earlier,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.290
when you were trying desperately 
to get up from the boat,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.470
what did he say?

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.870
He coldly ordered you to throw the turtle.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.220
What are you so mad about?

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.390
Of course he said that. I was the 
one who went down into the boat.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.430
It's good that we made it out alive, 
but because of me, we almost died.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.350
Besides, if Bucciarati hadn't 
told me to throw the turtle,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.570
I might've dropped it into the ocean.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.610
I know that!

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.700
What I'm saying is that 
he's cold to everyone!

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.040
Say... I don't really understand 
how girls feel, but...

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.220
Were you hoping he would 
ask you if you were okay?

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.560
I already know how Bucciarati is,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.930
but you're dying to know more about him.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.440
Excuse me? I'm dying to what?

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.890
Well, getting to Rome is what's 
most important right now.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.040
You can figure out your feelings later.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.150
I'm really not doing so great right now.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.110
Let me rest for a bit.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.350
The only way we can go is up right now,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.620
but if we should ever have to go 
down any lower than where we are...

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.660
We'll be fine.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.720
This village is built on 
the side of a mountain.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.930
All the roads are uphill.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.580
And outside the village, 
there are cars still running.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.260
That means the mold's 
range hasn't expanded yet.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.940
We just need to acquire a car and 
get out of this village quickly.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.940
We need to hurry to Rome at all costs.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.710
Which car should we take?

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.520
One with a corpse next to it, because that 
corpse should have the key to that car.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.870
It was just the mold breaking 
that corpse's hand apart.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.860
I'll watch our rear.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.310
You hurry up and get a car.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.460
Right.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.770
Mista, I take that back.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.170
Something... Something is wrong.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.190
Hurry and go up!

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.140
R-Right!

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.530
What are you doing, Mista?! 
I told you to go up!

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.570
I already am, Bucciarati!

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.490
But...

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.530
We're sinking!

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.490
We're moving away from the wall!

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.220
What's going on?

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.370
The whole staircase is being 
pulled into the ground!

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.950
This must be a different Stand 
user than the one using the mold!

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.270
There's another one after us!

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.390
This isn't good! 
We need to hurry and climb up!

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.260
If we go down any further, 
the mold will attack us!

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.520
Jump onto the wall!

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.830
My gun!

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.270
It's not sinking...

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.070
The staircase itself is sinking 
into the ground, like it's melting!

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.860
What's that?

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.320
The enemy!

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.330
The enemy's down below, 
and he's coming for us!

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.360
Mista! Climb onto the wall!

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.370
Zipper Man!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.950
<c.color261c48>Zu</c><c.color48436b>bo</c><c.color6a5b63>om</c>

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.990
He's fast... This guy is fast.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.880
And this is strange...

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.260
The ground feels solid when I'm
touching it with Zipper Man's hands.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.970
This is a solid stone staircase, 
but I'm sinking into it...

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.720
And this thing is moving around 
freely underneath the hard ground.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.660
This isn't good! I can't tell where he is!

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.980
Where is he coming from?

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.190
Can you hear me, Six Bullets?!

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.490
Come back to me!

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.940
Yee-haw!

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.850
One coming at us from beneath the ground,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.660
and a man-eating mold Stand...

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.720
They're both making the most 
of the other's Stand ability.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.360
This duo is too compatible, more so than 
any other team we've encountered before.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.760
What are they, bound by the 
red thread of fate? Damn it!

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.030
I found one, Bucciarati.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.390
A corpse that's still holding the car key.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.860
You bastard!

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.840
I just caught a glimpse of our enemy!

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.530
He jumped from the stairs 
and dove into the wall!

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.240
Th-This is...

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.200
Run, Mista!

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.380
It's fast! At this rate, 
we might make it to the car,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.590
but we won't have time to start the engine!

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.590
I'll hold them back! Keep going!

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.550
Don't stop, Mista! 
The ground is still hard!

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.120
The bullets are going to ricochet!

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.050
If the sinking ground is 
still hard somehow,

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.850
our best chance is the 
moment I get pulled under.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.160
This guy's the powerful, close-range type.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.440
His range is small.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.240
I should be able to see it as 
soon as it tries to pull me in.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.150
That's when I'll get him!

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.370
There! It showed itself!

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.530
Now!

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.300
Take this!

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.500
Mista!

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.370
I see...

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:14.850
I figured a powerful, close-range type 
might be able to deflect some bullets.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.960
But you see...

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.190
If you're going to deflect bullets, 
my Bullets can do that, too!

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.930
The first three shots I fired should...

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.720
What?!

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.570
He's not going to finish me off?

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.810
So he thinks he can kill me at 
any time, now that I'm hurt?

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.440
Hurry and pick up the key, Bucciarati!

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.940
Start the engine!

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.660
What the hell are you doing?! 
Hurry up and get in the car!

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.910
If we can actually get out of 
this village by car, that's fine.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.410
As long as we can all head for Rome.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.630
Where are you going, Bucciarati?!

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.380
Wh-What?!

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.960
So you're going to track us from 
underground, no matter where we go?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.780
What a terrifying ability.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.730
But do you have any idea where I'm headed?

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.690
Apparently you didn't, huh? 
You had no idea where we were.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.440
Arri, arri, arri, arri, arri...

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.490
Arrivederci!

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.860
Squish

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.000
Cioccolata

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.000
Green Tea

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.330
Arri, arri, arri, arri, arri...

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.420
Arrivederci!

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.160
My...

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.490
My...

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.400
My face!

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.160
What?

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.580
Cioccolata!

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.880
Three days ago... You heard, right?

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:26.640
The Stand that the boss sent into 
the airplane... Notorious Chase...

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.240
Hey, Secco. Aren't you tracking 
them down right now?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.600
Why are you calling me?

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:39.100
Hey, Cioccolata... This is important. 
Very important!

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.610
Chase... Is that thing...

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.650
Is it alive? Or is it a dead Stand?

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.390
What brought this on?

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.250
It's a simple question!

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:57.210
Answer me. If Chase was here,

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:03.510
would your Green Tea's mold 
grow on it? On the dead Stand?

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.460
Notorious Chase...

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.590
Are you talking about the one where 
the user was killed, but his hatred

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.530
was so strong that the 
Stand somehow survived?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.280
Who knows?

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.230
I'm curious about him, but I have no 
idea if the mold would grow on him.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:24.090
But I do know for certain that my Green 
Tea will destroy any living creature.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.070
The mold doesn't grow on inanimate 
objects like rocks, right?

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.620
Forget about that! Quit wasting time 
and film those guys dying already!

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.410
That's just it, though, Cioccolata!

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.370
Look up the hill. Look at the road.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.590
Hey, Secco...

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.420
Why is there a car leaving the village?

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.440
Is the one driving the car one of them?

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.600
Why did you just let them go?

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.010
Hey, Cioccolata... It's just unbelievable...

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.590
He hit me in the face.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:05.280
That Bucciarati guy... 
He didn't have any mold growing on him.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.990
Even though he jumped down!

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.150
I can't believe he attacked me there...

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.200
It's totally unbelievable!

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:21.210
His body won't grow mold! 
What the hell is going on?!

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.870
I haven't the slightest.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.760
I totally thought...

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.850
that you had plummeted.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.730
You scared me, Bucciarati.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.880
Did you hang on to the wall with zippers?

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.830
I guess it might've been a close call.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.530
It doesn't look like the mold got you at all.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.520
Mista, rest for a bit.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.580
I closed your wounds, but if you move 
now, they'll start bleeding again.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.050
I'll look out for any cars 
that might be following us.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.570
Right...

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.500
Bucciarati, your wrist... Did you hurt it?

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.220
Please, let me see it.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.210
Are you listening, Bucciarati?

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.560
If the mold got to you, you're in danger.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.740
Please, let me see it.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.400
That's...

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.660
Th-That's impossible...

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.810
Your skin is so cold...

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.660
A-And your pulse...

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.660
Giorno, did you just say something to me?

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.060
I couldn't hear you.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.960
What's... going on?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.340
Impossible...

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.200
It simply can't be!

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.450
O-Oh, yeah... 
Something similar happened before.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.520
I thought it was just my 
imagination back then...

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.530
When we were leaving Venice.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.420
Apparently, I hurt myself.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.880
Looks like there isn't much time left.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.390
I'm losing more and more 
feeling in my skin...

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:17.820
Or...

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.760
Maybe I never had any to begin with.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.090
That's impossible! Don't tell me, back then...

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.310
When you saved Trish from the boss in Venice...

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.090
Bucciarati, don't tell me... back then...

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.830
It's strange.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.160
I've accepted this as fate.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.690
Just a tiny bit of fate, of chance, 
that Heaven had granted me.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.320
When you healed my wounds in Venice,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.900
it appears the life force you gave me

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.400
allowed me to move for just a bit longer.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.800
Why... Why didn't you say anything?

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.490
My Golden Wind completely 
healed your wounds back then!

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.500
I'm sure it can fix whatever 
you're going through now, too!

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.160
Giorno, I'm sure your Golden Wind

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:13.310
knows more about that than anyone else.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.960
That nothing can be done for those 
whose lives have already ended.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.760
By that time,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.540
my life...

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.380
had already ended.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.020
You won't tell the others about this, right?

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.650
That's impossible... 
But that's impossible, Bucciarati!

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.870
Y-You're—

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.530
Quiet, Giorno!

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.990
Listen. What's that sound? 
Am I just hearing things?

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.370
There's no car following us.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.290
I hear it. It's getting closer.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.170
It's getting really close!

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.000
What?!

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.200
Above us! It's a helicopter!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.930
He dropped some mold on us!

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.010
Wh-What the hell just happened?!

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.280
Bucciarati, we're descending! 
This road goes downhill!

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.430
The mold is going to get us!

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.480
Giorno, Mista! We're jumping out!

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.850
Grab on to me!

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.690
Climb up! Climb up, even if only a little bit!

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.220
Subconscious...

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.720
In a way, Stand abilities are 
the users' subconscious abilities...

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.550
If there's any guilt in their heart,

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.630
they might subconsciously hit the brakes...

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.720
But whoever this is enjoys cruelty.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.450
Actually, he lives for it.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.970
That's how his ability became this.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.690
This guy doesn't have any brakes at all!

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.600
He has no limits on how evil he can be!

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.600
Hey, what's wrong?! 
I-I'll go get a doctor right away!

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.740
Hey, don't! Don't go down that way!

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.860
I'll bring a doctor here right away!

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.740
Hey, what's going on?

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.100
The mold...

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.490
It's spreading instantaneously!

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.870
That's impossible. There are 
three million people living in Rome.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.150
This is nothing like that fishing village!

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.040
And there are members of 
the organization in Rome.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.170
This would be a hit to the boss, too.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.530
This guy doesn't care.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.260
He's enjoying this!

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.160
At this rate, everyone in Rome will die!

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.560
No, this guy's not going to stop, 
even if it spreads further than that!

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.040
There's something else!

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.110
At this rate, the mold's killing range 
will spread to the Colosseum

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.070
faster than we can get there.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.900
Mista! Is that helicopter 
within your gun's range?

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.310
It doesn't matter! 
We have to hit it, no matter what!

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.700
Make sure you take it down!

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.120
Got it! I won't let you get away!

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.040
Go, Six Bullets!

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.000
Yee-haw!

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.270
The guy in the helicopter 
wanted me to shoot at it...

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:08.220
So that the guy who can move around 
underground could safely get to us!

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:13.550
All right, Secco was able to splash 
down safely... or should I say land?

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.570
Now they're cornered.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:21.000
And whoever Bucciarati and 
his men were meeting in Rome

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.320
will be dealt with by Green Tea.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.800
Th-That bastard's coming 
from the top of the hill!

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.680
And we can't go back down!

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.870
Mista, concentrate on the helicopter!

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.670
We can't let it escape!

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.550
I'll deal with this guy.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.800
I-It's no use, Bucciarati! 
It's already too far away!

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.820
I won't be able to hit the fuel 
tank or the propellers from here!

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.960
No, Mista.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.930
You never know until you try!

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.390
It's no use! They won't reach!

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.570
I know the Bullets' range better than anyone.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.060
The helicopter got away!

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.740
The guy underground is coming for us!

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.210
The bullets hit their target, Mista.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.570
Now, the two of us are going to go take 
care of the man in the helicopter.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.670
Let's go after the helicopter!

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.960
Go after it? The helicopter?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.010
What?! What is this?

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.360
We have to take care of him before the 
mold's killing spree reaches the Colosseum!

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.310
Bucciarati,

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.480
we can leave the guy beneath 
the ground to you, right?

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.880
Go, Giorno!

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.240
Run, Mista!

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:50.000
