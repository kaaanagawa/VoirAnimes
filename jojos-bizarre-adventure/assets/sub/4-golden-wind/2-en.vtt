00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.450
Episodio 02  Bucciarati Is Coming

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.970
Giorno Giovanna.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.030
His father is DIO Brando.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.070
DIO always saw women 
as mere tools or food,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.100
so it's unknown how Giorno's 
mother was able to give birth

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.230
to Giorno fifteen years ago 
without being killed.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.160
Giorno's mother was a very beautiful woman,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.050
but she was far from a model mother.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.360
After Giorno was born, they lived in Japan,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.670
but she would often go out 
at all hours of the night,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.830
leaving young Giorno alone at home.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.980
You sure you should leave 
your kid home alone?

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.980
Isn't he, like, two or something?

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.320
Oh, it's fine.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.650
I'm not about to lose my freedom 
just because I had a kid.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.910
Shiobana

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.820
Giorno would wake up in the middle of the 
night, and his mother wouldn't be there.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.450
How terrifying and despairing that 
must be for a child of one or two.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.150
There was no point in crying, 
so Giorno would just sit there, trembling.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.760
When Giorno was four, 
his mother got married.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.370
She married an Italian, and therefore, 
Giorno also became an Italian citizen.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.720
Um...

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.100
What are you doing over here?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.920
Come on, Haruno.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.980
Come take some photos with us.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.140
You mother's waiting for you.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.030
But as you'd suspect, 
when Haruno's mother wasn't around...

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.200
You're always looking at me,
trying to figure out what mood I'm in.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.990
You annoying little brat!

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.110
But it was actually the opposite.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.510
What's the matter?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.130
Oh, the bread.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.330
Here you go.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.750
Jeez, you're such a gloomy kid.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.180
The one who got him into the habit 
of trying to read others' moods

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.740
was this man himself.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.150
This made Giorno

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.350
the perfect target for the local 
kids to take out their anger on.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.570
Whoa, what's wrong, Giorno?

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.820
Why'd you trip over nothing?

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.320
Hey, you kids. Hurry up and get home.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.860
Yes, sir.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.930
Let's go.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.560
Yeah.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.790
Go back to Japan, you little freak.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.020
He never fights back, does he?

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.220
He's so creepy.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.750
He started to believe that he was the 
lowest scum to walk this Earth,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.380
and that it was only a matter of time until

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.630
he would grow up to be like the rest of the 
twisted people who lived in this town.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.310
But a certain incident would 
save Giorno from this fate.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.440
Damn it, where did he go?

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.960
Find him! Don't let him get away!

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.110
He can't get far with those wounds!

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.740
You don't think he went into 
someone's house, do you?

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.490
Keep your eyes on the ground! 
There should be blood.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.370
You go straight ahead. We'll go this way.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.120
Hey, kid.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.200
Have you seen an injured man around here?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.920
He's tall and has black hair.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.920
He went that way.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.380
That way?

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.780
He won't be able to move 
fast with those wounds!

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.390
Let's find him!

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.930
He felt no fear.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.890
He just felt that the man

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.520
on the ground also seemed alone 
and lonely, just like him.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.880
Come on!

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.850
Coming!

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.270
Thankfully, the man was hidden behind 
the grass, which was suddenly taller.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.500
This was due to Giorno's 
Golden Wind ability,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.080
but Giorno didn't know he had this ability 
yet, so he did it subconsciously.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.630
Around two months later...

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.270
I'll never forget what you did for me.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.360
Not long after,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.450
Giorno's father stopped hitting him.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.460
Damn it!

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.710
Why does he care so much about Giorno?

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.280
Come sit over here, Giorno.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.510 line:20%
Come on, don't be shy.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.290
The mean kids changed their tune.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.020 line:20%
I know it's not the best seat, but...

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.330
The man was a gangster.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.840
Here you go, kid!

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.800
This is... too much.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.550
I think there's been a mistake...

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.830
The scoop of chocolate is my treat!

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.320
Thanks...

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.520
Don't sweat it! That guy always 
takes really good care of me.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.270
The man would always just 
quietly watch over him.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.950
Despite Giorno being a child who always 
tried to read other people's moods,

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.400
the man treated him with 
respect as a human being.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.820
Giorno learned how to trust others,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.770
a natural trait that should have
been learned from his parents,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.260
from silent interactions with a stranger.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.790
What was that?

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.790
A gunshot?

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.100
We shouldn't get involved.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.100
Talk about bad luck...

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.250
U-Um...

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.640
What is it?

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.720
The man acted somewhat cruelly,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.320
determined not to drag Giorno 
into the world of gangsters.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.820
Hey, wait up!

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.390
Hold it!

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.700
You're the one who killed 
my dad, aren't you?!

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.470
You little shit! Damn it!

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.420
Damn it!

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.810
Damn it!

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.840
Your dad was scum.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.700
He broke the rules of my turf by selling drugs.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.020
He even sold them to women and children.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.340
That's why I killed him.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.840
How? Why?!

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.190
Why can't I shoot?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.280
You're...

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.490
You're a piece of scum, too!

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.100
Giorno didn't think the man 
was scum in the least.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.000
Bizarrely, the gangs that committed 
crimes and broke the law

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.320
were what straightened out Giorno's heart.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.050
In a city where politicians were corrupt 
and the police didn't protect the weak,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.610
Giorno Giovanna found his reason to live.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.150
Rather than looking up 
to a player in Serie A,

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.300
he wanted to become a Gang-Star!

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.440
This taste... is the taste 
of someone who's lying!

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.600
My name is Bruno Bucciarati.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.900
Answer me.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.910
Your questioning has already 
turned into torture.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.330
Does your head feel wobbly, 
as if it's about to fall off?

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.550
Though I'm pretty sure you have 
no idea what I've done to you.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.550
My body has a zipper?!

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.420
Giorno Giovanna.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.970
If I wanted to, I could roll 
your head around like a ball

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.430
while I ask you who did Leaky Eye Luca in.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.480
I don't think I could withstand 
another one of his attacks.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.190
He'll tear me apart!

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.190
I only noticed this ability a few months back,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.690
but I've never used Golden Wind 
to attack another human.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.910
When Golden Wind hits something, 
it can give it life.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.490
Any object can change into any living thing.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.540
But...

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.800
Even I don't know what'll happen if

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.440
it attacks another human being!

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.840
Answer me, Giorno Giovanna!

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.470
I don't have any other choice!

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.790
Useless!

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.290
Bagyah

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.100
What?!

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.000
Rumble

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.890
Y-You're...

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.930
a Stand user!

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.980
Rumble

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.140
So you could see my ability!

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.980
A what user?

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.940
So you're the one who attacked Luca!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.130
Didn't Golden Wind hit him head-on?

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.930
Then he should at least 
have a broken bone or two.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.790
You bastard...

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.930
Wh-What?

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.910
What did you do to me, you bastard?!

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.230
What the? I was just trying to stand...

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.110
I'm overflowing with power!

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.760
I can feel more and more power rising in me...

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.110
It's as though my body's been 
filled with the gasoline of life.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.440
What?

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.750
Its movements look slow.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:51.530
Whoosh

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.750
Could it be that I ended up like 
this because of your ability?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:51.990
Whoosh

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.410
Whoosh

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:00.410
You're a fool if you have a Stand 
that grants your enemies power!

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.930
Take this, Giorno Giovanna!

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.400
What? I can see myself...

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.270
What am I doing back there?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.520
The handle's not bent!

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.940
Did I misunderstand what's going on?

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.360
I just thought I was moving 
with incredible power...

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.170
But my body's actually still over there,

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.830
and my consciousness just jumped out, 
and that's what's over here?

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.910
Crap! I have to dodge!

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.840
I-It hurts!

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.210
A very sharp pain is gradually hitting me!

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.560
It's not that Giorno's slow... It's that 
my consciousness went berserk!

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.060
Useless!

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:57.950
It appears that when I have Golden 
Wind give a living being extra life,

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.400
they go berserk... or at least, 
just their senses do.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.740
I don't know why I have this ability,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.490
Boom

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.990
but I'll definitely be 
taking advantage of it.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.960
Bruno Bucciarati

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.730
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.770
I'm gonna call the police!

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.210
I'm sorry for all the ruckus.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.200
Please rest assured that we'll make 
sure not to involve any civilians.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.770
So this is Giorno Giovanna's Stand?

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.540
No... It doesn't seem like he 
even knows what a Stand is.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.070
But this ability...

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.030
It appears as though both of our 
abilities only reach a few meters.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.080
And here I thought you were just some brat

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.160
who wasn't affiliated with any organization...

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.500
Giorno Giovanna!

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.360
You're the one who attacked 
Leaky Eye Luca, aren't you?!

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.750
My boss wants to know why you attacked him!

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.390
You wouldn't believe me if I told you 
it was an accident, would you?

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.640
So I'm going to be disposed of, right?

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.640
And you came here fully prepared, right?

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.560
When you're going to dispose of someone,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.560
you're always prepared 
for the possibility that

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.320
you could end up being 
the one disposed of, right?

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.000
He's going to kill me... He's serious!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.250
This brat is actually going to try to kill me!

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.730
He's intense enough

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.750
that he'd actually do what 
he says he's going to do!

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.740
Kabaam

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.330
Zipper Man!

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.530
So that's his Stand?

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.440
<c.colord45634>Kashink</c>

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.360
Now I know for sure that my 
Zipper Man is more powerful.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.910
I wasn't told that I need to 
bring the suspect back alive.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.720
I wouldn't mind taking care of you here.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.450
But I've had my fill of dealing with 
your dangerous powers today,

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.040
so I'm leaving.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.000
I'm going to keep my distance for now,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.320
but I'll take care of you eventually.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.650
He can even pass through a solid 
wall by putting a zipper on it?!

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:28.780
This isn't good!

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.470
Letting him out of the 
cable car is gonna be trouble!

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.960
If I lose him now, it won't 
matter that I have Golden Wind!

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.800
If he's going to come after 
me 24/7 with that ability,

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.110
there's absolutely no guarantee I'll survive!

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.610
I'm going to lose!

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.950
I can't let him get away!

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.400
If he tells his friends about me, 
this will end up out of my control!

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.660
I have to stop him right here, right now!

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.750
For the sake of my future!

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.750
O-Ow!

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.590
Be more careful, damn it!

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.590
He disappeared!

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.430
Where could he have gone in that instant?

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.350
Don't tell me he can even 
enter people with his zipper!

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:18.810 line:20%
What are you going to do about this? 
I'm covered in garbage!

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.810
But that's the only thing I can think of!

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.730
That must be how he got that eyeball 
and those fingers inside me!

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.570
Bucciarati went into one of these guys 
to hide, like wearing a costume...

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.240
And that's how he's planning 
to head back into the city.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.160
Better get my broom...

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.460
They're all heading in different directions.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.120
I don't see a zipper.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.410
Which one is it?

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.320
Which one is he hiding in?

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.890
What the hell's your problem, 
you stupid fly?!

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.970
Jump

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.900
A tooth?

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.790
I gave life to the tooth that 
broke out of your mouth

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.090
and had it be reborn as a fly.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.540
The fly would return to you so 
I could tell where you were...

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.850
But this isn't good.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.750
I just got done saying we wouldn't 
involve any civilians...

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.700
But my bad. That was a lie.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.820
Still, he ended up hitting 
himself with his own power,

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.430
so I hope you can just deal with it.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:48.440
Giorno Giovanna, I can see your 
ability is not to be underestimated.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.040
You leave me no choice.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.480
This will be dangerous,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.990
but it seems I'll have to take care 
of you right here, right now.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.360
I can't let you escape.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.750
I'm pretty determined about that.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.130
Let me escape?

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.190
You don't have to worry about that.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.300
The only thing you have to worry about

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.090
is what you'll do once your body parts 
have been zipped apart all over the ground.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.060
This battle will be decided 
by who hits the other first.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.770
What's the matter?

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.350
Come at me, Giorno Giovanna.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.680
Useless!

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.060
Thud

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.450
Just your senses will go berserk.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.190
"You hit me first, so how?"

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.680
I don't blame you for wondering that.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.920
This isn't my arm.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.730
My Zipper Man's ability allows two separate 
things to be connected with a zipper.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.880
This is that kid's arm.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.980
I switched it out with mine.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:18.770
Because, of course, I'd rather avoid the 
danger of being hit with your ability.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.610
That's why your Golden Wind didn't work.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.670
What are you trying to do, Giorno Giovanna?!

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.960
I'm ending you right now!

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:44.520
Unbelievable... He ripped off his own arm

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.480
to extend his range a bit further 
and strike a moment faster...

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.350
Golden Wind!

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.630
I-It's happening again!

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.800
Just my senses have gone berserk!

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.200
H-He's going to get me!

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.780
The destructive power of Giorno Giovanna's 
Stand ability isn't too great...

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.370
But in this case, 
that actually makes things worse!

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.340
If I have to experience that slow 
pain not once, but multiple times...

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.670
I'll probably die from the shock of the pain!

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.880
Don't!

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:22.930
Stop!

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.440
He went out of range?

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.280
What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.920
Why did you stop attacking me?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.720
Why didn't you finish me off?!

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.700
Because you're a good person.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.260
You're in a gang, but you're a good person.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.020
You hesitated for a moment before attacking me,

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.670
so I decided I wouldn't attack you, either.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.530
When you saw the arm you 
took off of this kid,

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.410
you were shocked to see the state it was in

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.600
and stopped attacking for a moment.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.100
You were shocked that he'd 
been shooting up drugs.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.940
How old is he?

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.770
Thirteen.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.620
If you were just some gangster who 
wouldn't have hesitated or been shocked,

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.360
I probably would've been rolling 
around on the ground in pieces.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.080
But you seem different.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.950
That's why I stopped.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.690
There are people in this city 
who would sell drugs to kids.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.310
They're unforgivable.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.090
That's what you believe.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.010
But the one selling those drugs is your boss.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.870
You can't help but feel conflicted about that.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.270
That's why your heart ached 
when you saw his arm.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:55.640
So what? That's got nothing to 
do with me eliminating you.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:00.620
I've been ordered to find the one who 
attacked Luca and eliminate them!

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:06.980
Just because you stopped attacking me 
doesn't mean I'm not going to kill you!

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.030
No...

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.500
You won't kill me now.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.110
What?

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.960
You won't kill me. I know it.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.060
Why do you say that?

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.920
Because you're going to join me.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.800
I plan on defeating your boss 
and taking over this city.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.560
What?!

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.350
In order to get rid of gangs 
that sell drugs to children,

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.020
I'm going to have to become 
a gangster myself.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.520
Are you saying...

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.730
that you're going to join our organization?!

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.380
Are you serious?!

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.970
Do you even know what that means?!

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.970
What a great view...

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.910
Yes. If I'm going to take over this city,

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.620
I'll have to join the organization that 
rules it and work my way up.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.760
Bucciarati,

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.670
I'm going to become a Gang-Star!

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.980

Meet the Gangster Behind the Wall
