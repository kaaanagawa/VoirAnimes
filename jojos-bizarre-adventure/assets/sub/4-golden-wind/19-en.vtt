WEBVTT

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.130
We made it to Venice!

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.040
I'm diving into the canal!

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.250
Mista! Please hurry up 
and get out of the car!

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
G-Giorno! You... Your body's already...

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.840
I'm sure you already know this, Mista,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.140
but our priority is to obtain the item.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.070
Getting that thing will lead to our victory.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.650
The disc is in there!

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.500
We're surrounded by water, so it'll 
take a while for it to freeze.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.740
That's why I drove into the canal.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.980
Don't worry about me! Hurry and get out!

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.710
Got it, Giorno. But I don't 
like your idea of victory!

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.920
Killing him, and the both of us 
living to retrieve that thing...

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.170
That'll be our victory!

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.220
Like hell I'm gonna let you get away!

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.640
Just try and jump in, Mista!

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.750
I don't mind making a wager on whether 
or not you can swim faster than my ice!

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.780
Sh-Shit! Driving into the 
canal was a bad idea!

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.990
This guy has no weak point 
when it comes to ice!

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.710
Episodio 19  White Ice

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.230 line:20%
Turn the car into a plant, Giorno!

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.710
The hood of the car hasn't 
completely frozen over yet.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.470
Nurture a plant to life while you still can!

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.560
You're trying to grow vines 
to use them as ropes?

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.060
That's not happening!

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.740
I-It's no use.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.460
We need the right temperature 
to grow a plant like a vine

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.450
that'll grow fast enough to reach the bank.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.510
In this low temperature,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.490
the only plant that'll grow is the 
short grass you'd find in a tundra!

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.670
Who said anything about growing 
vines that reach the bank, Giorno?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.950
This is perfectly fine!

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.540
Short grass is exactly what I want!

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.920
But I need more! More! More!

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.420
If you don't want to die, get me more!

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.810
If you don't grow more, 
we're gonna die, Giorno!

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.890
Gotcha! Too bad you couldn't 
grow it to the bank of the canal!

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.190
Well done, Giorno! It froze over!

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.520
Now you won't die!

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.560
Th-That bastard! He froze some 
short grass to create a sled?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.560
N-No... A snowboard!

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.870
Damn it!

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.890
He's not going to let me get away so easily.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.700
Of course not...

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.250
White Ice! Undo the ice temporarily!

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.050
Th-Th ice...

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.290
...melted!

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.010
Mista!

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.930
An extremely low temperature 
is a world of life or death!

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.780
Nothing can move in extremely 
low temperatures!

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.440
They can stop everything!

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.230
That's what makes my White Ice perfect!

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.780
It can even stop the raging 
ocean if I want it to!

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.450
Hurry and get up on the bank, Mista!

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.700
Mista!

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.680
Gather up the grass that's 
floating in the water!

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.330
The grass you were using as a snowboard!

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.300
While you can fire the 
gun in your right hand!

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.010
Give it up, Mista!

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.720
Do you still not understand that 
attacking me is pointless?!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.770
<c.color4c7ae0>St</c><c.colorc15069>ab</c>

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.030
Gathering up grass... I see.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.110
Giorno, if you release your ability, 
the short grass turns back into car parts.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.970
Therefore, we can shoot them into you!

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.200
What?!

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.840
D-Did that do it?

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.490
No, it's shallow.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.550
I think we can at least get away for now,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.190
but Mista, this just bought us some time!

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.010
Let's get the thing quickly, 
then get out of here fast.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.430
That same strategy won't work again 
the next time he catches up.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.440
Please go, Mista!

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.150
The disc will show up somewhere 
if we destroy the lion statue.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.660
I'll retrieve it, 
then hide somewhere in the city.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.440
If I have a few dozen 
seconds, I can do this.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.160
But will hiding be enough 
to get away from that guy?

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.230
It might just work, but it might not.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.550
More importantly, 
this guy's way too dangerous.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.290
It'll be even worse if he ends up 
running into Bucciarati and the others.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.840
We need to end him now!

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.670
This is our only chance!

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.720
Wha— Mista! What are you doing?!

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.180
Your ability is perfect? That's impossible!

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.390
If you've completely encased yourself 
in ice, how are you able to breathe?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.230
There it is. I knew it.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.930
Air's leaking out.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.570
He's breathing from there, 
the back of his neck.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.010
Take your positions, Six Bullets!

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.660
Number One and Number Two, 
go around and flank him!

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.890
Wah, he's looking over here!

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.580
He's gonna do another ice attack!

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.310
No, first, he's probably going to go up for air.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.650
Once he rises to the surface, 
I'm gonna put a bullet in his head!

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.220
He's trying to go up to the surface!

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.810
Let's go, Bullets!

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.430
We're aiming for the moment 
he takes a breath of air!

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.960
Mista!

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.390
Number One and Two are saying 
they can't see the hole!

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.140
It must be due to his posture! 
He's facing up right now!

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.770
The hole's hidden!

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.940
Sh-Shit! Let's scram!

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.360
Oh, shut up!

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.160
Stay in your positions, 
Number One and Number Two!

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.410
How dare you do that to my forehead?!

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.450
Mista!

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.500
What the?!

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.000
You shot some fish that were swimming around?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.450
What the hell are you trying to do?!

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.440
He looked down! We can see it!

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.970
It's the hole! Now!

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.930
Here it comes!

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.590
We can do this!

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.670
Gwooom

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.560
We did it! Bullseye!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.280
Th-That sound...

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.990
That sound... It can't be!

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.580
So you found my breathing 
hole and went after that...

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.580
Mista!

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.460
But extremely low 
temperatures stop everything!

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.050
Gases turn to liquids, and liquids turn to solids!

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.760
Take a closer look. 
Can't you see the air that's stopped?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.380
The bullet, Mista!

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.990
That's the sound of a ricocheting bullet!

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.140
What?!

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.250
White Ice... Gently Weeps!

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.270
Mista!

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.620
I'd already created a wall of frozen air!

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.140
It uses up quite a bit of my Stand's power,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.280
but now nothing can shoot a bolt into me!

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.120
Anything that comes near me will stop!

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.620
This is a lesson I learned from you, Mista!

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.670
Giorno was right.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.090
This is all my fault... 
This is my responsibility.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.380
If only I'd prioritized getting that thing...

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.460
It's not under any trash cans or benches.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.770
I can't find anything of importance,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.060
and they wouldn't hide it 
out in the open, anyway.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.320
But considering how much Mista is hurrying,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.730
I just realized it must 
be in the immediate area.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.240
Where is it? This photo should be a hint...

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.550
Shit. This is the worst possible scenario.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.880
Mista's currently acting out of despair.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.720
He's decided to take responsibility for 
this, even if it costs him his life.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.810
But the only ones who can open up a path

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.870
in the darkness are those with resolve.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.390
Things are getting interesting.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.470
We're going to have to 
make some sacrifices,

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.260
but my resolve, as well as Mista's,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.360
will open up a path in the darkness!

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.020
Ghiaccio

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.020
White Ice

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.190
What the hell is this?

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.260
It was embedded in there?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.900
In one of the cuts or gaps in the statue?

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.610
Damn it! If I'm close enough,

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.970
I should be able to shoot into 
the hole in his neck again!

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.830
If I can just get close enough 
to aim through the wall of air...

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.380
Mista's getting reckless.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.790
He's willing to take responsibility 
for this at the cost of his own life.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.040
But this isn't just determination
resulting from him being cornered.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.360
It's resolve!

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.150
We need resolve right now!

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.380
Resolve doesn't mean sacrifice!

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.730
A computer disc!

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.090
I knew it! The thing you were trying 
to get was something to tell you

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.720
how to get to the boss!

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.850
I did it! Now we can find 
out who the boss really is!

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.240
All that's left now... is Trish!

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.440
Right after I finish you bastards off!

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.070
Come at me with all your futile attempts!

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.700
Let me finish you off!

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.750
Mista!

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.630
What the hell are you doing?!

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.350
Having resolve is the 
ability to open up a path

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.800
we need to follow within the darkness!

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:49.310
Guido Mista: arrested at 17 for murder.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.860
The result of the trial:

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.110
they did not see his 
actions as self-defense,

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.110
and he was sentenced to
15 to 30 years in prison.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.070
My happy-go-lucky youth...

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.910
Is this really my fate?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.270
Mista always had an optimistic view of life,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.870
but in this moment,
he didn't know what to do.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.470
Damn it.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.380
Get up. You're being released.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.760
You're the one who bailed me out?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.730
Yes. I saw the incident on the news and 
decided you acted out of self-defense.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:43.380
It means you are incredibly skilled 
with a pistol and full of life.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.270
But a guy like you probably 
wouldn't last two years in prison.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.200
That's why...

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.130
You pulled some strings.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.160
Do you belong to some organization?

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.530
Come with me.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.060
There's an excellent ristorante nearby.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.120
I like the way you eat.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.130
The bruschetta here is great, too. 
Do you still have some room?

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.130
Yeah.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.880
Pardon me.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.730
Yes, sir?

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.720
Could I get some bruschetta for him... 
I should get some for them, too.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.900
Could I get four orders of bruschetta?

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.740
No, make that five. 
I guess I'll get an order for myself.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.450
Right away, sir.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.270
So, continuing our conversation...

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.410
I'm in.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.000
I think you and I will get along great.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.840
So, I'm in.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.120
On one condition, though.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.640
Treat me to some dolce, too.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.330
Does this place have strawberry cake?

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.430
You sure are an odd one.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.330
I guess this must be fate, too.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.150
This isn't so bad. 
Everything worked out in the end.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:05.360
Mista learned that people have 
predetermined destinies.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.230
When they're young,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.280
people may find themselves at a standstill 
or taking the long way around at times,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.370
but they ultimately end up traveling 
the path they were destined to walk.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.210
I can see it! I can see the path perfectly!

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.970
I can see it for sure this time!

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.140
It's there, Giorno!

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.840
I see the path I need to 
take through the darkness!

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.140
Yeehaw!

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.060
Batoom

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.060
Bam

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.060
Bam

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.060
Shank

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.060
Crack

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.060
Crack

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.150
You guys don't seem to understand.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.680
The air is frozen because of the 
extremely low temperature.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.240
Just like this.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.670
If I put air that's been frozen 
solid in my suit and melt it,

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.640
the air turns back to normal!

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.560
If I take it in like this...

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.830
Just like a diver who has 
an air tank on their back,

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.670
I don't need a breathing hole anymore!

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.120
The hole!

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.050
He deflected the bullets!

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.260
Six of them! O-Oh, no!

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:19.270
I hope you have the resolve for this, Mista!

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.190
It's over.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.880
Yeah, my resolve is there, Giorno.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.760
If you hadn't given me your resolve,

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.880
I wouldn't have been able to see this path.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.490
The path toward the resolve to be 
willingly shot by my own bullets...

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.220
I-I can't see!

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.270
The blood's frozen to me and hardened...

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.210
The path through the darkness

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.610
isn't the path for the bullets to 
get through your wall of ice.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.930
I-It was to splash your face with my blood!

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.270
Shit! I can't get it off!

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.910
Hey, the metal pole from earlier!

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.860
Mista, your bullet carved it into a—

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.570
Ow! That hurts!

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:16.940
Something... Something... Something... 
Something lukewarm is—

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.750
You asked me if I had the resolve for this...

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.790
Well, let me show you!

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.500
But you'll have to show 
me some resolve, too.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:32.220
The resolve to be filled with holes 
and depart for the next world!

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.890
Th-That bastard's still standing!

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.900
He's hell-bent on shoving 
me back even farther!

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.430
Is he insane?! He's determined to finish this!

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.140
Shit! I need to get this out of my neck!

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.750
You're crazy! The bullet's 
gonna come flying back!

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.560
You're not gonna last!

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.240
I have to make it through.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.330
Starting now, I'm showing my true resolve!

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.870
Steel yourselves, Bullets!

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.830
White Ice... Gently Weeps!

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.810
Y-You can't take any more, Mista!

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.180
You're going to lose consciousness!

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.920
We're also...

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.230
...going to disappear!

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.770
N-Not yet!

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.810
I'm still conscious! I can still shoot him!

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.060
Y-You did it!

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.700
It went all the way in!

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.500
You're... wrong...

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.960
The one with stronger resolve... is me...

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.420
Guido Mista...

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.640
I'll commend you for... pushing me this far...

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.810
But the one who took better advantage 
of all the spurting blood... was me!

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.030
I froze the blood that spurted 
out of my neck to support me!

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.120
Now my neck won't get 
pushed farther onto the spike!

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.400
I'm totally secured!

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.320
The spike won't go any farther in!

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.030
Also... Haven't you forgotten something?

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.590
The bullet you shot last is still...

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.010
Straight into your head!

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.080
I win!

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.410
There's no wound?!

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.920
Wha—

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.080
Mista...

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.970
Your resolve is shining upon the path,

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.430
even brighter than this rising sun.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.900
And it's shining on the path...

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.680
that we're meant to take!

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.190
What the hell?!

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.740
Useless! Useless! Useless! 
Useless! Useless!

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.270
Recently, I... started noticing...

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.380
that despite Giorno Giovanna...

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.190
being a newbie...

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.970
things always seem...

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.550
to play out exactly how he says.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.900
The resolve I showed just now 
was also partly Giorno's.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.500
It was making its way into my 
heart before I even realized it.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.500
It almost feels like he's my capo, 
even more so than Bucciarati,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.860
and he kept me moving.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.030
What the hell is his deal?

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.200
Well, I guess that doesn't matter right now.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.920
It's not my style to think 
too much about stuff.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:53.230
Mista, we safely retrieved 
the disc, thanks to you.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.960
Hurry and fix me up. I-I can't breathe...

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.770
I wouldn't have been able to show 
that resolve without your ability.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.430
Hurry and fix me up, before I actually die...

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.090
Of course. But I'd like to 
clear something up first.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.330
Golden Wind doesn't exactly fix things.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.310
It creates parts of your body.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.520
I'll give life to the bullets 
embedded in your body

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.050
and plug up the arteries and 
other parts that were destroyed.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.900
Just shut up and do it already.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.840
Since I'm not exactly healing you, 
your pain will remain.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.870
Please don't complain to me later.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.200
Ow!

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.900
O-Ow! Be more gentle! 
Be more gentle, damn it, Giorno!

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.830
I told you, I can't.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.210
You're a gangster, for crying out loud. 
Please quit fussing.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.570
There are about 18 more wounds,

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.180
so you'll have to remove some of 
your clothes for me to plug the rest.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.150
Bucciarati! I'm picking up two signals...

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.240
It doesn't look like there's anyone else.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.730
Proceed, but carefully.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.170
I'm assuming it's Mista and Giorno.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.970
I'm sure they're bored out of their minds 
waiting for us since nothing's happening.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.400
Ack! Giorno!

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.620
There they are! Hey, Mista! Gio—

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.370
Be gentler! Gentler, damn it!

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.830
Don't take off my clothes! 
I'll feel it more!

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.430
Well, Narancia? Did you find those two?

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.690
Huh? W-Well, u-um...

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:25.010
No! Huh?! Suddenly there's 
something in my eye?

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.510 line:20%
Giorno, no! Don't! N-No more! I-I can't!

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.310
I can't see! I can't see them clearly!

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.010 line:20%
Be gentler, damn it!

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.680
Risotto's whereabouts are unknown.
Currently searching airports, train stations,
and the area around Naples.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.700
Curse you, Risotto...

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.460
You must be heading to Venice.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.040
If Bucciarati and his crew put 
an end to you, that's fine.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.360
Regardless, I'm not worried.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.020
Episodio 20
The Final Mission from the Boss
