Episodio 20 The Final Mission from the Boss

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.920
How much longer till we get there?

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.530
We're almost at Rialto Bridge.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.570
It'll be at least another five minutes.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.560
All right. Keep going.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.920
Bucciarati, what was the 
mission from the boss?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.280
I'm reconfirming the mission 
from the boss right now.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.630
Are you all safe?
I thank you for protecting my daughter 
Trish from the bottom of my heart.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.630 line:20%
I'll read it aloud.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.050
"The information on this disc

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.350
was inputted the moment all of you 
boarded the train at Naples.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.430
Therefore, I'd like to warn you 
that I have no way of knowing

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.100
how many more are after you,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.780
or how many members you've 
lost at this point in time.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.200
The information on this disc is the 
safest way for me to meet my daughter,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.140
and also your final mission.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.410
Let me also warn you that, 
should you deviate even in the slightest

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.200
from the instructions on this disc,
it will be unforgivable.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.090
If any of you do anything other 
than what's instructed of you,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.090
even if it's accidental,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.910
I will consider it a warning 
that you mean to harm me.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.510
Here is your final mission.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.180
You will now head to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.100
the island of San Giorgio Maggiore.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.360
The place you will take my daughter is

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.030
the top of the great bell 
tower of the church there.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.780
Once you take my daughter there,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.620
your mission will be over.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.560
Instruction one: there are no 
stairs to the top of the tower.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.960
Currently, there is only one 
elevator that goes to the top.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.260
The only ones allowed in the elevator 
are Trish and one bodyguard.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.070
Instruction two: the bodyguard is prohibited

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.550
from carrying any knives, guns, 
cell phones, or anything else.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.460 line:20%
Instruction three: you must 
land on the island within

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.810 line:20%
fifteen minutes of retrieving this disc.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.520
There is a tracking device in the 
disc, so I know where you are.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.930
Instruction four: the rest 
of you will wait on the boat.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.360
You are not allowed on the island."

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.700
That's all of it.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.780
Bucciarati, we have arrived.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.040
So the boss is at the top 
of that tower right now...

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.540
Those are pretty detailed instructions. 
He seems extremely cautious.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.000
But I guess you couldn't 
be a mafia boss otherwise.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.750
Anyway, this means our mission ends here.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.760
We all made it out alive, 
so I guess all's well that ends well.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.860
Yeah, just barely, though.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.040
Let's live it up in Venice for a 
few days before we go home.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.470
I hear the food's great there.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.430
They have good food here?

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.410
I just remembered I was hungry.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.040
What kind of food do they have?

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.480
Well, they have squid ink pasta, 
horsehair crab salad,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.990
and I hear the carpaccio at the 
Hotel Cipriani is fantastic.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.070
Hey, you bastards!

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.130
Don't let your guard down!

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.080
The mission's not over yet!

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.550
Narancia, keep an eye on the radar.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.770
S-Sure.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.410
Bucciarati,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.340
I volunteer to be her 
bodyguard in the tower.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.230
I'll take her to the top of the bell tower.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.350
Who the hell do you think you are?!

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.320
Bucciarati's the capo, so of course 
he's going to take her, you dumbass!

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.600
The boss didn't specify anyone because 
he didn't know who was still alive!

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.760
Of course. I'll go.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.480
All right, Trish.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.730
The two of us will go onto the island, 
as we were ordered.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.210
I know.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.970
It's our chance to find out 
who the boss really is.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.580
I'll find him, no matter what.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.480
Oh, I know. Giorno,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.720
could you give me that charm to wish 
me good luck on this final mission?

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.630
Ladybugs are considered sun bugs.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.820
They're symbols of life, right?

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.390
They're good luck charms, right?

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.400
Oh, that's right.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.810
Yes. Ladybugs bring good luck.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.950
This brooch that's been given life with Golden 
Wind's ability will act as a tracking device.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.500
Bucciarati.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.460
What is it, Fugo?

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.600
I thought this was a good 
opportunity to say this.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.660
Why so formal? What is it?

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.550
I knew that you'd become capo someday,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.760
and I know you'll be able 
to complete this mission.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.970
Of course he can.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.600
Let's aim for an even higher 
position in the organization!

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.210
Yeah... You're right.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.750
Let's go, Trish.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.520
If I can somehow get this 
onto the boss's body,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.860
Giorno will be able to track him down.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.860
Right now, we just need 
to find out who he is...

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.670
No matter what.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.760
The elevator door is open.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.280
There are only two buttons, 
for the first floor and the roof.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.680
It goes directly to either. 
There are no other floors to stop on.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.640
What's...

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.310
What's going to happen to me?

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.420
I suddenly got kidnapped by 
gangsters just like you guys,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.870
had my life threatened,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.020
and now, I'm going to be taken to 
a father I don't even know or love...

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.210
Where am I going to go now?

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.330
The boss is just concerned for your safety.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.250
As for what will happen to you from now on,

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.750
this is what I think...

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.300
First, you'll be given a different name.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.560
You might even need to have plastic surgery.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.760
You'll be given a new identification 
and family registry.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.370
You'll be somewhere we won't know of,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.980
some far-off country, where you'll live happily.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.880
Your father has that kind of power.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.250
Here. Let me give you a hand.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.650
It's not like...

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.590
I-I'm nervous or anything...

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.860
I wonder...

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.280
if I'll be able to like my father.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.000
No family worries about that.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.420
Yeah...

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.250
You're right.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.590
It's strange to even worry about that.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.290
We're almost to the top.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.350
Trish? Tri—

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.400
Wh-What?!

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.750
Trish... No... What's—

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.200
Trish and I should be the only ones here.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.880
No one other than the guys 
on my team knows we're...

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.310
No... It can't be!

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.780
Could the boss...

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.750
In order to make sure he stays 
completely invisible...

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.710
Did he have us protect his daughter

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.990
in order to ensure that he could 
finish off his daughter himself?!

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:34.190
Bruno Bucciarati was born as a 
fisherman's son in a suburb of Naples.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.330
His father wasn't the best 
at dealing with people,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.360
but he was an earnest and honest fisherman

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.760
who tried to protect his family 
from the cruelties of this world.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.840
Bruno.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.730
Dad.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.170
You need me to fix the net?

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.170
Got it.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.340
His mother was very kind, and Bruno 
loved his conversations with her.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.600
He always looked forward to the bedtime 
stories she read to him before going to sleep.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.480
All right, go to sleep, now.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.800
But...

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.530
It occurred when Bucciarati was seven.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.870
So what are you going to do now?

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.910
Well... I want a change, 
so I'm going to leave this town.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.240
After ten years of marriage, 
his parents divorced.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.950
As for the reason, only his parents 
would know the answer to that.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.890
What are we going to do about Bruno?

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:37.710
After a discussion, Bruno's parents 
had him make a decision.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.560
Bruno, your father and I both love you,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.600
but we're going to be living separately now.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.490
Who do you want to live with? 
Me or your father?

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.910
We want you to decide.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.240
You want to leave this place with 
me and go to the city, right?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.350
You're very smart.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.490
You want to go to a good school, don't you?

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.970
There'll be a lot more kids your age, too!

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.200
So, you want to live with 
your mother, right?

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.900
You'll come with me, right?

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:10.900
I'll...

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.670
live with Dad.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.460
Huh?!

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.300
What?! Bruno, you should 
really think about this!

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.800
You like me better, don't you?

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.230
I'll stay here with Dad.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.470
No...

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.140
Mom's strong...

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.200
She should be able to make it anywhere.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.230
But...

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.940
All right, I'm leaving.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.560
I'll come back once a month to visit.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.680
Okay.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.460
As Bucciarati had instinctively figured,

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.740
two years after his mother left, 
she remarried a man from Milan.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.520
He would end up only seeing his 
mother at Christmas after that.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.650
As for his father, because his 
wife left him for the city,

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.680
he became determined to send 
Bucciarati to a good school.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.010
Dad, I think customers are 
going to come by soon.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.900
Oh, I guess it's about that time...

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.450
I'll reapply the nets.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.230
All right. I'll let you handle this.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.720
Up until then, he'd only been a fisherman,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.370
but in order to earn money 
for his son's tuition,

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.200
he started taking tourists and 
other fishermen on his boat.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.280
And the wheel of fate continued to turn.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.700
Sirs, that island isn't good for fishing.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.920
There are better—

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.470
Whatever, man.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.900
We wanna go fishing over there.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.390
Just shut up and take us.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.450
Got it?

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.810
R-Right...

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.290
That evening, Bucciarati's father would 
be rescued by the Coast Guard,

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.900
his body riddled with bullet holes.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.140
He's been shot seven times in his arms, 
shoulders, chest, and torso.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.250 line:20%
We got an operating room open!

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.690 line:20%
Dad! Dad!

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.690
There are bullets still in his body.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.950
Dad!

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.830
For now, please just wait 
until the surgery's finished.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.300
Be strong. Can you give us contact 
information for the rest of your family?

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:19.790
Dad...

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.590
Forensics is coming by later, 
so give them this as evidence.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.620
Yes, sir.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.350
Thanks.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.220
Right.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.120
H-How did this happen?

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.240
Good evening. Are you his son?

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.680
We found this at the scene.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.420
Apparently, your father 
witnessed a drug deal.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.530
He was shot so that he wouldn't talk.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.160
Your father is a very important witness.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.700
We don't exactly want him to die, either.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.380 line:20%
I'm sure he'll be okay.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.360
My father was shot because 
of something like that?

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.420
Luckily, Bucciarati's father survived.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:08.130
Despite being shot seven times, 
none of the wounds were fatal,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.750
and the boat that found 
and rescued him

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.790
happened to have supplies 
to treat his wounds,

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.210
allowing him to survive 
until he got to the hospital.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.070
He was graced by good luck all around.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:24.520
But in terms of Bucciarati's life, 
it might've been better if his father had died.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:29.190
There are certain sticky 
situations where you don't

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.540
have the opportunity to 
choose the right path.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.870
Fishermen have way too 
much energy, damn it.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.340
I'll keep watch! Just hurry up and do it!

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.250
You've got some nerve, 
making us come here so late at night.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.920
Go to hell already!

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.620
Wh-Who the hell are you?

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.510
A k-kid? H-Hey!

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.690 line:20%
What are you doing under the bed?!

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.980
I-It's just a kid! Just 
take the knife from him!

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.980 line:20%
Th-That knife's dangerous! Put it down!

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.930
<c.color7d2b26>Riiiiip</c>

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.860
Wh-What are you—

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.300
I'll protect you, Dad.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.470
Don't worry. Take your time getting better.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.320
At the age of twelve, 
Bruno Bucciarati committed murder

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.550
and entered a territory 
no one should set foot in.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.800
I can't turn back now.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.750
They'll keep trying to get 
revenge and shut us up.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.020
I can't trust the police, either.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.310
The only one willing to 
protect this father and son

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.160
was the organization that ran 
the city from the shadows.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.370
Bucciarati knocked on the 
doors of that organization,

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.060
and in return for loyalty and 
service to the organization,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.010
they guaranteed their safety.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.000
Believing the organization 
was the true form of justice,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.820
he worked hard there.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.790
He made a name for himself 
within the organization,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.040
and eventually, the capo 
Polpo took a liking to him.

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.380
Five years later, Bucciarati's father died 
due to complications from his wounds.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.890
Bucciarati loathed the white 
powder of greed that had

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.850
dragged him and his 
father into this situation,

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:21.830
and swore that he would never forgive it.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.340
But...

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.690
I-I'm sorry! I won't bother them again!

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.480
I'll forget about that family!

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.360
Good. You can't regret anything 
once you're dead, after all.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.300
If you're also a gang member—

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.450
Those are...

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.410
Hey! What the hell are those?!

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.700
He learned that the organization's boss,
whom he thought was the true form of justice,

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.880
was involved in dealing 
the drugs he hated so much.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.620
In this city?

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.860
I thought they were prohibited!

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.770
And now...

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.470
The boss is now...

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.100
The most repulsive form of evil is

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.710
to exploit innocent people 
who don't know anything,

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.940
and to use others merely for one's own gain!

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.030
A father did this to his innocent daughter,

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.950
all to cover his own ass?!

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.570
This is unforgivable!

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:23.370
You have once again betrayed my heart!

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.920
There... Trish is still alive.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.820
All right. It's on him.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.140
But, damn it, I can't see his face.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.190
Boss, I was just going to 
seek out your true identity,

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.560
but the plan's changed.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.010
I'm going to get rid of you right now!

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.400
There's no time,

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.650
but the boss isn't expecting 
me to betray him right now.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.700
It will be...

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:01.740
an assassination.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.210
I'll get ahead of the boss on his 
escape route and finish him there.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.430
This...

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.180
This hole...

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.460
I see.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.140
It's a stairway to the charnel house that's 
found in the basement of any church.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.330
After he eliminates Trish down there, 
thinking he's in the clear,

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.540
he'll go through there and exit 
the other side of the building.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.710
I managed to get here first.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:57.740
Here he comes.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.320
He came down the stairs!

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:20.610
Now!

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.140
You should just go home now,

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.530
Bruno Bucciarati.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.830
If you step out from behind that pillar,

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.980
you're going to die.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.750
Zipper Man!

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.340
I-It's going to break off!

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.410
So he knew I was after him...

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.230
But since he hid himself again,

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.830
I'm guessing he's not that powerful.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.870
I'd like to ask you why.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.620
What's the meaning of this?

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.750
I highly respected all the work 
you'd done for me on this mission.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.590
Were you so happy to become 
a capo that you got greedy?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.170
Or did you overestimate your 
own powers and get cocky,

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.970
thinking you could actually surpass me?

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.170
When Trish wakes up,

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.830
I'm going to tell her that 
her father didn't even exist.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.150
Trish?

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.980
What about Trish?

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.010
My daughter has nothing to do with you.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.860
You could never understand my true feelings!

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.330
Giorno?

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:54.500
Bucciarati! Yes, I know he's on the move.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.140
I know exactly where the boss is because 
of the brooch you put on him.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.670
Right now, he's at the bottom of 
the stairs to the charnel house.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.050
He's right by the pillar that's about 
two meters away from the stairs.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.630
But wait, Bucciarati!

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.790
Something is wrong!

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.260
You're there!

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.310
Take this! Zipper Man!

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.290
The one who was in the pillar's shadow...

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:29.180
was me!

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.340
Wh-What...

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.760
What's going o—

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.630
I decided to show you... as a parting gift.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.460
Since this is the end, I'll fill you in.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:49.460
What you just witnessed and felt

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.600
was you in the future.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.270
You from a few seconds from the 
past witnessed yourself in the future.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.910
This is my Emperor Crimson's ability.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.690
I erased time and leapt past it.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.280
I don't care who it is.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.050
I will not allow anyone 
to threaten my throne,

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.280
no matter what.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.500
And now, you're going to have to disappear.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.590
Bucciarati, your mission to 
act as Trish's bodyguard

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.920
has now come to an end.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.980
Episodio 21
The Mystery of Emperor Crimson
