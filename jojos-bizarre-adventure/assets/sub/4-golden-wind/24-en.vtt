WEBVTT

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.980
It's hard to imagine 
that another assassin

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.400
from the organization is 
in Venice right now.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.010
It should be wide open.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.270
Let's head toward the airport!

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.110
We'll get a plane!

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.700
We're going to get a plane and head 
to Sardinia, no matter what.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.100
We must find out about the boss's 
past as quickly as possible...

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.860
or we lose.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.200
Marco Polo International Airport

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.890
I don't feel any life energy.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.270
There are no living creatures on 
this plane, not even a cockroach.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.730
All right, let's take this plane.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.560
Don't let any living creature 
or machine near this airplane.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.120
After taking off, an airplane glides at 
a few thousand to ten thousand meters

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.780
at a speed of around 800 kilometers per hour.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.290
Once in the air, there's no 
Stand user who can control

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.340
that kind of speed or power from the ground.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.670
Our destination is Sardinia.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.280
The flight should be around two hours.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.480
Episodio 24 Notorious Chase

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.650 line:20%
You're gonna fly this thing 
with Moody Jazz's replay?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.030
B-But there's no guarantee that 
this thing flew to Sardinia.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.720
I'm pretty sure there's this 
thing called INS that lets you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.480
put in a destination, and it'll 
get you there automatically.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.450
I saw it in a movie once.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.230
If I find the INS and input our destination, 
there shouldn't be an issue.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.120
Really? You're going by what was in a movie?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.090
Abbacchio, how long until takeoff?

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.970
No idea. I can't exactly fast forward this.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.680
It'll probably take around ten minutes.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.940
Bucciarati's leg... Was it injured 
in the restaurant battle?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.430
Still, despite how deep that 
cut looks, he's barely bleeding.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.160
Up front, to the left! Something's coming!

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.410
Something's heading our way, Mista!

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.520
Stop right there!

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.780
Just so you know,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.540
anyone who gets near this plane will 
be shot dead, even if they're a saint!

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.400
And it's not like a saint would even come here.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.250
If you care about your well-being at all,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.100
you'll turn your back to this plane 
and get the hell off this runway!

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.990
Apparently your ears are plugged up 
with wax, but do your best to listen.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.280
I'll warn you one last time.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.860
I'll let you go, so get 
the hell off this runway.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.090
He's a Stand user!

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.890
Six Bullets!

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.000
Giorno! Narancia! Be careful of the enemy!

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.200
His signal disappeared.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.590
He's the only enemy in the area.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.010
No one else is trying 
to get near this plane.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.480
Giorno! As you can see, he died instantly.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.690
There's no need to check up on him.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.690
Yes, I know, but we need to be cautious.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.860
He went down surprisingly easily.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.490
It's like he showed up only to be defeated.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.790
Hey, are you mocking me and my Bullets?

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.040
It just means that he was no match for me!

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.580
He's obviously way weaker!

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.080
Yeah! Yeah!

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.250
He's completely dead.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.260
Not only is he not breathing, but his 
heartbeat and life energy are gone, too.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.230
Mista! Giorno! We're taking off! 
Hurry up and get on!

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.970
Come on, Giorno. Let's go.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.710
I wonder if my father...

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.540
No, your boss

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.640
might have guessed that I'd go to 
Sardinia to find out about the past.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.760
Former.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.040
Our former boss.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.890
I'm sure the thought crossed his mind.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.810
That's why we need to find out about 
the boss's past as soon as possible.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.560
I figure that when he met 
your mother in Sardinia,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.600
he wasn't a gangster who 
needed to hide his identity yet.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.920
He was just an ordinary young man.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.610
He became a gangster after that.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.020
He must have some kind of identity.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.830
The true identity of the boss from 
fifteen years ago surely exists.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.510
As his daughter, you should 
be able to track it down.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.410
Something, anything...

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.060
Do you remember anything more detailed 
from your mother's stories of the past?

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.850
Cala di Volpe.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.810
Cala di Volpe... The fox's tail?

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.770
It's a resort located in a beautiful, 
emerald green coastal area.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.480
My mother mentioned that she met 
my father there while on vacation.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.340
She also mentioned that my 
father grew up in Sardinia.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.200
Apparently, he spoke with 
a Sardinian dialect.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.350
But then he disappeared, and my mother 
never found out more than that...

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.510
Not even his name.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.920
I'm not even sure what I should look for.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.280
Besides, this is all just from 
my mother's reminiscing.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.550
You're the boss's only living relative.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.650
That's why he's trying to eliminate you.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.020
Cala di Volpe...

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.900
That means we have our destination.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.480
Mista.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.640
Get your gun out and take aim.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.740
Listen to this sound...

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.090
Sound? You mean the sound of the engine?

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.290
What are you talking about?

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.430
Just please, get your gun out. 
There's something weird about this cabinet.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.250
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.710
The only one being weird is you.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.680
You're the one who said there wasn't 
so much as a cockroach on this plane.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.810
That's true... I don't feel 
any life energy, even now.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.230
But...

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.780
But what?

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.230
Are you trying to say there's a 
remote-controlled Stand on the plane?

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.500
You sure you're not just freaking out?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.490
I could very well just be freaking out.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.240
But I know I heard something.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.410
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.780
I'm going to open this. 
Please have your gun ready.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.030
A freezer...

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.560
I-I apologize. I was getting 
a little too high-strung.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.630
Giorno, what the hell kind of joke is this?

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.390
When did you put that in there?

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.410
You're trying to scare 
me with chicken scraps?

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.860
What the hell's so funny about that?

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.430
Th-That's not chicken.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.650
It's still wet. Th-The blood's still fresh.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.370
Aren't these the fingers of the fatty 
I blasted back at the airport?

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.960
Giorno, am I wrong?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.270
Calm down, Mista.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.700
Hey... Is there another one now?

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.440
You two. Is something wrong?

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.890
Giorno, you confirmed that there weren't 
any signs of life on this plane.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.100
But Mista is saying that it looked like 
those fingers increased from three to four.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.320
Is there any life energy in those fingers?

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.350
They are just bones. They have no life.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.250
If these bones had any signs 
of life or were a Stand,

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.670
plant life from Golden Wind's 
powers wouldn't grow from them.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.530
It freaked me out because it 
looked like there was one more,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.530
so I could've just been seeing things...

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.320
But there's still something 
really off about this!

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.600
Indeed.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.940
I'm not sure how or why, but someone 
put these in here on purpose.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.100
Let's throw these outside.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.260
Huh?! But opening the door is super dangerous!

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.540
Apparently, the difference in air pressure 
would send us flying like some rat in a toilet!

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.110
Everyone, hang on to something.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.780
Zipper Man!

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.280
<c.colorfb9f35>Pop</c>

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.540
Guess you didn't need to hang on after all.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.450
Anything else out of the ordinary?

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.250
Check every inch of this plane.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.540
I want some pizza, too.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.420
I want to go back to Naples and 
enjoy a simple Margherita...

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.010
This jet looks like a train station bathroom.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.240
But it must be some rich guy's jet...

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.370
What the hell is this?

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.150
The enemy Stand's name is...

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.730
Notorious Chase.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.180
Who wrote all this, and when?

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.110
Who the hell wrote this?!

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.320
What?!

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.840
Th-These fingers...

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.500
I-It can't be! We threw 
the finger bones outside!

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.830
We didn't even touch them!

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.670
Is this what made that graffiti?

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.800
A corpse?

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.700
B-But this can't be... 
The Stand ability of someone who's dead?

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.140
Is this thing getting bigger 
by consuming my body?

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.100
Golden Wind!

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.650
Cut off my right arm!

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.230
What?!

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.030
It's consuming my arm in the same shape.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.820
My Stand... is being consumed!

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.000
The one who was scribbling 
on the wall was me...

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.040
The one who brought the fingers 
onto the plane... was me!

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.650
What's going on, Giorno?

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:59.960
H-Hey...

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.790
Golden Wind!

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.500
You should probably make a 
new right arm fast, Giorno.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:18.010
Was he trying to jump onto Golden 
Wind's right arm just now?

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.390
What's going on, Giorno? 
This is unthinkable!

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.550
We've never dealt with a 
Stand like this before.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.640
It goes against all we know.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.910
A Stand... Does that mean the 
user is hiding somewhere?

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.910
The user isn't here.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.700
He's already dead. He died on the runway.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.750
That man came here specifically to die...

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.210
so that his Stand could 
automatically trace us.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.130
Its energy is still alive.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.760
It appears to be a Stand that only 
activates when its user has died.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.430
There's no user, so it can keep 
up with this jet's speed.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.340
But it's super slow, Giorno.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.690
Actually, it's not moving at all. Did it die?

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.350
It's not moving?

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.070
No, Narancia...

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.310
It's eating, so it doesn't 
have to move right now.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.440
I got too close. This thing is fast.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.170
My bullets...

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.250
It got four of them just now... 
That's more than half.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:27.010
Number Two! Three! Six! Seven!

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.190
This thing's seriously bad news!

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.030
Don't get too close.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.850
Everyone, stay back.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.010
Mista!

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.810
Shit! Don't get close to it!

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.940
For some reason, it changed 
its target to Narancia.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.530
It's using some criteria 
to decide who to attack.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.950
How dare you underestimate me?!

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.070
I just need to stay away from it, right?

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:49.990
But...

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.420
My L'il Bomber can blow this thing 
apart without getting close at all!

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.750
That movement... 
It's definitely tracking something.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.250
I-Impossible! It's fast! It's way too fast!

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.610
This isn't good! At this rate, 
it's going to attack all of us!

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.280
N-Narancia!

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.110
Trish! Hide inside the closet!

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.680
What?!

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.200
Why is it going after Trish?!

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.200
Hurry up and shut the door!

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.660
I-I won't make it in time!

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.750
Trish!

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.790
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! 
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.530
I figured out...

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.340
what it's tracking.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.870
It's movement!

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:54.250
This Stand reacts to movement and 
prioritizes attacking whatever moves!

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:59.430
It matches the speed of the 
fastest target and prioritizes it.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.550
If we can get this thing off the 
plane along with my left arm,

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.040
we'll get to Sardinia safely.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.950
Then everything will go as planned.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.540
Giorno, wait!

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.120
Who's going to heal your wounds 
if you lose both your arms?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.250
Swap with me! Get that Stand onto me!

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.380
We won't make it in time, Bucciarati!

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.720
It's climbing up higher!

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.720
D-Don't!

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.330
Giorno!

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.330
How can this be?

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.650
We haven't even gotten to Sardinia yet,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.790 line:20%
Mista!

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.430
and both Mista and Narancia are...

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.580
How can this be?

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.990
If we weren't in an enclosed space like this,

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.780
they might not have been so badly injured.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.210
My idea to board a plane was naïve...

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.710
No one could've predicted this.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.350
And it's because we're on a plane

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.440
that we were able to blow that Stand away.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.300
Regardless, we have to tend to their wounds.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.690
They're all gravely injured.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.760
Let's get them inside the turtle.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.000
Hang on a second.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.400
Tend to their wounds... Their wounds...

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.010
Giorno's arms...

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.940
They can be healed, right?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.990
With Golden Wind's powers...

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:50.390
Golden Wind and Zipper Man's powers activate 
once their fists hit or touch something.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.090
This is the most damage 
we've endured so far.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.750
Giorno Giovanna is no longer able to fight.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.590
That probably goes for Mista 
and Narancia, as well.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.110
Giorno can't recreate the 
arms that he's lost!

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.330
Trish, you should get some rest.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.140
I'm going to go tell Abbacchio.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.770
I'm...

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.310
heading to Sardinia for myself.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.810
Just for my own safety...

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.420
And...

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.010
For my future, I want to 
find the key to my father.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.530
But Giorno and the others are different.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.260
They're making decisions based on

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.420
what they think is right, 
not for their future or safety.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.840
I...

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.020
can't even begin to understand that.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.800
Was that... a ball?

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.820
A ball was rolling around?

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.900
I-Impossible!

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.570
It didn't get blown away 
by the plane's speed?

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.610
No, it's the opposite...

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.810
Giorno...

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.450
It's movement!

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:16.860
This Stand reacts to movement and 
prioritizes attacking whatever moves!

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.330
In that case, the plane is 
moving through the sky...

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.820
The faster something is, 
the more it prioritizes catching it!

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.430
It attacked the knife just 
now because I dropped it...

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.750
I want to run into the 
closet and shut the door.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.000
Slowly...

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.310
I have to move slowly...

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.250
I have to escape without any sudden movement.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.930
I-It's so sensitive!

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.660
Why did it change direction?

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.570
It must've reacted to something.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.750
That's... Giorno's brooch?

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.290
Could that brooch be...

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.190
alive?

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:22.050
Golden Wind... No, Giorno's arms...

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.200
H-His left hand?

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.760
C-Could it be forming his left hand?

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:34.970
Before Giorno cut off his arm, he used 
Golden Wind to give the ladybug life

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.650
and created the hand he lost.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.850
Giorno's not out of the game yet!

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.900
If I can protect that left hand,

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.160
Narancia and Mista's wounds can also be healed!

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.690
B-But how am I going to do that?!

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.010
