00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.760
Leone Abbacchio became a police officer 
after graduating from high school.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.500
This was due to his strong sense of justice.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.220
But soon after he became a 
police officer, his lifelong dream,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.330
Abbacchio realized there were many 
contradictions that came with this job.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.820
The police were supposed to 
risk their lives to save others,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.130
while those very people they 
were risking their lives to protect

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.090
were the ones who were stealing, 
injuring others in hit-and-runs,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.760 line:20%
Hey, you two!

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.870
and throwing rocks at police cars, 
breaking their windshields.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.860
Honey!

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.470
Are you all right?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.550
Hey, you!

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.230
You're a cop, aren't you?!

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.760
The masses were unappreciative,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.700
demanding, and irresponsibly 
discredited and insulted the police,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.690
asking, "What are the police even doing?!"

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.750
Even if the police risked their lives to 
arrest criminals who were lower than scum,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110
"Serial Burglar Isacco Finally Arrested!"

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.110
"A Whole Group Wiped Out"

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.170
the law for the masses was rather 
lenient as long as they had money,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.870
"Isacco Released
on 70 Million Lire"
 "Victims Furious"

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.810
and they would be released.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.000
Quit causing us so much trouble.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.800
My bad.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.090
It doesn't matter now.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.810 line:20%
We just have to find more people to rip off.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.190
Eventually, Abbacchio started to 
learn from these contradictions.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.540
Come on, Officer.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.590
Cut us some slack.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.680
That girl's father is swimming 
in debt, so she needs the cash.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.940
It's not like we're hurting anyone.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.650
Hey, are you done yet?

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.230
I've got a client waiting.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.560
I know, I know.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.610
Even if I were to arrest them, 
they'd just post bail and be released.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.880
The only difference is they pay either 
me or the court and their lawyers.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.280
You're a very passionate man,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.650
and a very passionate police officer.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.730
One night, they received a report 
that a shop was being robbed.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.370 line:20%
Abbacchio! Go around the back.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.010
Freeze! You're under arrest!

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.030
H-Hey, it's you.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.620
Looks like I messed up.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.770
You're...

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.360
He's been shot in the head.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.320
Hey, couldn't you just pretend 
that you didn't see me?

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.260
Come on, let me go.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.650
I won't cause you any more trouble.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.970
No! You're under arrest!

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.800
Come on, think this through...

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.060
If I get arrested, the fact that you took 
a bribe from me will get out, too.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.180
That gun's really dangerous...

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.580
Could you point it somewhere else?

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.180
Abbacchio! He has a gun!

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.170
Ow! It hurts, God damn it!

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.040
I'm gonna die...

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.620
I'm gonna die...

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.440
I'm gonna die...

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.420
I'm really gonna die...

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.650
That moment was the end of Abbacchio's future.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.900
Not only was he charged 
for being a dirty cop,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.870
but he allowed his partner to
die because of his actions,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.250
and that was a cross he'd have 
to bear for the rest of his life.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.030
It was then that his body and 
soul plunged into darkness.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.810
No matter who died, or even 
if he lost a limb or two,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.580
his heart would probably 
never be moved again.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.930
Abbacchio, wasn't it?

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.780
Episodio 06  Moody Jazz's Counterattack

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.670
You can solve the mystery, right?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.160
I'm counting on you!

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.030
Giorno!

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.510
What the hell are you doing?!

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.050
<c.color8a376f>Roar</c>

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.320
G-Giorno!

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.620
Giorno's in trouble!

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.880
Giorno Giovanna...

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.170
You're one crazy bastard.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.070
All this to prove yourself...

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.530
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.380
Y-You bastard...

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.480
Th-This Stand...

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.030
Use your Golden Wind to defend yourself!

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.950
I-Impossible!

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.680
Giorno... Where are you?!

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.780
Don't go down there, Bucciarati.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.820
Actually, stay back.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.280
It's not that I trust Giorno 
Giovanna as one of us,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.970
but Giorno seems to believe 
that you won't abandon him.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.960
He does some pretty crazy shit.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.260
Giorno Giovanna...

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.620
What if that had actually killed you?

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.920
So, again, Bucciarati, don't go down there.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.740
Th-That fly...

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.730
Narancia's shoe...

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.270
Giorno's powers haven't disappeared yet.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.030
Does that mean Giorno's alive?

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.400
They're here, Bucciarati!

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.310
Narancia and the enemy are below deck!

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.330
Zipper Man!

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.090
Narancia, Fugo, Mista, and Giorno aren't here!

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.460
Maybe they're right under where the fly is.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.640
It's just like Giorno said.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.390
The enemy's not just hiding in some 
locker or behind something to attack...

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.740
Hey. The fly's coming around now.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.910
That's strange...

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.610
Where is the enemy going?

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.030
How and where is the enemy hiding?

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.770
Regarding this enemy's abilities...

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.080
I hate to admit it, but it looks like I'll 
have to accept what Giorno was saying.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.290
I'll use my Stand to solve this mystery!

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.580
But... This spot's bad news, Bucciarati!

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.510
Moody Jazz!

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.070
Does Narancia from five minutes ago work?

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.120
Yeah. That should be fine.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.500
Is the fly all right?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.740
It's heading toward the bow.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.360
Now's our chance. Do it quickly.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.430
Yeah.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.310
What's that noise?

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.810
His headphones.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.770
Five minutes ago, Narancia was 
listening to his boombox.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.440
Huh? What's wrong with this thing?
It just stopped working!

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.110
Why'd it stop?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.110
This isn't it.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.910
I just bought it!

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.410
Narancia was attacked a little after this.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.810
Damn it! How dare he sell 
me something like this?!

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.110
I'll try fast forwarding and searching.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.380
That stupid old guy from the electronics 
store is gonna regret this!

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.970
That ten billion now belongs to us!

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.150
With that money, we can 
claim the rank of capo!

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.640
A-Awesome!

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.600
Where is it?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.570
That was my voice.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.930
Where'd you hide that kind of 
fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.590
It was right after this conversation 
that Narancia was attacked!

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.590
I can't tell you that yet.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.470
We'd better be able to see just how 
he was attacked, Abbacchio.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.760
My Stand replays everything.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.570
We'll be able to see everything, 
from Narancia's sweat to his pulse.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.240
And it'll follow him everywhere.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.640
It's about time.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.980
Let's get behind Narancia.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.170
He's about to be attacked!

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.190
L-Look! It's the same wound Giorno had!

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.870
<c.color8a376f>Roar!</c>

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.720
It's coming!

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.050
Th-This is...

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.020
He's deflating like a balloon losing air!

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.020
Mario Zucchero

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.020
Tender Machine

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.240
Air is leaking from his wound, deflating him.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.740
Looks like we know what 
the enemy's abilities are now.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.440
He's being pulled in!

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.310
Pause it, Abbacchio!

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.120
I see... So he's inside the pipe.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.150
This is the answer to our mystery.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.840
His nails, flesh, and bones are 
all floppy like a condom,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.390
even his shoe and his belt buckle,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.620
but he still has a pulse.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.680
Just like Giorno said, he's alive.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.140
So that's what's going on...

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.390
The enemy is also doing this to his own body,

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.120
hiding in pipes or between the planks or walls,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.650
and he's dragged in Mista, 
Fugo, and Giorno, as well.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.030
That explains why Giorno's fly 
can trace the general area,

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.650
but can't pinpoint exactly where they are.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.640
We figured out the enemy's ability.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.000
Now all we have to do is chase the enemy,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.880
find out where Narancia and the 
others are and save them,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.170
and then beat the shit out of the guy.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.130
I'm resuming Moody Jazz's replay.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.140
Chase? Wait a second, Abbacchio!

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.560
While you're replaying, you can't attack or 
defend yourself. You're totally defenseless!

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.620
It's dangerous to go into the pipe.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.020
I know exactly where Moody Jazz is going.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.530
When that bastard is near, use your 
zippers to open the floor and get him!

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.570
We can't defeat the enemy if we 
don't chase him, Bucciarati!

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.710
It went left.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.410
That's where he got Mista.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.030
Moody Jazz is going right 
underneath that ring buoy.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:18.550
It's going around toward the cabin 
where it got Fugo and Giorno.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.600
So the enemy is moving them around 
while keeping them captured.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.180
It's moving much slower...

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.430
That's where the bastard 
was hiding earlier.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.680
On the inside of that rope fastener!

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.380
The enemy's right below the deck there!

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.800
The enemy's coming for us.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.390
I'm not sure if he knows that 
we know his ability, but...

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.260
Bring it on!

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.740
The pipes! Cut through them 
and get them outta there!

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.690
Zipper Man!

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.910
Th-They're not there!

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.130
Where's the enemy, Abbacchio?

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.310
Where's your Moody Jazz? Where are they?

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.080
Right there.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.490
It's my Stand. I know where it is.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.900
It's right around there.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.280
Right around where?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.950
I'm telling you, right where you opened up!

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.880
My Moody Jazz is definitely right there!

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.250
Where are they?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.270
Where are they?

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.650
Impossible... It's definitely right here.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.820
Does this mean there's a mystery 
we haven't solved yet?

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.210
This isn't good!

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.140
Undo the replay and call your Stand back!

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.580
I already did.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.590
Something's wrong...

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.870
What wall is this?

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.390
Where the hell are you?

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.010
Did you hear that, Bucciarati?

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.020
That's the sound of the inside of a pipe.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.350
We can't see it, but Moody Jazz 
is definitely right there...

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.810
inside the pipe.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.470
What are you doing?

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.360
The enemy's right there!

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.020
The pipe's wide open, but it's in the pipe...

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.440
It's coming closer...

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.560
So it's right here...

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.250
We need to run!

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.790
Run?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.980
That Giorno Giovanna, whom I hate, 
told me to solve this mystery.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.890
He's an annoying little brat,

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.380
but I'm going to solve it!

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.750
Abbacchio...

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.380
It's coming!

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.880
There's one more mystery 
surrounding this enemy.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.010
I'm finally starting to see it.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.890
I'll solve this and kill that bastard!

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.200
That awkward feeling I got 
when I saw the mast...

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.020
Back then...

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.760
B<c.colore4cd76>zzz</c><c.colorda89aa>zzz</c>

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.880
It's right there! Call back your Stand!

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.760
I've figured out the other mystery!

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.790
Abbacchio...

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.780
Kill him... Bucciarati!

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.830
This mystery...

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.210
The place the enemy's hiding...

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.830
You're being dragged in! Grab on to me!

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.680
Damn it!

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.270
He's not there...

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.090
Where did he go?

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.790
What?

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.440
You bastard...

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.440
Where did you take Abbacchio?!

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.870
He's not in the cabin or 
the drainage pipe...

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.670
Where are you hiding 
Abbacchio and the others?!

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.740
The fact that there are 
seagulls flying around...

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.640
must mean we're getting close to shore.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.000
Looks like you're finally 
all alone, Bucciarati.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.820
You bas—

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.480
Oh, hang on one sec.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.240
Ah, ah, ah!

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.160
I'm the one who's gonna 
do the talking here.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.850
Shut your trap until I tell you 
to answer my questions, damn it!

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.700
Very good.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:34.860
I can finish you off at any time, 
and your crew is still alive,

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.640
but in suspended animation.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.640
You should be grateful.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.500
I could've killed them and 
thrown them into the sea,

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.820
all chopped up nicely so the 
fishies could eat them easier.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:51.150
Depending on your actions, I may even 
consider turning your crew back to normal.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:56.270
All you have to do is tell me 
where Polpo's secret fortune is!

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.250
Are you from Passione?

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.400
You really...

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.030
don't get it at all.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:12.390
I'll murder you, you little shit!

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.730
Listen up! All you're allowed 
to say is where the money is!

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:21.440
Just try and utter any other word 
from that asshole of a mouth!

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.860
For every word you say, 
I'll kill one of your friends!

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.990
Say, "What?" and I'll kill them!

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.150
Stay silent, and I'll kill them!

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.290
If I find out you're lying later, 
I'll kill them again!

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.430
Got it?

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.300
Speak cautiously and very carefully.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.090
Now, then, let me ask you...

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.350
Where's the money hidden?

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.130
Black-tailed gulls.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.710
Sorry, where?

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.940
Those aren't seagulls.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.340
They're black-tailed gulls.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.800
How do you tell them apart?

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.360
The ones that sound like they're 
meowing are black-tailed gulls.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.840
You called them seagulls, but you were wrong.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.720
They're black-tailed gulls.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.040
I'm gonna kill one now!

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.810
Just try it! Better hope you
don't get dragged down!

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.160
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.220
I didn't punch the deck earlier 
to find where Abbacchio was.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.130
It was to put a hole in 
the bottom of the boat.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.670
A h-hole?!

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:48.140
Abbacchio figured out where you were,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.100
and he was kind enough to show me...

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.220
where you are and how to know for sure.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.890
It was Abbacchio's blood.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:02.150
Abbacchio intentionally hurt his hand 
and showed me the blood trail.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.320
The blood trail didn't 
go down below the deck!

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.970
It was cut off right on the deck!

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.490
So what does that mean, 
and where was he dragged to?

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.210
I rented the yacht that was on the left.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.920
Abbacchio realized that when 
he looked up at the sky.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.070
I know where you are, 
so if you don't wanna drown,

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.670
you'd best come out.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.160
There were two boats!

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.280
Bwaaaaa

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.770
You bastard...

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:59.050
You were hiding by thinly covering 
this yacht with another one.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:05.250
You were traveling through the thin gap 
between them and attacking us from there.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.140
No wonder we couldn't figure it 
out. You get points for that.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.650
Stay back, Bucciarati!

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.470
I'll kill your friends!

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.040
You should know better than anyone that

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.860
you couldn't survive in a gang if a measly 
little threat like that scared you.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.120
Give up, and I'll forgive you.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.570
But the moment you stab Abbacchio...

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.070
I will end your life.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:42.550
Fwip

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.730
It's just as Giorno said.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.310
The fact that you had to hide 
to attack is your weakness.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.690
You're way too slow.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.770
Pop

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.540
Abbacchio!

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.170
Well done...

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.970
Abbacchio,

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.790
what's important isn't the end result.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.980
It's how you get there.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.450
Join my team.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.450
Don't die bound by your past.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.010
