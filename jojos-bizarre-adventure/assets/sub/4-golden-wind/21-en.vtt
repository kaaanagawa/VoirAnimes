Episodio 21 The Mystery of Emperor Crimson

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.400 line:20%
Damn it, Narancia!

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.770 line:20%
Who do you think you are, 
trying to eat all the chocolates yourself?

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.010
Give them back!

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.400
I bought them with my own 
money, so give them back!

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.410 line:20%
Narancia, I swear...

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760
There are only three left!

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.410 line:20%
What a greedy little shit.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.120
We've all been waiting for these, 
and we're hungry!

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.150
The ladybug brooch is moving 
from the top of the tower.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.960
I can feel it.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.130
It's heading to the charnel house below

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.760
to try to cross through there.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.680
Bucciarati must've put the brooch 
somewhere on the boss's clothes.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.760
Sorry, Giorno, but could 
you grab that water?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.320
I'm a bit thirsty.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.770
Also, you should be careful.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.110
We've been ordered to wait 
here on the boat for now,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.250
and not set foot on the island.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.000
Right.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.690
Huh? Eh?

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.420
Y-You ate them, didn't you, Mista?!

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.750
Give them back, damn it!

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.040
And what the hell do you have on your mouth?

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.650
Huh?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.960
Ah!

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.600
"Ah," my ass! You little shit!

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.550 line:20%
S-So sweet!

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.530
When did you stuff them in your mouth?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.300
By the way, I didn't thank 
you yet, did I, Giorno?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.220
For grabbing the water.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.780
Something's... bizarre...

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.410
I don't know what,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.010
but something's strange.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.490
Hey, you bastard!

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.790
Didn't you hear that the boss ordered 
us not to set foot on the is—

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.490
...land?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.490
Huh?!

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.360
This isn't normal.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.510
Something weird is going on!

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.400
This isn't good! Bucciarati!

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.440
Where do you think you're going, Giorno?!

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.860
Is that you, Giorno?

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.810
Bucciarati!

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.190
Yes, I know he's on the move.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.770
I know exactly where the boss is because 
of the brooch you put on him.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.820
Right now, he's at the bottom of 
the stairs to the charnel house.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.320
He's right by the pillar that's about 
two meters away from the stairs.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.240
But wait, Bucciarati!

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.910
Something is wrong!

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.170
Bucciarati, your mission to 
act as Trish's bodyguard

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.920
has now come to an end.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.350
Wh-Why, you...

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.100
He's trying to immobilize my arm.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.100
Zipper Man!

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.050
But... Emperor Crimson has already...

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.580
...seen through it.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.300
Your movements in the future.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.630
The trajectory of your 
movements in the future.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.050
Within Emperor Crimson's ability, 
this world's time disappears,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.630
and no one remembers the movements 
they made within this segment of time.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.850
The clouds in the sky don't 
realize they've broken apart.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.940
A flame that's extinguished doesn't even 
realize the moment it went out.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.900
All that remains in this 
world are the results.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.070
In the world where time has been eliminated, 
all movement becomes pointless!

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.220
I am the only one who can 
react to these movements.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.370
I can see every single 
one of your movements!

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.750
This is Emperor Crimson's ability!

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.470
Th-This ability...

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.650
No matter who you may be,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.540
everyone goes through their ups and downs.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.270
You succeed, and you fail.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.300
But if you happen to find the pitfall known 
as the future that's right in front of you

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.580
and manage to not fall in,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.500
you will never experience 
a setback in your life.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.880
You will remain in your best condition.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.960
Don't you think so?

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:15.470
Now that I've actually met you, 
I can tell that we are indeed related.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.110
I can sense that you are, 
without a doubt, my daughter.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.230
Which means...

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.410
When you are awake, you will feel 
the exact same way toward me!

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.980
Trish...

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.830
I must fill any pitfall 
that threatens my path!

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.660
I will now sever this bond 
of blood that binds us!

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.040
Trish!

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.170
<c.colorf8ff5e>Dogyuuuuun</c>

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.920
Dogyuuuuun

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.720
Wh-What?!

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.820
That must be Giorno...

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.060
Giorno's Golden Wind's ability...

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.730
He planted the turtle's cells in 
the brooch and gave it life,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.690
and a turtle with Stand abilities was born.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.120
Since our call was interrupted, 
he must've sensed something was wrong

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.660
and activated his ability.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.290
He always gives me courage...

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.920
I didn't think I could move 
anymore, but... Not yet.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.280
I still...

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.850
have to keep moving a little bit more.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.590
My mission's done? You're wrong, Boss.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.560
It's still ongoing!

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.390
As for Trish...

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.600
I will protect her on my own order!

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.510
If he can read all of my attacks,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.260
and I can't even realize 
that he's dodged them,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.160
then his ability surpasses 
all others in its invincibility.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.570
But...

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.540
This ability doesn't allow him to 
read one's movements for long!

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.040
It's only a short time.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.350
It seems to be around five to ten seconds.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.400
Distance...

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.800
For now, I need to get 
as far away as possible!

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.530
I need to get far enough that 
the boss can't find Trish!

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.890
I beg of you to keep moving, body.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.260
Don't let me waste this 
chance that Giorno gave me!

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.150
Until I can get out of this basement...

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.460
It seems there was another traitor.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.530
Must be the newbie.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.650
<c.coloraf0b7b>Rumble</c>

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.770
If my information is correct, 
I believe his name is Giorno Giovanna.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.740
<c.coloraf0b7b>Rumble</c>

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.750
So he must've joined this organization with 
the intent to betray me from the start.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.970
It seems you thought you could escape 
just by distancing yourself from me,

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.460
but it's nothing for me to escape 
that turtle an instant sooner.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.390
It appears that your efforts 
were futile, Bucciarati.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.640
How are you still able to move?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.060
Sheer willpower?

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.610
If you just rest, you won't be 
able to get to the first floor,

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.020
but you'll be able to die peacefully.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.650
First, I'm going to eliminate Trish.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.790
Don't you dare move, Bucciarati!

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.090
The chance that Giorno gave me wasn't in vain!

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.410
If this is going to be about 
reading each other's moves,

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.200
I've already read yours!

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.250
I knew before you fell into the sewer

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.170
that you'd probably use 
your ability to escape!

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.210
Now, Zipper Man!

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.910
Emperor Crimson!

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.810
That was close...

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.650
But within Emperor Crimson's world,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.230
your efforts are still futile!

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.440
Take this!

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.100
You're finished!

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.240
It wasn't you that I was trying to attack!

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.910
It was this pillar!

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.080
Zipper, close!

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.790
What?!

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.720
As I thought... 
Your ability is invincible...

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.230
But it appears that you can only 
read movements for a short time.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.380
You're not reading ahead of time.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.350
Just try and read my future 
movements, Boss.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.410
Try to figure out what I'm going 
to do in a few seconds.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.310
Try to see beyond time.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.020
You should be able to see me

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.210
after I've reached the first floor.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.660
Bucciarati! Trish!

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.040
This wound...

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.880
What happened in the basement?!

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.340
Where's the boss?

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.420
He should still be around...

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.640
Somewhere close by.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.060
I don't know the whole situation, 
but there's no way

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.330
the boss is just going to 
let Bucciarati go after this!

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.520
Bucciarati...

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.450
N-No...

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.780
Bucciarati!

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.380
His pulse...

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.590
I-Impossible! It's gone!

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.130
I created the parts needed for his recovery!

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.160
Bucciarati, please breathe!

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.980
So this must be Giorno Giovanna.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:51.640
His unknown ability gave Bucciarati 
the chance to escape.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.440
However...

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.230
I will not let them get away!

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.970
This is impossible!

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.940
I know I created the parts!

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.620
There's no way he shouldn't have a heartbeat!

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.410
Giorno, it's me.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.780
Call Abbacchio and the others.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.330
Get out of here.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.780
That voice...

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.250
I told you to call Abbacchio and the others.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.090
Get out of here!

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.920
Out of this church!

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.330
Hurry!

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.880
B-Bucciarati!

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.260
Th-Thank goodness!

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.670
You're okay!

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.180
Hurry! Hurry up and call the others!

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.850
B-But...

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.340
We can't figure out who the 
boss actually is right now.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.060
We need to get out of here, Giorno! 
While we're still far enough from him!

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.820
They're within my range!

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.650
Here I go!

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.660
I'll explain later! Hurry up, Giorno!

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.830
Golden Wind!

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.790
Giorno's over there!

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.620
Hey, Giorno, you bastard! Come back here!

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.350
How are you gonna make up for disobeying 
orders and stepping onto the island?!

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.840
Bucciarati's here, too!

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.360
H-How the hell did you get so injured?!

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.430
Why do you still have Trish with you?!

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.880
What's going on here, Bucciarati?

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.160
I'll explain everything later.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.100
Right now, we need to get out 
of here as fast as we can.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.590
I commend you, Bucciarati.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.720
I commend your precise and 
keen decision making.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.270
Even though I have the 
ability to eliminate time,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.900
if I were to face all six of those Stand users,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.160
one of them would end up 
learning my true identity.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.410
For the moment,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.000
they've managed to escape 
my Emperor Crimson.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.750
But this is not the end.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.380
I will never...

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.630
let you escape

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.610
from Venice!

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:53.970
Now I understand why the boss is feared by 
everyone and how he ruled over all of us.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.820
We can't defeat the boss... not now.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.240
As for his identity...

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.570
Assuming it even has one,

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.230
we'll need to find his 
ability's weakness first!

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.910
Emperor Crimson

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.300
What...

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.610
What the hell's going on, Bucciarati?

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.380
We need an explanation.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.260
What the hell are you doing?

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.780
All right. I'll just come out and say it.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.780
But I can't explain everything right now,

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.890
because there's no time and 
danger's right around the corner.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.320
The reason I brought Trish back

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.940
is because I betrayed the boss just now.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.150
I'll be leaving you guys now.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:48.150
If you go with me, 
you will also become traitors.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.230
Wh-What?

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.600
I-I don't think I heard you right...

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.870
Wh-What did you just say?

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.620
He said... he betrayed the boss.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.330
B-But why?

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.040
You probably shouldn't hear any more,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.280
because you guys have 
nothing to do with this.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.200
I think you should explain.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.470
Some of them might want to follow you.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.350
We need people on our side.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.100
What the hell is your deal, Giorno?!

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.190
First, you go into the church 
without permission, and now—

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.540
Bucciarati!

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.280
What's wrong? Are you all right?

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.680
I'm fine.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.680
I lost a lot of blood, so I got a bit dizzy.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.000
That shouldn't be possible...

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.230
When I created his parts, it should've 
also replenished the blood he lost.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.590
Did I miss a wound?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.400
I guess I've used up a good deal of energy.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.410
Does he not feel pain? There was no 
blood coming from the wound, either.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.800
Was I just seeing things?

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.080
I'm sorry.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.920
You had me worried for a sec!

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.300
For real.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.230
Bucciarati, please...

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.230
Yeah, Bucciarati.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.560
We want to know the details.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.570
The boss had us act as her bodyguards

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.170
so that he could kill his daughter 
with his own two hands.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.040
Because she shares his blood, she could 
have figured out his true identity.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.710
I found that out and...

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.490
I couldn't forgive him.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.480
I couldn't just come back
pretending I didn't see that.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.810
That's why I betrayed him!

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.870
How could you?

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.220
Are you insane, Bucciarati?

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.580
You know exactly what happens to traitors,

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.660
no matter who it is.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.870
The boss never lets anyone get away!

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:53.450
Hell, Venice could already be 
surrounded by the boss's elite guard!

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.010
You're right, and that's why 
I'm going to need help.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.700
If any of you are willing to accompany me,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.980
come down these stairs and get on the boat.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.670
But I will not order any 
of you to come with me.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.710
I won't even ask you to come with me.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.470
I did this all on my own.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.390
So you don't need to feel
obligated to come with me.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.850
This may come off as arrogant, 
but I'm going to say it anyway.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.810
I did this because I believe I'm right.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.470
I have no regrets.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.730
Despite the world we live in, I want to 
continue on the path that I believe in.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.730
If we can just find his weakness...

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.930
Though we're only fleeing for now,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.950
I will defeat the boss, no matter what.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.410
I will find his weakness, no matter what!

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.200
I understand your reasons, and what 
you did was right, Bucciarati.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.190
But I'm going to be blunt...

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.280
I hate to say it, but no one's 
going to get on that boat.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.720
How could you let your 
emotions take over like that?

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.660
I owe you my life, but going with you 
now would be a different matter.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.230
You've lost sight of reality.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.870
No one can survive in this world 
on expectations alone.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.020
We can't survive without the organization.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.330
Fugo's absolutely right.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.670
What you did is basically suicide.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.730
No matter where in the 
world you might run to,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.300
you'll never find a safe haven again.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.930
Besides, I pledged my loyalty 
to the organization.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.260
It's not like I pledged my loyalty to you.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.480
That being said...

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:54.780
I never had a home or place I wanted to go.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.890
The only time I'm ever at ease

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.950
is when I'm with you, Bucciarati.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.370
Abbacchio...

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.790
Y-You can't be serious, Abbacchio!

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.630
If we actually manage to defeat the boss...

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.590
Considering my skills,

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.130
I'd say I'm next in line to become a capo.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.640
Bucciarati's smart.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.780
He never goes into a fight that 
he has no chance of winning.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.600
We're gonna strike it rich for sure.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.210
Mista! Not you, too!

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.650
What are you going to do, Fugo?

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.000
You've all l-lost your minds!

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.860
We're going to be completely isolated!

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.970
Where are you going to run to?

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.200
No, you won't even make it 
out of Venice alive!

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.260
Narancia,

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.370
what are you going to do?

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.220
I-I... d-don't know what to do...

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.500
Tell me, Bucciarati...

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.320
What should I do?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.180
Do you think I should go?

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.380
Are you scared?

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.580
Yeah... I'm r-really scared...

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.990
B-But just order me!

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.460
If you order me to go with you, 
I'll be more confident!

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.520
Nothing scares me, as long 
as you order me to do it!

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.560
No.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.550
This is one thing I can't order you to do.
You need to decide for yourself.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.490
You need to choose your own path.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.700
B-But I don't know what to do! I don't know!

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.700
But let me just give you this warning.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.100
Don't come with me, Narancia.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.410
You're not cut out for this.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.710
Are you serious about this?

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.860
You'll be killed, without a doubt.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.970
There are some things in this world that 
you just can't do, even if you're right.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.680
Our job has always been dirty.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.720
How is this any different?

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.810
Even then... I can't lie to myself.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.950
Let's go!

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.530
Once the boat takes off, 
you're officially traitors!

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.580
Why? You're insane!

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:13.050
All this for a woman you just 
met and barely talked to!

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.040
You don't even know what 
kind of music she likes!

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.050
Trish was abandoned by 
the people she trusted...

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.380
I was also abandoned before.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.890
I was abandoned by my dad 
and the friends I trusted.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.360
We're sort of alike...

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.360 line:20%
It's none of our business what 
the boss does with his daughter!

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.690
Trish and I are sort of alike!

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.690 line:20%
All he had to do was close his eyes! 
I just don't understand!

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.540
Giorno, give me the turtle.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.260
Let's put Trish inside it.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.100
Okay.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.490
Bucciarati, please turn around.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.420
Bucciarati!

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.010
I'll go! I'll go, too! I'm coming with you!

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.440
Don't order me not to go with you!

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:15.320
Trish is me! She's me! 
The wound on her arm is my own!

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.120
Narancia... Not you, too...

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.690
You fool... You're going to be killed.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.020
I can't go along with 
such a foolish betrayal.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.340
I can't become a righteous idiot...

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.980
You took way too long to make your decision.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.010
You'd better not hold this
against us later on.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.640
Narancia, I have nothing but 
respect for your courage.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.270
I guess Fugo didn't come after all.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.640
That was his choice to make.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.560
Bucciarati!

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.660
I... I want to protect Trish!

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.030
I'll defeat the boss with you!

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.830
Yeah.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.070
Squalo?

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.980
We have some traitors... in Venice.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.880
The names of the traitors are 
Bruno Bucciarati and Giorno Giovanna.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:33.050
The boss's identity: Unknown
Stand name: Emperor Crimson
Has the ability to eliminate a certain amount of time.
Because of this, he can predict the future. Invincible.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.540
They can be taken dead or alive.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.290
This is straight from the boss!
