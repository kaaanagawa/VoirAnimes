Episodio 28: Beneath a Sky on the Verge of Falling

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.200 line:20%
Which means that the only thing 
Li'l Bomber can track right now...

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.020
I was winning...

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.160
I would've won...

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.080
But you had thrown the scalpels at them...

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.830
Boss...

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.710
He's down! Li'l Bomber finished him off!

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.850
All right.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.450
I'll go find out who it was.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.810
Hold on, Abbacchio.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.960
We don't know how many of the boss's 
men are on this beach right now.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.370
I need you to hurry

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.600
and replay the footage of the one 
who took the photo of Trish's mother

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.230
on this beach fifteen years ago.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.520
We need to get out of here as soon 
as we can, or we'll be in danger.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.870
But there's only one of them on the cliff!

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.950
Bucciarati, I remember the 
Stand from the plane.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.270
Despite Mista turning that guy into 
a corpse, we still went through hell.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.720
I have to confirm who's up on that 
cliff, or I won't be able to relax.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.750
Narancia, is the enemy up there dead?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.350
He's barely hanging on.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.930
But his breathing has just about ceased.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.460
He hasn't moved a millimeter.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.460
All right.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.160
Narancia and I will be the 
ones to go and check.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.020
Abbacchio.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.560
Use your Moody Jazz to get 
the replay going right away.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.710
All right.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.250
We can't stay here for too long.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.070
How much time do you need?

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.860
Well, we're talking fifteen years ago.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.540
It'll probably take eight to ten minutes.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.920
Do it in five.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.270
Giorno, Trish, and Mista are standing by in 
the turtle, so I'll bring them out here, too.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.810
And the moment we learn the boss's 
true identity from Moody Jazz's replay,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.000
we'll leave here.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.210
Narancia, use Li'l Bomber to signal for 
Giorno and the others to get out here.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.010
You got it!

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.950
I finally... figured it out...

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.660
I know... your identity...

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.290
Before I die...

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.190
show me... show me your face...

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.360
I will not allow you to continue this 
conversation any longer, Risotto Nero.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.910
The last thing I wanted was for Bucciarati 
and his crew to find out we were here.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.360
You should die with pride as the leader

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.790
of the Hitman Team, 
since you made it this far.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.090
I'm sure your men who are waiting in 
the afterlife will be proud of you.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.980
You're going to die at any second.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.910
And Bucciarati will come find 
you up here at any moment.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.310
Before that happens, give me back 
all the iron you stole from my body.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.320
If you do, I'll finish you off myself.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.510
Wouldn't it be the worst embarrassment 
of your life if you were

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.280
to die slowly and miserably 
in front of Bucciarati

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.580
and his men, who took the lives of your team?

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.080
Not to mention, they already 
consider you a pathetic enemy.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.080
I... die...

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.410
What was that? I couldn't hear you.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.050
Hurry up and give me back the iron 
that was in my body, Risotto Nero.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.010
I'm saying... that I won't die alone.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.560
Within the chunks of flesh 
that Li'l Bomber blew off...

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.100
The parts of me that scattered...

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.850
This time, I'll be the one using it...

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.150
Li'l Bomber, that is!

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.480
Die!

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.190
What the heck? Li'l Bomber is...

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.880
That bastard stuck itself to my Li'l Bomber!

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.910
<c.colore74465>F</c><c.colored7363>o</c><c.colorfbff7c>o</c><c.colore7836a>m</c>

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.830
Emperor Crimson.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.900
I blew away 0.5 seconds' worth of time.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.190
Everything that was in this world 
within that span disappeared,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.220
and all that remains is what 
happened after those 0.5 seconds.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.890
Just the results of the bullets hitting you.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.090
<c.colorb9d311>Rata tat tat tat tat tat</c>

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.430
Well done, Risotto Nero.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.390
You died before you could lose your pride.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.570
But that also means I'm still facing 
this unfortunate predicament.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.340
This isn't good.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.410
I have to do something...

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.610
Are you sure, Narancia?

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.290
Yeah.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.970
Something made its way into Li'l Bomber!

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.580
Shit!

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.710
They're coming...

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.010
I have to hide... and somehow 
replenish my iron...

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.490
Stop right here.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.470
We need to assess the situation 
carefully from here.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.440
Got it.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.620
It's all right, Bucciarati.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.350
His breath's completely stopped, 
and his Stand has disappeared.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.020
He's definitely dead.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.490
Though, I shot him in the face, so it 
might be hard to tell who he actually was.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.120
That man is probably the 
leader of the Hitman Team.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.580
How can you tell?

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.100
He's here alone without a team, 
which means that either

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.580
he was a very confident killer 
someone sent after us,

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.970
or he had no one left on his team.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.410
And he was just killed by whoever 
this other very confident killer was

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.680
for getting in the way.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.370
Uh, hello? Bucciarati?

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.920
It was my Li'l Bomber that 
turned him into a honeycomb—

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.820
You're wrong. You were just being used.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.690
There was someone else here.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.480
Look at his right foot.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.220
Li'l Bomber's attacks would 
have left burn marks.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.750
But there are no burn marks on that foot.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.870
It was only torn off.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.780
But... there was only one person 
on Li'l Bomber's radar!

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.960
I'm still not getting any other signal!

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.040
And why would anyone 
need to do that, anyway?!

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.640
Neither of them likely expected

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.470
the other to be as powerful as themselves, 
so the survivor is probably very badly wounded.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.620
Though, I don't know how they're 
hiding their breathing.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.180
Narancia, you sent out a signal for Giorno 
and the others to gather, didn't you?

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.010
They should be heading to the place 
the picture came from right now.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.640
All right, let's go after them.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.540
From now on, don't overlook even 
the smallest hint of breathing,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.320
even if it's a lizard or a mouse.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.960
The other killer is still nearby.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.650
He's an extremely dangerous killer 
sent by the organization.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.990
Damn it...

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.200
To think I'd have to endure this hell

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.870
back home on Sardinia,

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.930
all because of those bastards...

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.130
I know this is a rocky area, but there 
are way more than I expected.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.510
When I'm tracking the breathing of 
things like frogs and field mice,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.050
there are just too many!

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.950
And if I make the range too sensitive,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.850
I'll even pick up the breathing of the 
tourists and the exhaust from their cars.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.530
Damn it! Should I just light 
this whole place up?!

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.560
Calm down!

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.340
Frogs and field mice will try 
to hide in nearby holes.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.160
Those aren't the movements 
you're looking for.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.820
Look for the movement of someone 
trying to get away from us.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.300
Movement of someone trying 
to get away from us...

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.610
I have to hurry...

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.150
Abbacchio...

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.580
I have to stop his Stand!

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.730
That must be it.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.110
Hey, where are Narancia and Bucciarati?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.050
I only see Abbacchio on the beach.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.440
An enemy must've appeared.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.270
They're probably pursuing the enemy.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.870
And it seems that Abbacchio 
hasn't started his replay yet.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.760
Trish remembered that the photo 
was taken fifteen years ago in June,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.780
but she doesn't know the exact date.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.420
Moody Jazz is searching with 
a timer for the exact time.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.940
When it figures that out...

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.040
It'll be able to change into the boss.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.930
Let's go.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.270
Hey, let's play over here.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.640
You're the goalie today.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.750
What? No way!

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.970
Rock-paper-scissors, then!

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.380
Well? Can you tell them apart?

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.330
I found it, Bucciarati! There's just one!

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.540
It's 80 meters to our right.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.020
That must be it. It's not very fast,

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.530
but it's headed toward the tourists!

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.920
Narancia, don't attack just yet!

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.260
First, we have to determine 
exactly who we're dealing with.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.340
His movement stopped.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Bucciarati?

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.470
Blood?

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.830
You, there! I'm about to attack you!

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.160
If you are unable to fight anymore, 
come out from behind that rock.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.040
I promise not to take your life.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.750
I'll wait just three seconds. Got it?

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.580
It's been three seconds!

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.600
I take it you're prepared to fight!

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.760
Zipper Man!

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.340
<c.color9300d0>R</c><c.color8430d9>i</c><c.color6d6adf>p</c>

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.090
Hey, come on!

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.830
Where the heck are you 
kicking the ball? You suck!

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.250
Oh, come on!

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.160
It's your fault for not 
being able to get it!

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.150
Just shut up and go get it already!

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.830
You go get it!

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.820
It's already the 25th. 
June's going to be over soon.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.350
How long is this gonna take?

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.140
It better actually be June 
fifteen years ago, damn it.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.700
Higher! Higher, damn it!

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.580
Throw some rocks at it!

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.880
Shake the branches! Climb up there!

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.420
Hey! Pipe down, you little brats!

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.510
Go play someplace where there's more room!

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.590
Duh, we know that.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.430
Who the heck kicked it up there?

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.600
Hey! Stop throwing rocks!

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.560
Reach out your hand a little more!

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.990
I know, damn it!

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.100
I can't reach any further!

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.810
Oh, hell. Go on, move out of the way!

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.480
What the hell is this?!

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.540
Wait.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.690
Don't attack, Narancia!

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.160
He's just a kid! He's one of the tourists!

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.670
His mouth is sewn shut with 
the laces from his sneakers!

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.380
Only a Stand user could have done this.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.000
They must've switched places with him.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.690
And by the look of this kid, 
he seems to have lost a lot of blood.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.670
But where did all that blood go?

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.560
What the hell?! Where's the 
bastard that did this to him?!

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.280
How the hell did he disappear?!

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.220
He was super weak a second ago!

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.410
I don't know...

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.330
What in the world is going on?

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.330
Thanks!

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.020
All right!

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.990
C'mon, let's hurry!

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.030
Thanks, mister!

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.940
Thanks!

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.420
Hey, wait up!

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.070
Thanks!

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.120
Nothing beats coming back home.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.090
Luck's on my side.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.820
Let's go!

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.290
Kick it right this time!

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.040
You're the one who kicked it over there!

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.590
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.940
Leone Abbacchio

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.940
Moody Jazz

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.040
Uh... What are you doing under there, officer?

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.970
Sorry to bother you while you're eating.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.760
I'm conducting an investigation.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.300
I'm looking for fingerprints.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.970
There was a robbery across 
the street last night.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.210
The victim was struck with a bottle.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.860
It shattered, and shards went everywhere.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.670
But all the shards weren't on the sidewalk.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.500
Particularly the part that was being held.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.040
We heard that the suspect 
threw something away here,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.230
so I thought I might find 
something in this recycling bin.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.550
I should be able to get some fingerprints.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.490
That's the part I'm looking for.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.080
You're going to look through all that?

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.790
Well, it's my job.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.780
I see.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.750
Yeah...

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.470
Say, uh...

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.260
Yes?

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.810
For reference... I'm just curious.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:36.230
What are you going to do if 
you don't find the shards?

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.460
You might not get any fingerprints.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.510
No... Even worse, if you do find them,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.240
and the suspect hires a crafty 
lawyer and is found not guilty...

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.700
What makes you keep working so 
hard despite all those problems?

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.530
Well...

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.710
I'm not just after the result.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.920
When all you want is the result, 
you start to look for shortcuts.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.130
And if you take that shortcut, 
you might lose sight of the truth.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.130
You'll become less motivated.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.400
I think the most important thing 
is the will to find the truth.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.880
As long as you have that,

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.540
even if the suspect gets away this time, 
you'll get them eventually, right?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.780
Because that's what you're after.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.400
Don't you think so?

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.780
I envy you.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.140
I used to think I wanted 
to become a police officer.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.640
Ever since I was a kid,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.280
I wanted to become a 
distinguished police officer.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.320
At some point, I even had 
that same will you have.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.870
But I messed up.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.820
You see, people like me

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.830
are worthless.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.450
We never see things to the end.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.680
We always mess up somewhere along the way.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.540
That's not true, Abbacchio.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.540
You're doing great.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.270
We have the same will.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:05.840
That will you had when you 
first became a police officer

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.280
resides within your heart again now...

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.500
Abbacchio.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.340
Why...

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.700
do you know my name?

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.010
Come to think of it...

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.140
I think we've met before.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.200
Where are you going, Abbacchio?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.880
I'm getting on that bus!

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.600
I'm starting to remember...

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.420
That's right!

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.100
I have to go!

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.300
I need to get back to my comrades!

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.420
Did you forget, Abbacchio?

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.700
You came here on that bus.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.160
This is the last stop.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.060
You can never return.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.030
Y-You're...

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.450
That's right! You're...

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.910
You're the one who died 
because I took that bribe...

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.240
Abbacchio, you did very well.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.450
That's right...

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.520
So well that I can say I'm proud of you.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.950
No way...

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.500
This can't be happening!

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.850
God damn it! You can't be serious!

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.280
Hurry up and heal him, Giorno!

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.790
I said hurry up and heal him!

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.300
Don't make me kick your face in, you bastard!

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.760
It happened in a moment...

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.660
It happened in a second at close range.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.040
We were too late...

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.000
We were too late.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.290
How could someone like Abbacchio

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.710
let him get that close?

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.120
Mista...

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.110
Don't let Trish out of the turtle.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.350
The enemy will probably attack 
again, to try to finish Trish off.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.370
We have to leave here immediately.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.840
This is my fault.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.230
We can't gather any more 
clues about the boss here.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.440
Wh-What are you talking about, Bucciarati?

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.990
Abbacchio is gonna wake up any second!

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.070
It's just taking a bit longer than usual!

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.980
He'll wake up if we just 
wait a little longer!

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.780
Right, Giorno?!

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.910
That's what happened before, right?

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.730
H-Hey!

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.940
That's enough, Narancia!

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.710
It's too dangerous here!

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.010
You need to use Li'l Bomber 
to survey the area.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.270
What are you talking about, Bucciarati?

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.300
What the hell are you talking about?!

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.390
If the enemy's gonna show up, 
I'll kill him right here, right now!

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.140
If he's nearby, I'll face him head-on!

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.290
Mista! Right, Giorno?

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.210
Hey, Mista!

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.610
We have to go, Narancia.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.820
Just as Bucciarati said!

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.630
Wh-What?

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.530
What did you just say?!

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.860
Giorno!

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.950
You're probably just not trying hard enough!

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.830
Bring him back!

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.810
Give it all you have, you bastard!

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.210
That's enough, Narancia!

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.290
Shut the hell up!

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.440
Narancia!

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.930
Abbacchio...

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.250
Are we just going to leave 
him here, Bucciarati?!

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:37.110
Are we just going to leave 
Abbacchio all alone?!

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.610
I don't want to leave him behind!

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.220
This is an order, Narancia!

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.620
Abbacchio knew that this was a 
possibility when he came here!

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.810
We're leaving.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.620
Bucciarati, wait!

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.240
That's...

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.450
Bucciarati, wait. Just for a moment.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.620
This must mean something. It has to.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.820
He's holding something.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.750
What is it?

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.310
It looks like a piece of rock from somewhere.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.270
It must mean something. Golden Wind!

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.100
Go back to where you came from!

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.910
Hey, look!

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.320
Apparently, Abbacchio 
had completed his replay!

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.200
This is a death mask!

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.690
A death mask from the replay!

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.260
Right before Abbacchio's 
Moody Jazz disappeared...

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.370
It took the last of its Stand energy

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.080
and pressed its transformed 
face into the stone pillar!

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.290
Abbacchio left us this at the very end!

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.860
This is the boss's true face!

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.010
Abbacchio, you did a great job.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.220
And your will to get to your truth...

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.340
The ones left behind will get it.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.300
Because that's what important.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.450
