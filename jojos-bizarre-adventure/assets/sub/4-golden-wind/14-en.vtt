WEBVTT

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.360
Let me see the key we obtained again,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.500
Narancia.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.830
Huh?

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.610
Here.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.570
Wait! Don't throw it!

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.030
You little shit!

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.010
Dang, talk about overreacting.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.890
Isn't the fact that you're 
feeling pain a good sign?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.710
I just had it reattached thirty minutes ago...

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.580
It still hurts, damn it!

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.250
"I thank you for protecting 
my daughter, Bucciarati.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.600
Go to the drinking fountain with a turtle 
on the sixth platform at Naples Station,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.480
and use this key.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.100
Then, take my daughter to Venice by train.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.140
P.S. My missions for you will 
end once you get to Venice."

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.970
What's supposed to be by the 
drinking fountain at the station?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.300
The boss mentioned a way for us to travel 
without being found by the enemy.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.270
The station is dangerous, but we'll 
just have to trust him and go.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.060
D-Do you think the boss 
is actually in Venice?

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.580
Since it's mentioned in that note...

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.720
We don't need to think about that.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.790
We're just going to do as we're ordered.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.000
There's a super express leaving for 
Florence in ten minutes. We'll take that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.760
Mista, is anyone following us?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.720
So far, we're good.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.790
I can't say the same for the station, though.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.250
There'll be plenty of paid guys 
who'll report information about us.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.280
The boss's daughter, Trish.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.850
Her life is being targeted because 
of a father she's never met.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.020
I wonder how that feels...

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.110
Yeah, I get it, Fugo...

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.630
I can't help but stare at her 
you-know-whats, either.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.070
Huh?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.750
Th-That's...

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.570
Please forgive Fugo!

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.160
He didn't mean any harm!

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.190
He wasn't trying to take 
advantage of the sudden braking

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.470
to see your breasts or stroke 
your thighs under your skirt!

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.130
He just couldn't help himself!

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.190
Hey, stop that!

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.560
I actually lost my balance, 
but you're making it sound worse!

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.980
Please don't tell the boss!

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.580
Episodio 14  Express Train to Florence

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.120
<i>Florence bound leaving at 16:35 from platform 6</i>

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.530
He's really here. That's Bucciarati.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.020
I can't believe he actually showed up at 
a station where we could easily find him.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.640
I'm gonna kill him!

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.800
Maybe he was pushed to his 
limits and lost his mind,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.680
or he's somehow confident that 
he'll be able to give us the slip.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.860
Either way, I'm gonna kill him!

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.270
He killed Formaggio and Illuso! 
I'm gonna kill him!

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.370
Hey, dumbass.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.080
Drop the "I'm gonna kill him" crap already.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.630
That phrase doesn't exist in our world.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.670
Only weaklings use that phrase.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.260
Because when I or my other team 
members so much as think those words,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.850
our target is already dead, 
and the job is over!

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.310
So I've never uttered 
those words in my life.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.460
You're gonna be that way too, right, Pesci?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.090
If you're truly one of us.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.570
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.950
Yeah... I got it, Bro!

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.830
You can say, "I killed them!"

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.510
Prosciutto...

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.680
I'm going to head straight 
over there via the platform.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.560
Pesci, you board the train 
and head to the lead car.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.300
Got it!

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.060
We'll flank him.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.070
We need the boss's daughter alive, after all.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.020
Bucciarati, the train's about to leave.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.310
Is something wrong?

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.950
There's no other drinking fountain 
on this platform, is there?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.740
This key won't fit into this keyhole.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.990
Not to mention...

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.650
you don't even need a key to open it.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.160
It's just a stopcock.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.170
Bucciarati, how about the 
lock on that fire hydrant?

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.310
The shape's completely different.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.220
There aren't any locks or 
doors that this key will fit.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.680
They just aren't here!

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.180
Should we pass on this train?

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.980
The next one departs in fifteen 
minutes and is bound for Rome.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.980
No!

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.650
I'm sure some of our enemies know we're 
here and are heading to the station now.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.690
We have to leave here immediately!

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.030
The sixth platform...

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.740
The drinking fountain with the turtle...

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.990
This has to be the spot!

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.910
Damn it! What's—

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.890
The turtle...

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.430
Hey, Pesci, why the hell am 
I running into you here?

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.450
I-I could ask you the same thing! 
Where did Bucciarati go?

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.850
Bucciarati hopped onto the 
train right in front of me.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.410
It makes no sense that he didn't 
bump into you in the hallway.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.660
Well? I'm right, aren't I?

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.110
I didn't run into anyone!

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.960
Bucciarati, his crew, the newbie, and the 
boss's daughter definitely aren't here!

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.510
Something's strange...

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.220
Bro, the train's about to leave.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.850
They must be hiding somewhere 
inside this station.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.440
They're gonna keep an eye on us tracking 
them and hop on another train to get away.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.840 line:20%
Let's use some homeless guy or 
something to search the station!

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.090
There was something placed 
at the drinking fountain.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.330
He must've picked it up.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.660
He picked up something that looked black!

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.040
Get on, Pesci!

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.850
But why?!

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.980
I just have a hunch.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.360
I don't know how,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.270
but I think Bucciarati and the 
others are somewhere on this train.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.800
You think?

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.000
You <i>think</i>?!

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.260
I'm sure the boss is helping them out somehow.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.740
I have a feeling that if we don't board 
this train, we'll lose them forever!

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.550
A feeling?

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.830
Just shut up and get on, Pesci!

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.410
It takes takes three and a half hours to 
get from Naples to Florence by train.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.450
It's an hour and a half non-stop 
to the next stop, Rome.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.350
Aw, we ended up getting on...

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.570
Shut up!

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.770
Hey, the gap between the door and floor...

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.130
What's on the other side of this door?

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.230
Isn't that the driver's cab?

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.640
But there's no way seven guys are in there.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.310
You never know.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.730
Use your Fisher Man to attack that room.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.400
Do it.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.420
Fisher Man!

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.990
There aren't seven guys in here...

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.620
There are two!

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.710
Got 'em!

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.800
Damn it. It really is small in there.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.630
I guess there's only the driver.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.100
But they're definitely 
somewhere on this train.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.230
Huh? Hey, wait a second.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.080
There's only one?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.870
I know I sensed two living things in there.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.990
I could've sworn there was one more...

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.940
Hey, Pesci!

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.540
We're going to search this 
train from end to end!

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.700
We'll drag Bucciarati and his crew out!

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.290
But you stay here.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.030
Huh?

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:06.490
If they realize we're here, 
they might come to stop the train.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.000
You got it, Bro!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.570
They have the girl with them,

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:16.040
so they shouldn't be able to just move 
around or jump off this train easily.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.560
That's going to give us our advantage.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.260
We'll slaughter them all before 
we get to Rome and take the girl!

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.580
The key wasn't made to fit in a keyhole.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.690
It actually fit right into this turtle's shell.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.780
That, in turn, somehow
activated the turtle's ability,

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.560
creating this space and making the key itself 
the entrance so that we could hide inside.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.890
Th-The turtle is a Stand user?

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.560
O-Ow!

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.790
Wh-Where the hell am I?

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.300
I'm under the seat?

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.630
Ow!

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.030
B-But man, this is awesome!

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.300
This turtle is like some kind of spaceship!

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.200
But this room isn't some kind of illusion.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.960
This is a real room.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.100
Even the sofa and other furniture is real.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.190
There are some chilled drinks in here.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.900
I guess the boss left them in there for us.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:23.130
Turtles like being in the shade, they aren't 
loud, and they don't scuttle about.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.840
This way, we should be able to get 
to Venice by train without worry.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.130
I guess there's no way someone 
would be in the locker...

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.300
I just don't have my bro's intuition.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.390
B-Bro!

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.270
D-Don't tell me he...

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.580
The Thankful Death!

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.780
A-Are you really going to do it?

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.250
You're going to do in all of the passengers?!

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.860
We don't even know if they're on this train!

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.450
I already told you

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.560
that I would be thorough about this!

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.380
They're definitely here.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.030
What's the big deal, anyway?

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.250
Every year, there are lots of 
train crashes all over the world.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.960
This won't be as brutal as those.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.020
Mr. President

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.020
Coco Large

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.480
It's probably because we're 
in a room inside a turtle,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.010
but it's sorta muggy in here.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.310
You want a drink, too, Narancia?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.400
There are only cold drinks, 
but there's cola, mineral water,

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.840
carbonated, non-carbonated, apple juice, 
orange juice, and pineapple juice.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.100
Hey, are you even listening?

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.930
Huh? What was that?!

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.270
I'm asking if you want something to drink!

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.880
Why don't you get some rest while you're at it?

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.730
You look pretty tired.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.980
I'll keep an eye on the ceiling.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.890
Oh, okay!

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:30.320
My shoulders suddenly feel stiff, 
and my back hurts. There we go...

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.410
I'd really like something warm...

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.330
Something that won't upset my stomach.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.860
I told you, there are 
only cold drinks in here!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.460
You never listen, do you?!

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.040
I'll just eat this banana, then.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.050
Man, gardens like these make me sigh.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.980
They're so calming...

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.890
They're so beautiful...

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.640
I'd love to drown in nostalgia and 
think back on when I was a kid

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.350
while I just lay out in the 
sun in a garden like this.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.920
Hey, stop that!

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.300
Licking your finger before 
you turn the page is gross!

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.450
Huh? Did I do that?

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.020
Me? No way!

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.570
Hey, there's something 
hanging from your mouth.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.300
Talk about gross. What the hell is that?

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.240
Hey!

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:36.320
A tooth?

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:42.770
I can't eat this banana for some reason...

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.570
It's all hard and dry...

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.020
Hey... Are you messing with us?

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:56.150
Man, you startled me... 
That sort of looks like a tooth.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.290
I'm still pretty grossed out, 
so I can't really laugh...

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.630
What is that hanging from your mouth?

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.630
Huh? Did you say something again... Mista?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.010
You're speaking too softly...

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.180
I couldn't hear you very well...

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:20.270
I'm telling you, this banana is crumbling...

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.630
I-I can't eat it...

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.480
Th-They're all dry...

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.570
A-All the fruits are dry...

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.910
Wh-What the hell is wrong with you?!

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.720 line:20%
Didn't you hear me? Okay, then...

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.240
There's something wrong with your face!

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.470
N-Narancia, you...

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.680 line:20%
I'll say it even louder this time!

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:46.490
Are you paying attention?! 
I can't eat this banana!

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.600
Look. It's just crumbling...

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.800
It's old, damn it...

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.590
Bucciarati!

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.850
I know! It's a Stand attack!

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.420
Th-There must be an enemy on this train!

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.520
Huh? What? What's this white stuff?

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.730
It came from my head...

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.520
What the hell is this?!

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.650
What's the matter?

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.200
Did something... happen?

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.160
Th-They've all aged!

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.710
Mama... Wake up... Wake up...

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.780
Mama... Mama...

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.960
Wake up...

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:45.060
Wh-Who the hell is th-this?

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.610
What? No way... This can't be!

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.070
This is me?!

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.030
What the hell's going on?

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.830
A-A Stand that makes people age?

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.000
Did they figure out we're in this turtle?!

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.380
Calm down, Mista.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:07.500
If they knew we were inside this turtle, 
they would've used a more direct attack.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.630
And since they haven't, 
that means we haven't been found yet.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.930
The enemy probably only knows that 
we're somewhere on this train

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.000
and, in order to find her,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.840
they're attacking everyone 
on the train indiscriminately!

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:29.310
D-Does that mean this train is running 
with everyone on board affected?

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.080
Probably.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.330
They're desperate. 
I'm sure they'll do anything...

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.160
And without a second thought.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.810
This leaves us two choices.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.200
One, take Trish and somehow 
get off this train.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:47.710
Two, we find this enemy, even though we 
don't know their range, and dispose of them.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.380
Obviously, we'll go with the second choice.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.880
If we want to take her and run,
we'll have to stop the train.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.010
It's too dangerous.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.770
Assassinating them is more definitive,

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.100
with my Six Bullets!

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.570
Yes, you're right.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.310
But we don't have any time.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.360
We're aging at an alarming rate...

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.800
B-Bucciarati...

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.570
M-My hands...

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.670
Th-They're crumbling!

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.620
They're falling apart!

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.170
You're right, Bucciarati. 
We really don't have any time!

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.500
Wait a minute, Mista...

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.880
It's too early... to go...

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.500
What the hell are you talking about, Giorno?

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.890
I'm telling you... it's too early to go...

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.000
We don't have any time to waste!

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.680
Wait.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.750
Hear him out.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.520
What are you trying to say, Giorno?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.400
Why are we all aging at a 
different rate than Bucciarati?

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.450
Mista's and my symptoms are light...

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.160
Trish's are even less!

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.430
But why?

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.120
Apparently, we're just aging at 
different rates! I'm going!

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.150
No... If they're attacking everyone 
indiscriminately with age...

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.750
They might end up killing her as well, 
despite her being the target.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.370
There's some kind of prerequisite 
to how fast we're aging.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.880
I'll tell you what I think...

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.870
I think the enemy is differentiating between

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.270
men and women by the difference 
in their body temperature.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:34.150
I read somewhere that women have more 
fat in their bodies, which makes them

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.650
less susceptible to temperature fluctuations.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:42.160
Apparently women also age better 
and live longer than men.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.330
Don't you think it's been a little hot?

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.740
The enemy is differentiating 
the aging speed based on

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.370
slight differences in body temperature.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.170
All that matters is that the men 
age faster and she ages slower.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.910
Yeah, that sounds about right,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.060
but then why are you and I 
aging at different rates?

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.800
Are you insinuating that I'm a girl?!

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.170
Change in body temperature...

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.320
Come to think of it, 
our bodies were slightly cooler...

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.600
Because we had something cold to drink.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.860
Narancia didn't have anything to drink.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.630
Th-That's...

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.650
Giorno, it's exactly like you said!

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.500
We're aging slower because our 
bodies were slightly cooler!

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.870
Cool everyone down! 
Cool everyone down with ice!

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.340
Hold it, Mista!

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.830
You're going to have to 
take that ice with you!

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.250
Th-This is all that's left?

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.540
It doesn't change the fact that 
we have to dispose of this enemy.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.720
Mista, you're going to take 
that ice and defeat the enemy...

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.350
Before the ice melts and 
you lose your Stand power!

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:00.320
Just the driver... It doesn't look 
like anyone else is in here.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.070
It's so muggy...

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:11.280
This Stand really is 
attacking indiscriminately.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.750
I wonder if this turtle is aging, too...

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.550
But they say that turtles 
live for 10,000 years.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.490
Guess they live longer than us.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.780
Damn it...

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.760
What's Bro thinking? This is so dangerous.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.480
What's he gonna do if I 
get old, too? Damn it...

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.640
The air conditioner?

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.800
If I turn it on inside the driver's cab, 
everyone in the turtle will cool down,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.650
and that might slow down their aging!

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.000
There it is!

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.450
Something took the bait!

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.810
Wh-What the hell is this needle-like thing?!

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.420
A d-different Stand than 
the one that's aging us?

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.380
There's another one? There are two of them?

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.490
There are two enemies?!

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.790
