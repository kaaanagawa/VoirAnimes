00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.120
Sanctuary!

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.070
Take this! I'm out of time!

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.780
As I thought... There's no mold growing on you,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.240
even though you fell.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.880
Cioccolata's Green Tea will 
kill any living creature.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.290
What the hell's going on with your body?

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.040
I mean, I guess I'll just have to pulverize

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.210
every last inch of your body 
until you can't move anymore...

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.680
w-w-with my Sanctuary!

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.270
I don't think Ill be able 
to defeat him quickly.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.260
In that case... I'll lead him away

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.900
from here.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.970
Episodio 31 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 3

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.350
This should be far enough to 
lose that underground guy...

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.340
There are accidents everywhere!

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.080
What's going on?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.500
Look! Someone's unconscious 
over there, too!

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.020 line:20%
Hurry up and save them!

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.900
An ambulance!

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.420
Over here!

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.870 line:20%
Under the stairs!

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.050
Wh-What's...

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.350
Wh-What happened to the mold?!

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.310
C-Cioccolata?!

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.080
The mold disappeared.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.250
Giorno, Mista...

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.880
They must've taken care of 
the guy in the helicopter.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.020
Secco, it's me. 
Did you take care of Bucciarati?

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.480
Something rather unexpected 
has happened on my end.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.850
I'm about to take care of Giorno and Mista,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.200
but I've taken a bit of a blow to the head.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.240
So there's something I want 
to tell you now, just in case.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.170
Listen carefully, Secco.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.030
Their destination is the Colosseum.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.050
I found that out from the 
Bullets' conversation.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.450
Apparently, someone's 
waiting for them there,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.860
and this mysterious figure 
knows how to defeat the boss.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.640
That's why Giorno and the others 
are trying to get to them,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.470
and why the boss is trying to 
stop that from happening.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.620
Listen carefully. Figure out this 
mystery before anyone else.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.840
You're the only one I can count on.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.190
What's with him?

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.030
Wait, that phone call... Was it...

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.240
Cioccolata, you piece of shit!

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.330
Did you actually think 
I'd feel sad over you?

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.280
You loser!

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.950
You're super smart,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.890
you'd throw me sugar cubes and play with me,

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.160
and you have a lot of money.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.010
On top of that, you're super 
strong... Or so I thought.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.500
That's why I thought I'd be 
safe if I listened to you.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.600
But apparently, you're weak after all!

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.820
I mean, you lost!

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.740
I don't like you anymore, you scum!

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.970
I hate your guts!

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.320
He knows!

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.440
He knows that we're trying 
to get to the Colosseum!

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.170
He intends to figure out the secret!

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.250
I won't let you go!

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.400
Half...?

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.260
Take this! Zipper Man!

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.630
What?!

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.610
By the way, doesn't "Colosseum"

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.570
sound kinda like "kill them" 
(koroseyo) in Japanese?

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.650
Don't you think so, Mr. Language Teacher?

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.400
I thought I'd ask before I killed you.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.740
Up until now,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.410
I thought we'd be out of danger as long as 
we stopped the man in the helicopter.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.830
But things are still getting worse...

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.800
The actual threat is this guy who 
can move freely underground!

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.630
If I let him get to the Colosseum 
before we get there...

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.690
He's going to go on a rampage!

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.370
You're... a bit annoying... Bucciarati.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.020
You already know... don't you?

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.860
At close range, I'm faster 
and stronger than you!

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.020
You're a nuisance! 
I'll take care of you here and now!

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.830
You sure know how to think fast.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.140
You got away again...

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.740
Just barely, though.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.650
But your body really is weird.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.140
What the hell is the deal with you?!

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.300
You have glass shards stuck in you, 
but you aren't bleeding much at all.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.110
Did you... see that just now, too?

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.180
Hey... What do you think that is?

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.300
It came from the second 
level of arches, right?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.160
There was something shining.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.570
It happened earlier, too.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.310
Hey, something just hid in the shadows.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.420
Was that...

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.710
I saw it... I saw a glimpse of it!

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.740
The light was reflecting! Someone was 
looking over here with binoculars!

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.550
The guy you're going to go 
see is definitely there!

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.030
He was in a wheelchair, wasn't he?

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.200
I think I saw some prosthetics, too!

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.710
Is he disabled?

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.840
I'm going to find out this secret!

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.770
No matter what the deal with your body is!

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.320
I'm going to end you, Bucciarati!

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.090
Are you mocking me? You went into 
the ground with your zipper?

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.530
Are you copying me?!

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.280
Do you think you stand 
a chance against me

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.790
by going underground?!

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.370
Take this! Sanctua—

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.890
He's not hiding. He's moving.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.100
These vibrations...

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.140
He's moving in some direction...

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.220
Y-Y-You copycat!

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.100
Who the hell do you think I am?!

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.640
You and your piss-stained zipper guy!

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.210
H-How dare you steal my technique?!

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.540
But the only thing that 
copying me is going to do

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.700
is ensure that you basically 
just doomed yourself!

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.410
I won't let you get to the Colosseum!

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.470
The surfaces are getting softer...

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.490
So he is pursuing me!

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.900
But this sound...

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.770
This sound that's heading right 
toward me with no hesitation...

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:15.110
They say that sound reverberates 
better in liquids than in solids.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.730
It's just like being under water.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.560
Does that mean he can hear 
when I'm moving, too?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.870
You got way further than I thought,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.460
but you can't run from me anymore!

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.680
I can tell... I can even tell 
how far you are from me!

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.870
He's 20 meters ahead and to my left.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.940
He moved to the right. Just 10 more meters.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.800
Just seven more meters...

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.550
Five meters...

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.640
I'm not going to strangle you. 
I'll bury you alive.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.140
You can die in this grave you
dug for yourself, Bucciarati!

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.200
You think you can escape my punches

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.950
when you're surrounded by walls of dirt?

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.950
Just two more meters!

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.430
A water pipe?

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.570
You cut it to try and trick me?

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.230
Seriously?

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.640
The fact that you're trying 
these stupid little tricks

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.560
proves that you're feeling cornered!

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.250
You basically just admitted that you'd lose,

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.470
even with your abilities, when you 
have to face off with my Sanctuary!

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.930
I don't know where you are, but I do know 
that you're within 20 meters of me.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.690
You're staying as still as possible 
so I won't be able to find you.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.210
Or what?

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.670
Are you trying to come up 
with some kind of strategy?

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.520
I mean, you are pretty quick-witted.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.890
But...

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.840
I'll make you lose your upper hand...

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.120
You and your quick wit...

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.660
That's a different sound than before.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.210
What is this sound?

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.150
I'm hearing it from all directions.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.310
The stone pavement inside the ground...

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:30.340
turns to mud because my 
Sanctuary touches it.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.380
But the moment it moves 
away from my body,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.960
it hardens again.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.100
Say, Bucciarati...

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.710
There might actually be a chance.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.710
If you stay perfectly still, 
you just might make it...

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.530
I mean, there's that miraculous story

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.890
about the death row inmate 
who survived three hangings

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.270
because of the rope breaking 
or the gallows malfunctioning!

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.550
It's no use... I can't stay 
underground any longer!

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.370
But it's not like I can run 
along the surface, either!

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.670
I was prepared for this, 
but if he doesn't make it here,

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.090
I'm going to have to destroy the arrow.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.710
Our only hope... is for them 
to encounter this arrow.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:37.060
The only ones who can surpass Emperor 
Crimson, who has the ability to control time,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.570
are those who know the true 
power behind the arrow.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.160
And the one capable of that is not me.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.610
It's them.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.300
Twelve years ago, I acquired this 
arrow after fleeing Egypt.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.340
And the fear that this arrow brings

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.250 line:20%
will never end until they come.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.250
J.P. Polnareff
(36 years old, French)

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.970
The Colosseum in Rome
"Rome will exist as long as the Colosseum does;
when the Colosseum falls, so will Rome;
when Rome falls, so will the world. (A quote from a
certain medieval monk who saw the Colosseum)

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.380
This brief history... is rather ironic.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.990
They joined a gang because 
society had cast them out,

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.240
yet they're the ones trying to stop this 
world from falling into the hands of evil.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.770
But in the end...

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.520
Will Bucciarati actually 
be able to make it here?

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.200
There's no point if he doesn't 
come out the victor.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.150
If he fails, I'll have to destroy 
this arrow and its secret.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:42.700
All I can do is wait for them to arrive.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.530
Everything begins after that.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.670
I've been waiting all this time...

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.580
just protecting this arrow's true power.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.020
I-It's no use! I've reached my limit!

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.490
He moved! He couldn't take 
it anymore and moved!

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.610
Twelve meters to the right. Bucciarati...

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.520
He's planning to hide beneath the Colosseum

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.410
so he can evade the barrage 
of stone spears!

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.360
That's not gonna happen!

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.460
H-He's coming!

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.430
I can hear very clearly that 
he's catching up to me.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.800
I can feel the reverberations! 
He's ten meters straight ahead!

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.760
Eight meters...

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.400
He's moving faster than me!

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.010
Zipper Man!

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.090
You know...

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.480
I knew he had something up his sleeve...

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.850
Bucciarati, is this the best you 
could do in your desperation?

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.350
Though you are the only one who was able

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.190
to hide from my Sanctuary for even a second.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.820
But now you're finished! I'm closer 
than before. I'll find you soon.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.370
The longer you hide,

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.030
the closer you come to your defeat!

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.190
Wh-What...

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.300
M-My skin...

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.360
Don't tell me...

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.680
Even the stone pavement 
is turning into mud!

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.680
It stands to reason that your body

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.670
will start turning into mud the 
closer I get to you underground.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.620
I heard you! You're right there!

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.770
Now I've got you for sure. I can tell.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.990
I'm 1.5 meters away from you.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.910
So you've already made it to the Colosseum...

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.050
You were so close.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.780
Take this! The secret will be mine!

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.040
Zipper Man!

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.610
To be honest, I don't really 
know why, either...

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.230
But even after breaking some 
bones, I barely feel any pain.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.960
My heart has stopped, so I don't 
bleed very much, either.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.430
The damage to my body is minimized.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.130
That's why I was waiting for this...

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.310
I'm sure my eardrums can handle the 
damage they're about to endure, too.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.350
I was waiting...

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.370
for you to drag anything and 
everything into the ground.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.040
Street lamps, street signs, parked cars...

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.880
And the tires on those cars.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.370
Whoops. I guess you can't hear me anymore.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:21.250
You bastard... N-Now you've done it...

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.650
But... This isn't a big deal.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.090
I can still hear!

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:31.570
I could hear that tire popping! 
I know where you are!

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.060
You're right there, Bucciarati!

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.760
M-My leg! Wh-Where am...

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.560
Wh-Why? Wh-Where is he?!

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.470
What did he do to me?!

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.890
How did I mistake a car for him?!

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.110
Your eardrums have been destroyed.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.900
Your Stand that allows you to travel 
through the ground...Sanctuary, was it?

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.170
Now that your ability's lost 
its radar, your ears,

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.110
it's completely useless.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.110 line:20%
I figured it out, you bastard!

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.470
You're planning to destroy 
my eardrums, aren't you?!

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.320
You think I can't travel through the ground 
if my ears are destroyed, don't you?!

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.550
What a stupid idea!

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.450
Stay back!

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.180
Stay the hell away from me!

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.280
I won't take your life.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.810
But now that you know about the man 
waiting for us at the Colosseum,

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.340
I can't let you go, either.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.680
I need you to stay put for a while.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:41.680
You bastard!

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.190
You're trying to put me out 
of commission, aren't you?!

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.890
Stay the hell away from me!

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.950
Just stop talking now. 
This conversation isn't even coherent.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.690
S-Stay away!

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.400
Score!

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.540
Th-The moment you attack me, 
I'm gonna turn this kid into mud!

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.830
Then I'll throw him at you and run!

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.540
You don't wanna kill a kid, 
do you, dumbass?!

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.650
Change of plans! For a while, I was 
thinking about defeating the boss,

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.740
but I'll settle for just reporting this

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.970
to the organization and getting 
a reward from the boss!

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:29.920
It's easier for me to just 
work for the organization.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.770
Hey, brat! Get me a taxi.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.280
Raise your hand and flag 
down a taxi for me!

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.750
You're going to get one for me!

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.830
Hey! Are you listening to me?!

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.280
You stupid brat!

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.250
Hurry up... and get me... a taxi!

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:59.500
Bucciarati! Why the hell are 
you moving toward me?!

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.760
Can't you hear me?!

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.640
Your maximum range is two meters.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.230
I'm very aware of that!

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.680
You're probably thinking I can't 
get away because I hurt my leg!

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.990
Don't underestimate me! I'll kill this brat!

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.870
You couldn't reach me! 
I'm out of your range!

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.760
You stupid piece of shit!

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.920
You just grazed my ha— 
Wh-What the hell?!

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.420
A zipper! Shit, my throat!

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.520
I didn't need to even bother predicting it,

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.140
but in the prediction I saw,

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.650
there was no way that Bucciarati 
would sacrifice a kid like me.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.530
Shit! I need to undo this somehow!

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.740

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.010 line:20%
Ah, Cioccolata!

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.630
Cioccolata!

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:12.060
I came here after tracing the 
signal from Secco's cellphone.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.140
But what's happening seems to be 
different from the boss's orders.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.180
To think that Secco had already lost...

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.860
Since they're a pair, that probably 
means Cioccolata is also...

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.250
It also appears that 
Bucciarati is here alone.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.190
Where are Giorno Giovanna and Narancia?

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.370
Wh-What? My body suddenly... 
All my strength is...

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.580
It can't be... My eyes are blurring, too...

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.120
Am I finally out of time?

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.540
I knew this moment would come...

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.500
But now?
