WEBVTT

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.890
That's... Giorno's brooch?

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.500
C-Could that brooch be...

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.730
forming his left hand?

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.130
Giorno's not out of the game yet!

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.280
If I can protect that left hand,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.380
Narancia and Mista's wounds 
can also be healed!

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.040
B-But how am I going to do that?!

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.720
Episodio 25 Spicy Lady

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.720
B-But if I scream

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.730
or move faster than that 
brooch, I'll be killed first.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.360
It's unfortunate for Giorno and the 
others, but I can't do anything...

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.320
And I'll also be the one 
attacked after the brooch.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.660
I have to hide.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.660
I have to use this opportunity 
to hide in the closet...

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.380
This is...

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.120
the switch to make the seat recline.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.090
If I push it, the seat will lean back.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.300
That thing will probably attack 
this seat before the brooch.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.420
Th-Then I can grab the brooch 
and head into the cockpit...

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.780
B-But I can't!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.700
I can't make a wager like that!

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.740
It's far too dangerous.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.240
I need to just hide in the closet...

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.820
What's wrong with me?!

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.280
Do I even realize what I'm doing?!

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.600
Unbelievable.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.290
I didn't want to take the risk, 
but I still pushed the button!

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.760
Now I just have to do it.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.630
The path to the cockpit is wide open!

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.510
Move...

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.210
slowly...

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.590
Just like the tai chi that 
the Chinese practice...

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.890
It's only about two meters to the brooch.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.950
I can't rush.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.670
If I rush, I'll die!

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.210
It's heading back this way!

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.690
Because it finished destroying the 
seat... and it stopped reclining...

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.610
But there are more seats to recline.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.210
Why did it... grab on to 
my leg and not the seat?

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.820
L-Liquid?

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.850
It reacted to the speed of 
these liquid drops falling?

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.180
B-But why are my boots wet?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.160
All I did was push the reclining switch!

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.100
How did my boots get wet?

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.610
I knew it. I should've left the ladybug alone.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.940
I should've just stayed out of this!

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.950
S-Save me, Bucciarati!

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.700
M-My boot just fell over next to my foot.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.090
It's like it went through my foot...

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.350
Wait, what?

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.770
What just happened?

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.100
Now, pick up that brooch, Trish.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.190
Wh-Who's there?

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.000
Is someone there?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.540
I've always been here,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.790
ever since you were little.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.740
I've always been by your side.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.330
Trish, please pick up that brooch.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.480
That's the decision you've made.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.540
You've already made up your mind 
to protect Giorno's left hand.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.260
Hesitation leads to weakness.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.930
And... please, give me orders.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.760
Wh-Who are you?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.560
I am you.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.850
I'm also the one who got the 
thing off of your boot just now.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.770
I am your ability.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.190
Now, if you've made your 
decision, please pick it up.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.400
You and I are going to protect

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.420
Giorno's left hand!

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.240
Trish, if we're able to protect it,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.170
we'll open up a new future 
for Giorno and everyone else.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.370
And your future, as well.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.580
What's going on?!

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.960
Pick it up, Trish!

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.450
I'm finished!

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.930
How the heck am I supposed 
to protect this thing?!

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.600
This is your ability.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.510
I made the seat softer.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.340
Wh-What just...

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.910
Made it softer?

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.370
I literally slipped right through the seat.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.340
And it somehow damaged that thing.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.920
The fleshy part of that thing ripped.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.700
That thing managed to stop Mista's 
bullets and catch up to this plane.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.940
It has the ability to destroy 
things that are fast.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.770
But if it hits things that aren't 
moving, it takes damage.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.860
Are you... me?

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.220
Was I the one who just did this?

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.080
The thing with the boot, too. Was that—

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.110
What's important right now, Trish,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.070
is that you picked up the brooch.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.990
Your strong determination 
overpowered any hesitation.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.460
You are becoming stronger, 
both mentally and as a person.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.420
And you are able to make anything 
in this world softer, more elastic.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.800
Making things softer...

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.320
means they become harder 
to break than diamonds!

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.890
I-It's coming again!

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.030
This time, stay still.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.650
I'm starting to understand that 
you're me, but I have to hide!

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.610
Make the closet door soft!

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.840
Please make it in time!

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.520
Damn it! Stay the hell away 
until I close this door!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.620
I-It managed to find me on the other side 
of the door, even though I'm hiding!

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.990
I-I'm done for!

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.010
I'm starting to understand that I'm a 
Stand user and have Stand abilities...

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.000
B-But...

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.340
This thing's invincible!

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.850
The user is already dead, too. 
No one can defeat this thing!

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.520
Trish, I asked you not to move.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.440
We have to head to the cockpit, 
where Bucciarati is,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.570
but we went in the opposite direction.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.090
What are you talking about?

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.880
Giorno's brooch is developing 
into his left hand and moving.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.500
I had to run away!

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.670
But your ability...

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.410
All it does is make things softer!

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.750
It's taking all I have 
to evade these attacks!

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.090
I-It's going to get me!

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.180
I-It attacked the clock again?

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.640
What?

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.590
I made the clock more elastic.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.660
As long as you don't move faster than 
the second hand on that clock,

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.940
it'll continue to respond to the second hand

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.240
and give priority to attacking 
the clock over and over.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.460
When I said not to move, 
I just meant to move slowly.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.060
Move slowly.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.950
Slower than the second hand.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.760
At super slow speed...

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.730
But with the strength of a vise.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.810
We're going to rip this thing apart...

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.720
and kill it.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.710
You bastard! Just go to hell already!

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:58.970
You piece of shit! Quit latching 
on to this world, damn it!

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.870
It's falling apart into tiny 
pieces and disintegrating!

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.110
This Stand that just kept pursuing 
its targets, like a vengeful spirit,

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.620
is becoming so small and disappearing...

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.100
Y-Your name...

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.850
Do you have a name?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.850
What should I call you?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.560
Spicy Lady.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.400
I see...

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.630
That's a fitting name.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.070
Trish Una

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.070
Spicy Lady

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.120
Now Mista and Narancia's 
wounds can be healed.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.710
But Giorno Giovanna... 
He is a strange person.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.760
Not only is he able to give things life,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.860
but his actions also helped you mature.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.380
I'm going to go make sure 
the engines are okay.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.810
Bucciarati, I have some news to break to you...

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.050
The problem has already been solved. 
Giorno has actually already...

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.970
Don't say another word!

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.690
I-I mean... Slowly...

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.220
Come here slowly, Trish.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.900
Our altitude is 7,000 meters!

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.010
6,800...

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.860
6,600!

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.750
It's no use. It just keeps falling!

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.320
And I don't know why!

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.790
I figured out why we're falling, Abbacchio.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.430
But what are we supposed to do?

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.290
What are we supposed to do about this?

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.300
Bucciarati, what are you—

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.010
I told you not to move!

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.090
D-Don't tell me...

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.060
Th-Th-That's... But that's impossible!

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.400
Giorno said that thing has 
the ability to catch up

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.620
to things that move and take them in.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.770
The engines on this plane... 
Just now, that thing...

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.810
Trish, don't turn around.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.070
Don't panic, no matter what.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.750
Slowly walk this way.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.360
Th-That's...

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.170
No! Th-That's impossible!

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.920
It's no use! We just keep falling!

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.100
At this rate, we're going to crash!

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.310
Actually, the engines are 
likely to explode before that!

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.680
Th-That thing should've been torn 
into pieces and disintegrated...

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.930
W-Wait, the engines are 
right behind the closet.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.320
Oh, no...

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.070
If even a tiny part of this thing 
melded into the wall of the closet...

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.980
There's a possibility that it 
took in the engine's energy.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.330
And now...

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.560
We need to make an emergency 
landing, Abbacchio.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.510
The Tyrrhenian Sea is in front of us.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.360
We need to make an emergency 
landing on the water.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.680
It's the only choice we have!

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.300
An emergency landing?

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.150
Even if we're able to land safely, 
what are we supposed to do after that?

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.280
This thing will still come after us!

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.930
It's invincible. It's too powerful.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.470
It's an invincible ability!

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.530
Now, slowly, Trish...

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.280
Slowly, like a slug. Don't panic.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.430
Don't run, whatever you do!

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.290
If you rush, it'll attack you!

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.800
Wh-What the?!

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.040
What are you doing?! 
It's going to catch up to you!

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.040
Yes, it certainly will!

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.160
If I do something as lame as moving slow, 
it's going to catch up to me anyway!

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.930
Get in the cockpit, Bucciarati!

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.880
Have you lost your mind, Trish?!

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.680
It's going to destroy the door!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.470
Th-The door...

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:36.550
Th-This is...

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.350
What the... Don't tell me you...

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.380
An emergency landing?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.420
Bucciarati, we need to do the opposite.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.840
If we all want to survive 
and get to Sardinia safely,

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.860
we need to... destroy this plane!

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.990
Wannabe!

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.840
Spicy Lady!

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.340
T-Trish... This is... 
When did you obtain Stand abilities?

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.550
Th-The walls and glass 
are all soft like rubber.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.820
If that thing is going to 
prioritize speed in its attacks,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.020
then crashing would be faster.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.160
A plane crashing is way faster

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.980
than this parachute!

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.530
Yes! You stupid bastard!

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.080
We took pretty severe damage,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.400
but now that the plane has crashed 
into the waters near Sardinia,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.570
that means the boss's men can't 
confirm whether we're dead or alive.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.960
Right?

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.090
The organization's lost track of us.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.310
That means we've got some time now.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:06.510
Time to track down the boss's 
true identity and find him!

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.630
No, Abbacchio.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:15.240
It appears that our damage is going to 
grow just a bit... just a little bit more.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.300
I'll get rid of that thing.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.950
I have to use my zipper.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.960
Wh-What?!

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.130
Don't tell me...

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.250
It's completely invincible.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.840
There's no way to kill this thing.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.510
We can only chase it out with 
speed, just like Giorno did.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.500
B-Bucciarati, you can't mean... D-Don't do it!

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.420
You're going to wrap that 
thing onto your arm?!

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.940
Don't! Are you going to take 
yourself out of this, too?!

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.510
No, Abbacchio.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.240
No one else is going to get hurt.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.180
Giorno's Golden Wind ability

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.370
is safe right here.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.500
Wh-When did you...

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.690 line:20%
Arrivederci.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.880
"Goodbye."

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.700
Stand name: Notorious Chase.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.550
Complete annihilation: impossible.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:39.450
Forced to track the crashing 
waves of the sea forever.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:46.590
At times, it attacks ships that happen to 
move faster than the waves and sinks them.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:52.220
Eventually, these waters would be known 
to local fishermen as the "Tyrrhenian Belly"

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.920
and considered ominous.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.640
Now, let's lay low and find 
out who the boss really is.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.600
We're going to track down my father's past!

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:15.680
The private jet hijacked from 
the Marco Polo International Airport

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.630
crash-landed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, 
fifty kilometers northeast of Sardinia.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.360
This mystery has yet to be solved.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.480
No passengers were found on board.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.190
I thought I'd made it disappear,

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.380
but one's past wraps itself around 
one's true peace, never letting go.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.610
Unbelievable. This is why blood 
relations are so troublesome.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.200
It wouldn't be concerning 
if it involved a stranger,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.660
but once blood relations are 
involved, things become tricky.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.870
But that's all it is.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.360
It's just a blood relation. 
If I can get rid of that,

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.520
I'll be able to remain 
in the prime of my life.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.500
Several days ago, 
after Pericolo secured Trish,

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.680
the traitors who were after her scoured this 
apartment that Trish and her mother lived in,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.630
but none of them noticed.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.490
Every morning of her life,
Trish awoke in this house...

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.280
And...

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:49.750
Every day, she looked at this picture 
that her mother had lovingly put up.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.690
But this date... There's no doubt about it.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.320
It's fifteen years ago.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.470
This portrait... Even I almost missed it.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.430
To think that such a thing existed...

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.420
Their plane crashed... but they're alive.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.140
I can feel it...

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.860
My daughter's Stand abilities have awakened.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:20.570
I can also tell that she's alive 
and heading to Sardinia.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:25.400
And if it was Abbacchio's Moody 
Jazz that was flying the plane,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.540
that means he's also alive, at the very least.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.540
I can't let Moody Jazz go 
to the spot in this picture.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.910
Trish might not realize it right now, 
but she'll surely remember

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.130
the existence of this picture.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.390
And if she goes to Sardinia, she'll figure out

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:54.030
that the person who took this portrait 
of her mother when she was young

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.810
was me!

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.650
I can't let Moody Jazz's ability replay that!

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.870
I'll have to go there myself.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.550
I have to do it myself.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.330
I can't let any of my subordinates 
attempt to handle this.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.340
Oh, y-you were home.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.800
I knocked, but... 
I'm here to clean your room.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.510
P-Pardon me, I'll come back later...

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:31.970
Huh?

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.470
Huh?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.790
Why was I here again?

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.190
O-Oh, right! To clean! I'm supposed to clean!

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.280
Now, time to get to work.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.390
