00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.400
So there you are... Boss...

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.400
That's where... you were...

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.160
And that's... whose body you're using.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.040
The moment I got tired and could 
feel my soul being sucked out,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.360
you said you had to go because 
things were going south...

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.150
It's true...

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.990
If you're there, Boss...

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.470
We're going to win for sure...

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.790
But...

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.240
I'm so lonely...

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.300
Could you... call me again...

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.820
like you always have?

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.250
Boss...

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.060
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.480
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.530
Eternal greatness exists only within myself.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.110
Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.480
Episodio 36 Diavolo Surfaces

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.330 line:20%
Mista! Hurry up and pierce 
your Stand with this arrow!

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.360
What's going on? 
Requiem's suddenly heading toward us.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.200
Giorno! Stop Requiem!

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.660
I can't! It's too far away!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.070
<c.colorf0cc62>Crack</c>

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.090
Wha—

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.170
My gun...

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.720
What are you doing, Mista?!

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.130
It's because you're touching the arrow!

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.750
No way! Why is this...

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.380
Let go of it, Mr. Polnareff!

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.260
Let go of the arrow!

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.750
Glad I took that cop's Beretta just in case.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.160
But what the hell, Bullets?

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.770
Why'd my revolver break all of a sudden?

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.300
M-Maybe the boss got close?

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.770
You dumbass! Think before 
you talk, Number Five!

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.580
Are you saying you saw someone coming 
close to us in this big, open space?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.000
We didn't see anyone at the 
moment the revolver broke.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.590
It's metal fatigue.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.400
It's because he's been overusing the gun.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.490
The axis of the cylinder broke.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.590
We haven't had a chance to do
any maintenance or inspections!

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.420
H-Hey!

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.280
What the hell is this thing's problem? 
It's heading toward m-me!

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.840
No, Mista. It's heading towards me.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.860
Even though it has the arrow back...

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.960
Golden Wind!

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.990
<c.colorc2bb4c>Batoom</c>

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.000
Requiem intends to finish me 
because I touched the arrow.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.870
Mista, run!

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.040
Reload, Bullets! Reload the gun!

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.540
This isn't a revolver! 
We need another cartridge!

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.550
It'll take time to reload it!

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.190
I-It's no use...

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.680
I'm finished...

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.730
I'm throwing it! Catch it, Giorno!

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.320
I'm gonna throw the turtle to you!

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.320
Mr. Polnareff!

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.300
You okay, Mr. Polnareff?

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.590
He's okay. B-But... how?

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.640
Mista, do you remember what 
I said back at the Colosseum?

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.050
There's still more to Requiem's 
ability that I'm not aware of.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.310
But I'm starting to understand.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.760
Requiem stopped because 
the starting time has come.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.450
The starting time?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.600
Yes.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.260
It's because

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.630
my body has started to change!

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.040
That's why it stopped trying to kill me!

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.050
This is Requiem's true motive, 
now that it's gone berserk.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.230
The ability to make beings swap souls,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.010
meaning the ability that makes them 
start to change into something else.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.740
The prelude is over, and the actual 
piece is now starting to play,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.400
so it gave up on killing me.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.040
The 4.5-billion-year history of this 
world's creatures is starting to change

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.280
into something else within a matter of hours.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.360
All of it!

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.930
I see...

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.010
So that's what makes Requiem 
so truly frightening.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.820
However...

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.380
Thanks to them, I was able to see it.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.290
I'm starting to understand the answer.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.760
I'm close to figuring out how to 
get that arrow from Requiem!

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.670
I'm realizing the method!

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.550
Wh-What the hell is going on?

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.020
What's up with this ability?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.350
How far has this damn thing spread?

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.780
It doesn't look like they're 
dying or in pain...

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.230
Everyone just has these vacant stares.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.100
But there is this fear of 
becoming something else.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.320
The fear that, slowly but surely, both my 
body and my soul are going to disappear.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.200
Trish!

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.340
I-I'm fine. But...

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.220
The starting time is imminent.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.640
It will happen differently for 
each of us, but it'll start soon,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.870
for all of us.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.130
We don't have much time left...

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.830
That's what you're saying?

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.050
Polnareff! This is happening 
because you brought the arrow!

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.610
You said it had the power to defeat the boss,

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.460
but instead, you basically ended us!

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.900
Stop! This is far beyond 
anyone's expectations.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.970
It's more important that we 
find a way to defeat Requiem.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.720
That's right. Good. Get closer.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.480
Get closer to Requiem!

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:53.750
If we get closer, I'll be able to fully see 
Requiem's secrets, because I'm right here.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.450
The arrow's power will become mine, 
and the world will grovel at my feet!

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.700
After it!

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.410
Good!

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.250
Don't move, Mista!

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.850
Trish, Bucciarati! Both of 
you stay where you are!

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.830
Stay right there!

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.660
Wha—

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.230
I just told you not to move, Mista!

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.600
We can catch up to Requiem in a second!

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.930
What the hell? Shut up, you dumbass!

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.430
My body's disappearing already!

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.260
I picked up your revolver.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.230
The one that you said broke a moment ago.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.790
This broken part doesn't match up 
correctly with the rest of it.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.440
If it just broke due to metal fatigue, 
they should still fit together.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.400
What are you getting at, Giorno?

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.620
Bucciarati, I need you to 
stay right there, too!

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.660
We need to keep a distance from each other!

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.330
You dumbass! Requiem is getting away!

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.170
The Bullets said it was metal 
fatigue, so it's metal fatigue!

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.430
I have a new Beretta, too!

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.260
The parts aren't matching up 
because a piece flew off!

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.850
That could be...

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.340
But it could be something more.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.780
We'll be able to tell as soon 
as we see this lost piece.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.530
Golden Wind.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.610
I gave a part of the gun 
life and let it loose.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.400
Moles are basically blind, but their 
sense of smell is unparalleled.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.280
Looks like it's returned, 
and it found its lost piece.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.690
<c.color5e55b4>Fit</c>

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.210
H-Hey, wait a sec!

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.040
Are you saying someone just used 
immense force to tear the gun apart?

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.100
Listen up! The Bullets and 
I are very clear on this!

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.960
There's no one who got close 
to me in this square—

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.930
You're exactly right. No one did.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.170
That's why we need to stay 
apart from each other,

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.290
because his range is only a few meters!

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.660
Giorno, you...

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.810
No one got close to Narancia 
when he was attacked, either.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.650
No one... other than us.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:58.210
Mr. Polnareff, if your guess is correct 
and the boss had two personalities,

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.080
then he should be able to get in 
and out of another's mind freely.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.090
Diavolo has inhabited one of us.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.760
Wha—

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.280
If he stays hidden, 
Trish can't detect his existence.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.200
The reason he's staying hidden now

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.240
is because he's waiting for us 
to obtain the arrow for good.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.700
That's why he also appeared for a 
brief moment to destroy the gun.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.560
W-Wait a second!

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.130
I know I keep saying this, 
but stay away from me, Mista!

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.100
Stay out of his range!

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.690
My gun was destroyed!

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.860
You're the one closest to the gun.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.070
I-It's...

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.910
It's not me!

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.460
O-Oh, yeah. When Narancia was attacked...

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.610
The one closest to him was...

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.750
Shit. I must do something.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.260
Requiem keeps moving farther away.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.220
This rookie, Giorno Giovanna...

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.270
He's hiding in one of us.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.520
But despite that, we have one advantage.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.030
Diavolo can make Emperor Crimson appear,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.520
but he doesn't have complete control 
of the body he's inhabiting right now.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.200
If he had total control

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.380
of the body he's currently inhabiting, 
he wouldn't just stay quietly hidden.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.430
It's because he can't manifest 
and move around freely

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.660
that we all still live and 
haven't been eliminated.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.370
In a sense, we have him cornered.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.370
It's the turtle!

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.190
It was the closest one to my revolver!

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.410
Polnareff is the one who's possessed!

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.580
That's not possible.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.960
Mr. Polnareff was almost 
killed by Requiem earlier,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.550
because the boss destroyed the revolver.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.020
The boss won't let the body he's 
inhabiting be put in danger.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.330
Plus...

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.040
I only sense one being's life force.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.280
This turtle only has one soul in it.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.510
You can tell that, Giorno?

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:07.240
Only if I can get closer 
and touch their body.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.740
How can you be so certain?

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.360
Life force is a mass.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.460
If I actually touch someone, 
I can tell how many there are.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.420
There's no other way.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.360
I have to touch each one of you and find out.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.130
But how are you going to get closer 
within Emperor Crimson's range?

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.010
I learned how to detect 
Emperor Crimson from Mr. Polnareff.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.940
The moment the droplets suddenly 
increase is when time has skipped!

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.020
Correct.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.560
But whether you can avoid his attack 
or not will be a matter of luck,

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.120
as is whether you'll be able 
to just barely dodge it.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.570
It's definitely not me.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.990
When Narancia was killed, 
I was the farthest away.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.000
Then I'll check you first
so we can be at ease.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.720
Hey!

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.180
Stop right there! Stay away from me!

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.630
D-Don't come any closer!

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.280
If Diavolo is actually in you, 
what's going to happen to me?

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.980
When Narancia died, his body was empty.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.370
My soul was able to travel from 
Narancia's body into my own,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.990
but it was empty.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.520
There's no chance that he's possessing me.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.620
Oh, really?

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.210
That's just what you're saying.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.210
I have no way of confirming your ability.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.310
Not to mention, Giorno,

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.920
do you have a way to definitively 
confirm that you only have one soul?

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.890
You can't check yourself with 
your own ability, can you?

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.510
Mista, we can't go after the 
arrow unless we find out!

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.480
Come any closer and I'll blow your limbs off!

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:01.920
Stop!

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.280
Check me first, Giorno.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.950
Hurry up and do it!

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.370
We're losing more and more time.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.420
Just as you said,

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.920
depending on how we look at the 
situation, we have the boss cornered.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.450
There's no other way.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.880
Yes...

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.000
We have to do this right now.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.410
Someone's going to be attacked...

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.060
If we get closer to one another...

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.230
<c.color5395d4>Slice</c>

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.310
Giorno!

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.290
It's Mista!

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.190
He was the one possessed!

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.440
Spicy Lady—

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.170
No, Trish!

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.130
It's you!

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.510
He got closer instantly by 
moving your body closer to him!

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.500
I've been waiting for this 
moment, my daughter...

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.050
The moment you unleashed your Stand!

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.980
Diagram of swapped souls

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.980
Bucciarati

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.980 position:20%
His body has died
(which means Doppio 
has also died)

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.980 position:20%
Trish            Mista

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.980 position:20%
Diavolo
(Emperor Crimson
had possessed him)

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.980
Giorno

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.980 position:20%
Turtle   Polnareff

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.010
My daughter...

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:32.070
If you hadn't revealed your Stand, 
I might've actually been cornered...

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.990
Zipper Man!

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.290
If I can grab the Stand, 
I can also move the body.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:45.630
Now I can at least make this body run.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.410
We're going to be attacked! 
Brace yourselves!

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.830
He's going to make time leap—

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.610
Wha—

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.970
D-Don't tell me...

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.480
Why's he running without attacking us?

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.720
Through observation, he's already found

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.100
a way to get the arrow away from Requiem!

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.440
There's no time! That takes priority!

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.780
Shoot, Mista!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.780
Don't let him get there 
first, no matter what!

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.320
Stop wasting time!

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.990
This isn't the time to hesitate 
because that's your own body!

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.260
That's not it...

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.730
I've already fired, Bucciarati.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.100
It seems that... I've already fired six shots.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.490
He's running as he makes time leap!

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.880
He predicted the course of the bullets!

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.020
After him! If he gets the 
arrow, we're finished!

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.400
That shadow...

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.740
The reason no one can touch the arrow...

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.040
If I'm correct...

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.670
When I move, Requiem's shadow moves 
in the opposite direction from me,

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.780
despite the location of the sun.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.090
Which means...

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.220
To that man, it should look like the 
shadow is stretching toward me.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:21.110
In Bucciarati's eyes, the shadow is 
stretching in front of Requiem.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.890
Which means...

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.530
This shadow is in different 
places depending on the viewer!

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.650
This is the mystery of Requiem!

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:33.150
This is why it can control everyone's souls!

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.710
This thing is the shadow of one's soul.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.440
Requiem itself is the shadow of my soul!

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.750
That's why attacking it will 
mean attacking yourself!

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.380
If we can get rid of this shadow, 
I can get the arrow!

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.500
And...

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.870
If it has a shadow, then my own 
light should be somewhere, as well!

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.300
He still doesn't have the arrow!

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.550
We're rushing in, Mista!

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.710
The light is behind my own mind!

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.400
He just destroyed something behind his head!

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.260
What in the world did he do?

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.940
Now I've got it...

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.060
I, Diavolo, now have the arrow!

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:23.870
If Diavolo found a way to grasp the 
arrow, we should take advantage of it.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.770
Because the arm he tore off of me and these 
droplets of blood are all just particles.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.110
Golden Wind shall now

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.930
appear!

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.590
These ants!

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.410
What just happened?

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.180
This is good, so far.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.330
Let's go...

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.640
We have to hurry.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.320
Blast the arrow away from him! 
Don't let him grab it, Mista!

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.690
I'm already shooting!

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.350
They made it through!

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.790
Despite him predicting their 
movements, we're still far apart.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.040
He can only knock the ones coming 
at him out of their trajectory!

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.960
The rest of you knock that arrow 
back and bring it to me, Bullets!

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.440
H-He'd already thrown...

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.040
...a civilian into the air!

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.040
He figured out the bullets would land 
and returned the arrow to its place!

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.000
The trash ability of an underling...

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.840
There's no way your weak mind can 
surpass Emperor Crimson's predictions.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.080
You will not be able to get through.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.310
You're still just trash.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.070
I will admit though, Bucciarati,

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.100
your team has made me sweat.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.610
I never dreamed you would be foolish 
enough to betray the organization,

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.510
nor did I ever think you'd 
find out my true identity.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:57.950
But the fact that I've been able to figure 
out this arrow's true power is a blessing!

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.930
It's a gift granted to me by fate 
because I was able to defeat my past!

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.820
I need ammo, Bullets!

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.580
We told you, Mista!

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.520
It takes time to reload that cartridge!

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.630
We're finished!

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.740
Wh-What in the world?

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.910
Spicy... Lady...

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.290
You didn't deflect Mista's bullets.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.250
I just made them softer.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.500
The bullets stretched out like 
chewing gum and stuck to your hand,

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.330
and I had them use their elastic force 
to return and blow through it.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.220
Trish... You're still conscious!

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.800
I'm going to overcome this.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.840
I'm not going to live in fear 
and run away from the fate

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.390
that you've passed on to me.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.400
If it's in my way, I'll just climb over it!

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.110
The arrow's flying toward me!

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.890
I'm the closest!

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.490
He can't get past me!

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.200
Even if he predicts where 
it'll fall and erases time,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.660
I'm still closer to it!

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.710
If only... My daughter,

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.610
if only you hadn't been born...

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.890
Fear truly does come from the past.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.780
You have genuinely angered me!

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.770
What?

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.010
<c.colord26f46>Booooom</c>

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.380
You said you'd overcome this, did you not?

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.380
You were right, Trish. Now you 
can surpass not only the past...

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.020
but their heads.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.370
Trish!

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:50.000
Episodio 37
