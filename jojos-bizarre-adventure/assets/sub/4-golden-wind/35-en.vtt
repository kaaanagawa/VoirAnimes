WEBVTT

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.670
Could it be that while we were sleeping, 
Giorno and I, and Mista and Trish...

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.610
Each pair's minds have been swapped?!

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.980
Don't attack just yet!

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.780
That Stand!

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.120
It's Zipper Man!

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.450
It's Bucciarati's...

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.330
soul!

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.030
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.450
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.500
Eternal greatness exists only within myself.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.090
Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.410
Episodio 35 The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 2

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.910
Yes! Bucciarati's okay!

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.540
And he was going after the 
arrow before the boss was!

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.220
The way you're talking...

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.740
Sounds like it's Narancia who's inside you.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.300
Am I correct?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.260
Yeah!

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.660
And you two...

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.730
I'm Giorno.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.720
I-It's me, Trish.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.610
Well done, Bucciarati.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.770
You've already figured out 
this bizarre situation.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.110
That voice... Are you the man we 
were supposed to meet earlier?

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.590
Indeed. My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.400
<c.color8c433f>Stab</c>

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.910
I was killed by Diavolo.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.410
But I swapped souls with this turtle,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.130
so I'm just barely clinging to 
this world, basically as a ghost.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.170
And that is my Stand.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.510
The arrow's power caused it to go berserk, 
and it is now Chariot Requiem.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.780
That's the reason your souls 
have all been swapped.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.790
Wait. If our souls have been swapped,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.240
then the one in my body is—

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.310
He hasn't woken up yet.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.930
He's still out cold.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.530
Are you... Mista?

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.020
Yeah. Glad you're safe, Bucciarati.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.850
The boss, Diavolo, 
who swapped minds with you,

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.320
is being watched by 
Number Seven of the Bullets.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.440
He hasn't moved an inch. 
He's completely out.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.040
Bucciarati!

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.290
Requiem's getting up!

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.350
We already know how to use the arrow.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.970
If we take control of that arrow,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.470
everything will be over!

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.800
<c.color2f3c67>Rumble</c>

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.220
<c.color892e3c>Gwooooar</c>

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.390
Zipper Man... What in the world...

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.530
Pick up the arrow!

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.320
Requiem's charging at you!

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.030
Boom

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.030
Boom

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.030
Boom

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.030
Boom

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.940
Stop

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.830
I'm gonna knock the arrow away!

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.170 line:20%
Hurry and pick it up!

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.860
Something's wrong!

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.260
Don't tell me that was...

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.960
Take this!

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.100
I'll put a hole in your brain!

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.330
The pillar next to you!

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.770
Mista, duck!

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.340
Boom

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.760
Spicy Lady!

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.100
<c.color6efff8>Smack</c>

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.770
<c.colora25c82>Blam</c>

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.010
I'll splatter your brains on the ground!

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.670
On the ground!

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.490 line:20%
Let the ants swarm around you! 
The flies swarm around you!

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.020
What the... Number One? Where the 
hell did you come from? Hey, stop!

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.750
Cut it out!

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.270
Huh?

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.170
What's wrong, guys?

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.310
What...

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.300
It can't be...

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.720
H-Hey!

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.010
It's going to pick up the arrow!

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.920
It's going to pick it up!

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.960
What the hell?

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.790
What the hell just happened?!

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.780
I think this is

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.630
Requiem's Stand ability 
when it's in berserk mode.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.660
This is the first time I'm 
witnessing it, as well!

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.120
Now that Requiem has gone berserk, 
it has carried on my wish

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.120
and has become a defensive Stand.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.460
All to make sure it doesn't let 
anyone else have the arrow!

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.420
Anyone who tries to touch the arrow 
gets stopped by their own Stand!

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.630
The arrow has the ability 
to control your mind...

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.520
Are you saying this is a part of that?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.810
So then, what the heck are we supposed to do?

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.270
Our Stands have powered up.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.250
B-But, I mean...

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.320
If we try to get the arrow with that power...

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.620
S-Stop that,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.080
Benedict!

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.410
There, there... It'll be okay.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.760
Mista! Number Seven, the one
keeping watch, is freaking out!

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.280
Bucciarati's body...

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.490
is awake!

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.410
Diavolo? No way!

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.930
We'll have to go after the arrow later!

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.400
Position yourselves where 
you can see his body!

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.360
Mista! Shoot him now!

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.490
What are you doing?! 
Hurry up and shoot him!

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.130
B-But that body is yours, Bucciarati!

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.040
Bullet wounds...

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.230
are wounds my Golden Wind can fully heal.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.520
We need to make sure he can no longer move.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.510
That's what you're saying... 
Right, Bucciarati?

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.590
He stood up! He's starting to walk!

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.880
Boom

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.880
Boom

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.360
He's convulsing!

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.150
He won't be able to come at us anymore!

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.820
No one else is showing up on my radar.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.900
No one's coming to save him!

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.050
We did it.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.520
Now, once we get the arrow 
back... it'll all be over.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.380
Once we get back to Naples, 
I'm gonna go to school!

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.970
I wanna eat some piping-hot pizza, too!

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.010
Authentic margherita from back home, 
where it's baked over an oak wood fire!

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.970
I'll get some porcini mushrooms on it, too!

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.390
And then...

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.460
If I ever see Fugo again...

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.920
Maybe I wouldn't mind him calling me dumb.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.520
Too bad Abbacchio's gone now, though...

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.130
Trish!

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.130
I'm going to protect you until the end!

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.330
We all will!

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.780
Narancia...

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.200
Mista.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.960
Just in case, shoot both of his legs, too.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.790
R-Right!

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.490
Trish, you have my bullets.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.480
Give them all to me.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.230
They're inside my boot.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.160
S-Sure...

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.350
Hurry up, would you?

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.010
Come on, hand over the bullets!

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.310
M-Mista...

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.100
Time just skipped ahead a few seconds!

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.200
Yeah! There are bullets on the ground, 
but I don't remember hearing them fall!

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.800
But that's impossible! 
I didn't see it at all!

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.420
Not him bringing out Emperor Crimson 
or making it disappear, either!

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.510
And why?

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.220
He hasn't moved an inch from that spot!

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:42.680
Trish, drop one more bullet from my hand.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.630
Hurry it up!

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.440
The number of bullets on the ground is four!

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.240
I can't deal with the number four!

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.190
Four is the number I just 
can't have around me!

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.910
If it fell when you handed them to me, 
then you have to drop another one!

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.370
Is he actually Diavolo?

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.470
Trish, when we woke up, you mentioned that

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.470
you couldn't sense the boss's presence 
from that body at all, right?

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.090
What about now?

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.790
Do you sense the boss nearby?

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.580
But that's not possible!

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.060
You swapped with Narancia, 
and Mista swapped with Trish.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.410
That means Bucciarati 
switched with Diavolo!

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.020
That's Requiem's ability, 
once it's gone berserk!

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.720
I don't really get what's going on,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.190
but if time just skipped ahead,

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.300
then it's a fact that that body isn't 
the one controlling Emperor Crimson!

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.900
Narancia, what's going on in the area?

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.920
Is there anyone else trying 
to come near here?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.100
Narancia?

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.850
Trish, please...

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.650
You need to drop... drop one more 
bullet from my hand... please...

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.650 line:20%
I don't know...

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.040
I don't know why I can't sense the boss.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.030
I have no idea why!

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.820 line:20%
Move. Move!

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.820
I can't sense him anywhere...

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.070
Let me through! Please!

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.610 line:20%
Please! Move out of my way!

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.780
Impossible! There's no way 
this should've happened!

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.990
Keep an eye on our surroundings, Mista!

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.250
Watch our backs!

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.950
Narancia!

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.380
Cut the iron bars, Bucciarati!

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.250
We need to hurry up and get Narancia down!

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.500
Leave it to me, Mista! Leave this to me!

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.640
You need to load your gun, Mista!

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.480
He'll do it again! 
His attack had already begun!

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.860
Zipper Man!

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.360
Now heal him!

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.990
Hurry up and get the iron bars out of him!

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.240
The civilians outside the Colosseum 
are starting to wake up.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.180
Where is he? I didn't sense 
any trace of the boss at all!

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.740
I don't get why his presence seems to 
disappear and then reappear anymore...

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.420
Emperor Crimson's range is 
two to three meters, at most.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.890
So then how did he... from over there?

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.190
H-Hey! You did it!

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.980
Narancia's awake now!

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.280
Yes!

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.620
Th-That was a close one...

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.790
No... Mista.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.920
This is... an empty... shell.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.430
It's an empty shell.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.300
The wounds he received...

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.220
have already been healed by my Golden Wind.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.470
But... he's already gone.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.480
Narancia...

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.550
isn't...

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.920
It's... completely empty.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.560
His soul...

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.310
It's gone.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.450
He's gone now.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.980
There's nothing I can do...

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.260
I didn't make it in time...

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:35.810
It's so empty that I could slip right 
back in... I could coexist in both bodies...

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.870
That's just how...

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.030
empty this body is.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.290
Narancia!

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.520
This is too sudden...

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.950
Jean Pierre Polnareff

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.950
Silver Chariot

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:06.900
Where is he?

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.440
Where could he be?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.430
This is inconceivable!

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.390
This can't be possible unless 
there are two Diavolos!

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.030
Two of them...

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.720
That kid and Diavolo...

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.600
Don't tell me there are 
actually two of them...

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.060
<c.color831040>Rumble</c>

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.410
There's only one body, but two minds!

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.200
Bucciarati! I figured it out!

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.530
Diavolo has two personalities!

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.490
That's the only possible way!

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.970
The one in that body right now 
is the kid that I encountered.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.210
The kid and Diavolo have the same body, 
but their minds are separate!

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.620
At times, people's minds

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.350
can be scarred and split due to a 
traumatic experience during childhood.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:58.400
As they grow older, that split can 
develop into a separate personality.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.570
That split personality starts to appear much 
more distinctly as they reach adulthood,

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.190
and one personality will 
be dominant over the other.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.460
That's the multiple 
personality disorder theory!

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.380
Listen carefully. What I just 
said isn't a hypothesis.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.300
I've even heard of reports 
from Germany and England

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.720
where the individual's physical features 
change depending on the personality.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.600
Requiem's ability tore his 
soul away from his body.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.980
One of them, the kid, 
ended up in Bucciarati's body,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.600
but the other one...

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.010
And it could be coincidental, 
but they ended up in someone else's body.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.640
That's who Diavolo is!

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.570
Emperor Crimson attacked from their body!

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.820
What are you talking about?

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.440
Two personalities?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.480
That's who the boss really is?

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.560
Slowly but surely, 
people are waking up outside.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.370
So I don't know where he's hiding.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.700
But he <i>will</i> come again!

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.160
He'll attack again, and soon!

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.760
That's possible...

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.860
But he could've already left the area.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.250
Diavolo is also after the arrow.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.440
That's why he attacked Narancia first.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.110
He got rid of our radar first.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.920
So we wouldn't be able to tell 
that he was going after the arrow.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.100
That's why he took down Li'l Bomber.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:27.450
This just means you'll have to 
obtain the arrow's power after all.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.600
Either way, if you're going 
to destroy Emperor Crimson,

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.240
you need to find the arrow before he does, 
and get it away from Chariot somehow.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.800
Which way did Requiem go?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.140
To the left.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.570
It looks like people are starting to 
wake up in the direction he's headed.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.000
Find it? But your body is...

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.430
What about your body, Bucciarati?

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.630
I missed all his vital points.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.300
But he won't be able to stand up and move.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.030
I made sure of that.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.600
We're going to have to leave you behind here.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.460
So that no one

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.730
can hurt you anymore...

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.540
Ever again.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.610
But I promise

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.670
that I will take you back home.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.960
<c.color5a469d>Rumble</c>

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.100
Watch out for anyone coming near us!

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:39.970
Let's go!

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.440
Trish! What are you doing? Stay close!

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.680
R-Right.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.930
Hey, the woman running over there! 
You're under arrest!

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.510
You're going to accompany me to the station!

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.960
Kablam

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.510
I-Is something wrong, Mista?

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.160
Nope! Everything's fine!

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.030
They got close, so I thought 
it might've been the boss,

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.640
but it was just some cop.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.080
It does indeed seem that Requiem

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.800
doesn't have a destination 
in mind, nor any emotions.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.130
It hasn't even looked at me 
or the direction its heading.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.090
It does look like a living creature,

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:02.510
but it also looks like something 
resembling black plastic.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.200
It hasn't even recognized me as an enemy.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.440
It seems to be slow and even weak.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.020
And it's a fully physically formed Stand.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.740
Civilians can see and touch it.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:24.810
<c.color461376>R</c><c.color30354f>i</c><c.color386643>p</c>

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.440
Drag...

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.440
<c.color708c42>Drag</c>

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.850
It's no use... It's not letting us get close.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.340
It's not just our Stands.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.930
If we try to touch it with something, 
it'll come flying back at us.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.800
This arrow might truly be invincible.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.660
The more difficult this becomes, 
the more I'm convinced that it has

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.900
some kind of isolation power 
that repels everyone.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.650
It's getting up again.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.360
How can we pick up the arrow?

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.070
It's right in front of us!

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.530
Hey.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.300
Requiem won't allow Stand 
users to pick up the arrow.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:17.040
But what if someone who's not a Stand 
user tried to pick up the arrow?

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.060
Well, what do you think will happen?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.060
Why are you asking me that? 
How the hell would I—

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.330
<c.colora42f49>Rumble</c>

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.570
H-Hey, guys!

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.140
My soul is holding on for 
dear life within this turtle.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.350
I'm no longer a Stand user...

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.810
so I was able to touch it!

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.160
Mista! Hurry up and pierce 
your Stand with this arrow!

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:50.000
