WEBVTT

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.810
Something's wrong.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.850
It actually lit up again... 
There has to be something wrong!

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.740
You relit the lighter, didn't you?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.280
No way! You bastard! 
What the hell are you doing?!

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.590
This soul...

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.080
did not belong to one 
who should be chosen.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.200
One who should be chosen?

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.170
H-Hey, are you...

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.470
He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770
You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.690
I'll give you one more chance. 
You have two possible paths...

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.740
So it indiscriminately attacks anyone 
who happens to see the lighter relit.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.500
Th-This is...

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.840
This bastard... He's dragging my soul

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.630
out of me through my shadow!

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.480 line:20%
I'll give you one more chance. 
You have two possible paths...

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.860
Episodio 04  Joining the Gang

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.020 line:20%
The first path is to become a chosen one.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.530
It's no use... It's stronger 
than Golden Wind.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.810
The old man died after his soul 
was struck by that arrow.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.180
So what's going to happen to me

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.910
if my Stand is attacked?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.980
Your only other path is death.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.940
Th-This arrow...

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.840
If I actually get stabbed by 
that arrow, I'm dead for sure!

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.470
I've got no choice!

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.510
Even if Polpo is one of the capos,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.180
if he's going to stand in my way

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.230
and even kill an innocent old man 
like he was a piece of trash...

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.980
I have to defeat him!

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.740
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.750
Golden Wind...

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.280
Only your senses will go berserk, 
and all movements will look slow.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.630
It's gone! That's impossible!

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.880
It shouldn't be able to control 
its own movements right now.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.970
Even if it were able to move, 
it should be extremely slow.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.970
It shouldn't be able to disappear!

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.040
It has to be around here somewhere...

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.840
It has to be!

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.150
I have to find it before the 
slowed-time effect wears off,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.290
or it'll attack me again.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.080
What?!

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.540
F-From within the shadows?! Sh-Shit!

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.880
Its movements are slower, 
but it's still just as powerful!

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.050
I can't move at all!

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.330
The shadows! It's in the shadows!

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.850
It can only move within the 
shadows, but at amazing speed...

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.800
Looks like it can't follow 
me into the sunlight.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.470
But the sun's going to set on the 
other side of the school soon.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.050
Once that happens, I'll have nowhere to run.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.080
What'll happen if I force 
it out into the sunlight?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.850
It's definitely worth trying.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.310
But how am I going to drag it out?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.270
What should I do? It's waiting right there.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.230
It's waiting there patiently

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.200
for the sun to go down.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.990
Hey!

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.740
What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.740
Koichi!

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.040
Who's that guy collapsed 
at the bottom of the stairs?!

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.960
What did you do to him?!

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.360
Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.590
That wasn't me!

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.340
That Stand right there atta—

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.880
The wrong idea?

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.550
I saw you talking to that old man!

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.030
I was watching from the window!

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.240
You were... watching?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.520
Then... did you see the 
lighter being relit, too?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.060
Huh?

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.480
Don't step into the handrail's shadow, Koichi!

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.480
Get out of the shadows!

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.980
Sh-Shit!

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.960
You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.490
You have two possible paths.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.830
Wh-What's going on?

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.450
The first path is to become a chosen one.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.780
Your only other path is death.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.780
This arrow is...

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.120
Golden Wind!

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.310
It hurts so much...

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.630
This hurts like hell, but now...

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.630
it looks like I was able to drag 
you out into the sunlight.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.720
I turned part of the handrail

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.980
into morning glories and let them hang down.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.400
Now you're out of the handrail's shadow!

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.520
So close!

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.800
There were more shadows nearby, 
so it managed to escape.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.780
But it looks like if I can drag that 
thing completely out into the sunlight,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.740
I might be able to win.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.250
Wh-What was...

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.040
What was that Stand?!

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.090
As you saw, it's trying to attack us.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.550
The old man who relit 
this lighter was killed.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.690
Because we saw it being relit,

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.450
both you and I are now its targets.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.800
That's not what I meant.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.350
That arrow... It's from <i>the</i> Bow and Arrow!

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.730
I didn't know one was in Italy, too...

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.150
What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.640
Is it because of you that another 
Stand with the arrow appeared?!

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.850
It'll take too long to explain everything...

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.030
But I don't know anything.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.330
Do you know something about that Stand?

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.590
And about that arrow?

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.360
Why did you save me?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.420
Telling me about that 
arrow is more important!

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.580
The sun's going to set!

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.220
Why did you save me?!

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.420
Don't you dare assume that I feel like 
I owe a thief like you anything!

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.550
The lighter being lit is 
because of something I did.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.100
There was nothing I could've 
done for that old man.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.240
I feel awful about it.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.750
I believe what I did was right, 
but I feel dark and gross inside.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.110
But despite that,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.580
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream 
that I believe to be right.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:46.270
Two years ago, I was shot with a similar 
arrow and gained my Stand ability.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.840
If the person shot with the arrow doesn't 
awaken to that ability, they will die.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.770
Awaken to the ability?

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.920
That's it!

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.320
That's what it meant by the "chosen one"!

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.230
Someone whose Stand awakened!

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.980
And that must be the motive 
behind Polpo's test!

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.770
I don't know about the origin of the arrow,

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:10.140
but I've met a Stand very 
similar to this one before.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.530
It's a long-distance 
remote-controlled Stand!

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.910
Long-distance and remote-controlled?

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.520
It can only carry out simple commands,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.240
but it won't stop attacking 
until it's fulfilled its motive.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.910
Our best option is to find the 
Stand user and take them down.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.880
Sadly, that's not an option.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.170
The user is in a jail cell. 
We can't get to him.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.630
Anyway,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.630
that thing won't be able to leave 
the school building's shadow,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.600
so let's head into the sunlight 
while it's still available.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.620
Then, before the sun goes down,

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.780
we'll lure it into the shadow 
of something that can move,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.560
and then we'll get rid of that shadow.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.930
That way, we can drag it into the sunlight.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.370
Got it!

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.120
I-It's gone!

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.920
I've got you!

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.550
Wh-What?!

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.090
You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.360
The crows!

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.020
It hid in the shadows of those crows 
and moved over there in them!

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.620
Th-This thing...

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.950
It's useless!

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.440
Sh-Shit!

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.710
While in the shadows, its power 
and speed are much higher!

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.340
Act 3! 3 Freeze!

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:46.750
My Reverb Act 3's ability is to 
make Stands or people heavier.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.660
I've made its hands heavier,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.880
so much that it won't be able 
to lift a finger from the ground.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.690
It should let go.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.360
I made the entirety of its hands heavier!

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.390
It shouldn't be able to 
bend its fingers anymore!

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.030
It's strong...

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.930
It's determined to not 
let go, no matter what.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.440
You have two possible paths...

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.680
I-It's no use!

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.940
Any damage inflicted upon the 
Stand goes right back to the user!

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.530
At this rate, Giorno's 
legs are going to break!

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.280
Act 3! Undo 3 Freeze...

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.280
No.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.710
Don't do that, Koichi.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.380
This ability that makes things heavier... 
Don't you dare undo it.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.710
This is perfect.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.590
This is exactly the ability 
that I was looking for!

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.010
But your leg's going to shatter!

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.740
Wh-What?

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.690
That tree...

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.440
Golden Wind is an ability 
that continuously gives life,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.480
so that tree continued to grow, 
lived the extent of its life,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.110
and is now starting to wither.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.550
Ability?

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.640
But that tree's at least ten meters away...

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.450
So you got to the tree's 
roots by digging that hole!

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.320
Bam

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.610
Y-You did it! The shadow's gone!

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.960
It's been dragged out into the daylight!

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.970
You told me there were two paths,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.310
but sadly, you only have one.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.830
Koichi, could you move 
to the right a little?

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.570
Huh? Like this?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.900
Hmm...

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.830
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.750
Bask in the sunlight.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.400
That's it.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.460
That's your one possible path.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.190
Still, I have to wonder

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.740
if I'm going to be able to join the gang now.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.490
What to do...

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.990
Polpo

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.990
Shadow Sabbath

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.410
That arrow...

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.040
The fact that the Arrow 
is also in Italy means

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.500
that there'll be even more victims!

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.130
I need to hurry up and tell Jotaro!

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.890
Wh-What are you doing?

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.380
Did you just say there'll be more?

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.830
We defeated Polpo's Stand,
which had the arrow.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.590
You saw it for yourself.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.180
Defeated? You've got this all wrong!

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.080
I'll admit that we managed to escape 
its attacks because of you,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.800
but that Stand only stopped 
attacking because of the sunlight.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.230
The user isn't hurt at all. 
They're perfectly fine!

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.490
So Polpo's alive?

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.310
Not only that, but long-distance 
remote-controlled Stands

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.450
basically don't affect their users at all.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.910
He probably hasn't even realized 
there's been a battle here.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.300
What?

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.570
So he has no idea at all?

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.370
He doesn't know I'm a Stand user, either?

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.520
Chill out, would you?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.800
If he noticed anything, it was probably 
that his hand felt a bit heavier,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.890
but he'd have no way of knowing 
that you and I are Stand users.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.030
Hey, could you move your finger?

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.600
Sorry, but I still can't 
let you make your call.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.490
I'm begging you...

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.270
This isn't just one enemy.
They're an organization.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.420
If you tell someone, 
the organization might find out.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.570
Enemy?

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.990
Organization?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.350
I'll tell you and only you, Koichi.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.700
The Next Day

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.590
Someone gifted me a special-order pizza.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.100
Sorry to keep you waiting. 
Let's see, you were...

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.880
Giorno... Giorno, uh...

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.750
Giorno Giovanna.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.020
Ah, yes. Sorry about that.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.340
My head goes blank when I eat.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.390
Perhaps it's because all my 
blood goes to my stomach.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:07.320
This might sound sudden, but are 
you a religious person, Giorno?

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.280
I'm not sure... but I'm not 
very passionate about it.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:19.550
What I'm about to say may 
contradict God's teachings,

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.000
but I'd like you to listen carefully.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.550
If the most important thing 
in this world is trust,

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:32.090
the most despicable thing you 
can do is insult someone.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:36.680
Listen well... To insult 
or betray someone's trust

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.330
not only hurts their reputation,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:45.560
but puts them in a very sticky situation.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:53.070
We will not fight others or risk 
our lives over money, power,

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.830
or having our seats taken 
at a theater or on the bus.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.040
Fighting is truly foolish.
Only idiots bother with it.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.250
But...

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.720
I will risk my life over being insulted.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.980
I believe that God forgives even murder.

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.000
Don't forget that.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.020
Congratulations! I will allow 
you to enter the organization.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.890
You did bring me the lighter still 
lit, as I trusted you would.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.350
You pass.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.210
That's our Passione organization's badge.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.780
It proves that you passed.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.860
You'll be working under 
Bucciarati for a while.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.350
How about it? Why don't we celebrate your...

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:17.360
Did that brat actually protect 
the flame for 24 hours?

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.930
Or did he relight it and 
become a Stand user?

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.620
I couldn't care less about that.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.920
Young, clueless guys like him are easy to use.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.250
Either way, we can use him however we want.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:42.710
Oh?

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.270
I could've sworn I closed that...

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.830
The blood does flow to my 
stomach after I've eaten...

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.000
You met him again?

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.100
I'm sorry, Jotaro.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.590
But I can't help thinking

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.450
that he, Giorno Giovanna, isn't as 
dangerous as you think he might be.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.280
What makes you think that?

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.600
Well...

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.690
Well, I'll tell you that in person.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.310
Is that all right?

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.400
All right.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.010
If that's what you want to do, that's fine.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.590
I'll be waiting.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.620
Thank you.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.180
I'll talk to you later.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.380
Jotaro, back then, I really did think...

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.060
Does this Giorno kid really admire that?

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.610
Is he sane?

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.190
But I can feel it...

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.630
I can feel that he has a righteous heart.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.770
I can tell...

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:08.470
Because I observed three members of 
the Joestar bloodline back in Morioh.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.960
The three who exude righteousness from 
their hearts, as if it were their life energy.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.440
I could see the same thing in his eyes.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:24.660
Without a doubt, the blood that flows in 
his veins carries the will of the Joestars.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:32.250
So I'm going to keep this to myself 
for a while, like he asked...

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.090
The golden dream that Giorno 
Giovanna possesses.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.970
Well, then, maybe I'll 
go do some sightseeing.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.100
The Next Day

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.820
Come with me, Giorno Giovanna.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.500
What was that noise?

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.470
Well, whatever.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:14.450
When someone insults you, 
even murder is forgivable?

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.880
I see. What you told me is very important.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.260
You insulted that innocent old man's life.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.960
So I changed one of your guns into a banana.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.270
You should savor your 
last meal as best you can.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.890
So... Where are we going?

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.040
I'll introduce you to my team.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.220
They're all Stand users.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.530
