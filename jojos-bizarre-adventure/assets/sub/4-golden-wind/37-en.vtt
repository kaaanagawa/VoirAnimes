00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.470
If only... My daughter,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.370
if only you hadn't been born...

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.880
Fear truly does come from the past.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.180
You have genuinely angered me!

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.840
What?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.370
<c.colord26f46>Booooom</c>

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.540
You said you'd overcome this, did you not?

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.610
You were right, Trish. 
Now you can surpass not only the past...

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.370
but their heads.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.020
Trish!

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.790
No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.220
All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.220
Eternal greatness exists only within myself.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.850
Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.840
Episodio 37 King of Kings

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.450
T-Trish!

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.640
No way! He...

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.330
He attacked! He went through 
Trish's mind... and into himself!

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.280
I guess I don't need this body anymore...

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.270
or you.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.360
H-Her soul!

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.890
It's moving away!

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.460
Trish's soul is...

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.660
disappearing into the sky!

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.200
The arrow!

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.500
The arrow belongs to me!

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.170
It pierced me!

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.560
The arrow's power... 
This gift given to me by fate!

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.300
Now my Emperor Crimson 
will sit atop the world again!

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.640
Did it pierce me?

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.340
I-It didn't!

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.370
Wh-What... Something is wrong!

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.660
No... I can't even grasp it!

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.010
E-Emperor Crimson's hand is translucent!

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.830
And it's crumbling!

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.680
What?!

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.980
Th-This is...

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.080
My soul is leaving her body...

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.700
This wind is...

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.220
I-It can't be!

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.660
Could it be that all you can predict, Boss,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.500
are the movements of arrows and bullets?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.930
You couldn't seem to predict 
what I was going to do.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.930
Y-You bastard...

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.740
You're the one who discovered 
the way to destroy Requiem.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.580
This thing behind our heads...

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.190
Or rather, this thing that's 
behind every one of our souls.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.300
It just needs to be destroyed.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.550
You wanted to pick up the arrow, 
so you didn't completely kill Requiem,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.550 line:20%
Don't... Don't, Bucciarati...

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.200
but if I completely destroy mine...

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.530
The ability of Requiem, the Stand 
that lost control, will disappear.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.840
Don't, Bucciarati!

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.930
Look at me! Think about who's truly worthy!

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.270 line:20%
Bucciarati... Y-You're...

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.800
Who is the king worthy of 
possessing this arrow?!

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.430
Bucciarati! The weak are not 
worthy to possess the arrow!

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.050
All the souls that have been swapped...

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.910
will return to their original bodies!

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.900
Trish's soul!

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.520
I-It's Trish!

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.880
Mista!

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.850
Everyone, look!

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.490
You did it, Bucciarati!

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.250
It was a close call, but she's returning!

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.640
I'm leaving the rest up to you, Giorno.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.170
B-Bucciarati...

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.550
Y-Your body's back at the Colosseum.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.850
That body is—

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.060
Giorno, I was reborn.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.120
When I met you back home in Naples...

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.970
When I betrayed the organization...

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.450
My soul had been fated to 
slowly die, but it was reborn...

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.490
Thanks to you.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.560
This is what true happiness is.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.040
This is how it should be. Don't worry.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.520
Please give everyone my regards.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.160
How dare you?!

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.710
All for a stupid little girl!

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.900
You vile pukes that some 
loser spewed into a toilet!

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.170
Who do you think I am?!

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.170
I, Diavolo, shall be the 
one to possess the arrow!

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.610
W-We did it...

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.310
Way to go, Bucciarati...

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.700
That was a close one...

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.640
but Trish will be okay now.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.120
Giorno... You need to heal us.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.530
Bucciarati's still at the Colosseum, 
but I'm sure he'll be here in no time...

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.600
Right?

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.860
Don't worry about it, Giorno.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.940
I'm only going back to 
where I was supposed to go.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.280
I'm simply returning to how I once was...

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.680
That's all...

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.980
Jean Pierre Polnareff

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.980
Chariot Requiem

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.610
Benedict!

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.470
I don't remember who said it, but...

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.690
"We are all soldiers chosen by fate."

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.260
But there are truths I've learned 
from this world, as well.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:57.330
Fate has given me the ability to make 
time skip, and to predict the future.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.610
There's no doubt about it. 
That's the undeniable truth.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.910
The fate of this world

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.330
was supposed to have chosen my Emperor 
Crimson to stand invincible at the top.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.470
I am no soldier.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.870
Damn it!

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:19.890
And despite that, somehow... 
that arrow is not in my hands!

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.170
How dare you?!

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.660
There's no way...

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.630
There's no way that I, Diavolo, 
would lose like this!

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.920
I need to retreat for now.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.770
I need to hide from the arrow and await  
the ideal moment for my counterattack!

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.730
Retreating here is not admitting defeat.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.170
I have the ability to take 
myself back to the top!

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.770
Don't let him get away, Giorno...

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.830
No matter... what you do...

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.720
If he gets away, he'll go into hiding.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.240
He's planning to run away, Giorno...

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:01.100
I just felt it... He took a step back!

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.890
Wha—

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.680
He's holding the arrow!

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.990
The one who will control the 
arrow after Requiem...

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.890
is Giorno!

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:30.620
It's no use... There's no way I 
can escape from here after all!

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.350
I'll lose my pride if I flee from them.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.780
I am a king!

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.460
My only goal is to remain at the top!

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.410
If I flee now, my pride will be lost!

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.720
There is... no next time!

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.390
He's not running away!

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.400
He's coming this way,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.230
despite how pointless that is!

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.320
Golden Wind!

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.420
He did it!

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.390
The one who will go beyond the power 
of that arrow is Giorno's Golden Wind!

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.030
No! You're wrong!

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.150
I thank you, my daughter!

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.490
Because of your insulting claim 
that I was going to run,

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.640
I was able to keep my pride!

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.740
Thank goodness I didn't retreat.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:28.420
If I had fled, I wouldn't 
have seen this premonition.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.360
This unexpected premonition 
from Emperor Crimson Eulogy!

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.060
Golden Wind!

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.570
He did it!

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:49.270
The one who will go beyond the power 
of that arrow is Giorno's Golden Wind!

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.820
B-But why?

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.260
It went through him... 
but the arrow's on the ground.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.010
I'm so glad I didn't run away. So very glad!

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.360
To be honest, my heart was filled with despair.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.660
If my daughter hadn't ridiculed me,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.950
I wouldn't have decided to advance on you.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.300
And because of that,

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.280
I saw a premonition of the 
arrow falling to the ground!

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.720
Giorno Giovanna... 
You weak little newcomer...

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.660
This means that you weren't a suitable vessel.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.100
He's already disappeared, 
but remember what Polnareff said?

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.500
The arrow decides who 
is worthy to wield it.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.080
I know I'm repeating myself, 
but I'm truly glad I didn't run away.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.650
You've been rejected by the arrow!

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.010
Giorno, run!

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.270
You're finished!

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.420
I, Diavolo, will be king, 
just like I've always been!

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.550
G-Giorno!

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.610
Mista, wait!

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.290
The thing that's peeking 
through the crack...

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.790
Could that be...

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.150
Th-That's...

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.490
What am I looking at right now?

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.770
I cracked his head open!

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.680
Shouldn't I be seeing his brains 
spilling out right about now?

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.880
What came out wasn't brains...

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.110
Th-This can't be!

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.020
And the arrow's being sucked into his arm!

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.790
The arrow—

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.220
Shit! You're finished, Giorno Giovanna!

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.640
Th-That's...

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.020
Giorno wasn't rejected.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.060
He wasn't cast aside by the 
arrow because he was unworthy!

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.470
No... In fact...

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.240
The arrow is forever Giorno's!

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.040
The boss can never have that arrow now!

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.730
Am I looking at reality?

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.640
I must be seeing some kind of mistake.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.510
I should be looking at Giorno's corpse, 
with his head cracked open!

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.160
This cannot be reality!

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.450
It's Requiem...

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.930
That's Giorno's Requiem...

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.880
Golden Wind Requiem!

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.970
Golden Wind has gone beyond 
the power of the arrow!

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.970
What?!

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.750
The only thing that will survive 
is the truth of this world.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.900
Righteous actions born of truth 
shall never be destroyed.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.210
My friends may have perished,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.930
but their actions and wills 
have not been destroyed.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.470
They handed this arrow to me.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.480
So, are your actions born of truth,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.800
or are they merely superficial, born of evil?

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.080
We're about to find out.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.470
Can you avoid destruction, Boss?

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.960
Wh-What's going on? What's about to happen?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.940
Don't tell me our souls are 
going to be swapped again!

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.670
I don't know... No one does.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.490
Giorno probably doesn't, either.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:08.300
But given what just happened, I know that 
Giorno has complete control of Requiem!

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.750
It hasn't gone berserk!

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.600
I couldn't see it... I couldn't 
see the moment he attacked!

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.550
But I was able to predict that attack.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.070
The reason it didn't fully hit me is because

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.340
I was able to predict the 
hole appearing in my hand!

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.580
I can dodge his attacks, 
though just barely.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.500
It's true that this Golden Wind's 
attack yielded tremendous power...

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.180
But... that's all it's worth.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.340
It merely powered up.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.210
It's a threat, but I can still predict it!

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.100
This is not something I can't overcome!

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.640
Fate has chosen me as the 
one to stand at the top!

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.970
I am the king who has overcome all threats!

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:59.470
Don't talk to me like you have any idea 
what's going on, Giorno Giovanna!

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.800
I won't even give you the 
chance to regret your death!

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.510
Emperor Crimson!

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.430
Time shall be eliminated 
for everyone but myself!

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.940
I can see it... I can see 
his Stand's movements!

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.100
I can perfectly see what it's trying to do!

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.320
I can estimate what these pieces 
of trash are going to do!

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:32.370
That should fully stop 
Golden Wind's movements!

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.400
Even after time starts moving 
again in a few seconds,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.180
your eyes will never be able to see 
myself or Emperor Crimson again!

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.850
The pinnacle of truth lies within my abilities!

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.560
Yes! I've won!

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.930
I'm just a moment quicker!

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.700
I've completely ripped out his 
heart in my premonition!

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.780
The future has chosen the 
actions of my Emperor Crimson!

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.610
This is the end!

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.170
Wha—

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.680
What?

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.220
Don't tell me this is...

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.910
Is the time that I disposed of 
reversing... because of Requiem?!

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.540
N-No! Everything is returning to normal!

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:56.120
But my premonition still favors me!

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.790
Take this, Giorno Giovanna!

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.450
Wha—

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.480
Wha—

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.320
Wha—

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.010
Wha—

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.730
Wha—

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:11.440
Wha—

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.250
Wha—

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:12.950
Wha—

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.680
Wha—

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.220
Wha—

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.700
What is this?

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.560
What am I seeing?

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.480
A-Am I dreaming?

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.910
Am I witnessing some kind of illusion?

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.070
No... that can't be true.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.900
The only one who can move within 
the time I've disposed of is me!

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.690
This is... Requiem.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.340
What you're seeing is indeed the truth.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.200
You are seeing the movements 
created by your abilities,

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:50.460
but you will never arrive at the 
truth that's going to happen.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.750
None who stand before me 
shall ever get there,

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.000
regardless of their abilities.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.130
This is the power of Golden Wind Requiem.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.650
This is unknown even to Giorno 
Giovanna, who controls me.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.350
Giorno Giovanna!

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.120
I won't even give you the 
chance to regret your death!

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.530
What am I saying?

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.990
I-I...

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.040
haven't moved at all from the start!

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:35.010
Th-This premonition that I had... 
It's the truth that's going to happen!

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:40.110
My invincible Emperor Crimson should 
be heading toward victory!

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.150
Useless! Useless! Useless! 
Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.870
Useless! Useless! Useless! 
Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.160
Useless! Useless! Useless! 
Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.430
Useless! Useless! Useless! 
Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.970
