WEBVTT

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.760
Because you're going to join me.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.070
I plan on defeating your boss 
and taking over this city.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.780
What?!

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.540
In order to get rid of gangs 
that sell drugs to children,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.880
I'm going to have to become 
a gangster myself.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.370
Are you saying...

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.420
that you're going to join our organization?!

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.890
Are you serious?!

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.440
Do you even know what that means?!

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.440
What a great view...

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.340
Yes. If I'm going to take over this city,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.050
I'll have to join the organization that 
rules it and work my way up.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.800
Bucciarati,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.140
I'm going to become a Gang-Star!

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.000
Pass! Pass!

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.330
Thanks!

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.160
Thanks.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.160
Thanks!

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.730
Fine.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.400
I'll report back saying I couldn't 
find the one who attacked Luca

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.770
and introduce you so you 
can join the organization.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.710
However, if they find out at any time 
that you're going after the boss...

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.260
I'm not going to save you.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.350
Traitors can't be saved.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.770
You'll have to deal with your own failure.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.270
Otherwise, I'll wager on your golden dream and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.570
the honorable, golden resolve it took 
to go so far as to rip off your own arm,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.390
Giorno Giovanna.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.370
Episodio 03  Meet the Gangster Behind the Wall

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.750 line:20%
Our organization oversees 
every industry in Naples.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.170
Passione... That's the 
name of the organization.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.380
Passione means "passion," but that's not 
actually related to the boss's name.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.100
No one actually knows the boss's name, 
nor does anyone know what he looks like.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.460
We receive orders from a number of his capos.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.590
Giorno, the capo who'll be deciding 
whether you'll join the organization

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.060
is a man named Polpo.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.140
He's in this building.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.450
But this building...

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.410
Loom

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.410
It's a prison.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.750
Correct. Polpo was convicted 
of a certain crime

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.450
and won't be out for fifteen years.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.880
But he gives me orders from the inside 
and commands the organization.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.190
He can leave this place whenever 
he feels like it, but he doesn't.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.110
There's simply no reason to.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.200
But why?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.890
You'll understand once you go in.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.640
Giorno Giovanna, you're going to be 
interviewed by him, and you have to pass.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.910
It's basically like any other job interview.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.900
What the interview actually 
entails will depend on his mood,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.980
but whatever you do, don't let him 
find out your true intentions.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.490
All right.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.440
Oh, yeah. The Stand ability...

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.170
That's what you called it, right?

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.370
I never asked how you ended 
up with that ability,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.290
but are there others with it?

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.460
That'll also be answered 
once you get inside...

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.470
If you pass, that is.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.470
First, place your belongings, watch,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.170
and everything in your pockets into the tray,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.300
then proceed to the next 
room for a body check.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.120
Stand right there and raise 
your hands over your head.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.200
Once you go through that gate, 
please continue straight down the hall.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.580
N-28 is where Polpo's cell is.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.160
The room is divided with reinforced glass, 
but you'll be able to talk to him.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.090
Touching the glass, giving him anything,

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.260
and receiving anything from 
him are all forbidden.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.110
You have fifteen minutes.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.300
Once you pass through, the gate will close.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.480
If something happens, please yell.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.380
I'm going to meet him directly in his cell?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.940
Not in some visiting room?

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.020
You don't know who he is?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.100
That left arm of yours...

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.060
Is it injured?

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.160
That's no bed...

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.150
<c.color52154c>Gwooo</c>

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.020
It's just on your right hand,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.430
but the fingers are slightly red, 
like you were holding something.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.100
Like lines that would be 
left after holding a bag.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.170
Which would mean that you were holding 
a bag in your right hand up until now.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.030
Why's that?

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.610
Well, uh... You're right.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.360
I was holding a bag in my right hand,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.180
because as you observed, I hurt my left arm.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.960
I envy your ability to be 
so reckless with your body.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.880
Would you like some wine?

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.110
I have some exquisite Chianti Classico.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.830
It pairs perfectly with some Scamorza 
cheese and caviar on a cracker.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.420
I've been told that I'm not allowed

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.040
to give you anything or 
receive anything from you.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.410
They're just saying that.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.510
What people say and what they do...

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.320
are vastly different.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.810
That's the best and worst thing about people.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.990
The only downside to being 
in this cell is.... well...

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.400
Polpo...

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.360 line:20%
The fact that I can't admire Michelangelo's 
great painting in the Sistine Chapel.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.360
It's not that he doesn't 
need to leave the prison.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.980
Things would just be the same 
for him whether he left or not.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.080
With that body, he might 
actually be safer in the cell.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.060
More importantly, how did 
he get through the door?

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.030
Bucciarati's told me all about you.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.730
So you want to join our organization?

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.840
Hmm... Giorno Giovanna, was it?

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.170
Well, why don't we get 
this interview started?

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.680
What the hell was that?

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.090
Did my eyes play a trick on me?

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.940
For a moment, it looked like he took a bite 
out of his finger along with the cracker...

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:51.420
No... Maybe Polpo is also a Stand 
user, just like Bucciarati.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.430
Either way, I can't let him 
find out that I'm one, as well.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.720
What do you think is the 
most important thing

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.010
when it comes to choosing 
someone, Giorno Giovanna?

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.120
Is it what they're capable of?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.940
Oh? And what exactly are you capable of?

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.120
I borrowed a few things when 
she was patting me down.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.170
I thought these would be useful for your test.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.870
Of course, I'll be returning 
them to her when I leave.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.310
Do you have anything else?

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.880
Other than that, the only skill I have

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.670
is being able to completely 
fold my ear into my head.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.470
That's rather amusing.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.560
But, you see...

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.320
There's something else 
that's far more important,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.580
and that's trust, Giorno Giovanna.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.280
The most important thing when it 
comes to choosing people is trust.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.190
In comparison, being smart or 
being talented means as much

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.630
as this piece of cracker between my teeth.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.470
This test is all about seeing 
how trustworthy you are...

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.430
with this lighter's flame.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.290
Take it, and make sure the 
flame doesn't go out.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.160
Whoa, there.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.980
Be extra careful to make sure 
the flame doesn't go out.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.620
Fuller, the 17th-century theologian, said,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.330
"He's my friend that speaks 
well of me behind my back."

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.830
In order to join our organization,

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.290
you'll have to show how trustworthy 
you are when we can't see you.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:56.730
For 24 hours, you will hold on to that 
lighter without letting the flame go out.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.260
If you can do that, I'll approve 
of you joining the organization.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.740
Simple, right?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.220
The lighter has plenty of fluid in it.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.410
All you have to do is sit quietly 
in your room until 3 PM tomorrow

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.060
and make sure the flame doesn't go out.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.000
If you're a careful man who'll work 
hard to make sure it doesn't go out,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.030
the flame shouldn't go out.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.610
Which means you're someone we can trust.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.620
However...

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.770
If you're a man who is 
taking us too lightly,

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.770
and you fall asleep, 
sneeze, or knock it over,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.210
or a sudden wind blows the flame out...

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.970
It means that you're untrustworthy,

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.510
and I can't allow you to 
join our organization.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.180
Now, take the lighter.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.030
This is your entrance exam.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.240
You have 24 hours.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:07.570
I'm looking forward to seeing you come 
to visit me again tomorrow at 3 PM.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.830
For 24 hours...

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.080
All visitors must go through another body 
check when they go through the gate.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.010
Once you're told that you 
can leave the facility,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.550
please continue to the next 
room and grab your belongings.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.970
Wait! Polpo didn't tell you anything?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.270
What?

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.480
I'm going to pat you down now.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.030
Let me remind you that it's prohibited 
for you to accept anything from him!

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.590
Shit! I was under the impression 
that Polpo bribed all these guys,

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.070
giving me permission to take 
the lighter out of here!

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.700
Visitor, put your hands 
up and proceed forward!

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.660
So Polpo's test for me 
has already started...

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.490
And...

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.140
I have no choice but to go through with it!

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.240
I have to pass this test 
and get into Passione!

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.970
Koichi Hirose

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.970
Reverb Act 3

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.340
Visitor, hurry forward!

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.680
Just like I hid her ID in my hand 
where no one could see earlier,

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.280 line:20%
Put your hands up and proceed forward! 
I will conduct a body check!

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.580
I'll hide this flame!

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.770
You're free to go.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.720
There are no problems here.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.220
You may leave this facility.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.160
However...

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.710
Please open up your hand.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.520
Let me remind you that it's prohibited 
to accept anything from him.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.490
Visitor, open up your hand! 
I'm going to check it.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.130
A flower?

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.780
A real flower?

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.840
Very well. I'll allow you to take that out.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.930
You are permitted to leave this facility.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:40.240
I turned the lighter into a flower 
and hid the flame within it.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.480
That was too close.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.990
But is this flame Polpo's Stand ability?

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.050
The wind's definitely bad news!

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.170
Hey, Giorno! Perfect timing!

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.100
Could you push the shutter 
button on the camera?

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.030
No.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.610
Sorry, but could you help me out here?

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.300
No.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.770
I finally made it back to my dorm.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.310
Th-That was close...

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.280
Now the lighter won't fall over, 
and even if the air moves,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.260
the flame will be protected.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:55.460
Now, just as Polpo said, I just need to 
watch over this for the next 23 hours.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.210
I know.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.230
I'll make sure my window 
is locked, just in case.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.850
I need to make sure it doesn't randomly 
open and allow the wind to blow in here.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.750
What?

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.990
Who's opening my door without even knocking?

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.470
Th-That's—

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.410
Looks like he's out.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.250
Now's my chance.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.570
It's that Japanese guy again!

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.130
His name was... Koichi Hirose!

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.210
How did he find out my address?

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.470
Looks like my suitcase and 
belongings are long gone.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.750
But my passport might still be around.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:44.350
It's probably harder to sell someone's ID.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.760
I feel like a thief, sneaking into 
someone's room like this, but...

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.170
No! He's the thief here!

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.820
What's so wrong with trying 
to find what belongs to me?!

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.070
His passport? Shit!

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.210
It's in the documents case 
on top of my desk because

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.040
I'd planned to return it to him!

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.560
At this rate, Koichi's going 
to see the lighter's flame!

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.350
Then he'll probably put it out!

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.290
He'll think it'll set the place on fire!

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.760
What should I do?

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.010
I have to hurry up and retrieve that lighter!

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.950
Golden Wind!

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.300
I used Golden Wind to turn 
the light cord into a snake.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.180
That bread is pretty delicious.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.950
Good job biting into it!

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.450
Now I'll pull it up with the cord...

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.910
What? Shit!

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.140
I can't believe this.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.980
He found the lighter.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.760
This isn't good.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.310
I have to make sure he doesn't 
blow the flame out!

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:58.750
Oh?

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.520
This mark! The mark symbolizing Japan!

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.980
I found it! It's my passport!

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.110
I-It's burning!

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.010
Thank goodness...

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:17.970
Huh?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.880
That's strange. I could've 
sworn I saw a lit lighter...

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.580
That was close.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.960
He almost extinguished the flame.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.340
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.880
And to take my first step toward that dream,

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.470
I have to protect this flame, no matter what!

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.650
Whoa, that was close.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:45.510
Sorry about that. I was cleaning the stairs.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:50.600
I'm glad it was just a slight mist and 
the water didn't actually hit you.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.230
This must mean we've both done 
good things in our daily lives.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.310
Your daily actions are very important.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:04.550
If you weren't careful, you'd probably be 
wearing that bucket of water on your head.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.960
Seriously? This isn't good.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.350
The flame...

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:14.120
I wonder if I can ask 
Polpo to let me try again.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.050
No...

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:20.630
If he were that forgiving, 
he wouldn't have tested me with this.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.090
Flame?

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.640
Is that lighter not lighting up anymore?

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.610
Is it broken? Is it my fault?

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.100
No, it wasn't you.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.070
I'm actually trying to 
process what happened...

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.470
But from what I can see, 
it doesn't look broken.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.540
The lighter is still letting gas out.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.790
What did you just say?

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.000
Whoosh

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.760
Yes, there's still gas coming out.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.710
Is this the switch?

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.230
Did you try pushing it?

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.810
No... It shouldn't be able to light.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.170
But look at this fine craftsmanship!

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.430
This whole test depended on 
if the flame was lit or not.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.580
It's a very impressive lighter.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.390
If I were able to just light it again, 
there's be no point in this test!

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:16.790
I was startled by the size of the flame, 
but it looks like it's working fine.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.940
See?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:24.700
By the way, since you have that lighter, 
you're not smoking cigarettes, are you?

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.410
Something's wrong.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.480
It actually lit up again... 
There has to be something wrong!

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.540
What the...

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.430
That couldn't be his Sta—

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.270
You relit the lighter, didn't you?

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.230
I'll give you one more chance. 
You have two possible paths.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.690
Th-That's...

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.520
The first path is to live 
and become a chosen one.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.730
Your only other path is death.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.440
A Stand!

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.930
That's gotta be Polpo's Stand!

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.160
There's no doubt about it!

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.830
You relit the lighter!

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.200
This is your fate!

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.080
No way! You bastard! 
What the hell are you doing?!

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.090
This soul...

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.550
did not belong to one 
who should be chosen.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.720
One who should be chosen?

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.680
H-Hey, are you...

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.310
He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.030
Was it because...

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:46.350
That Stand pulls people's souls out 
and kills them with an arrow?

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.990
Is that it?

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.900
But does "the one who should be chosen"

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.120
mean someone who can join the gang?

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.620
You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.550
I'll give you one more chance. 
You have two possible paths...

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.530
