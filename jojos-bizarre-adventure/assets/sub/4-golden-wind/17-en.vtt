WEBVTT

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.340
You gonna be able to track them, Melone?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.060
Yeah.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.130
I've managed to collect a blood sample.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.080
Bucciarati's, that is.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.490
Hey, when's this train 
gonna get underway?

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.360
Please, just wait a little bit longer.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.980
We have another driver on the way right now!

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.070
What? What happened to the first one?

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.950
Ugh, talk about annoying.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.880
Especially that crying brat over there.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.040
I knew I shouldn't have gotten on 
this train with all these peasants.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.980
Miss.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.010
How's your health?

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.760
H-Hey, what do you think you're doing?!

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060
This is my compartment!

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.970
You can read what's written 
on the door, can't you?

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.060
Do you have anything with 
your birthdate written on it?

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.920
Uh...

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.990
Oh.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.320
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.240
Born March 10, 1977. 
Twenty-four years old.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.050
Very... bellissimo.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.300
A very good age.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.310
Don't touch my things!

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.200
Get out!

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.290
Smack

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.290
So good...

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.420
What a magnificent slap.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.560
If you have the energy to produce 
such a strong slap, there's no doubt.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.760
You are...

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.380
in excellent health.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.470
"Health: excellent."

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.600
And judging by the taste of your 
fingers, your blood type is O.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.870
Right?

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.080
What's your deal? Are you a thief?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.790
Who do you think I am?

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.650
My family—

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.320
Ah, I don't need your name.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.730
I don't care about where you 
were born or your upbringing.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.350
What's important is your 
current health condition,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.580
your birthday, and your blood type.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.990
A Pisces and type O!

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.150
Bucciarati is an Aries and type A,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.370
and, according to horoscopes, 
is a terrible match for you.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.340
And that's so perfect!

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.580
Looks like you drink and smoke, as well.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.960
Do you do any drugs?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.550
If you're doing any drugs...

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.430
You're even more amazingly di molto great!

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.260 line:20%
I-If you want money, I have it... 
If you want more, I have a credit card...

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.260
Listen.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.210
Could you be quiet and listen?

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.580
This next question is the 
most important of all.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.570
What's important here is your preference.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.320
Which do you prefer?

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.950
Apparently the Indian <i>Karma Sutra</i>, 
which was written 1,500 years ago,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.490
has more than 48 positions in it.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.490
And I think it's really important...

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.840
as the beginning that leads to 
the birth of an excellent child.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.040
Now, choose.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.920
Babyhead!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.790
H-H-Help me!

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.140
Help me!

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.840
Conception complete

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.880
3 minutes until birth

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.970 position:20%
Analyzing the DNA from Bruno Bucciarati's blood sample.
Would you like to integrate the DNA into a body and nurture it so that it can be tracked?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.650 line:20%
Oh, yes. We're going to nurture it...

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.630
1: Yes. 2: No.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.810
into something atrocious.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.070
Di molto...

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.380
Episodio 17  Babyhead

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.210
As long as no one finds us,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.940
we should make it to Venice 
by tomorrow or the day after.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.560
Man... Everyone seems super bummed.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.040
I wonder if Bucciarati said 
something harsh to Trish.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.650
No... I think she's worried because 
Bucciarati hasn't told her anything.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.980
Trish is probably a Stand user, 
but hasn't realized it.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.840
And her mysterious father...

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.810
She has all sorts of questions on her mind.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.370
But Bucciarati is forbidden to 
speak about any of those things.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.700
I'd like to look more into her abilities.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.120
They'd probably offer some hints 
about the mysterious boss.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.720
She's very strong-willed.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.860
She doesn't cry or complain at all.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.230
Mista!

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.690
Tell Number Two and Number Three 
to share the hamburger with us!

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.920
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.390
There's nothing to eat here right now...

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.470
Huh?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.010
Where the hell did you get that?!

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.360
D-Don't tell me...

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.620
Why'd my hamburger disappear?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.040
There's something under the seat.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.950
Sh-Shit!

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.870
A turtle?

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.980
There's something on its back...

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.820
What are we going to do, Mista?

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.660 line:20%
It looks like some kind of jewel... Is it a key?

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.020
This seems bad.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.300
What just happened?

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.750
Mista, you were keeping watch 
on the ceiling, weren't you?

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.680
What happened?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.810
Huh? Me?

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.610
I-I haven't the slightest. 
I wasn't watching at that moment...

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.260
Huh? Maybe the truck stopped...

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.950
Birth complete

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.790
Ow!

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.790
What happened?

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.610
Th-This...

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.590
D-Don't tell me I—

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.530
Thank goodness. Nothing happened.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.550
That stupid asshole!

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.280
What the hell was up with 
that creepy bastard?!

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.310
How dare he make me think 
I was about to die?!

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.270
I wanna kill him, damn it!

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.480
That piece of shit!

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.450
Hello? Are you the conductor of this train?

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.480
Come to my compartment, right now!

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.140
What does "kill" mean?

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.320
Looks like they were born.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.950
They're starting to learn from their mother.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.580
Babyhead's child, that is...

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.970
And this is great!

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.260
They're already responding to their 
mother's desire to kill someone!

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.670
Make us proud!

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.700
I'm telling you, some creepy bastard 
attacked me here! He attacked <i>me</i>!

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.590
It's because you have that poor 
excuse for a lock on the door!

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.550
There's even a bump on my head!

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.780
Ugh, I'm so pissed!

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.720
That piece of shit! I hope 
you guys are prepared!

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.470
What does... "kill" mean?

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.980 line:20%
I'm going to sue the hell out of 
you guys! This is unbelievable!

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.980
What does... "piece of shit" mean?

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.070
Would you like to learn some more?

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.960
Okay, pay close attention.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.980
This is Mr. Lion. He's the king of beasts.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.620
The one with the long nose is Mr. Elephant,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.670
and the one with the long 
neck is Mr. Giraffe.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.160
The one eating the grass is Mr. Zebra.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.500
And...

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.410
Oh, what's this?

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.540
This is what "kill" means. 
Do you understand?

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.420
It means to make them die, 
or to get rid of them.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.380
Next... Oh, we have some children's games.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.510
A spinning top and baseball.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.100
This is bowling, and these are ice skates.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.230
Oh, dear! Look at how handy these things 
are when you use them like this!

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.680
The ones who died are the pieces of shit.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.200
You use "piece" when there's only one and 
say "pieces" when there's more than one.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.560
Do you understand?

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.330
But you can kill them in whatever 
way your instincts tell you to.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.670
However, you are forbidden 
to attack this girl named Trish.

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.290
You need to capture her alive.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.760
There is also a newbie
whose face we haven't seen yet.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.130
They're with Bucciarati as well, 
so you need to find them and kill them.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.290 position:20%
I have to pee.
What should I do?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.350
What should you do?

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.660
I mean, just do it?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.920
Babies pee all the time.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.980
But it doesn't look like 
the lock's been broken...

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.880
H-Hey, what is this?!

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.060
There's something leaking from 
the ceiling of this stupid train!

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.820
I don't see anything...

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.030
I-It stinks!

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.070
What is this?! It's so dirty and gross!

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.240
Miss...

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:23.820 position:20%
Mommy said that I stink.
She's also screaming that I'm "dirty and gross."

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.420 line:20%
So it seems. And how does 
that make you feel about her?

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.280
What a great mommy!

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.280 line:20%
Yes!

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.680
Di molto! This is extremely wonderful!

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.250
You're learning so well!

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.240 position:20%
I'm hungry...
What should I do?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.110
Not yet. You haven't learned enough yet.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.030
It's too soon.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.500
Let me drink! Hurry and let me drink!

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.220
Hey, not yet! I told you, not yet!

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.930
I can't take this anymore!

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.170
I can't spend another second on this train!

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.610
I'll sue the train company and make sure 
they take responsibility for all this!

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.800
I'll tell them the bump on my 
head is a concussion, too...

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.780
Huh? I don't hear her anymore...

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.220
She was too good of a mother!

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.590
It's good that she taught him the desire 
to kill first, but this is too early!

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.550
H-Hey!

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.130 position:20%
Bucciarati's DNA is currently not moving...
It's idle somewhere up north.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.540 line:20%
What am I going to do with you?

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.020
I guess I can't deny your talents, though.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.050
It looks like the automatic tracking 
of Bucciarati's DNA has kicked in.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:35.030
It's a hassle, but Babyhead's son is an 
invincible, remote-controlled Stand.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.300
Nothing can defeat you!

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.990
Melone

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.990
Babyhead

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.980
Let's just steal one already.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.910
Are you stupid?

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.170
Word would spread in no time 
and go right to the enemy.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.500
Then they'll just be waiting to ambush us!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.170
That's true.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.390
Fugo's got a good point.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.090
Then let's hear what 
Bucciarati wants us to do.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.000
Wh-What are you doing, Giorno?

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.820
If we steal only one, 
we'll be caught immediately.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.100
But if we steal a hundred...

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.970
If it isn't just a single 
car that disappeared,

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:28.410
and if they're all found in 
pieces at different locations,

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.890
the search for the missing 
cars will be much harder,

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.880
and it should give us plenty 
of time to get to Venice.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.620
I see...

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.030
That definitely beats hitchhiking.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.340
Whatever.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.340
Giorno, you tell Bucciarati.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.840
Here.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.410
We're going to go get a car.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.650
Please get down from the chair.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.140
It's very dangerous outside right now.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.360
Listen, Mr. Bucciarati.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:05.070
If I were to ask you a dumb question, 
would you be able to answer it?

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.530
It depends on the question.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.210
What am I supposed to do if 
I need to go to the bathroom?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.750
You aren't suggesting that 
I use a diaper, are you?

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.110
I see... That's a very good question.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.460
Good. I'm glad you understand.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.230
Let's make the closet a toilet.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.660
Please, go ahead.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.830
Go ahead?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.270
You said you had to go to the bathroom.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.500
I don't know where it leads underneath that, 
but I'm sure the turtle will be fine.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.980
It might actually get nutrients from it.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.860
I have no idea what you're trying to say...

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.980
Bucciarati, we've procured a car.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.950
All right. Once we confirm 
that we're safe, let's head out.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.290
Understood.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.560
That bike... When did it show up here?

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.040
Where's the person who was riding it?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.240
Giorno, is something wrong?

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.050
Trish?

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.610
What the hell?!

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.560
Trish!

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.250
I-Impossible!

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.610
Trish!

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:29.580
Zipper—

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.280
Shit... It's a Stand, and 
a remote-controlled one!

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.730
But this power isn't remote-controlled. What's—

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.050
Bucciarati, please be on your guard.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.870
A strange bike has appeared.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.510
Bucciarati?

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.590
Don't tell me... Bucciarati!

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.690
Where's Trish? Trish!

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.620
I had the turtle in my 
hands this whole time...

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.920
I'd know if they came outside.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.190
Could the enemy have already 
used some kind of attack?

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.070
Golden Wind!

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.200
Di molto!

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.910 position:20%
I've captured the boss's daughter, Trish,
and Bucciarati as well.
What should I do now?

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.250
Di molto! Well done, Babyhead!

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.750
Get away from there immediately, of course!

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.740 position:20%
I'm currently inside a turtle...
There's one human waiting at the exit of the turtle.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.710 position:20%
I've never seen him before.
He's going to find me on my way back. What should I do?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.710 line:20%
Someone you've never seen?

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.080
That must be the newbie.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.300
If he finds you, you're going 
to have to get rid of him.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.710 position:20%
Roger.
I will get rid of the newbie who's waiting at the turtle's exit.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.520
But make sure you do it quietly 
so you aren't found by the others.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.980
Capturing Trish takes top priority.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.960
I'll have them head over 
there as well, just in case.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.010
I thought I felt a presence there, but...

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.600
No, you were correct.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.640
Everyone! There's an enemy here! 
We're being atta—

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.380
D-Did it take... my throat?!

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.570
Are you done yet, Mista?

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.280
Don't rush me!

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.340
Is something wrong?

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.020
Nah. Giorno's waving.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.810
I'm pretty sure Bucciarati's telling 
us to hurry up and get the car.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.710
I just told you not to rush me!

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.410 position:20%
The attack was successful. It's very quiet,
because I stole part of his throat.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.420 line:20%
Di molto! Well done!

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.200
Impossible! I destroyed the cabinet, 
but it's still not showing itself?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.770
And how am I not able to see 
it the moment it attacks me?

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.730
Where is it hiding, and how is 
it carving out pieces of me?

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.050
Carving out pieces... Which means...

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.480
Shpang

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.960
So you've carved away his leg and eye, too?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.200
Di molto! Well done! 
Now, come back, Babyhead!

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.530 position:20%
The attack was unsuccessful.
Obviously, he's figured out what I am. What should I do?

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.980
What?

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.990
<font size="19">The newbie outside has removed the key from the turtle's back.</c>

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.990
<font size="19">Apparently, when someone removes the key, only living things can leave.</c>

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.330 position:20%
My body is floating upward.
What should I do?

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.510
I'm not sure what you're 
saying... Living things?

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.050
You're a Stand! It doesn't matter 
if you're living or not.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.430 position:20%
That's true, but right now,
I have the eye that I stole from him.
His eye is living.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.980
I knew it... It was that cabinet.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.880
I see now...

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.720
It's not that I couldn't see the enemy.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.890
I'd seen them all along!

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.910
This ability chops up humans and 
reconstructs them into something else!

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.620 position:20%
Melone.
What should I do?
What should I do?
What should I do?

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.720
Don't panic! Who cares if he 
figured out your ability?

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.260
The newbie hasn't been able to breathe for 
a while, and he's missing a leg, right?

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.050
Just defeat him already and steal 
the turtle, along with Trish!

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:16.970
Roger.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.390
Golden Wind!

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.500
It's dodging by splitting itself apart!

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.730
Which means...

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.990
G-Guys...

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.580
I need to somehow... let them know...

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.250
That had some effect!

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.880
No, that was just a rock.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.220
Sh-Shit...

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.190
Trish is going to get taken...

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.430
At this rate, Bucciarati will be eliminated!

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.540
I-It's strong...

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.860
Is it... invincible?

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.750
I will leave the newbie's corpse here.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.670
As planned, I've quietly captured Trish.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.630
Di molto! Good!

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.180
I'm heading back to the train 
you're on now, Melone.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.890
Reconstructing humans into objects...

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:55.000
Your ability gave me an excellent hint.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.660
Your ability is similar to my Golden Wind.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.990
They're very much alike in the way 
that they both recreate something.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.360
Due to the hint you gave me, 
and almost being killed,

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.820
it would appear...

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.430
that I've grown a little.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.970
M-Melone, did you hear that?

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.410
I totally forgot earlier, but now 
I know the newbie's Stand ability.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.970
What about the newbie?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.980 line:20%
His button has become an eye! 
In his hand! It became an eyeball!

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.240
Hey, Babyhead, what are you talking about?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.020
What's this about the dead newbie?

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.130
He inserted the eye into his face!

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.020
<c.colord29d68>Rum</c><c.colorcf626a>ble</c>

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.320
He did the same with his throat and leg!

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.660
His ability is to create life!

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.940
He created his own parts!

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.910
His ability is the exact opposite of mine!

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.410
Hey, who the hell are you talking about?

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.210
You're not getting away! Golden Wind!

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.960
The newbie... He...

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.260
He's been revived!

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.470
A-Are you listening, Melone?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.080
He made parts of the motorcycle into roots!

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.360
I can't separate them!

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.510
I have to get rid of the 
parts that are stuck!

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.830
I need to get away from the bike!

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.930
Did it turn into a rock again?

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.960
This isn't good. He's going 
to try to pick up the turtle.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.330
I'll kill him before he picks it up!

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.370
Calm down, Babyhead!

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.590
Let him pick up the turtle.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.240
What do you mean?

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.090
The moment he picks up the turtle, 
tear him apart for good.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.430
Oil's pouring out. That's not good!

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.720
Make sure he can never get up again!

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.090
I got him!

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.040
It was only a little bit, but how 
dare you freak me out, you bastard?!

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.470
Now, I'm going to rip your head—

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.410
I've learned a lot from your ability 
to turn humans into objects.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.980
I'm not sure if it's fate or if our 
Stands were attracted to each other

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.040
due to their similarities that we met.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.590
But because of you, 
my Golden Wind was able to grow.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.620
Wh-Where did it go?

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.680
I just tore off your wrist. Where did it go?

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.620
Tore off?

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.070
That's incorrect.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.900
I intentionally let it go.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.480
I'd like to give you a little advice.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:43.520
You should probably use your hand to 
defend yourself, rather than attack me.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.070
D-Don't you dare underestimate me!

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.110
Take this!

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:49.390
What?!

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:55.020
The hand that I cut off has already 
become another living creature

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.750
and invaded your body.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.560
Yes.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.460
As you can see, it turned into a piranha!

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.790
Episodio 18
Head to Venice!
