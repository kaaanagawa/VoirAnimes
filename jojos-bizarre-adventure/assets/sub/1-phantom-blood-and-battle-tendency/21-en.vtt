00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.240
This building was originally
a 14th-century castle.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
It was converted into a hotel
in the early 1900s.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.480
But it closed 10 years ago
when its owner died.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.300
Now Kars has turned it into a shelter
from the sun.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.970
The enemy lurks within.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.050
But JoJo and Lisa Lisa
know nothing of the hotel's layout.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.930
From the silent depths

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.050
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.390
Crimson blood

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.140
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.430
If inherited love is called fate

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.720
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.220
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.970
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.010
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.720
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.600
Destiny written into your veins

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.390
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.050
Take hold of them

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.050
Chapter 21: A Hundred Against Two

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560
Damn it!

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.400
What's with the creepy cobwebs?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.820
Clean the place!

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.570
We're depressed enough
without these decorations!

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.910
But look at this trail of blood.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.120
Wamuu took a heavy beating from Hamon.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.080
Caesar didn't go down without a fight.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.930
We can't let Wamuu recover!

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.260
We're going in, Coach Lisa Lisa!

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.470
What is it?

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.640
W-Well...

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.810
T-This doorknob really grossed me out.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.230
It feels like
I'm grabbing some guy's hand.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.320
I'm not a door!

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.150
Huh?!

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.370
What are you looking for?
I said I'm not a door.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750
A vampire!

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.540
Look out, JoJo!

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.960
JoJo!

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.050
If it weren't for that weapon,
I'd have peeled your face clean off!

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.600
I'm Wired Beck.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.020
I killed my lover,
but escaped from prison.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.610
But then Lord Kars made me
part of his gang with a mask.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.740
He has my loyalty.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.490
I'm not going to let you go in
and disturb Lord Kars's rest.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.250
Those fiends! So they're already
unleashing their hounds upon humans?!

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.000
How troublesome.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.760
You're just a pawn
that's bound for hell.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.760
Here, let me give you a little push
into the abyss!

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.050
Lisa Lisa?

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.910
Beautiful! Magnificent!
Such lovely skin you have!

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.780
Hold me! Let me drink your life
through that skin!

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.430
I'm in a bad mood.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.310
I don't want to hear from
or look at a worm like you.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.870
But if you want to hold me, just try.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.330
It'll be the last thing you do.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.920
Spikes!

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.170
So that's what they are!

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.050
They're spikes, not fingers!

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.970
He's covered in wire-like body hair!

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.160
I don't like it when women
make jokes about me.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.360
Girls who laugh at me get punished!

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.160
I'll give you a squeeze!

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.710
I'll hug you to death!

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.160
Yikes! He's faster than I thought!

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.510
Her scarf!

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.330
I see. Her scarf
becomes a Hamon-filled weapon.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.380
A scarf?

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.090
You want to catch me?

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.880
Don't make me laugh!

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.260
And now I'm free!

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.960
Uh... Wha...?

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.460
Where are you going?

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.390
Come, JoJo. Let's move.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.010
O-Okay.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.980
Lisa Lisa's movements flow like silk.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.650
She doesn't waste any effort!

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.230
Hey, don't ignore me!

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.780
Hey, you!

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.790
A woman like that
has to be punished, right?

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.690
Oh, no, friend. Your time is up.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.180
You're the one who got punished.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.460
You got a dose of Hamon.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.670
Don't be ridiculous!

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.850
She's got what it takes!

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.440
I thought she'd be weak in a fight,
but she's better than me!

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.860
I'm impressed!

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.990
She's my coach, after all!

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.860
By the way, JoJo...

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.370
...you still haven't taken the antidote
Caesar stole for you, eh?

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.370
This?

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.710
Why?

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.960
I'll drink it after I beat Wamuu.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.880
This ring isn't a promise between
Wamuu and me anymore.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.850
It's now a promise to Caesar
to fight and keep living.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.980
Lisa Lisa, will you hold it for me
until I need it?

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.480
No.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.360
You should keep it.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.670
Who knows what may happen to me?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.290
As they went deeper,
the trail of blood grew ever thinner.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.960
JoJo and Lisa Lisa were fully aware
what that meant.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.460
Wamuu's wounds were healing.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.090
Are they here?

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.610
I've been waiting.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.860
You've grown quite a lot.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.740
Bastard, you killed Caesar!

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.660
Calm down, JoJo. Look at the floor.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.370
Don't worry, my head is cool.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.290
I noticed, too. The footprints, right?

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.130
There are two sets.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.050
That means Kars is here! Where is he?!

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.970
Show yourself!

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.100
Yes. Two sets of footprints.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.510
But I feel dozens of lungs breathing.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.960
It's her. I see...

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.820
You're quite composed and
perceptive for a woman.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.570
I can see how JoJo and Caesar
learned so much so quickly.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.790
And you can feel even slight breathing.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.870
You're among the finest Hamon warriors.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.880
Wha-What the...?!

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.420
You, you're all vampires, aren't you?
Damn it!

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.860
No response? That's creepy.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.560
Kars!

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.820
Lord Kars gave us, his chosen,
eternal life!

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.780
It's 100 against two!

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:12.120
When our master gives the order,
we'll tear you both to shreds, JoJo!

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.430
T-This is bad. It's 100 on two.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.410
Lisa Lisa, we can't win this one!

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.810
Wait, Lord Kars.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.600
Back in Rome, we promised
to fight each other.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.310
I want revenge for Master Esidisi.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.820
Please allow me to fight.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.360
I shall not.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.360
Our goal is to obtain
the Red Stone of Aja.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.620
Don't forget that, Wamuu.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.580
Yes, lord.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.680
That's right. We can't.
I'm not in the mood anymore.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.040
I know I could beat you.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.760
But even if I did,
all these vampires are still here.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.480
Win or lose, I'd still die, right?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.260
With odds like that,
giving up is only natural.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.980
I'm throwing in the towel.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.860
Blast it! You all saw, didn't you?

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.110
And I thought I could
zap them all at once, too.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.400
Now, kill them!

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.120
If you kill us,
you'll never have the Stone.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.280
Hold!

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.120
What's this, woman?

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.910
I'm not stupid enough
to be carrying the Stone here.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.880
If one of us isn't
in a certain place at a certain time...

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.300
...the Stone will be destroyed!

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.510
Don't try to fool me, woman.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.060
Do you think
you'll be able to find it in time?

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.520
The bomb is a small thing,
but is enough to damage the Stone.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.030
Is all this true? She never told me.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.320
I'll just run with it!

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.750
Yeah, it's all true!

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.330
If we die, boom! Kaboom!

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.960
Even so, we can't let you
leave here alive.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.460
I have a suggestion.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.510
JoJo and Wamuu can fight one-on-one.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.470
And Kars,
you and I will fight one-on-one.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.970
And to the winner...goes the Stone!

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.220
What?!

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.870
The victor will win the Stone
and the future.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.860
It will all be clear.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.830
Who will hold the stone, us or you?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.450
Who will survive?
The Pillar Men or humankind?

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.950
Why you...!

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.030
Wamuu?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.000
It's laughable, Lord Kars.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.250
S-She's good!

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.250
She's a better gambler
than I could even dream of being.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.630
You've got pluck, woman.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.010
Very well. We fight for the Stone.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.840
But don't get cocky!

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.850
You have no tomorrow!

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.600
She just turned a dire situation
into more-or-less even odds.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.870
All right, then. Let's do it!

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.580
We need a proper time and place
for our battle.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.460
Wamuu, your thoughts?

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.170
We fight tonight, under the full moon!

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:59.350
The place will be at the foot of
Piz Berlina, 15 km southeast of here.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.020
We meet at the Skeleton's Heel
stone circle.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.400
Many warriors found death
or glory in that place.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.480
A stone circle?

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.200
Hey, you can't just pick a place
that suits your fancy!

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.910
Wamuu, I think that's a fine choice.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.700
Now, about the Stone...

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.700
JoJo!

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.500
Bring the Stone to the Skeleton's Heel
at midnight tonight.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.760
And be sure to remove the bomb.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.920
The woman stays here as insurance!

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.860
Lisa Lisa!

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.570
They don't want us to run.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.240
It's a reasonable request.
Go and fetch the Stone.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.950
Don't worry about me.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.370
Right. I'll see you at the arena.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.960
Trust me.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.580
I do.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.590
Caesar...

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:31.160
Until yesterday,
I lived only thinking of myself.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.530
But a new feeling burns inside me now.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.780
Is this compassion?

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.380
Curse it!
I just want to wreck those bastards!

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:50.580
And I'll do it for Caesar, Meshina,
Lisa Lisa and the rest!

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.090
I'll fight for you all!

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.130
As I thought, there's no bomb at all.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:11.190
Lisa Lisa, you're deceptive,
even under pressure!

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.250
Now, maybe I should bring you
a change of panties, hmm?

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.660
What're these photos?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.370
It's Granny Erina!

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.260
Why would Lisa Lisa have this?

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.920
Who are these people?

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.790
May 1889?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.680
It's 50 years old!

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.220
This young man is Speedwagon!

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.470
Granny Erina!

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.560
And Straizo is holding a baby!

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:54.520
Lisa Lisa... I know nothing about
her life or her past.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.320
Why does she have these photos?

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.510
It's the real thing.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.490
We accept your bargain.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.660
We'll fight you one-on-one!

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:11.100
You saw the photos.
That means you want to talk, right?

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.810
Actually, I had planned to talk to you.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.440
Just who are you?

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.190
Fifty years ago...

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:26.450
Erina lost her husband, Jonathan Joestar
on a ship on the Atlantic.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.240
He was your grandfather.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.450
That day, your grandmother
saved a baby girl's life.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.500
That was me.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.210
The baby in that picture is me.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.710
H-Hang on now.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.460
That was 50 years ago!

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.700
If you were a baby 50 years ago...

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.270
H-Hey! How old are you, anyway?!

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.350
Y-You're 50?!

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.100
I-If you're 50, that means...

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.980
...y-you're old!

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.310
Right? Normally...

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.990
Y-You look like you're in your late 20s.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.910
They say Hamon energy is life energy
and keeps you young.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.750
But I guess you don't behave
like a young woman should at all.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.020
I think I see a wrinkle
behind those shades!

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.050
Just kidding.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.760
Now, prepare the arena!

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.600
Light the fires!

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.320
There's no time to talk now.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.070
But we do need to.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.950
My roots are connected to yours.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:50.950
Our roots?

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.370
The mask killed my parents.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.750
Since Erina was pregnant
when she rescued me...

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.210
...I was raised by Straizo.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.830
A-Are you serious? By Straizo?

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.250
Straizo taught me about Hamon.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.560
Straizo gave me the Red Stone.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.060
So S-Straizo is your foster father!

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:25.430
It is tragic that the fear of aging
drove him to such madness.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:31.160
My feelings about you defeating him
are complicated.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.030
But I feel it was destiny.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.660
What can I say?

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.460
I-It is very complicated.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.840
What a bizarre relationship.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:51.180
Lisa Lisa carries
a past full of sadness.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.470
JoJo, we're out of time.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.430
W-What's the rumbling?

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.320
They're here. Now the battle can begin.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.320
T-They're...!

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.880
Out of the way!
I don't care if you get crushed!

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.800
I-Is that a d-dinosaur?!

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.130
N-No, it's a horse!

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.890
Lord Kars, Lord Wamuu, please move!

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.230
They've gone berserk!

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.140
Lord Wamuu, please!

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.320
What fine steeds.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.790
We used masks
to turn these horses into vampires.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.160
V-Vampire horses?!

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:10.300
In this arena, JoJo will face Wamuu
in an ancient-style chariot duel!

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.300
A chariot duel?!

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.350
An ancient Roman death match!

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:21.430
You'll ride through the arena
while you fight!

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:28.810
Lord Wamuu or JoJo? Who will fall
or be beaten down while riding?

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.630
Defeat means death!

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.280
Those are the rules, JoJo!

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.700
The beasts have 150 horsepower!

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.910
Even Lord Wamuu can barely control them.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.440
Now wait a minute!

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.330
I'll fight you on any field!

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.210
But vampire horses
are your minions, right?!

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.630
Worry not. The reins conduct Hamon.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.210
Wamuu will use his strength.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.770
You can use Hamon to control them.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.440
I-Is that right? They look vicious!

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.350
Don't bite, now!

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.480
I see. A little Hamon does it.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.530
Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.290
Wamuu chose an ancient form
for this battle.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.420
That means he's serious.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:37.090
He's not doing this for fun,
or making sport of it.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.520
Beat him, JoJo. We have to win this.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.060
There are no draws!

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.060
Wamuu!

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.320
I haven't taken this antidote yet!

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.740
I promised Caesar I'd drink it
after I kill you!

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.630
That promise will give me
power I've never seen before!

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.960
Fight alongside me, Caesar!

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.430
I ride to battle!

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.610
Next episode

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.300
Wamuu! Wamuu!

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.480
Start!

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.070
Chapter 22: A True Warrior
