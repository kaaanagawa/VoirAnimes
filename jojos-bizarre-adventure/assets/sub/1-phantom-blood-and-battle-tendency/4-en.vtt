WEBVTT

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.280
Jonathan won his battle.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.040
But he lost everything to do so.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.200
I brought him here three days ago.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.720
He's totally alone.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.230
I hope I can give him the will to live!

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.690
Two stars fallen from the heavens

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.860
Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.160
Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.360
The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.280
And for the man who follows
his ambition...

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.400
...a sacrifice awaits

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.420
With pounding heart
and burning will

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.210
With thundering fists

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.610
And overflowing bravery

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.530
He steps forward, free of doubt

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.820
A fate determined by his blood

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.860
JoJo!

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.860
Chapter 4: Overdrive

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.590
Spirit! What Jonathan
needs now is spirit!

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.300
It's the middle of the night,
but his room is lit.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.400
What's going on?

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.350
That woman!

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.860
Has she been
attending to JoJo all this time?

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.240
Her hands are cracked from
being wet so long.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.360
She must have cooled his burns
thousands of times!

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.650
I'm glad.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.400
He's conscious!

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.950
You're through the worst of it.
You'll be fine.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.440
You've been treating me?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.070
You...

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.570
How could you be here?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.240
You look like...

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.150
No, never mind.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.790
It couldn't be.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.110
You really look like her.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.460
Who do I look like?

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.470
Erina Pendleton?

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.570
It's nice to see you,
Jonathan Joestar.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.120
JoJo...

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.100
Erina, you've really grown!

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.100
Me? You've grown a lot more!

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.070
But...

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200
It really is nice to see you again.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.610
Yeah.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.120
I wasn't cut out for that
sort of work, anyway.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.490
I'll come back later.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.380
Time for Speedwagon to play it cool.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.320
I-I must have fainted.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.780
Oh, dear!

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.810
But your arm is broken!

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.240
I'll always hold you.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.280
Some people are just fated
to meet each other.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.400
-Whitechapel, London-

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.050
You're out playing too late, you harlot!

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.010
Most humans are bound
by the laws of good.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.080
They fear the power of evil.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.720
But a rare few are born
unfettered by good...

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.090
...the evil elite.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.220
I can use you, Jack the Ripper.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.340
Submit your will to me.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.390
I'll give you wondrous power
and unprecedented pleasure.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.860
You need worry no more.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.580
Only Speedwagon and I know
about the tragedy here.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.790
The police think it was an accident.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.830
But where is the mask?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.390
I didn't find it in the rubble.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.970
I hope it was smashed.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.890
I think it was.
I want to forget all this.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.090
JoJo!

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.220
Erina...

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.230
Who is he?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.300
He's been following us.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.970
Is something wrong?

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.350
No, everything's fi--

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.600
Mister Jonathan Joestar.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.420
And the lady is Miss Erina Pendleton.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.300
W-Who are you?!

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.220
You did well to survive
against the mask's power!

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.600
JoJo!

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.720
That's right. Squeeze every bit of air
out of your lungs.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.180
JoJo!

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.280
He's injured! How could you?!

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.280
He's out of breath,
but there's no need to worry.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.290
W-What on Earth?!

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.050
What's happening?

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.720
I feel so...

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.710
M-My arm!

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.350
I am Baron Zeppeli.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.470
Courage alone won't
defeat the mask.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.930
But my arm was shattered!

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.220
The pain is mostly gone.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.910
I can even lift this rock!

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.330
That's incredible!

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.170
W-What did you do to me?!
Who are you?!

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.700
One question at a time, please, JoJo.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.120
I did nothing.
Your breathing killed the pain.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.040
Why did you do that to me?

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.010
How do you know my na--

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.540
H-He's gone.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.490
I said one question at a time, JoJo.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.860
I'll show you the answer.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.130
Follow me.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.310
What you will see
will change your destiny.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:38.450
I struck your diaphragm with a finger
and altered your breathing.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.690
How did you alter it?

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.780
Allow me to demonstrate its energy.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.290
What does he plan to do?

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.550
What's happening?

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.660
L-Look at the water!

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.060
Those ripples are unnatural!

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.690
This is the same energy
that removed your pain.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.660
Don't!

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.790
T-The frog wasn't hurt!

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.200
That was Sendo.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.960
S-Sendo?

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.240
Hamon, or ripple energy, creates Sendo.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:47.220
My Hamon energy went through
the frog's body and split the rock.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.410
JoJo, I know for a fact the mask
is still intact.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.100
Dio, the mask's master, holds it!

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.820
What?!

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.980
Did you just say Dio?!

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.110
I did!

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.740
I have sought the mask for decades!

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.990
I intend to destroy the mask
and vanquish its owner!

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.790
You are destined to fight
against the mask.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.410
You must master Sendo
or face certain death!

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.000
And humanity will fall with you!

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.690
T-This is...

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.450
JoJo, what's going on?

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.260
What does he want?

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.540
Erina...

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.260
I can't let her get involved in this.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.950
Anyone but her...

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.910
A-Astounding!

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.770
The blossoms!

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.740
U-Unbelievable!

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:48.550
The Hamon energy left from healing
his arm revived the blossoms!

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:55.110
This JoJo may be an untapped
wellspring of strength and talent.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.500
This youth may be the one
who can save the world!

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.690
My power is slowly returning.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.890
The food chain...

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.150
Pigs feed on grass.
Humans feed on pigs.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.400
And we feed on humans.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.110
Humans are our food,
so we are the true masters.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.080
Bon appetit, Jack.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.890
I'll start with a few wicked servants.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.400
Next, the world!

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.850
It will all belong to me.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.020
Humanity will kneel at my feet!

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.630
-One week later-

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.490
I studied Hamon under the tutelage

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.740
of the unfathomable Zeppeli.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.190
I knew I had to defeat Dio.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.850
And this is why.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.600
JoJo, let me tell you why
I am hunting the mask.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.490
It started when I was a young
Will A. Zeppeli.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:12.220
At the time I had a limitless thirst
for the unknown.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:18.270
I traveled the world as part of
my father's archaeological team.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.580
One day, we were excavating
an Aztec site...

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:23.830
You mean...

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.970
That's right. It was my misfortune
to unearth that cursed mask.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:39.430
On the voyage home, one of our team
donned the mask and chaos ensued.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:49.740
He tore off the heads of his companions
in a bloodthirsty rampage.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.740
The entire crew of 58 was killed.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.240
I dove into the sea to escape,
but he followed me!

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.850
Suddenly, dawn broke!

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.710
In the light of the rising sun,
I saw his face.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.940
It was the expedition leader...

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.270
...my father.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.230
The ship drifted away
with the mask still aboard.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.470
I was filled with dread

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.790
that the power of the mask
might be unleashed again.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.110
I knew I had to find a way to stop it.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.370
That path led me to the ways of Hamon.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.170
Hamon energy comes from the flow
of one's own blood.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.580
The mask drains energy
from the blood of others.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.030
They are two sides of the same coin,
the same energy!

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.170
I see!
It's like using fire to fight fire!

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:01.270
Correct. Strike them with enough
Hamon energy, and they will explode.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.330
And the waves created by Hamon...

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.360
...are the same as waves of sunlight!

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.170
Baron Zeppeli, please teach me
how to use Hamon.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.530
I'll do anything to learn it!

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.430
I'll teach you, like it or not.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:24.540
You will be Dio's first target
in his conquest of the world, JoJo.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.300
Listen, JoJo.
Breathing affects your blood.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.610
Your blood carries oxygen you inhale.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.610
The oxygen in your blood
affects your body's cells.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.180
Your cells are your body.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.560
Like ripples in the water, breathing
properly creates Hamon in your body.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.770
And that creates energy!

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.790
His arm suddenly extended!

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.010
How did he do that?!

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.050
It's called a Zoom Punch.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.620
I dislocated my shoulder and extended my arm!

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.830
Hamon energy dulls the pain.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.960
JoJo, do not break the rhythm
of your breathing.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.410
Hamon energy is sensitive
to emotional disturbances.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.050
Yes, sir!

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:14.840
Hey!

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.670
Jonathan!

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.300
Speedwagon!

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.600
We're headed for Wind Knights Lot?

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.460
That's right. I confirmed
that someone like Dio is there.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.120
Many have gone missing there recently.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.880
We have no time.
JoJo, your final test will be combat.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.610
Yes, sir. I'm ready to do battle.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.240
Same here!

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.130
Here's the entrance to
Wind Knights Lot!

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.620
We'll attack while the sun is still up.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.250
I left without saying goodbye to Erina.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.550
I will return to her!

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.070
What the...?

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.000
Driver, why have we stopped?!

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.690
Careful, there's no sun in here!

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.570
Hey, driver!

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.490
Is it Dio?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.650
Where did he go?

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.580
Both of you, step away from the horses.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.200
What in blazes?!
He was hiding inside the horse!

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.820
Jonathan, this guy...
This guy is bad news!

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.930
He's crueler and crazier than Dio!

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.940
So Dio's already gathered evil minions!

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.900
Stand aside, you two.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.190
I'll do the fighting.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.700
He's a zombie.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.030
They feed on the living to gain
eternal life.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.460
But they are mere puppets
that must obey their masters.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:17.830
I'll let you enjoy the most
exquisite terror!

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:23.800
Once the blood has drained
from your faces, I'll drink every drop!

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:30.700
Wriggle in despair, little worms!

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.070
Now, what's his next move?

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.350
If I were him...

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.270
JoJo, this method of thinking is key.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:44.500
First you must consider the situation
from the enemy's viewpoint.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:50.990
If I were him, I'd cut off the route
to the sun by blocking the entrance!

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.110
He's collapsed the tunnel's mouth!

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.550
Jump, Speedwagon!

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.520
Here he comes!

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.270
H-He's covered in knives!

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.110
S-So that's how he
shish-kebabbed the driver.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.530
Hamon Cutter!

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.420
My Hamon Cutter is far sharper
than your knives.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.670
JoJo, here's your next lesson.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.860
Think of a flea.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.920
A miniscule insect, right?

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.640
Despite their size, they
see fit to challenge towering humans.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.810
Should that be called courage?

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.690
I don't believe so.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.190
So what is courage?

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:05.610
Courage must know fear
and make fear its own!

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.950
Fear upsets breathing!

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.760
Conquer fear and your breath
will never fail you!

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.790
Hamon breathing comes from courage!

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.190
A good human is a brave human!

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.360
Courage is a marvel of humanity!

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.670
Though powerful,
zombies do not know courage!

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.550
They are just like fleas!

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.050
Sendo Wave Kick!

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.610
My Hamon energy has disrupted
the zombie's body.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.320
He didn't even spill his wine!

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.910
JoJo, you will finish him off.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:49.450
Destroy his entire brain.
That's the only way to kill the undead.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.980
Time for the slaughter,
you naughty little pigs!

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.260
I'll dice you to bits and eat you!

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.530
You're really going after him?!

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.170
It has to be done.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.930
But JoJo will do it alone.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.850
JoJo.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.180
You must destroy him
without spilling a single drop.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.920
One last lesson, JoJo.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:26.190
In the land of Norway, they say
the north wind created the Vikings.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.760
Spill a drop and
even if you destroy that zombie...

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.950
...I will abandon you.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.300
Listen to yourself!
Have you gone insane?!

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.580
You stay out of this!

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.260
I'll do it.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.210
The north wind created the Vikings.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.280
It's a labyrinth.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.030
It was made to create confusing
shadows even when lit.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.230
O-Oh, no! The fire!

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.460
The light will only make me a target!

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:18.410
But now I have no clue
where he'll come from.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.750
How fragrant!
The smell of fresh blood.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.330
First I have to think like the enemy.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.770
He must be close.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.500
Next, I have to make fear my own.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.560
I will control my breath.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.520
Come! I'll chomp down on your carotid
and pull it out with my teeth!

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.570
The harsh wind from the Arctic Ocean
gave birth to the mighty Vikings.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.330
In other words,
challenges can create opportunities.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.990
Will that wine create a Viking?

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.410
If not, then Dio has already won.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.040
These ripples! It's Hamon!

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.500
So my north wind is this wine!

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.840
The wine senses Hamon.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.580
It goes through the glass, my arm,
my body, the ground...

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.030
I can feel his vibrations!

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.910
The wine is a Hamon detector!

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.270
My spirit trembles!

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.270
I'm burning up!

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.060
I've found you, zombie!

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.080
Pierce this wall!

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.900
Sendo Hamon Overdrive!

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.870
Come here so I can suck your blood!

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.200
Sounds like JoJo figured it out.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.540
The north wind has made a new Viking!

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.600
Next episode

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.440
We meet at last.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.440
I lay my curse upon you!

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.890
Can he overcome this delusion?

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.640
A duel between heroes!

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.610
Dio, I'm ending your madness!

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.880
Chapter 5: Knights of Darkness
