WEBVTT

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.740
Using Caesar's bandana,
JoJo barely defeated Wamuu.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
Next, Lisa Lisa faced off against Kars.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.430
Von Stroheim and Speedwagon
appeared suddenly with help.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.450
However, in a cowardly turn,
Kars used a double to fight.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.770
He sprang out and
stabbed Lisa Lisa in the back.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.940
JoJo and Lisa Lisa are in
the greatest peril of their lives!

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.200
Kars, you bastard!
I hope you rot in hell forever!

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.580
JoJo doesn't know.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.570
He doesn't know that
that woman is his own mother!

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.970
Don't let go, JoJo.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.980
It's a forest of crystal spikes below.
She'd die instantly.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.940
K-Kars!

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.230
Your soul is as rotten as a pumpkin

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.740
left in a field that even flies won't visit!

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.120
Shout at me. Grumble at me. Insult me.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.910
While you're holding that rope,
that's all you can really do.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.940
From the silent depths

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.820
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.490
Crimson blood

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.130
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.430
If inherited love is called fate

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.760
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.150
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.650
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.780
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.700
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.580
Destiny written into your veins

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.340
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.550
Take hold of them

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.170
Chapter 24: The Ties that Bind JoJo

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.800
JoJo! Lisa Lisa!

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.430
JoJo doesn't realize
his mother's life is in his hands!

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.940
Mr. Speedwagon, we should tell him!

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.600
No.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.690
Why not?!

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.020
It's not the time.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.240
Von Stroheim, are you done
with the vampires?!

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.650
We have to help JoJo!

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.310
Give me a break!

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.390
You think we can get rid of them
in just a minute or two?!

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.200
Get out of my sight!

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.840
It's no good. They need more time!

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.050
JoJo...

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.190
Careful, the rope will slip
if you don't watch it.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.370
While you're holding the rope,
your hasty feet can only move so far.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.810
He kicked Kars,
but Hamon didn't flow into him!

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.920
W-We're in a real fix!

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.120
Looks like your Hamon is running dry.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.340
You might have just enough
for one last, all-out attack.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.990
I'll just stroll up to you and take

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.770
your life like I'm plucking a flower.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.360
Kars!

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.570
It's true I might have barely enough
in me for one final attack.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.370
I'm not exactly confident.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.750
But even so, I've come up with a plan.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.060
It's something to make you choke!

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.420
Do you want to know what it is?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.920
I won't tell you!

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.710
Hey!

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.680
You're not tying any ropes together!

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.680
This is a match!

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.680
What do you think I'll do with it?

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.230
Wh-What is JoJo up to?

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.970
He set his scarf on fire!

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.920
Before this fire burns me,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.490
I'll use all I've got
left to send you packing!

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.540
The fire is a gamble!

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.580
It's a risk to motivate me!

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.330
I seek life within death!

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.790
JoJo...

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.710
An act like that...

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.960
...is just desperation!

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.600
Don't toy with me.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.640
You're just dodging around
in order to catch your breath.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.440
I'll say it again:
I want to kill you at my leisure.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.200
I won't play king of the apes!

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.900
Come on, now! I need to breathe!

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.410
Who cares if I look silly?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.200
Listen.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.790
I can cut Lisa Lisa's rope
whenever I please.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.170
And if you dodge again, I will!

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.310
Is that all right?

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.920
Should I cut it?

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.470
You want me to do it?

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.060
You don't, do you?

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.390
Don't!

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.980
You ran before. Now come to me, slowly.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.820
If you want me to cut the rope,
stay where you are.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.820
The coward!

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.320
What's your choice?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.740
Is your life more precious
than this woman's?

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.580
Here's my choice!

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.680
I don't know what you're planning,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.760
but if I cut this, you'll fall as well!

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.260
You fool!

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.380
JoJo!

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.260
Lisa Lisa!

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.020
Idiot. That's two birds with one cut.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.600
What the...?!

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.480
He...!

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.860
This rope is connected to JoJo!

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.530
When did he do it?!

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.320
He didn't have the time!

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:32.450
When he first kicked, he let himself
be cut along with the rope!

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.760
While he lit the match, he secretly tied

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.250
his leg to her rope and made a loop.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.470
He needed a distraction.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.630
So he set his scarf on fire.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.980
And then to tie the ropes together,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.020
he let Lisa Lisa be cut down on purpose!

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.520
That cunning devil!

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.990
Now you're holding me and Lisa Lisa up!

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.240
You deceived me, JoJo!

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.620
I never thought I'd hear that from you!

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.250
It seems you like tricking,
but you hate to be tricked!

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.500
You may have lived
for over 10,000 years.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.930
But to compete with my skills,
you need another decade!

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.090
Kars!

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.010
Your time is up!

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.020
Hamon Overdrive!

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.270
D-Did it work?

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.410
T-That was the last of my Hamon.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.660
I'm burned out.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.410
I don't have any Hamon left.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.080
I-It got into him!

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.040
Yes!

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.920
He did it! He hit Kars with Hamon!

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.380
Off you go!

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.010
You...

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.000
Look! Kars fell into the crystal spikes!

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.350
He's finished! See?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.270
Hamon will travel right up his arm!

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.270
You're weak! Your time is up!

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.270
Even we could finish you now!

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.830
He's trying to spook us.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.800
All right! Let's eliminate him for good!

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.840
Bring out the UV amplifier!

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.800
Yes, sir!

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.600
Coach Lisa Lisa...

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.690
Kars said he didn't quite kill you.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.200
I don't think he hit anything vital.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:00.580
If we act quickly,
I'm sure you'll live through this.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.630
It's finally over.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.120
It is. I'm glad.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.590
Hey, Mr. Speedwagon?

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.180
Can I ask you something?

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:13.970
What is it?

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.470
Why did Granny Erina tell JoJo
his mother died when he was little?

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.840
Why does Lisa Lisa
hide her past from him?

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.730
Smokey, that's...

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.860
Granny Erina told me not to ask you,
but I have to know!

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.240
She's his mother.
Keeping that from him is awful.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.560
Smokey...

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.750
JoJo and Granny Erina are my friends.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:50.710
They saved me from crooked cops,
even though I was just a thief.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.130
That's why I'm here!
I'll do all I can to help.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.730
All right, Smokey.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.930
I'll tell you.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:13.740
You did take good care of Erina
while I was away from New York.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.700
But promise not to tell JoJo!

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.120
This is a Joestar family issue.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.280
It's not our place to talk about it.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.130
The name Lisa Lisa is an alias.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.260
Her real name is Elizabeth.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.550
She was raised by
a Hamon-user named Straizo.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:50.000
She and Erina's son, George,
fell in love and got married.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.850
George and Elizabeth had a son.
You know him as JoJo.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.220
JoJo's father George was
a member of the Royal Flying Corps.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.940
Aviation developed rapidly
during the First World War.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.920
George was among the first
brave pilots to fly into battle.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.650
He stood out as a hero
even among the Royal Flying Corps.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.150
However...

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.280
...a gut-wrenching horror from the past

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.600
came back to haunt the Joestars.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.710
Fifty years before, Dio had created
blood-sucking zombies.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.220
Straizo, myself and the others
thought we had exterminated them.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:15:00.220
But one had escaped, hid within society,
and lived for decades undiscovered!

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.390
He was a cunning, intelligent creature.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.400
He created no spawn.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:17.440
He ate even the bones and hair
of his victims, leaving no evidence.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.200
And by some wicked twist of fate...

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.250
...he worked as a commander
in the Royal Flying Corps!

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.090
T-The Royal Flying Corps?

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.370
With JoJo's dad?

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.590
The same.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.140
George uncovered his secret.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.810
He had listened well to Straizo and me.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.810
But ultimately,
George was an ordinary man.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:57.730
He had character and talent,
but he hadn't trained with Hamon.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.700
Before he could unmask the commander,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.770
he was discovered and attacked!

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.120
His message to Straizo wasn't in time.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:19.130
George's death was covered up
as a nighttime plane crash.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:28.680
Straizo and I found this suspicious,
and eventually found the truth.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:37.980
That night, I told Elizabeth
as she held an infant JoJo.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.940
Instead of showing grief...

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.280
...she flew out of the house!

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.880
She was a genius with Hamon,
but her emotions consumed her!

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.600
She was witnessed
when she killed the commander.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.440
The military didn't know
about zombies or Hamon.

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:26.000
They concluded that Elizabeth
had attacked their beloved commander,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.780
killed him, and burned his body.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.210
Soon she was known around the world

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.750
as a murderer and national traitor.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:59.560
We used all the Speedwagon Foundation's
resources to cover her trail.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.650
Elizabeth had to leave England behind

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.890
without even a word to her son.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.670
Erina knew what had happened,
and she had a request.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.160
When this child grows up
and asks about his parents...

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.670
...please tell him they both died.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.760
This child...

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.100
This child...

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:39.080
And so Elizabeth became Lisa Lisa.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.490
Why?

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.320
Why is it that way?

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.750
At least say his mother is alive!

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.160
I know painfully well why.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.310
Erina lost her husband and son in

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.670
the battle between Hamon and the masks.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.640
But thinking of her grandson, of JoJo...

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.720
...she didn't want Hamon in his life!

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.150
Lisa Lisa is the same way!

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.480
Such a tragic family.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.820
Such a miserable fortune.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.280
But now...

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.780
Now JoJo...

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.660
JoJo used Hamon
to save his mother's life!

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.500
Mr. Speedwagon...

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.130
Now there's no reason
for Lisa Lisa to hide.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.640
JoJo knows about Hamon,
and he used it to save his mother!

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.720
True.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.350
But it's not up to me.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.480
We have to know how Erina
and Lisa Lisa feel first.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.010
But...

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.860
Colonel!

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.360
We're ready to fire!

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.440
Right! Aim it right at him!

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.920
We will have the honor
of executing Kars!

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.390
Prepare to die, Kars!

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:31.550
I can't tell you how good it feels
to order this myself!

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.670
Don't, von Stroheim! The mask!

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.280
The Stone is in his mask!
UV light will help him!

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.080
D-Damn it!

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.420
Stop! Don't fire the UV amplifier!

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.460
N-No!

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:33.440
I-I didn't see him holding the mask.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.410
I didn't see him put the Red Stone in!

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.410
Dear God...

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.980
Kars...

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.560
Next episode

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.590
The ultimate life form...

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.450
He can manipulate life at will!

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.910
Is there no way to stop him?

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.570
Kars, the Ultimate Thing, is born!

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.710
