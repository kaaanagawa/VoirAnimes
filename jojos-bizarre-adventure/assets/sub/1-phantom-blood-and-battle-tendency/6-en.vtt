WEBVTT

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.280
Hamon will travel even better down here!

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.290
Underwater...

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.290
Turquoise Blue Overdrive!

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.670
Jo--

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.090
JoJo!

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.630
H-He did it!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.130
It's not over!

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.840
I can't believe he outswam
Hamon traveling underwater!

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.960
He's like lightning.
My Overdrive only scraped his head.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.690
It'll take a solid punch
to send Hamon directly into him!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.920
Lord Dio!

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.200
I thank you for giving me life and
the supreme honor of fighting this man!

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.800
He is made of the stuff of heroes.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.000
Now we fight without
the burden of water!

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.540
Now we face each other using skill,
technique and spirit alone!

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.260
Hold nothing back!
Show me everything you have!

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.120
Even as Dio's puppet,
he hasn't lost his pride!

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.890
But it has been twisted into
a love of violence!

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.980
Your blood will be one with my body!

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.920
Another hair attack?!

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.110
Bring it!
I'll give you a dose of Hamon!

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.200
Two stars fallen from the heavens

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.750
Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.880
Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.250
The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.340
And for the man who follows
his ambition...

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.030
...a sacrifice awaits

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.250
With pounding heart
and burning will

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.840
With thundering fists

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.340
And overflowing bravery

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.550
He steps forward, free of doubt

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.670
A fate determined by his blood

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.670
JoJo!

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.320
Chapter 6: Tomorrow's Pluck

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.170
Overdrive Barrage!

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.760
JoJo!

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.900
T-This is bad. Hamon can only be
projected from the extremities!

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.860
He can't cut Blueford's hair
with his arms tied up like that!

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.870
I-I want to help him,
but we have our own problem!

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.450
Tarukus! H-He's gonna...

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.040
I-It's tearing through my clothes
and into my skin!

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.960
Struggling only makes it worse!

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.880
His hair is draining my blood!

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.890
Here's your coup de grace, pup!

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.850
I'll slice off your head
and bathe in a fountain of blood!

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.270
Try this instead!

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.070
Metal conducts Hamon, too!

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.280
Metal Silver Overdrive!

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.440
G-Good show!

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.330
He turned blocking the sword
into an attack using Hamon!

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.050
My heart resonates...

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.300
Heat enough to burn...

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.510
My blood's beat is razor-sharp!

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.600
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.110
Yes! There's the sound
of flowing Hamon I'm so used to!

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.410
S-Something is different about Blueford.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.000
Now that I know his past
and personality...

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.250
This is for the best.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.380
He is a zombie
trying to spread his vile kind.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.880
He has to be destroyed.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.130
I am the Black Knight Blueford.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.470
This pain is nothing to me!

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.020
You're a mess, Blueford!

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.940
I can't believe his bloodlust
still drives him in that state!

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.030
What?!
What are you doing, Jonathan?!

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.780
Dodge or counter!
Why aren't you moving?!

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.620
What in blazes?

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.420
What are they thinking?

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.550
You said this pain just now.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.050
Pain.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.890
You feel pain.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.810
T-The flowers!

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.560
They're blooming at his feet.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.440
Black Knight Blueford's body
is being ravaged by Hamon.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.160
But pain has returned to him.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.620
The pain of being human.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:31.080
As Hamon destroys his zombie form,
it is restoring his noble human soul.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.590
That's why I stopped fighting you.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.380
And that's why you stopped your sword.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.050
His face is no longer twisted
by rage and hatred!

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.390
He looks like a son
peacefully talking with his mother!

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.990
You believed I would stop my attack.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.320
Your trust kept you
from counterattacking.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.050
Is your faith in humans so strong?

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.510
This pain means I'm alive.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.120
If I can feel pain,
I can feel joy as well.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.630
This is humanity.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.280
I am filled with an odd tranquility.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.270
I feel no bitterness.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:29.140
Here, at the end, I have met
a marvelous man of true compassion.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.260
I shall now return to my queen.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.690
Companion of a world 300 years
younger than mine,

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.260
tell me your name.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.200
Jonathan Joestar.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.290
Jonathan, I grant you the word engraved

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.210
into the sword given to me by my queen:

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.960
Luck.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.670
And for your future, I grant you this:

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.380
Pluck!

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.420
Sir Blueford!

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.350
What irony.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.770
What a twisted fate.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.280
Why did I have to kill him
in order to save his soul?

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.730
He left the world with hate,
but he had a proud spirit.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.290
His noble heart was bent
to terrible insanity!

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.790
The mask caused this!

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.960
And I'll stop Dio, the man behind it!

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.340
JoJo! Behind you!

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.000
Tarukus!

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.680
W-What the...?!

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.010
How could he heartlessly stomp the armor

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.310
of his dear deceased friend?!

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.560
Blueford, you spineless dog!

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.310
I admired him,
but cunning was his game...

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.570
...while I chose to be
a master of slaughter!

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.570
I crush, kill and destroy
using brute force alone!

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.320
Let me hear your anguished cries!

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.760
Nice catch, JoJo!

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.140
The cliff is crumbling!

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.470
These leaves...

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.020
JoJo!

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.930
Yes, sir!

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.780
Life Magnetism Overdrive!

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.500
Grab on, Speedwagon, Poco!

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.630
Humans create a weak magnetic field,
making them living magnets.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.970
An Overdrive can increase
that field's power.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.850
Sending the field into the leaves,
they created a magnetic sheet!

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.890
Amazing!

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.320
You have a lot of tricks!

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.570
Are you guys, uh, human?

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.950
Were you sent down from heaven?

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.290
I've been wondering that, myself!
I'm totally baffled!

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.210
And Baron Zeppeli,
you're the biggest mystery of all!

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.630
Where did you learn to do this?!

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:57.470
I came across a mysterious man
at a port town in India.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:03.230
He was young and shabby-looking,
but called himself a doctor.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.320
I was in for a shock.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.360
He took a gangrenous limb
and healed it with light from his hands.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.040
It was the power of Hamon.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:22.110
I felt that Hamon might be the key
to fighting the evil stone mask.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:29.880
So I traveled far up Tibet's Salween
River in search of the doctor's master.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.100
His name was Tonpetty.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.870
Stranger from a distant land,
I can see your future.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.490
Is it your desire to train with me?

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.750
To do so would alter your fate.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.250
You will be destined to die.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.420
I accept that.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.300
I have a purpose worth
risking my life for.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.560
I can't share Tonpetty's prophecy
with anyone, even JoJo.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.940
Y-You all right?

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.360
T-That sound.
Is that Hamon, too?

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.950
I-It's not!

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.910
It's Tarukus!

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.300
H-He's insane to leap in
to attack us from that height!

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.350
This glider is made of pure Hamon.
Touch it at your own peril.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.060
What's that?!

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.900
T-The old knights' training ground!

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.610
Jump for it before
Tarukus knocks us down!

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.080
That lunatic!
He slammed straight into the wall!

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.560
That'll destroy even a zombie.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.380
Unlike Dio, he can't regenerate,
so he should be finished.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.390
H-He's a machine!

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.850
He lives only for fighting.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.230
His bones should've been
powdered by that!

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.550
He's climbing up!

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.190
Our goal is to destroy Dio,
but he insists on getting in our way.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.710
We will eliminate Tarukus here!

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.870
JoJo, take the boy
somewhere safe inside!

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.840
There's something strange
about this door.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.140
C-Careful! These ruins
are where the knights trained to kill.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.760
They say it's full of traps!

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.730
Jonathan! Something's coming!

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.770
- Oh, no!
- JoJo!

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.610
W-What is this?!

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:40.700
Tarukus!

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.950
The Lair of the Two-headed Dragon.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.870
A chain death match after
300 years of boredom sounds perfect.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.730
The Lair of the Two-headed Dragon,
an ancient sparring ground!

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.510
Home of the chain death match!

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.230
I killed 48 here.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.510
You could call this sport my specialty.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.520
S-Stop, Baron Zeppeli!
It's just too thick!

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.780
Y-Yikes!
He's ruined his hands!

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:22.450
U-Unfortunately Hamon cannot
be used for destruction.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.830
Bricks I can handle, but not this door.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.790
JoJo is the same.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.620
He cannot break the chain holding him!

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:38.420
The key to the collar on your neck
is right here!

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.470
The doors can't be opened
from the outside during a match.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.090
The key to my collar is on yours.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.270
That means that taking the head
of your opponent...

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.570
...is the only way out of here!

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.150
Overdrive!

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.330
T-The chain is touching the ceiling

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.290
so Hamon won't flow into Tarukus!

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.220
My left humerus is cracked.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.890
I can use Hamon energy to fix it.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.770
But to do that,
I need to get this collar off!

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.480
I can't breathe!

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.940
JoJo!

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.200
D-Damn!
I wet my pants!

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.830
I-I have to get away from these guys!

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.210
They've brought disaster to my town!

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.250
Baron Zeppeli, that lever!

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.460
The door can be opened from the inside!

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.050
JoJo will fight on his own.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.550
But his battle with Blueford
has left him weak.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:10.310
I don't care how!
We have to find a way to join him!

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.060
I don't see any way in!

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.520
It's too small.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.570
They could never fit through.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.320
But...

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.570
...maybe I could.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:33.830
Blast it!

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.910
We can't get the door open.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.540
We'll have to use the cliff entrance
Tarukus used.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.210
B-But that'll take too much time!

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.380
We've got no other option.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.930
I'm always on the sidelines!

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.930
I'm powerless!

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.890
I can do nothing to help!

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.190
Look at me, Poco!

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.980
I said look at me!

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.300
Aww, he's scared!

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.610
He's quaking like a leaf!

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.260
Look! Look!

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.990
He's gonna cry!

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.290
U-Uh oh!

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.260
L-Let's get outta here!

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.010
S-Sis...

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.890
Taking it from those bullies again?

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.430
Come on, now.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.160
Why don't you try standing up to them?

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.000
I-I'll fight them...tomorrow!

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.690
So when is tomorrow?

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.650
Um, tomorrow.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:49.950
Poco...

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.370
What is the scariest thing to you?

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.000
Is it that sting you feel?

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.040
Is pain scary?

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:10.090
Don't you think growing up
being unable to do anything...

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.260
...would be scarier than pain?

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.850
I-I...

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.750
Relax, baby brother.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.900
I'll do the laundry when we get home.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.040
Poco!

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:39.740
A window!

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:44.210
Hey! Don't go in there, you fool!

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:51.380
Stop him! Tarukus would butcher a man
going in there, let alone a child!

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.280
Listen, kid! It's too dangerous!

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.840
Think what will happen
if those monsters win!

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.700
If that big JoJo guy dies,
they'll attack our town!

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.530
They'll attack Sis!

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.330
I have to be the one to protect Sis!

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.490
Sis! Tomorrow is now!

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.250
Stay back! It's not safe!

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.340
Keep out of this, brat!

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.390
Poco!

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.140
Pain isn't...

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.090
...what's scary.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.950
I did it.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.580
You did well, Poco.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.580
Don't worry, you're not that hurt.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.860
Now, Baron Zeppeli!
Go in there and crush him!

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:21.810
Baron?

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.560
You will be destined to die.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:28.730
At last...

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.400
Is it time for the prophecy
to be fulfilled?

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:38.570
If it is fate, I will simply accept it.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.410
Baron Zeppeli!

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.910
What did you just say?

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.640
Next episode

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.850
This is just too cruel!

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.290
You'll pay, Tarukus!

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.720
I'll stomp you!

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.650
JoJo, please, take up my torch!

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.920
