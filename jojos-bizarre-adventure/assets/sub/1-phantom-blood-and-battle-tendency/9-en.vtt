WEBVTT

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.420
M-Move, arm!

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.670
The Hamon will fill my head!

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.620
I have to do something
before that happens!

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.060
Lord Dio!

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.630
We'll find you a new body.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.830
An excerpt from the December 4, 1888
edition of The London Press:

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.300
"73 of the 452 people living in Wind
Knights Lot went missing overnight."

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.300
"Investigators have one lead
based on witness accounts."

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.680
"Four outsiders were seen burning
a man's clothing at the cliff's base."

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.770
"One of them was seen smashing
a curious stone mask with a hammer."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.750
Our work is done!

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.540
Two stars fallen from the heavens

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.970
Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.840
Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.430
The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.110
And for the man who follows
his ambition...

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.840
...a sacrifice awaits

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.500
With pounding heart
and burning will

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.030
With thundering fists

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.500
And overflowing bravery

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.580
He steps forward, free of doubt

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.750
A fate determined by his blood

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.630
JoJo!

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.520
Chapter 9: The Last Hamon

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.670
Joestar heir Jonathan Joestar weds

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.540
Erina, only daughter of the Pendletons!

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.170
They plan to spend their
honeymoon in America.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.500
Good heavens!

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.210
Look at the time!

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.880
They're about to depart!

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.050
Hey!

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.350
Hi, Mr. Speedwagon!

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.020
You almost missed seeing them off!

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.340
Sorry I'm late.
So where are they?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.890
They're on the ship.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.920
It's about to set sail.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.770
What?!

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.660
Where can I see them?!

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.030
Father STYX...

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.790
...we expect much
from your mission to Mexico.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.780
I'll do what I can.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.370
Jonathan! Where are you?!

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.500
Gangway!

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.380
What weighs so much in this thing?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.250
How should I know?
Some weird Asian told me to move it.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.280
Hey. Did you guys hear that?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.400
Quit flapping your gums and move!

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.590
We don't get paid till the job's done!

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.540
Ouch! What a bunch of louts!

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.830
Mr. Speedwagon!

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.500
Look! There they are!

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.410
Hey!

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.580
Mr. Joestar!

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.500
What a joyous occasion!

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.420
Make a happy life for yourselves!

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.180
I'll always be here for you.
If you need me, I'll come running!

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.810
Though I might just get in the way.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.190
Mr. Joestar!

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.570
Bon voyage!

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.870
-Atlantic Ocean, en route to America-

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.310
One bird all alone,
separated from its flock?

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.200
Erina...

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.200
Is something wrong?

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.370
Why are you crying?

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.410
These are tears of joy.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.580
Because I am with you.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.090
Even back then, you strove
to be a true gentleman,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.390
no matter the consequences.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.520
And now the proud
Jonathan Joestar is in my arms.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.520
I feel the same way.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.230
When my heart was frozen in despair,
you came and warmed me.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.150
I am happy to have saved a world
with you living in it.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.280
I wish Dad could've met you.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.990
Erina, let's go and eat!

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.790
Jonathan!

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.630
I was about to tell you
to watch your head.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.050
I hope today never ends.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.110
Crap, that's the engine room.
It sure fell into a filthy place.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.990
I could just sell it,
but it makes me money.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.030
Dear Lord...

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.490
You sure do like picking on me.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.630
I couldn't. I've never had alcohol.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.130
Try a little. Just a sip.
It's not that strong.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.010
Give it a taste.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.100
Here.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.570
Y-You're...!

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:50.950
Jonathan?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.040
No!

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.260
There's no way...

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.710
Dio is...alive...

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.720
Erina, go to our room and
don't forget to lock the door!

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.650
What's with this trunk?
The lock is open.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:27.030
That's funny.
I can see a catch glinting inside.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.580
That means...the trunk
is locked from the inside!

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.340
Stop!

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.590
You're...!

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.430
Is my new body here?

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.310
D-Dio!

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.430
Jonathan is worried.
There's something wrong.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.190
JoJo, look.
See what has become of me.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.450
There is a reason
I come before you in this state.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.580
Why would I show you my weakness?

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:17.080
Because, JoJo, though I once
despised you, I now respect you.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:22.600
I respect your courage,
your spirit and your power.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.090
I realize that now.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.340
Dio!

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.840
JoJo...

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.550
If it weren't for you,

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.990
I never would
have obtained the mask's power.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.970
But because of you, the world
has slipped from my grasp.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.820
If there is a god who controls fate,

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.610
I am sure he bound ours the tightest.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.330
Our two existences are truly one.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:59.170
I will take the body of
the only man I respect

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.990
and live in eternal glory!

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.690
That is the destiny laid out for me!

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.180
You will feel no pain,
that is my last gift to you!

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.470
His eyes...! No!

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.350
Live on as my body, JoJo!

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.310
Jonathan!

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.760
J-Jonathan...

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.870
Eri...na...

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.860
What a pity.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:00.270
If you had just held still,
it would have been a painless death.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.570
Torn from your fairy tale into hell,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:09.530
unable to understand or even speak?

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.040
Did JoJo never tell you of me,
the mythical dweller in the dark?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.530
I may not look like much, but surely
you remember me, Erina Pendleton.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.800
No, it's Mrs. Erina Joestar now,
isn't it?

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.920
Dio!

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.550
The ship's full of monsters!

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.790
As you ordered,
I drained the life of one passenger.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:05.130
And now most of the ship
has joined our family!

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.840
And now we go to America.
Isn't that right, Lord Dio?

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.050
I can't speak.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.270
I can't even breathe.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.850
Erina... Erina!

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.480
I have to save...

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.950
I can't charge my Hamon.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.780
Behold, Lord Dio!

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.200
The sniveling whelp can't breathe!

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.670
He'll cause no mischief
with Hamon now!

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.210
This is what he gets for
crossing you, Lord Dio.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.560
Now it's time to play.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.510
Or shall I just wait a few minutes
for him to suffocate, hmm?

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.930
Listen, Wang Chan!

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.180
I'll tolerate no insult to JoJo!

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.080
He is the man who brought me
to my current state.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.940
Show him some respect by severing
his head painlessly.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.360
Yes, Lord Dio.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.280
And now my dear friend's body
will become my future!

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.370
Jonathan!

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.670
He's up to something!
Stay back!

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.210
He might have one last trick
up his sleeve!

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:37.890
He can do nothing!
Surely Lord Dio overestimates him!

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:44.220
Now I'll scoop out what little brains
you have with my fingers!

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.850
Must...save Erina.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:53.360
I'll have to use the last bit of Hamon
left in my body all at once.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.110
A little will do.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.490
Look out, Wang Chan!

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.000
S-Something broke inside of my body.
Something important.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.420
N-No!

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.680
This... This is the end.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.050
My last Hamon.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.600
It was too weak to destroy
that zombie completely.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.110
But it was enough.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.590
W-What the...?!

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.410
JoJo must have done something
to Wang Chan's body!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.670
He disrupted its functions
without destroying it.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.670
He's made it cling tightly
to the machinery.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.920
A-And the device it's clinging to...

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.180
...is the paddle's screw shaft!

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.930
The strength of a zombie is enough
to stop the paddle!

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:11.940
If the shaft stops, the steam inside
the piston will keep building up!

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.940
And after a while...

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.940
...the ship will explode!

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.400
Jonathan, this can't be.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.450
How could this happen to us?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.800
R-Run, Erina.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.420
The s-ship will explode.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.720
I don't know exactly what is going on.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.620
It's too much for me.
I don't know if I should cry or scream.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.700
Maybe I should just faint away.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.730
But I can say one thing.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.480
Erina Joestar...

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.320
...will die with you.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:10.660
In the warmth of these lips, alas,
I feel the touch of death.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.620
Jonathan Joestar is dying.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.500
But we're together.
I want to stay like this forever.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.340
Until the ship explodes
and everything burns.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.340
Until everything is gone.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.660
It's all right to cry.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.460
But you...have to keep living.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.710
It's like a storybook!

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.250
You want me to save a baby and run?

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.140
To me, that heroism is cruelty.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.480
My only wish is to die with you.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:20.510
That woman died to save her child.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.240
My mother did the same for me.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.260
Go with the baby. Hurry!

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.790
You plan to destroy the whole ship!

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.920
JoJo, you really never give up!

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.560
But neither do I!

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.290
I will live! No matter what!

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.900
Along with your body!

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.310
Zombies!

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.610
Devour Wang Chan's body
and restart the piston!

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.110
It's starting to explode.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.250
Jonathan!

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.140
It's already exploding!

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.220
I have to protect myself
from the sun at all times!

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.510
So I am already prepared
in the event of an explosion!

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.110
Erina, take a good look!

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:47.150
Now that JoJo can't use Hamon,
I can safely steal his body!

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.500
Then I will step into that trunk,
my humble boudoir.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:57.860
That little shelter can withstand
a blast made by a ton of dynamite!

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.080
Here I come, JoJo!

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.420
And I bid you welcome,
my new, eternal body!

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.470
Jonathan!

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.020
Dio...

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:24.270
Like you said, our fates might truly
be one in the same.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.830
I feel an odd warmth toward you.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.740
Now our lives are bound completely.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.490
And they will vanish
along with this ship.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.370
Fare...well...

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.000
...Erina.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.420
Let me go, JoJo!

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.220
Release me!
Think about it!

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.970
You'd like a shot at eternity, right?

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:01.140
I can heal your wounds!
You can live forever with Erina, JoJo!

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.230
JoJo?!

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.980
He... He's...

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.960
He's dead.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.500
Jonathan Joestar
Died February 7, 1889

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:42.730
Jonathan Joestar
passed away into oblivion.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:50.530
His life was a piece of history
invisible to ordinary people.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:59.280
They will never hear the tale
of his noble accomplishments.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.630
But his descendants will.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.880
The new life that was inside me

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.550
at that time will surely hear his story.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.440
Erina Joestar was rescued
soon after near the Canary Islands.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.310
And the book of the stone mask
closed for a time.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:37.570
But this was only the beginning
of a new adventure.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:41.310

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.560
Next episode

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.310
It was the fall of 1938.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.110
Nice to see you, Speedwagon.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.400
How did you know that, bastard?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.360
Take him down!

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.570
I'm Joseph Joestar.
Call me JoJo.
