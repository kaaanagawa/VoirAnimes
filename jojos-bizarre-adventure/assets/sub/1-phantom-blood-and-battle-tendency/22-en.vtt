WEBVTT

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.580
The battle for the Red Stone!

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.370
JoJo versus Wamuu...

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.580
...in a chariot duel!

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.340
The match will begin when the moon
reappears from behind that cloud!

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.440
What a life I have.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.940
Why does Wamuu get all the fans?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.020
One lap is 960 meters.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.780
These horses can make a lap
in one minute.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.780
Look at that column.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.080
Each lap, a new weapon
will hang from that column.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.910
Weapons?

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.960
The one who reaches the column first

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.230
will be able to wield that weapon.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.050
For the first lap...

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.160
...it's a giant sledgehammer!

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.890
That thing could smash
through a chariot!

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.340
If Wamuu gets his hands on it,
my situation will go from bad to worse!

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.160
But if I get it first, cover it with oil
and fill it with Hamon...

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.950
...victory will be mine!

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.350
I expect an excellent,
fulfilling fight from you, JoJo.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.220
The moon is at the cloud's edge.
Soon its light will shine upon us!

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.050
JoJo, what are you doing?!

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640
It's almost time!

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.270
I know, I know!

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.270
The start is the key!

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.310
I have to check the rubble
under my wheels.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.400
Hey, Wamuu, it looks pretty bad down there.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.400
You gonna clear that up?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.040
JoJo, hurry and climb on!

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.880
JoJo!

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.510
Start!

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.990
From the silent depths

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.120
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.420
Crimson blood

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.220
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.470
If inherited love is called fate

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.730
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.240
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.030
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.080
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.790
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.670
Destiny written into your veins

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.390
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.060
Take hold of them

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.730
Chapter 22: A True Warrior

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.730
Start!

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.860
What the...?

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.280
L-Lord Wamuu is having trouble starting!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.330
His wheels are stuck!

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.290
JoJo did it!

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.210
That clever devil.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.880
Bastard, you were at work
while we looked up at the moon!

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.590
You cheater!

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.220
Rotten cheater!

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.420
I never thought I'd be called
a cheater by you!

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.230
When your life's on the line,
there are no rules!

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.070
I don't mess around
when it comes to survival!

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.110
Beep beep!

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.440
He's nearing the column!

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.330
JoJo will reach the hammer first.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.550
Mine! Mine! Mine!

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.840
Wait till I get my mitts on you!

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.340
Gotcha!

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.220
I'm going faster than I thought!

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.890
No!

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.640
JoJo!

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.520
Y-Yikes! It got caught on my ring!

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.360
B-But now this fight is in the bag!

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.400
What luck!

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.950
You can have the hammer.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.990
That was my plan from the beginning.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.200
Wamuu has some sort of plan.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.620
Show me your fighting genius!

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.340
A little oil and some Hamon!

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.590
Bring it on, Wamuu!

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.970
Wamuu slowed down.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.560
This is a fight to the death,
not a race.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:14.730
The proper usage of your weapon
and your horses is the key.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.160
Okay! Now I'll just move in and
whack him with my hammer!

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.580
JoJo, you can't slow down now!

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.830
You have the hammer,
so I'll grab something else.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.920
So, Wamuu, are you ready
to get slammed by this thing?!

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.430
He was so happy with his hammer,
but now look at his face!

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.190
H-He sure thinks b-bigger than I do!

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.440
No! Speed up and get away, JoJo!

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.610
Too late!

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.240
Now you have to abandon your chariot!

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.130
He fell? I guess the fight ends early.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.630
What will JoJo do next?

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.880
JoJo!

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.640
I give a 90% chance he'll be crushed
by my vampire horses.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.310
There's a 5% chance he'll break left...

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.190
...and a 5% chance he'll go right.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.860
Now what will our cunning warrior do?

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.150
M-My hammer.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.620
Where's my hammer?!

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.400
His hammer? Did he hit his head?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.620
A hammer won't save you now!

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.330
He mustn't dodge.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.630
If he does, Wamuu will stop and finish him

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.630
with a Divine Sandstorm!

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.930
But JoJo ran straight at Wamuu's horses!

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.140
Yes, JoJo! Quick thinking! That'll work!

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.770
He struck the harness
between the horses!

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:22.400
The horses ran on, and JoJo used
the hammer to send himself skyward!

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.490
U-Unbelievable!

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.080
The hammer's length
kept him from being kicked!

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.540
In your face!

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.210
And now to give you a good whack!

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.420
He's gone! Where'd he go?!

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.510
Wamuu is always a step ahead of JoJo.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.640
R-Right! These guys can hide
inside others!

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.610
That was close!

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.280
H-His boot!

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.870
It saved him!

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.610
If he wore a different kind of shoe...

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.120
Luck's on my side!

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.000
This hammer got caught on my ring.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.290
Luck is part of being effective!

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.500
Now look at yourself!

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:25.300
Your own power has trapped you
inside of that horse!

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.100
Here we go!

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.510
Here's Hamon for you
and your horse, Wamuu!

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.520
The fool! He doesn't see!

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.110
Look out, JoJo! Stay away from Wamuu!

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.830
Inside there, Wamuu's hands are free,

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.350
and speed and shaking are no issue.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.620
That means...

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.080
Nobody has survived a direct hit!
Caesar didn't!

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.170
You are caught in my Divine Sandstorm!

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.740
Even with just half a lap
around the arena,

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.260
it was a fight full of twists, eh?

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.530
But in the end, Wamuu was the better
thinker and the better fighter.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.480
Next up is the battle
between you and me.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.070
To be honest,
I prefer not to fight women.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.780
Wamuu dislikes it even more.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.590
Even so, all Hamon-users
must be exterminated.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.300
Drink that for a painless death.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.060
You seem to be mistaken.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.190
JoJo and Wamuu aren't done fighting.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.190
L-Lord Kars, look over there!

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.450
Huh?!

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.280
Lord Wamuu's arms look like
they're about to fall off!

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.160
M-Madness...

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.040
How did that happen?

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:28.010
W-Wamuu! What happened to him?!

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.510
It's JoJo!

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.980
He survived! He's up!

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.860
He's just fine!

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.600
W-Well, I did it again.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.400
That Divine Sandstorm hit him directly!

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.830
H-How...?

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.980
Directly?

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.860
JoJo was cunning enough to make
it look direct.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.410
He's an absolute genius of trickery.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.540
I don't know if I should praise him.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.780
Take a closer look at Wamuu.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.550
I-I see...

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.300
He wrapped Hamon-filled reins
around Wamuu's arms.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.140
Wamuu's Divine Sandstorm was hobbled.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.020
Wamuu was sticking his hand
out of the horse.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:30.150
I knew he'd stick his other hand out
to use his Divine Sandstorm.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.280
And I had the perfect counter!

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.910
Look at Lord Wamuu's face!

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.220
He's sweaty and pale!

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.080
Where is he looking? He looks vacant!

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.120
W-What should we do?!

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.790
It's lap two!

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.670
B-But Lord Wamuu can't grab
a weapon like that!

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.090
Can Lord Wamuu fight on?

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.220
It's no surprise.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.050
Wamuu was struck with Hamon
in the middle of his attack.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.310
The confidence he built over millennia
has crumbled.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:09.970
The quiet intensity his victories
gave him has vanished.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.910
It was surely a shock for him.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.360
But it matters not!
Put out the next set of weapons!

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.790
Lord Kars gave the order!

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.770
We must obey his command.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.300
For the second lap
both warriors get crossbows!

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.720
Each comes with two balls for ammo!

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.610
The faster warrior chooses
the large or small bow!

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.400
S-So now there's two weapons,
a big one and a small one?

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.620
Lisa Lisa, let me say
what's on your mind.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.370
Wamuu's mind is in no state to fight.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:12.630
So why is Kars deploying weapons
with such confidence?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.370
It makes you nervous, right?

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.240
Here's why.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.640
It's because Wamuu is a true warrior.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:26.310
Top athletes use a psychological
technique called the switch comeback.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.970
When pressured by shock, failure or fear

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:36.390
they can flip a mental switch
and bring out their fighting spirit.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:40.070
In desperate situations,
a ritual is needed.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.780
This is Wamuu's!

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.040
W-What the...?! What is he doing?!

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.770
Lord Wamuu!

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.130
Look at his eyes!

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.790
He poked them out!

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.850
I foolishly relied on my eyes
because I could see.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.760
JoJo exploited my weakness.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.600
Now I will use this horn
to see wind instead of light!

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.940
He flipped his switch
by removing his eyes.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.240
Wamuu is now psychologically invincible.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.700
Now he can sense the wind with his horn.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.550
He sees air better than light.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.450
W-What was that all about?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.290
That won't psyche me out!

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.900
We lost Caesar!

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.840
Your eyes are nothing compared to that!

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.190
Which crossbow--

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.260
--will you take?

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.930
Why ask? You know the answer!

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.020
The big one, of course!
I need more power!

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.230
That one does have power.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.110
Yeah, lots of power.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.900
N-No! I can't draw this thing!

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.660
S-So tight! Can I even bend this string?

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.370
You got greedy!

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.540
Even a normal crossbow
takes a lot of strength to draw!

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.950
You got greedy!

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.800
So greed got you back!

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.430
I'll use the first ball
to get a picture.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.240
Now I see the range.
The next shot won't miss.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.320
Damn. How can I shoot back?!

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.830
Lord Wamuu, blow him to smithereens!

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.870
Let us feed on whatever remains!

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.380
J-Just as I thought.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.560
The wind stirred up by the fire
makes it hard for him to see.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.890
This is the spot!

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.650
He's underestimating Wamuu.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.910
H-Hey, what's Lord Wamuu doing?

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.070
He's turned away from the flame!

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.940
JoJo is staying opposite Wamuu
and near the flame.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.250
He's giving away his position!

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.130
He's banking his shot
like a billiard ball!

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.180
Wha...?!

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.770
He hit me from behind!

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.490
I was looking at the terrain
as we circled.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.830
I wanted to find a wall
I could use on you!

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.830
C-Can't breathe!

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.590
It lost momentum,
so it didn't pierce the skin.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.550
But he's spitting up blood,
which means organ damage.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.970
Finish him, Wamuu!

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.510
But JoJo is a wily one.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.770
Be on your guard!

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.980
Has he set a trap?

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.450
My crossbow cocked itself
when it hit the ground.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.530
I can't let him know that!

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.200
I can't kill him from this far.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.960
Closer. Come closer.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:03.840
N-Now!

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:05.840
He has!

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.560
Almost! Almost!

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.900
His shot went wild, though.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:30.700
I should commend him for fighting
until the very last.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.900
Here I come, JoJo!

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.490
S-Stay away!

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.040
D-Don't get any closer!

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.000
Go away! Leave me alone!

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.040
Please, just spare me!

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.800
You cur!

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.830
Huh?

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.040
He's throwing rocks!

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.970
What a pathetic loser!

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.360
Go down like a man, little worm!

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.520
Wamuu...

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.140
...here's what you'll say next.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.980
Do not dishonor our fight, JoJo!

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.190
Do not dishonor our fight, JoJo!

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.240
Here!

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:21.620
A bat could fly between those stones.
But what about you, Wamuu?

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.000
A-An iron ball c-came from behind!

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.920
B-Bastard!

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.180
Looks like I did it again.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.310
Wamuu, I used the shot you fired
at me earlier.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.020
The arena went quiet.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.980
Everyone was silent.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.690
There wasn't even a moan.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.610
Wamuu's wound was
like a Jack-o'-Lantern's sneering grin.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.750
The iron ball carried
a small amount of Hamon.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.330
The wound began to fester.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.960
Wamuu's damaged arms grew worse.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.250
There would be no more
Divine Sandstorms.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.060
I-I have to r-resume my Hamon breathing.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.400
A kick after faking a fall?!

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.740
You're just lashing out in pain!

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.240
Rebuff Overdrive!

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.710
JoJo won! Wamuu won't get up again!

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:56.050
W-What has become of the great Wamuu?

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.010
I have fallen into such a sorry state.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.600
A body that lived for 12,000 years
is reduced to this.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.100
H-His arms!

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.900
His arms are gone!

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.280
It is not my way to give the enemy
an easy victory.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:20.410
My wounds are my flesh.
My losses are my ability.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.480
I will use all of this to claim victory!

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.870
His arms!

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:32.460
He fired his severed forearms
from the hole in his chest!

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.320
What the...?!

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.600
C-Can't breathe!
I can't use my Hamon breathing!

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.730
T-That wind.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.610
It's flowing toward Wamuu.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.660
This is my ultimate mastery of wind.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.040
Ultimate mastery? No!

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.680
Stop, Wamuu! You cannot do that!

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.430
The wind is going into those pipes!

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.800
My ultimate mastery:
Atmospheric Rift!

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.650
Next episode

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.190
You recreants!

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.690
No matter what the method...

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:02.780
Kars's stance...

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.560
You crossed a line
you shouldn't have crossed.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.660
I alone always stand on top!

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.930
