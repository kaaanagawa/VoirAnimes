WEBVTT

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.880
I have proof of your devilish plot, Dio!

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.700
He's caught me.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.220
But I won't run.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.170
I came back here to fight JoJo!

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.570
Two stars fallen from the heavens

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.740
Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.920
Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.440
The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.140
And for the man who follows
his ambition...

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.350
...a sacrifice awaits

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.450
With pounding heart
and burning will

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.960
With thundering fists

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.580
And overflowing bravery

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.580
He steps forward, free of doubt

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.480
A fate determined by his blood

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.720
JoJo!

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.060
Chapter 3: Time With Dio

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.060
ADJUSTMENT	I found the antidote.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.860
Dad just took it.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.060
Dio, I'm heartbroken.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.870
We were raised as brothers and now
I have to turn you in.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.050
I'm sorry.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.220
You might not believe that,
but I mean it.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.090
That compassion is very like you.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.900
JoJo, this is selfish,
but I have a final favor to ask.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.350
Please, give me time.
Time to turn myself in.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.160
What's this?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.500
I expected him to fight
like a cornered animal!

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.200
JoJo, how did you make it
out of that slum alive?!

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.820
I'll have to distract him,
then with one quick stab...

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.920
I regret my life until now!

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.830
Being poor when I was a child
made me greedy!

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.220
What I did was wrong.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.090
I tried to poison and rob
the man who raised me!

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.760
I came back to turn myself in.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.820
If I wanted to run,
I could have gone anywhere!

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.300
T-That's true.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.010
I want to make amends.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.890
Dio --

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.400
Careful, Jonathan.
Don't trust a word that snake says.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.110
Who am I, you ask?
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.430
I'm Robert E. O. Speedwagon,
the meddler.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.740
I was worried about Jonathan,
so I came back with him.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.750
Since I like you, Jonathan,
let me tell you something.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.780
I was raised in squalor,
and I've seen a lot of lowlifes.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.140
My nose knows the difference
between good and bad.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.690
And this guy stinks worse
than a pile of puke!

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.230
I've never met a man
as wicked as him!

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.230
Wicked because of circumstance? No!

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.200
This man was born bad!

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.450
This face is familiar to you, isn't it?

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.950
This man has testified
that he sold you the poison.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.200
I've heard enough.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.280
This is truly a shame.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.670
I put the same love and hope into you
as I did my own son.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.950
Dad, you need to rest.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.140
Right, I'll go to bed now.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.890
I don't want to see my son arrested.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.240
JoJo, do what you must.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.400
Yes, Dad.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.520
So this is the end?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.450
They won't catch him.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.400
That face and three moles on his ear...

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.910
He was born with the devil's own luck.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.920
JoJo, I want you to be the one
to handcuff me.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.720
For our years together.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400
All right.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.920
Be careful, Jonathan!

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.940
JoJo, being human means having limits.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.450
I've learned something.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.200
The more carefully you scheme,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.690
the more unexpected events come along.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.450
As long as you are human...

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.780
What? What do you mean?!

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.760
I'm throwing away my humanity, JoJo!

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.870
I'm moving beyond humanity!

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.860
Where did you get that?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.890
Watch out!

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.120
Shoot him now!

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.630
I'll use your blood, JoJo!

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.070
He...

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.470
Dad!

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.440
Fire!

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.530
JoJo...

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.980
D-Dad...

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.300
I should have dodged that knife.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.550
I let the mask distract me.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.100
You sacrificed yourself.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.560
Keep this.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.560
It was your mother's.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.060
Dad!

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.150
That wound is fatal.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.520
How could I let that happen?!

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.460
Sir Joestar... I told you...

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:09.350
It's my fault. If only I
had banished Dio's father.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.290
Dio's father?

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.660
When I first joined the force,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.120
there was a man who tried to pawn that ring.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.480
It was Dio's father, Dario Brando.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.400
Yes, it's definitely my ring.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.300
We had a pair made when
we were engaged.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.150
A burglar named Dario Brando
was trying to pawn it.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.440
Brando!

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.650
Sir Joestar thought he owed
a life debt to Dario Brando.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:53.150
But Brando was just a thief rooting
around for gold at the accident site!

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.530
Oh, no!

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.810
Did he happen to tell you that
I gave him the ring?

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.470
He did. What a flimsy lie!

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.110
It wasn't a lie.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.770
I did give it to him.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.810
I-Is that true?

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.150
He is innocent.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.650
Let him go.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.820
Why would you let him go?!

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.020
If I were born in his circumstances,
I may have done the same.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.290
Sell this and buy something
for your family.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.480
Then forsake criminality
and walk an honest path.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.550
Sir Joestar knew the whole truth
before he adopted Dio.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.550
Hang in there, Dad.
The doctors will save you.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.790
JoJo, please don't hate Dio.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.020
I am responsible.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.000
I was hard on you because
you are my real son.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.940
But in Dio's eyes, that may have been
unfair to him.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.940
That could have driven him
to do what he did.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.440
Please bury him next to his father.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.870
Dad...

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.460
JoJo, it's not so bad...

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.830
...to die in the arms
of your own son.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.790
Sir Joestar!

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.390
What a tragedy!

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.780
Now his kindness is gone from the world!

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.780
No!

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.790
Sir Joestar passed his noble spirit
along to Jonathan!

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.790
It has become his iron will, his pride
and it will create his future!

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.080
Normally I hate spoiled crybabies.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.790
But they are different.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:11.240
They live life with no regrets.
They're giants!

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.550
T-The body!

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.990
Dio Brando's body is gone!

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.070
You, cop! Get away from the window!

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.450
H-His head...

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.800
H-He's still alive!

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.060
How?! We filled him with bullets!

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.560
Watch out! I'm sure he has a weapon!

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.310
I-It can't be!

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.250
He's coming this way!

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.820
What are you waiting for?! Shoot!

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.950
Dio, stop right there!

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.290
Dio!

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.770
Hurry up and
pull the trigger, Jonathan!

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.530
He's not dead, even after that.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.990
I don't get it.
I can't understand what's happening.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.000
How could this be?!

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.500
JoJo...

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:12.760
This marvelous power comes from
the mask, and your father's blood!

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.360
He's sucking out that man's life!

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.860
Dio, just what have you become?!

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.990
I-I'm so confused...

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.540
The knife... Dad's death...
Blood... Dio... The mask...

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.550
My notes... The brain...
Unknown abilities... Unknown strength...

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.770
Dio, you aren't human anymore!

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280
Dad...

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.030
Stop! You don't stand a chance!

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:20.280
I've never seen the like!
Anything that powerful is a monster!

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.780
You're right.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.900
Honestly, I'm scared.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.330
But Dio, I can't let you live like this.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.960
It's my fault. I'll finish it!

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.590
Jonathan, stop! You'll just be killed!

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:41.030
The brain! The mask unlocks
the brain's hidden potential!

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.850
So in order to beat Dio...

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.420
The bodies!

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.440
Warm blood...

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.610
I want to lick it all up!

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.780
You don't mind if
I suck your blood, do you?

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.370
This is hard. He was my brother.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.520
Dad, please lend me your strength.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.600
I have to be strong.
Dio is no longer human.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.740
He's a monster!

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.150
Watch out!

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.160
I can't let Dio kill another person!

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.420
H-He caught it!

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.020
Even after it went through his hand!

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.230
Wait, the hole in his head
has already healed!

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.350
He's completely immortal!

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.730
You're weak! So weak!

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.470
JoJo!

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:24.100
I have to play with you a bit more
to test out my new powers.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.190
Even I don't know how far they go yet.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.750
Hiding?

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:55.190
Didn't I just tell you?
Human schemes have their limits.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.420
Cease your useless struggle.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.560
Cowering behind the curtains, are we?
Come on out!

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.290
It's not a scheme. It's courage!

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.610
He's regenerating while he burns!

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.510
Is that the source of his immortality?!

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.100
This fire isn't enough!

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.770
What are you doing?!

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.570
Get out of here, Speedwagon!
This doesn't concern you!

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.260
You can't go up!
The fire is spreading!

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.430
Jonathan, what are you planning?

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.190
Come on up, Dio!

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.330
Dio, I won't let you go
beyond these walls!

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.160
Jonathan, don't!

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.950
Is he using himself as bait
to protect his friend?

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:44.980
It doesn't matter.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.940
I'll just use your blood
to heal these burns.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:02.690
Fleeing up here is useless!
Falling from this high won't hurt me!

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.720
Instead, now the fire has cornered you!

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.190
Dad...

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.520
Dad, I'll miss you.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.880
Please go to heaven
along with those flames.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.020
And then, help me accomplish my goal.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.670
Give your strength to the fire.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.270
What is Jonathan doing?

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.060
No! He couldn't be!

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.940
Stop! You mustn't do it!

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.430
H-Here he comes.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.630
Utterly pathetic!

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.130
Suddenly, JoJo's youth
flashed through his mind!

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.270
My youth...
My time with Dio...

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.020
Now I'm going to settle the score
for all that time!

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.530
He's trying to make the fire
burn as hot as possible!

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:35.030
If the fire burns Dio faster than
he can regenerate, he'll die!

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:41.040
So Jonathan waited for the flames
to spread before going to the roof!

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.670
Don't do it!

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.340
H-How dare you!

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.870
The mansion my ancestors lived in
is burning.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:01.420
Dad is dead, I have nothing left.
Nothing but my life.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.940
I'll let myself burn!

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.630
I'll end your ambition
in exchange for my life!

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.030
Goodbye, JoJo!

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.370
For a second there I admired your guts.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.180
Now cry tears of joy
since you can die with your dad, fool!

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.370
I'm beyond human! Invincible! Immortal!
I will rule this world!

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.140
JoJo, you gave me this power!

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:48.650
I can't reach!

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.570
Dio, I'm back!

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.330
What?! How?!

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.000
I won't let you go!

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Your fate is sealed!

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:12.920
Here! This is the knife
you killed my father with!

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.660
I've crushed his arms to dust and he's

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.130
on fire, but he just won't let go!

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.360
Very well!
Let's go into the inferno together!

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.010
But you'll die alone!

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:40.870
I'll find a way to escape,
no matter how hot it is!

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.560
Dad! Lend me your aid!

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.880
A scream! A desperate cry!

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.570
Whether at an urge from beyond or

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:57.340
an instinct to use his burning home...

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.840
JoJo kicked!

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.080
And across from that spot...

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.520
What the --

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.350
...was a statue of the Joestar
family's guardian angel.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.120
How could a worm like you...

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.320
I completely forgot!

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.540
The more you beat him, the tougher he gets!

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.550
JoJo!

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:34.030
This wasn't what my life
was supposed to be.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.510
Jonathan!

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.020
Dad...

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.780
You're alive.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.020
You're alive!

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:53.160
He...

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.520
He won!

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.090
There it is.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.650
Next episode

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.790
Courage is knowing fear!

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.420
This guy's worse than Dio!

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.350
Wriggle in despair!

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.910
Who do I look like?

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.660
Please, teach me how to use Hamon.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.890
