00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.800
The spines of this mask can pierce
a human brain.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.500
But they haven't the power
to pierce our immortal brains.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.170
We need more power.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.430
Oh, what's this?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.390
It's called a Red Stone of Aja,
a rare and beautiful gem.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.470
It refracts light billions of times,
making it strong and pure.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.150
Its power is miraculous.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.260
But it is not enough!

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.950
This tiny stone doesn't
give the spines enough strength.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.710
To complete our mask,
we need a flawless Red Stone.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.300
We need a super Aja.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.260
Once we have it...

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.770
...we will conquer the
sun, and become the final,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190
perfect step in evolution.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.190
The masks were invented by
the most intelligent among them, Kars.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.860
Kars and the others crossed the
Atlantic in search of a super Aja.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.660
Suzie Q.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.820
Yes, Madam Lisa Lisa, here it is.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.870
Thank you.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.920
In my hand is a perfectly flawless,
natural crystal.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.000
A super Aja!

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.140
You had a Red Stone of Aja?!

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.680
The Pillar Men wiped out
the warriors of Hamon.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.060
But this Stone narrowly escaped them.
I am its current guardian.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.510
Caesar, I know how you must feel.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.700
The stone masks killed our grandparents,
along with countless others.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.660
And we've met its inventor, Kars.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.460
Smash it!

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.330
Smash the Red Stone!

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.750
If you break it,
they'll cry like babies.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.010
I cannot do that.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.170
Why not?!

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.650
There is a legend that they
cannot be defeated without the Stone.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.470
Why the heck not?!

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.470
I don't know.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.650
But I perform my duty as guardian.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.110
JoJo, Caesar...

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.990
You must take a final examination.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.860
A-A final exam?!

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.950
Caesar, you must defeat Meshina.
JoJo, you must defeat Loggs.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.970
From the silent depths

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.060
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.400
Crimson blood

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.160
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.460
If inherited love is called fate

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.710
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.220
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.020
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.060
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.780
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.610
Destiny written into your veins

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.370
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.580
Take hold of them

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.580
Chapter 17: The Deeper Plan

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.140
Are you ready, Caesar?

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.890
I'm more than ready!

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.820
It's almost dawn.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.820
It's always darkest before dawn.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.490
Now where on earth
is Loggs hiding?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.190
I have to stay sharp.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.480
I have a score to settle with him.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.000
Is that Instructor Loggs?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.840
H-How horrid!

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.300
I-It's unnatural!

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.050
Instructor Loggs!

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.990
H-He's dead!

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.890
E-Esidisi!

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.560
So you came to Venice, to this island.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.030
To think that the woman guarding
the Stone is just an island over.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.250
His lungs were pulled out.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.580
Lungs are vital for Hamon-users.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.590
It had to have been one swift kick.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.390
The tyrannical Loggs.
You yelled at me for three weeks.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.430
To be honest, I hated you.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.560
I thought I would finally
get back at you for all you did.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.410
But watch me from up there,
my instructor.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.440
See the fruit of your torture!

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.210
Hey, Esidisi, it's six days early,
but I'll take it now.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.960
The antidote in your nose ring is mine!

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.180
Out of my way.
I don't have time to deal with you.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.470
Time? You have way more time than me!

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.650
That was sharp.
I think you've grown smarter.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.230
But when somebody
looks at me like that...

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.110
...they're asking to die.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.000
I'll tell you once more.
Get out of my way!

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.950
Touch me and you'll lose half your body!

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.460
Make me!

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.960
What's this?

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.550
Well? Get me out of your way!

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.250
I only move
if there's dog poo in my way.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.060
His Hamon is breaking through my skin!

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.690
He's learned much control
in just three weeks.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.320
However!

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.120
I must say your new skill surprises me.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.630
But you're still far from ready
to fight against me!

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.460
I met and devoured countless
Hamon-users like you 2,000 years ago!

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.970
If I twist and break your finger off,
you'll never use it again!

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.100
Like this!

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.240
You finally noticed?

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.520
Your arm is wrapped up
in a fine silk thread.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.640
It's soaked in vegetable oil
so it conducts Hamon well!

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.240
I was aiming for your neck,
but there was no chance!

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.710
H-How did you do it?!

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.620
I-It's...

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.080
It's a little morbid for my tastes.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.460
First blood goes to my instructor
and me, Esidisi!

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.220
2,500 years ago, a man in China
wrote The Art of War.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.810
He said this:

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.730
Victory is decided
before the battle is fought.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:04.490
That means laying strategies
while your opponent is unaware.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.550
I skipped school a lot.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.510
But Granny Erina made sure
I studied history!

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:17.250
You may have lived a long time,
but you don't have a head for strategy!

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.590
Take this!

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.180
W-Why you...?!

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.770
Oh? Are you mad?

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.850
Are you upset that
I disintegrated your arm?

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.110
Get upset! I'm far more furious!

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:45.070
Because of that ring you put in me,
I haven't slept right for weeks!

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.830
I can't take it!

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.130
I just can't take it!

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.000
W-What's he doing?!

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.510
H-He's bawling!

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:10.550
I thought he'd blow his top for sure.
This Esidisi is full of surprises.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.180
T-This is embarrassing.
He's throwing a tantrum!

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.360
My poor arm!

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.380
Some things are creepier
than anger.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.910
I'll finish him quickly.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.050
Ahh, I feel better now.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.630
My emotions get out of control.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.470
When I'm about to lose it,
I calm down by crying for a while.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.550
You referred to Sun Tzu, right?

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.440
I know him, too.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.980
Long ago, I journeyed to China.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.390
All war is deception.
To fight is to delude.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:16.400
Anger your enemies to
lure them into mistakes.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.540
That's what you're planning, right?
I won't fall for it.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.280
But JoJo, I really am shocked
at your improvements.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.960
I admire your Hamon.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.470
I've longed for a worthy opponent.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.550
W-What are you doing to his arm?!

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.520
It's a bit thin,
but it will grow thicker in time.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.560
H-He's too much!

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.150
He was crying a minute ago!

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.650
Oh, JoJo, I believe I've frightened you!

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.240
Admit it, you're scared of me!

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.910
I-I can't read him!

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.180
I've always read my opponents

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.030
and used their feelings against them.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.440
But Esidisi's personality is beyond me.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.130
Am I the one being read, here?!

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.680
W-What's happening to Loggs's body?!

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.180
I-It burns!

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.810
H-His body is boiling!

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.060
How in the...?!

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:31.550
An animal's temperature rises
when it moves or fights disease.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.070
I can bring my blood to 500 degrees
and shoot it out.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:41.410
I sent my boiling blood into him
when I took off his arm.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.580
Wamuu can control the wind
with his Divine Sandstorm.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.880
But I am a master of fire.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.170
Heat is my domain!

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:56.470
Your power to utterly destroy a body
is astounding.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:02.020
But I can see you're just
trying to scare me by doing it!

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.730
Try a Clacker Volley!

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.860
My Hamon isn't like it was a month ago!

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.190
I really did frighten you.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:19.950
Your emotions caused you to attack
recklessly and too soon, JoJo.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:28.500
My veins will inject boiling blood
into your head and turn it into stew!

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.380
This is why I am called
the Burning King!

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.390
JoJo...

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.770
Take this, Caesar!

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.570
Bubble Launcher!

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.580
Stop! That's enough!

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.910
If we continue,
one or both of us will die.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.170
No, I hate to admit it,
but I'd be the loser.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.260
I have trained here
ten years longer than you.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.640
But your Hamon burned off all the hair
on my right arm.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.770
What can I do
after being shamed like this?

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.060
You passed your final exam
with flying colors.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.880
You're more interested in your

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.410
good-for-nothing friend's exam, Caesar?

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:56.880
I am only this strong because
I didn't want JoJo to outpace me.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.800
And both of us are going to survive
our upcoming battle.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.060
I'll say this, JoJo seems
lazy and impudent.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.270
But he's good deep down.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.990
You're bad at making friends,

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.580
but when you do, I guess it's true love.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.530
T-That's...!

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.670
Esidisi!

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.240
That was a clever dodge.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.540
T-The mask protected me, but...

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.420
H-Hot hot hot hot!

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.800
Damn his blood!

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.790
Blast it! These sexy lips
finally come out from under the mask,

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.680
and you just burned them, bastard!

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.520
JoJo, on the surface
you make witty banter.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.990
But in your head,
you're planning, aren't you?

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.910
You turned pale, JoJo!

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:08.790
Did I hit the mark?
Was that a bull's-eye?!

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.330
My next plan...

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.880
I-I'll use the string!

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.550
I'll act like I'm dodging.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:25.220
But I'll run a string along
these spikes while I move.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.510
I can't let him catch on.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.660
Once he steps inside the string,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.520
I'll wrap him up, then use Hamon!

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.030
T-That laugh means trouble.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.450
C-Could he be reading my plan?

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.620
No, that's impossible!

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.420
Here's the Burning King's Prison!

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.390
How long can you
keep avoiding my attacks?

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.060
So you noticed at last.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.400
Why is my hat shrinking?

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.730
You're caught in my web!

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.450
My hat is 100% wool.
It conducts Hamon just fine.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.030
Oho?

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.710
W-Why are you smiling?

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.530
Is there a reason?

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.830
Your next line is,
I'll wipe that smirk off your face!

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.290
I'll wipe that smirk off your face!

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.800
B-But that's my trick!

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.660
A web? Look around you!

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.050
I am the one spinning a web!

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.640
I knew about your little plan all along!

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.520
JoJo, what did you say?

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.820
Victory is decided
before the battle is fought, was it?

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.280
True, true.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.410
True, true, true!

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.170
How very true your words were!

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:19.790
But my plans were the ones to go
deeper and decide victory!

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.040
My veins have given you some new holes.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.840
Now I'll fill them all
with my burning blood.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.350
You'll look like a lovely birthday cake
covered in candles!

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.870
He's on a knife edge!

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.700
H-He won't make it!

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.680
Caesar!

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.960
Judging from what I can see,
I assume Loggs is dead.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.160
If JoJo falls,
Esidisi will come after us next.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.910
JoJo's too far away for us to help now.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:00.380
It hurts, but we have to think about
Lisa Lisa and the Stone.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.000
Now, let's prepare to move.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.490
JoJo...

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:15.510
Let me hear your screams
as you twitch and writhe in despair!

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.150
You laugh as I hold you
on the edge of death?

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.070
Has the fear driven you mad?

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.580
Well...

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.110
My arms are folded and
my eyes are closed.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.750
This is a victory laugh, Esidisi.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.630
You lost today because
you snoozed for 2,000 years.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.420
I lost?! You say I've lost?!

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720
Oh? You don't get it?

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.640
You can't read me?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.290
You don't understand
you've already lost?

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.270
You said your plans went deep,
but mine went even deeper!

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:10.780
Humans have been progressing
for the past 2,000 years.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:18.200
In the 18th and 19th centuries,
sleight of hand became entertainment.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.080
I'm a huge fan of it.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.120
Illusion is my thing!

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.770
B-But I cut those strings!

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.880
How are they still whole?!

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.390
My rope magic worked!

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:38.640
I laid my trap so that even if
the string was cut, it would be safe.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.270
Cutting here
leaves the white string whole.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.270
A simple trick.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:51.030
Now you'll say, My veins will move
faster than your pathetic Hamon!

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.740
My veins will move faster
than your pathetic Hamon!

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.860
Feel the beat of my Hamon Overdrive!

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.280
I can't... I can't...

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.380
You're a human...

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:17.760
I... I-I am the highest life form!

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.850
I won't be beaten!

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.490
That's it!

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.600
You've pushed me too far!

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.490
Esidisi's body is leaking
some kind of energy!

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.540
Is it the energy from
millennia of life?

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.200
Die already!

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:48.380
Die with the power you stole
from thousands of innocents!

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.590
My instructor, I must thank you
for torturing me.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.220
Grazie, Loggs!

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.920
Santviento turned to stone
and only feigned death.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:21.080
But even Esidisi's bones were destroyed.
Why is he different?

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.990
Maybe it's just because my Hamon
became stronger.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.580
He's dead now, and I have
one of the antidotes I need.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:42.680
I guess it reminds me of snot
because it's dripping from a nose ring.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.190
But I have to drink it.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.970
All right! I think it worked.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.880
The ring around my windpipe is gone.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.290
So, now I'll go see
Caesar and Lisa Lisa.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.070
I think I used my head too much.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.670
My shoulders are sore.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:26.180
Six days until
the ring around JoJo's heart dissolves.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.690
Next episode

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.580
How about the white one?

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.770
Wait until we cross!

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.530
But I really do like this design.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.240
I'll eradicate them.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.430
Which to choose?

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.840
Damn it! I can't hit her!
