WEBVTT

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.530
The poison rings in JoJo's chest and
neck cannot be surgically removed.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.330
Before the rings dissolve
and the poison is released,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.210
JoJo has to defeat Wamuu
and take the antidote!

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
Venice, Italy

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.970
What a disaster!

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.050
I only said one month as a bluff,
but they took it seriously!

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.260
I should've said one year!

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.970
Hey, JoJo...

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.190
Quit screwing around!
Start thinking!

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.570
I-I am thinking!

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.900
But there's no point
in thinking too hard about it.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.780
Not only for me.
You'll get depressed, too, Caesar.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.750
JoJo, you need to at least learn to do
what I am about to do.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.420
The water isn't falling!

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.090
JoJo, catch!

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.090
Hold it like that.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.300
That's all? Piece of cake.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.970
Here's what went wrong.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.350
The strength of our Hamon
is about equal.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.020
But you always release it
in a burst from your palm.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.030
That's why the water exploded.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.490
But I was releasing Hamon
from the tip of my finger alone.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.830
Just one point.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.870
Using one point creates a vibrating skin
that holds the water.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.790
Scattering Hamon like you do
wastes energy.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.930
A squirt gun with a smaller hole
shoots farther. Got that, chump?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.470
Listen, JoJo. You have to train
to control your Hamon completely.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.600
That is why we came to Venice,
the home of my coach!

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.050
Oh, no!

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.820
The two words I hate the most are
effort and work!

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.030
31 days until the rings dissolve

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.000
From the silent depths

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.090
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.430
Crimson blood

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.190
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.490
If inherited love is called fate

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.740
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.250
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.050
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.050
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.760
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.640
Destiny written into your veins

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.400
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.610
Take hold of them

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.540
Chapter 16: Lisa Lisa, Hamon Coach

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.120
What's this?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.340
I thought Venice was a tourist town.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.050
Why would a master of Hamon be here?

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.800
Excuse me.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.760
We want to go to Air Suplena Island.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.020
Gondolier, are you listening?!

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.700
He's standing on a floating oar!

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.290
W-Who the heck is this guy?!

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.460
What the...?!

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.430
You'll get it now!

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.940
I don't know who you are,
but you're going to pay for that!

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.280
You can use Hamon well enough
to stand on water, hmm?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.070
A woman?!

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.870
C-Coach!

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.900
She is called Lisa Lisa.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.960
No one knows her true name,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.810
her history, or where she learned Hamon.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.000
But she will be our coach
for the next month.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.430
I still have to make you pay
for hitting me with that oar.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.680
I won't hold back because you're a girl!

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.180
I tested your talents
and found them superb.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.020
I'm impressed you can walk on water
without training.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.520
However!

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.780
You must be prepared to die
if you want to master Hamon in a month!

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.280
S-She's made a high bar!

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.130
What the...?!

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.930
Joseph Joestar, you will wear that
breathing correction mask at all times.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.730
I can't--

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.790
Use rhythm. With proper rhythm,
you'll have no trouble.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:20.280
But if you fail to maintain rhythm,
the mask will begin to suffocate you.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.740
You will learn to run 100 kilometers
with the mask on!

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.830
Take this stupid thing off right--

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.330
I-I can't breathe!

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.390
Your training has begun.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.880
I'll take it off for meals
and tooth brushing.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.590
JoJo, just maintain your rhythm.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.590
It'll be like wearing a Halloween mask.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.850
Y-You're gonna get it, you--

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.850
I have one more thing to tell you.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.520
I am not teaching you
so that you can save your own skin.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.990
I am forging warriors
that can destroy our enemies!

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.710
Y-You witch.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.860
You want another round with her?

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.700
I don't hit women.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.000
Now, Caesar, JoJo...

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.080
...welcome to Venice!

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.000
Sheesh.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.510
I respect her skill with Hamon,
but I'd never marry a girl like that.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.260
She's kinda cute, though.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.770
Bow to her!

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.060
What? Why is a playboy like you
so polite to her?

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.060
I respect my coach like my own mother.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.490
I won't tolerate rudeness toward her.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.290
Air Suplena Island is 30 minutes
northeast of Venice by boat.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.570
Compared to the city,
it is dark and mysterious.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.410
But the island's beauty
matches Lisa Lisa perfectly.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.670
This is our new training ground!

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.170
That entire island is my home.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.050
We have to prepare to face death, eh?

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.840
Just how will we train?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.600
I see.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.520
You're safe, and so is my grandson.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.850
I couldn't be happier.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.570
Tell Granny about the poison rings
and I'll beat you senseless!

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.360
I can't tell her. How could I?

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.500
This is the prologue,
we call it Hell Climb Pillar!

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.330
W-What?!

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.500
What's this about?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.730
C-Coach, are we really starting
with Hell Climb Pillar?

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.380
I haven't ever attempted it.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.930
Hell Climb Pillar has claimed
many trainees' lives.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.140
If you cannot overcome this test,
you have no right to be here.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.050
Hey, don't keep this a secret
between yourselves!

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.770
What the hell is this Hell thing anyway?

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.650
Step through these doors and you'll see.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.240
Coach, no!

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.670
Th-This is...

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.790
...oil!

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.800
It's flowing down this pillar.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.480
It's 24 meters to the top.
Climb using only your hands.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.800
There is no other exit.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.850
If you can't climb,
you'll die down there.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.810
We have to get up this slippery,
24-meter tall pillar?!

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.800
30 days until the rings dissolve

00:09:54.370 --> 00:10:01.380
A test of endurance using Hamon,
the grueling Hell Climb Pillar!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.300
This is bad.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.340
I can barely cling to the pillar.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.300
Moving my fingers even a bit
is exhausting.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.810
Falling off of this pillar just once
would leave me

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.640
with no energy to climb!

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.230
We'd starve and die!

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.810
JoJo and I both!

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.280
JoJo, the longer it takes,
the harder it will get!

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.570
Hurry and climb!

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.740
N-No!

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.450
I have to worry about myself!

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.600
I lost control just by talking.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.960
This is ridiculous!

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.260
I just got here!

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.970
She knows I don't have
the power to climb this bloody pillar!

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:57.430
Damn her! Just tossing
us down here like that!

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.150
She's lost my respect after all!

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.980
I've always been nice to girls.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.400
But I'll come up with some way
to torture her later!

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.350
Bloody hell!

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.370
A lot of trainees died
trying to climb this thing, huh?

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.870
Are you sure they weren't simply too stupid?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.800
Using anything but Hamon
is an insult to the pillar!

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.810
Hell Climb Pillar loves only Hamon
and rejects all else!

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.560
Never forget that!

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.980
Wait! Hold on, Lisa Lisa!

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.690
I mean, Coach!

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.390
Y-You won't really let me die down here

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.260
if I don't have the power to climb up.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.320
It's my first day here.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.870
This is just a test to fire me up.
You'll pull me out later, right?

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.170
Such cold eyes!

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.300
A look like that means
she'll really let me die!

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.800
Blast it all!

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.970
Who do you think you are?!

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.920
You being cute just makes me
even angrier about this!

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.920
Twenty-eight hours later.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.110
Caesar is at 15 meters.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.180
JoJo is at zero meters.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.070
The rings will dissolve in 28 days.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:41.700
More than a day has passed
and Caesar's only made it that far.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.210
I shouldn't be worrying about others,
but he's struggling.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.720
The fingers supporting him
look like they're about to come loose!

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.370
His Hamon is about to run out!

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.350
Fight, Caesar!

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.300
He's about to fall again!

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.150
He's on his fingertips!

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.320
Caesar!

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.990
W-Whoa!

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:22.450
W-Wait a minute.
Were his fingertips always like that?

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.460
He wasn't about to fall off at all!
He was...

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.500
A squirt gun with
a smaller hole shoots farther.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.460
N-No way!

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.260
I-I'll give it a shot!

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.070
Let's solve a Hamon mystery!

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.890
Is this it?

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.110
I did it! I'm sticking!
My Hamon is sticking!

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.180
I thought having your hands
flat supported your weight.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.130
It's odd, but the opposite is true!

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.370
Hamon concentrated into the fingertips
is much stronger!

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.330
What a simple puzzle! I've got it!

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.380
Now that I understand,
I just have to climb.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.630
So how will I torture that awful woman?

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.550
Looks like JoJo's got it.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.940
Another 24 hours have passed.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.060
Caesar is at 18 meters.
JoJo is at 16 meters.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.060
The rings will dissolve in 27 days!

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:36.020
Now I know why Caesar slowed down
so much at 18 meters.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.070
The pillar widens out as it goes up.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.690
This is where it gets hard.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.120
The pillar is as mean as that woman!

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.410
Three hours later.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.710
Caesar is at 19 meters.
JoJo is at 18 meters.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.670
Oh? What's that?!

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.590
I-It's a crack!
And it's big enough for my fingers!

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.010
Hooray! Time for a break!

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.020
What luck!

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.250
Yes! Now I can catch my breath!

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.910
W-What was that?!

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.610
It felt like a switch!

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.860
W-What's happening?!

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.490
No!

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.830
Hell Climb Pillar loves only Hamon
and rejects all else!

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.080
Watch out! Something's coming!

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.500
Crap! I turned something on!

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.930
Even climbing this thing
might be too much.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.590
H-How can we get past that?!

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.350
A sheet of oil shoots out at
the 20 meter point of the pillar!

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.360
The high-pressure stream
cuts like a razor!

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.130
W-What's up, Caesar?

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.530
A-Are you mad at me or something?

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.070
S-Sorry, Caesar.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.170
But I know any sane person
would've tried to rest there.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.670
Whoever made this was twisted
to set a trap like that!

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.750
I wasn't looking at you
with blame, JoJo.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.200
It was worry.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.390
Can my Hamon get me through
that razor-sharp barricade?

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.770
There's one way!

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.520
W-What the...?!

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.150
He's sticking with his feet!

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.990
Caesar!

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.370
Hamon to attract and repel!

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.840
My Hamon is focused at my feet to stick

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.130
I have to control two opposing types
of Hamon at the same time!

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.560
I-I did it!

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.730
I hate to say it, but JoJo
can't yet control two types of Hamon.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.480
He can't get through!

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.280
S-Spectacular!

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.310
I'm glad Caesar found a way through.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.550
But I'm not sure
I can perform a stunt like that.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.560
Nine hours later.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.420
Caesar reaches the top after 61 hours!

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.220
C-Coach!

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.290
JoJo can't take any more!
Stop the oil, please!

00:17:53.930 --> 00:18:00.610
Knowing JoJo, he'll attempt
some try-or-die stunt any second now!

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.440
But will he make it?!

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.430
Hanging around like this
is getting me nowhere.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.330
If he tries to break through,
that oil will split him right in half!

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.330
Even if he's blasted away,
he'll just fall and starve to death.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.590
Coach!

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.200
To hell with it!

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.260
I have to try or die!

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.090
Here goes nothing!

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.550
Don't, JoJo! Just stay there!

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.060
The beat of my Hamon cuts like a knife!

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.860
JoJo!

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.030
JoJo... He...

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.120
He's using Hamon
to slide along the oil sheet!

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.540
The oil loses momentum as it shoots out.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.200
And so!

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.640
He used the speed of the oil
to jump on top of it!

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:18.390
He didn't fall!
In fact, he's up three meters!

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.520
No one has ever
climbed the pillar that way before.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.900
Turning his weakness into strength,
he's quite clever.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.040
I-I made it!

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.700
But it's not over yet.
I'm on the wall.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.910
But its overhang is even worse
than the pillar's.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.000
I'm completely exhausted.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.670
There isn't even a meter to go, damn it!

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.130
I-I can't control...

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.430
...my breathing any longer.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.850
C-Caesar!

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.120
Don't misunderstand.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.150
I wasn't mad at you earlier.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.780
Coach, please forgive me
for saving JoJo like this.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.790
That's fine, but aren't you
exhausted, too?

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.450
I forgot!

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.540
Don't let go, please!

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.880
Caesar!

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.720
Ten seconds later, after saying
Don't let go, 13 times...

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.550
...JoJo reached the top!

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.600
Hold it, Miss Lisa Lisa.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.980
While I was clinging to the pillar
for my life, I was thinking.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.860
How am I gonna get back at her?

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.820
Shall I strip you bare,
or pinch your nose till you cry?

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.120
I thought he was easygoing,
but I guess he's the vengeful type.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.620
Which will it be?!

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.920
I-I did it! I'm holding water in a cup
while it's upside-down!

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.900
Marvelous!

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.430
In only three days, he's learned
how to control Hamon!

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.600
JoJo's talent is incredible, but Coach
Lisa Lisa's training is even more so!

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.930
Coach!

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.440
I-I'm impressed.
G-Give me more training, please!

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.230
You'll see. I can overcome anything!

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.950
Forget it.
I guess he's easygoing after all.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.450
Believe me, I have many activities
ready for you.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.910
I'll impress you into the ground.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.950
Yes, ma'am!

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.660
The next three weeks
will be harder than this warm-up.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.130
And who are you, sneaking up on me?

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.220
Wh-Who are these guys?

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.640
The water is like pudding!

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:10.860
These two are my servants and
your instructors, Meshina and Loggs.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.610
I-I couldn't even begin to do that.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.780
Do you want to learn?

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.370
I asked if you want to learn.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.200
O-Of course I do!

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.910
I have to!

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.130
Do you?

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.040
Then come here
and take a good, close look.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.180
Tell us your names already!

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.540
From here on, we're gonna...

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.450
...forge you into real men!

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.780
Breathe! If your breath is strong,
your muscles will be, too!

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.870
You have to breathe ten times a second!

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.530
T-This sucks!

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.750
Inhale for ten minutes,
then exhale for ten minutes!

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.050
If you can, the mask comes off!

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.540
Th-This is crazy!

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.120
Seven days until the rings dissolve!

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.570
Next episode

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.660
You must take a final examination.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.980
We need more power.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.330
He's good deep down.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.120
This is unnatural!

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.580
I can't take it!

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.930
Chapter 17: The Deeper Plan
