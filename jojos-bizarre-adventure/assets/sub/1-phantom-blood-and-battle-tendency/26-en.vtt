00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.000
Long ago, an already extraordinary man
wished for further power.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.950
He could live like the birds,
dwell with the fish,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.160
breathe like the trees,
and move like the water.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.910
But he could not face the sun.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.340
So he created a stone mask.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.600
One day he would befriend the sun.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.160
And the world would be his!

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.050
Chapter 26: The Ascendant One

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310
Kars...

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.670
Did Kars take a lava dive?!

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.950
You...worms...

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.320
We got him!

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.780
I-I need armor.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.600
Like a clam or a crab...

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380
...I'll make armor.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.380
I'll cover myself.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.640
It's not enough!

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.310
It's melted rock, idiot!

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.310
It's over a thousand degrees!

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.660
You're gonna burn to a crisp!

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.280
Yeowch!

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.500
T-That did it!

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.570
Finally!

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.860
We finally took down Kars!

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.070
JoJo, that shock triggered an eruption!

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.180
Let's get to safety
before celebrating!

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.530
Good idea. Hang on tight!

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.070
What a wonderful sound.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.510
It's music to my ears.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.370
I've been longing to hear
that song from you, JoJo!

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.010
Kars...but how?!

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.130
A bit of his shell.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.140
I see. Kars...

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.640
First, Kars covered himself
in a shell like a crab.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.780
But it was still organic.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.240
It couldn't withstand the lava's heat
and burned away instantly.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.530
Kars's secret
was in a second layer of armor!

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.540
That second layer...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.580
...was bubbles!

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.500
The bubbles created a layer of air
between Kars's body and the lava.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:52.910
Heat from lava
Air
Kars's body

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.220
As the outer layer burned,
more bubbles came up to replace it.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.810
Kars could survive in lava
for a few minutes.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.460
The Earth gave birth to life.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.650
But now! Alas! In the end...

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.150
...Kars had conquered the Earth!

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.160
Long, long ago, far earlier than
man's first recorded history

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
a certain group of creatures evolved
on our planet.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.190
They could only live at night,

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.830
as they died when exposed to the sun.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.180
So they lived below ground.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.850
Even without the sun, they led long
lives feeding on other living things.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.770
Early humans that appeared
feared them as gods or demons.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.780
Few died, so they did not have many
children and their population was small.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.490
They knew no strife and lived in peace.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.660
But then...

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.410
...a genius was born among them.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.050
There is strength hidden in this body,
abilities undreamed of.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.680
I will unlock greater power!

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.410
The genius created a stone mask.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.510
The mask granted him undying power,
but he required more life energy.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.070
He had to consume
more creatures to live.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.970
If left unchecked,
he would eventually consume all life.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.070
His brethren began to fear the mask

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.590
and its gifted creator!

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.580
His existence is a threat!

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.790
He has to be removed from this world!

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.290
We have to destroy him!

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.710
Fool! Don't you wish to conquer the sun?

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.180
Don't you wish to rule over all?

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.680
Don't you wish to purge your fears?!

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.480
Then fall.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.520
The genius slaughtered all his brethren,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.290
including the parents who raised him.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.420
He and one companion took
the two surviving babies and left.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.130
They set off on a journey
in search of ultimate power.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.440
And ten thousand years later,
that power was in his hands!

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.850
He's a god. He's become a god.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.190
Humans can't stand before a god!

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.730
Submission is our only chance!

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.200
What was that?
Did you just say something, JoJo?

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.170
Die! Overdrive!

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.250
Ha...mon?

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.720
Did you say Hamon Overdrive?

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.800
JoJo!

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.600
That shock!

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.440
I'm melting! No!

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.440
My leg is melting!

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.440
What? It's like he used...!

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.190
It can't be!

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.360
It is! That was Hamon, you dimwit!

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.670
I conquered the sun, and you still
thought Hamon was beyond me?!

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.040
W-What?!

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.370
And it looks like my

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.960
Hamon is hundreds of times
more potent than yours.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.690
Hundreds of times more potent?!

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.740
It's like being burned by the sun!

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.850
His flesh is liquefying
and then vaporizing!

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.100
So how do you like that taste
of your own medicine?

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.860
An excellent response.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.070
Well, let me ease your suffering.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.660
JoJo!

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.040
This is it. I'm going to die.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.540
It's over for me.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.300
JoJo accepted this fact completely.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.780
He felt no fear, no pain, no regret.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.380
He thought, I did all I could.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.960
Before the epitome of evil, he watched

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.750
his dying self with ice-cold awareness.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.910
Von Stroheim was no different.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.820
Unable to move, he felt he knew how it

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.430
felt to be a frog swallowed by a snake.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.470
This way of breathing...

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.950
To send a Hamon-user like you
into the black pit of death...

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.430
...Hamon really is a poetic vehicle!

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.510
Hamon...

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.640
...far greater than mine...

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.430
Sail into the infinite abyss
of oblivion!

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.550
Hamon?!

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.460
What?!

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.250
The Red Stone!

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.620
What?!

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.240
The Red Stone!

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.460
The Red Stone of Aja!

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.380
Why did JoJo hold the Red Stone
toward Kars?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.050
Even he didn't know!

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.650
It was instinctive.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.370
He felt the Red Stone
being drawn toward Hamon.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.350
But JoJo's body understood.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.650
His body moved in order to survive.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.570
JoJo's will to live
pushed his body into action!

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.820
T-The Red Stone is a Hamon amplifier.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.810
That energy made the volcano's eruption
reach a sudden peak!

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.260
T-The whole slab they were on
was blasted into the sky!

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.770
S-Such tremendous force!

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:12.110
But do you think a little eruption
will be enough to get rid of me, JoJo?!

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.110
I'll become a bird to escape!

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.750
Goodbye forever, JoJo!

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.630
Bless our Mother Earth!
It shot my arm all the way up here!

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.550
Now, Kars!

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.760
Your line is,
Did you plan this, too, JoJo?!

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.390
Did you plan this, too...

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.310
For an instant, Kars was distracted
by JoJo's arm! One fatal instant!

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.870
Hot chunks of rock he could have dodged
launched him higher!

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.530
Did you plan this, too, JoJo?!

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.000
What do you think?!
I planned every little detail!

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.410
I stacked the whole deck!

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.170
That's a total lie,
but it'll drive Kars crazy!

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:15.450
The material released in the eruption
reached escape velocity!

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.310
Even the Earth's power
couldn't kill Kars!

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.060
But instead...

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.200
...it blasted him out of the atmosphere!

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.020
Stars?! N-No!

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.530
It's over.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.950
Granny...

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.040
Von Stroheim...

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.450
Speedwagon...

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.960
Smokey...

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.670
And Lisa Lisa...

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.380
Farewell, everyone.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.140
Jo...

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.890
JoJo!

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:09.820
Eight hours later, von Stroheim returned
alive to tell Speedwagon this:

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:19.120
On February 28, 1939, Joseph Joestar
passed away on Isola di Volgano.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.750
I'm in outer space?!

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:37.930
I'll use jets of air to change my
trajectory and return to Earth!

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.380
I-It's not working!

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.050
I-I'm freezing!

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.790
The air is freezing around me!

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.790
It turns to ice the moment
it comes out of me!

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.050
I-I can't change direction!

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.590
I can't go back!

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.980
Kars never returned to the Earth.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:36.650
He became half-mineral, half-animal
and floated forever through space.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.200
And though he wished for death,
he was unable to die.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.830
So eventually, he stopped thinking.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:55.500
Outside New York City
April 1939

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.550
Our Father who art in heaven,

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.140
hallowed be thy name.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.060
Thy kingdom come,

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.990
thy will be done,

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.060
on earth, as it is in heaven.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.200
Goodbye, JoJo.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.080
Now that I think of it,
we only met six months ago.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.960
But I'll always remember you.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.340
Always.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.000
Come, Erina, you mustn't catch cold.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.480
Let's go home.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.860
Just a bit longer.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.190
Guess who?

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.400
Hey, everybody!

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.030
I finally got to New York
and nobody was there to meet me!

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.500
So I heard you were all at a funeral.
I looked high and low!

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.660
Hey, Coach Lisa Lisa!
Are you all healed up?

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.710
Meshina, you're here too!

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.670
I want to ask von Stroheim if he can

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.800
fix my hand up with some gadgets.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.430
But it looks like war with the Germans.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.930
Hey, now! What are you thinking?!

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.310
This is a funeral, you idiot!

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.060
Who's an idiot?!

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.220
Hey, did you just call me an idiot?!

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.280
Just calm down. Let's go have a talk.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.280
It's...

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:46.780
No way!

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.790
Hey! Don't start any trouble!

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.080
You aren't getting away
with calling me an idiot!

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.000
JoJo!

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.920
JoJo's alive!

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.170
Alive?

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.120
H-Hang on, now!
What's with all the surprise?

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.030
It's like you saw a ghost!

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.850
Bwah! Why's my name on a headstone?!

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.780
D-Don't tell me this is...

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.040
JoJo!

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.860
You're still recovering,
so you shouldn't stand in the rain!

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.990
Take this.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.820
I-It's Suzie Q.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.120
What's that ring on her finger?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.210
Y-You don't know about my wife, either?!

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.880
Your wife?!

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.310
Your wife? Oh, my!

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.010
Being introduced as your wife...

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.260
It makes me blush!

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.220
Right?

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.700
Don't right me!

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.560
Back when the volcano erupted...

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.320
...the rock I was on shielded me
and fell into the sea.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.940
A fishing boat picked me up.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.640
Then you nursed me back to health
in Venice for two weeks.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.620
But they haven't heard.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.620
You sent a telegram, right?!

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.000
T-Telegram?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.830
Yeah, you said you would!

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.800
Let's not get all clicky now.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.430
I'm sorry! I forgot!

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.810
Oh, no! Unbelievable!
What is that woman thinking?!

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:37.430
Get back here!

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.060
JoJo is alive!

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.010
I said I'm sorry!

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.030
Sorry doesn't cut it!

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.050
JoJo...

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:57.050
Later, Lisa Lisa, Elizabeth Joestar,
told JoJo she was his mother.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:58.830
They moved to America.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:04.220
In 1948, she married a Hollywood
screenwriter.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.650
Erina Joestar continued her work
as a teacher.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.930
In 1950, at age 81, she died peacefully,

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.440
surrounded by those who loved her.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.940
Robert E. O. Speedwagon continued
with his various enterprises

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.450
and helped to further
science and medicine.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:37.330
In 1952, he died
of a heart attack at age 89.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.330
He remained single.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.710
Smokey Brown worked his way through
college, majoring in political science

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:51.510
and became the first black mayor
in Georgia, his home state.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.220
Rudol von Stroheim never saw JoJo again.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:05.010
In 1943, he died as a proud German
soldier, fighting in Stalingrad.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.480
We are the world's greatest!

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.240
Time flowed onward...

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.980
JFK International Airport, New York
1987

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.980
...to a new generation.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.750
And JoJo...

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.590
Oh, I bumped you. Are you okay?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.510
Oh, dear.
You should watch where you're going.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.840
You're right. I'm fine.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.450
We all make mistakes.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.350
Wait a minute. Are you Japanese?

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.100
Yeah, why?

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.970
Then I take that back!

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:58.450
Alitalia flight 285 for Tokyo
is now boarding.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.000
My only daughter has been married

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.040
to a Japanese man for over 20 years now.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.920
Why did she get married
on the other side of the world?

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.090
My own grandson doesn't know my face!

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.590
I'll never forgive the Japanese!

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.180
But...

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.310
...I do like my Walkman.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:36.320
From the silent depths

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:43.450
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:50.750
Crimson blood

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:57.510
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:05.810
If inherited love is called fate

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:12.070
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:18.570
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.370
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:28.370
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.090
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.970
Destiny written into your veins

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:42.720
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:48.390
Take hold of them

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:52.170
Part 2: Battle Tendency -- Fin

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.820
Atlantic Ocean, near the Canary Islands
1983

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.820
Y-Yahoo! We finally got it!

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.200
R-Relax! Just bring it up!

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.060
It's a hundred-year-old treasure chest!

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.400
L-Let's pop it open!
