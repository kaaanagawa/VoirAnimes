WEBVTT

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.230
Rome, Italy

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.790
What do you call this?!

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.200
You expect me to eat spaghetti
with ink in it?!

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.620
Well sir, this is
spaghetti al nero di seppia.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.540
It is made with fresh squid ink,
so it is black.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.760
Huh?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.010
It's quite tasty, sir.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.200
Yum! Well isn't this a treat?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.000
I like it! It's good!

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.690
This hotel is going to the dogs.
They'll let anyone in these days.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.830
Signorina, this is a gift for you.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.420
Oh, it's lovely!

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.280
My pretty thing, when you remove this

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.880
at night before bed, please think of me.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.200
Oh, no! Did that stuck-up snob
really just say that?!

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.060
It's sweet enough to make
my teeth hurt!

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.120
I'll put a spell on it.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.450
Make her fall to my love charm.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.730
I can't stand guys like that!

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.910
And spread your magic to her lips.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.920
That insinuating little dog!
I see his game!

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.410
It's a travesty!

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.830
Here we go.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.490
A little Hamon prank.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.280
These will wrap around his
face and stick for a while!

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.750
Th-This can't be!

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.250
I-It's Hamon!

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.250
He used Hamon!

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.370
Excuse me, you have a call from a
Mr. Speedwagon, Mr. Caesar Zeppeli.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.740
Mamma mia! I'll be right there.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.740
Wh-What the...!

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.370
That skirt-chasing Casanova
is the Zeppeli we're here to meet?!

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.000
From the silent depths

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.870
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.410
Crimson blood

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.200
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.450
If inherited love is called fate

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.410
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.200
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.700
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.870
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.750
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.620
Destiny written into your veins

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.370
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.450
Take hold of them

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.350
Chapter 14: Elite Ancient Warriors

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.190
The Speedwagon Foundation, founded 28

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.340
The Speedwagon Foundation's
Washington headquarters

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.360
years ago through Speedwagon's fortune.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.210
It furthers science, medicine,
archaeology and more...

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.860
...for the benefit of all humankind.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.370
But it has a deeper purpose.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.120
To find the secrets of the stone masks!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.920
We're using UV lights.
Put on your masks, please.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.920
Introduce the snake!

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.930
The snake was absorbed!

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.940
Santviento isn't dead!
He's defending himself somehow!

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.570
He'll awaken in the darkness.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.650
Impossible! How can we kill him?

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.950
He feeds on masked vampires,
and he's immortal!

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.120
But be at ease, Mr. Speedwagon.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.750
As long as he's under these UV lights,
he won't be able to move.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.570
That's right.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.090
What a relief.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.720
Let's take our time
and research a way to stop him.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.430
These were taken in the cave where
we found Santviento.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.980
Look carefully.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.440
Their horns are all different!

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.530
If the one on the bottom is Santviento,
who are the others?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.910
According to von Stroheim, the Germans
found another Pillar in Europe.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.240
Is that true?!

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.080
They are in a vertical line.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.450
That could indicate the ranks
of the Pillar Men.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.470
Von Stroheim told us to meet a man in
Rome, so JoJo and I are going.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.230
That man...

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.370
...is the grandson of Will A. Zeppeli,
Caesar Zeppeli!

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.110
So where are you from?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.640
Shall I take a photo of you
with the fountain?

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.530
The birds in this country
sure are friendly.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.740
Can't say I like the men, though!

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.620
Come, now! You've been introduced,
so why can't you be civil?!

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.170
Allow me to be frank, Mr. Speedwagon.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.010
My grandfather died tragically
fifty years ago.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.640
My father took up his torch
and hunted the mask.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.620
We Italians have the strongest
family bonds in the world.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.900
We are proud of tradition.
I am no different.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.110
But what about that man?

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.540
You say he knew nothing of his
grandfather until recently!

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.570
Such irresponsibility!

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.300
I'd watch what I say, if--!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.830
Hold on, Caesar!

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.870
I kept everything a secret from JoJo!

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.330
Even so.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.880
He fought Straizo and
one of the Pillar Men.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.260
So I wondered how tough he was
and waited for him.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.640
I saw what he could do with Hamon
and was disappointed.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.590
His Hamon is simply not enough!

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.400
His victory against the Pillar Man
was blind luck for sure.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.820
I will never work with him!

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.740
Caesar, he hasn't trained with Hamon!

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.330
It's too late, old man.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.400
I'll show you with a good thrashing.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.380
That won't happen.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.190
With your Hamon, you couldn't
even beat this girl.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.760
Then you couldn't even beat a pigeon!

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.930
Are you making fun of me?

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.860
I love to make fun,
but I won't be made fun of!

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.780
H-He gave this girl a Hamon kiss.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.870
I'll say it again.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.040
You couldn't even beat this girl.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.190
S-Should I stop them?

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.170
No, even if it's hard on him,
if he can't get through this...

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.300
What did I tell you?

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.890
My grandfather only died because
your grandfather got in his way!

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.640
I can't accept someone of
your bloodline!

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.900
Caesar, that's too far!

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.020
Y-You...

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:06.180
You couldn't leave it at just me,
you had to insult my dead grandfather!

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.490
I have a technique
sure to eliminate the Pillar Men.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.900
My Hamon Bubble Launcher!

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:24.340
My gloves and clothing are coated
in a special soap mixture!

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.760
I'll blast you back home, Joestar!

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:47.280
I'm impressed you're still conscious,
but your Hamon won't break you out.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.820
And look at that,
your breathing is ragged.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.950
Enjoy your stay.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.910
Now you'll say, Signorina,
I will lift my Hamon spell.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.540
Here, signorina,
I will lift my Hamon spell.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:19.480
I put a Hamon-filled pigeon in her mouth
while I was being choked.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.860
I knew you'd kiss her again
to remove your Hamon.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.150
I'll say it again.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.030
You couldn't even beat a pigeon!

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.120
What a day.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.570
Who does this jerk think he is?

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.930
Does he have to grandstand
just to sit down?

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.050
He really ticks me off.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.850
If I had a technique like his Bubble
Launcher, he wouldn't be so proud.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.480
I have to come up with something.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.440
But working at it would be a hassle.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.910
I'll show him what's what
with a card game.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.950
What are you up to, JoJo?
Deal the cards normally.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.790
What do you mean?

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.870
I told you to deal normally!

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.370
No tricks!

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.880
Wh-Whoa-oa!

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.630
Oh, no! I've been caught!

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.180
Well, you can't beat me without
resorting to sly gimmicks like that.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.180
So what is this mirror
on your shoe for, eh?

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.680
You want a piece of me?!

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.390
Bring it, rube!

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.730
Caesar!

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.320
It's been eight hours.
What are you waiting for?

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.400
What am I waiting for?

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.450
Here's your answer!

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.580
What's this?! A German soldier!

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.580
It looks like we're clear.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.400
The Germans guard the Pillar Men.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.590
He'll get us in to see them.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.220
You're serious?!

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.150
Germany and Italy have an alliance!

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.460
And the Germans want to do
scientific research on my Hamon.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.870
You're Englishmen, but
you're allowed to see the Pillar Men.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.170
You can thank my
painstaking efforts for that, JoJo.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.960
Mr. Speedwagon, we have
many questions.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.680
Let's work together
to stop them before they wake.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.640
Hey, Mark.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.060
How is your girlfriend back home?

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.340
Well, she's...

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.060
Th-The truth is...

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.670
...I'm going home
to get married next week!

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.440
Really?!

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.480
Mamma mia! Congratulations!

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.800
I was his wingman when
he picked her up!

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.450
Hey, keep your eyes on the road!

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.290
Stop nuzzling the wheel!

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.580
By the way, JoJo...

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.880
...do you have a girlfriend?

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.810
Of course not.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.170
No girl would want to
date a guy like you.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.880
It would be easier to find Nessie!

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.020
This guy really thinks he's hot stuff!

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:48.230
I'll come up with a killer technique
and teach him a thing or two!

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.720
Look! Something's strange!

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.860
Wh-What's going on?!

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.580
Calm down! They're under UV lights!
They can't move.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.500
Take care and look into it.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.210
Yes, sir!

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.880
The death of von Stroheim's team
was an important lesson.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:18.550
We have to cut the Pillar out and
put it in a bunker in Germany.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.760
What's happening?
There's a shadow, so I can't tell.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.180
Take a closer look.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.810
I-I hear something.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.400
His horn!

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.440
H-He couldn't be...!

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.690
He's awake!

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.840
Bring out more UV lamps!

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.620
Yes, sir!

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:59.430
H-He's blocking the UV light
with blood and brain matter!

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.780
The world has changed while I slept.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.190
I can see how
in these paltry inventions.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.370
H-He spoke!

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.750
Do you think you can hold me
with your feeble lights?!

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.920
Our hands!

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.630
They're stuck together!

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.150
Wamuu!

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.030
Awaken, my masters!

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:23.550
The famous Mouth of Truth
was a secret entrance all this time?!

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.640
This place is so unearthly!

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.190
Caesar, have you tried Hamon
on the sleeping Pillar Men?

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:41.400
Hamon is only useful on the living.
It has no effect on stone.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.860
It won't work unless they are awake.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.410
Hey, where are the guards that
are supposed to be here?!

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.410
No one's here! It's too quiet!

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.000
You're too loud.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.790
T-This isn't right.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.000
There should be a guard posted here.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.130
What?

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.260
Whoa!

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.920
Hey, I just stepped in something!

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.970
It's the grossest feeling ever!

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.310
What the heck is it?!

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.440
Th-They're...!

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.860
The husks of soldiers!

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.650
Th-They're all dead!

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.280
No way!

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.070
Hey, Dutch! Don't run off!

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.080
Something's out there!

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.780
Wh-What is that?!

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.830
This can't be! Th-They're...!

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.960
Awake!

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.170
Get out of there, Mark!

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.930
Mark!

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.150
Mark!

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.150
Caesar... Caesar!

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.650
Mark!

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:11.160
They didn't even notice what happened
when one of them bumped into Mark!

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.410
It's like when a man
steps on an ant while walking!

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.960
It is night outside, Wamuu.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.220
Yes, Lord Kars. What is your plan?

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.510
Searching for the whereabouts
of the Red Stone of Aja, of course.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:38.440
All we need is the Stone and
the Mask will be complete!

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:44.440
But Master Esidisi, the human world
has changed much over the years.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.990
Long ago, the Emperor of Rome
had the Stone.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.450
But that age has ended, I am sure.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.580
Then we must find out
where the Stone has gone.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.410
They say the Emperor
cherished the Stone.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.090
I am sure humans
still tell stories of it.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.130
I shall find the Stone.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.510
We have time.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:15.100
For now, let us go outside and
observe the changes in the human world.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.610
Wamuu!

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.610
What are you doing, worm?!

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.160
Stay your hand, Esidisi!

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.330
I apologize, Lord Kars.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:43.540
Wamuu, I know how you hate
when someone enters your shadow.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.550
I forgot how you reflexively attack
anyone who does.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.800
It has been 2,000 years, after all.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.600
I have offended you, my lord.
Punish me as you see fit.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.270
No, there is no reason for it.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:03.940
It is that very fighting spirit
that lets me rely on you.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.420
The fault is mine
for entering your shadow.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.570
Forgive me, Wamuu.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.860
Lord Kars...

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.820
We go, Wamuu.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.120
Yes, lord.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.370
Caesar!

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.000
Kill me! Kill me now!

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.750
Mark!

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.050
I-It's starting to hurt.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.010
I-I'm so scared.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.470
I was numb at first, but the pain...!

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.060
Please kill me now, Caesar!

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.020
Mark!

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.060
There's nothing we can do!

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.030
We can't do anything to help him.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.820
We're powerless!

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.820
The hopelessness is overwhelming!

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.070
C-Caesar...

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.580
You...

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.080
Thank you, Caesar.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.430
Mark!

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.850
He was just a young man.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.250
Just an ordinary man.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.860
He loved his family.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:29.940
And his girl.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.480
And his country.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:35.360
He was a normal,
hardworking young man.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.740
He was just a kid!

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.330
Caesar!

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.790
JoJo, stay out of this!

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.740
This fight is mine!

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.120
I have to do this myself!

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.600
Next episode

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:31.770
Oh, I'm tired of talking.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.860
I told you to continue!

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.400
He's spineless!

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.680
The Hamon tribe.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.610
This is my Divine Sandstorm!

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.830
