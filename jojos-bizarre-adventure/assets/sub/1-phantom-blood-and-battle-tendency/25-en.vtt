WEBVTT

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.680
N-No!

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.390
I-I didn't see him holding the mask.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.350
I didn't see him put the Red Stone in!

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.360
Dear God...

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.700
Kars...

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.980
From the silent depths

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.120
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.410
Crimson blood

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.210
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.510
If inherited love is called fate

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.810
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.230
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.030
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.910
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.790
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.670
Destiny written into your veins

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.380
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.720
Take hold of them

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.320
Chapter 25: The Birth of a Superbeing

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.190
He stood up!

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.330
Stand your ground!
German soldiers are not cowards!

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.070
The ultimate being?

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.810
Madness! No creature could
ever become perfect!

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.310
Kars...

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.920
Look at his arm!
It's still smoking!

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.690
The Hamon will ruin him!

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.430
He'll melt where he stands!

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.700
He might have put the Red Stone
into the mask,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.590
but he is still utterly the same!

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.690
And he'll die like that!

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.640
Fire the UV amplifier again!

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.090
We'll end him for sure this time.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.310
Hurry it up!

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.970
Sir!

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.600
What's going on with him?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.000
What is he staring at?

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.910
L-Look!

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.580
See? Over there!

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.500
Wh-What the hell is that?!

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.640
Am I seeing things?
His hand turned into a squirrel!

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.690
It's kind of cute, actually.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.380
Look out!

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.820
It's dangerous!
Stay away from that squirrel!

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.090
The squirrel!

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800
Get out of here! Hurry!

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.990
Unbelievable!
He can manipulate life at will!

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.620
Hooray!

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.370
The sun is rising!

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.940
The vampires...

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.010
The sunlight will take care of Kars.
We're saved!

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.190
It's no good. He's fine!

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.160
He's still standing, even under the sun!

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.610
This is a nightmare! It can't be!

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.420
This looks like our doom!

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.880
A perfect life form combines
the abilities of all other life forms.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.160
It combines all life into one.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.180
But this...

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.720
Breathtaking. Such beautiful radiance.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.440
That light is the most
wonderful thing I've seen.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.700
And now I have conquered it.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.330
H-He's invincible!

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.780
He has no weaknesses!
Even Hamon won't work on him!

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.420
He's immortal! Unstoppable!
No one can beat him!

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:21.180
He is complete!
Kars, the Ultimate Thing, is born!

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.480
T-This is my fault.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.680
I let him put on the mask
with the Red Stone in it.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.560
Is... Is there no way to stop him?

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:37.020
Are we humans destined to die,
to become food for him?

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.200
No, I have a plan.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.780
What was that, JoJo?

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.580
Hold her.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.330
Yeah...

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.250
I have one last plan.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.710
A final plan?

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.710
Yeah, I save it for last.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.300
What is it?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.550
JoJo, d-do you mean that final plan?

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.600
Listen up!
Do it till your last breath!

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.600
Do what until my last breath?

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.320
Run away!

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.990
I knew it!

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.490
Hamon-users mean nothing to me now.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.250
But you...

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.920
Wamuu and Esidisi need to be avenged,
and I must celebrate.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.510
JoJo, your death...

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.010
...will be dedicated to my birth!

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.180
He's catching up!

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.560
Pipe down!

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.190
I'm trying to think up with something!
Keep quiet!

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:06.860
JoJo's going out there to save Lisa Lisa
and the rest of us!

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.080
But it's useless! No plan of his could
overcome what Kars has become!

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.830
He's coming! Hurry!

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.170
Hey, Smokey!

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.340
I don't think you understand,
so I'll tell you something!

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.850
There's no reason for you to be
running with me!

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.480
Kars is after my blood alone!

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:43.610
He thinks killing me is the best way
to ring in his new life!

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.980
JoJo, there's something
you have to hear!

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.040
Lisa Lisa, your coach, she's your...

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.960
He's here! He's here!

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.970
Speedwagon, is he...?

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.190
Is he really the perfect being?

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.420
Yes, the power of the Red Stone will

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.800
make him into the ultimate life form!

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.890
A perfect being is: One, invincible.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.440
Two, does not age.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.850
Three, will not ever die.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:25.750
Four, has the abilities of all
other life forms, and outperforms them.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:31.570
In addition, it is like a Greek statue,
a model for beauty.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.260
T-There's no way to stop him now.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.290
He has no weakness at all!

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:44.510
Humans can't kill him,
not with Hamon or even the sun!

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.000
JoJo!

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.680
Smokey, your path ends here!

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.080
Tell me about it later!

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.470
JoJo!

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.940
That won't save you.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.210
Let's see who's stronger, Kars!

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.340
That's...!

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.230
One of our warplanes!

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.110
JoJo!

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.360
The feathers are
as hard as armadillo shell.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.800
They are coated in an oil
that deflects bullets.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.660
Naturally, their hardness makes them
weapons as well as shields.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.170
His feathers are like knives!

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.720
This looks bad!

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.270
But...

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.780
I got on this plane
to get away from you!

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.160
JoJo!

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.420
All he can do now is run!

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.090
Fly, JoJo! Fly!

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.550
That's all we humans can do now.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.180
Current speed: 240 km/h.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:50.440
No matter how evolved he might be,
he's still just an animal.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.520
I'm safe for now.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.490
I guess he can't keep up
with a plane for long.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.230
The fuel!

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.700
Two hours left.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.200
So I can run away for two hours.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.960
Does that fool think he can run
from me for even a moment?

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.220
You'll never land safely now.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.470
You won't stand on the earth again.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.430
JoJo! JoJo!

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.310
Do you read me? Respond, JoJo!

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.980
Hey, Speedwagon!

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.480
JoJo! Grabbing that plane
was a smart move!

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:40.240
The Germans and I will do what we can
to help you get away!

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.330
Do you have a chart?

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.740
It's right here.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.870
Good. Maintain radio contact.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.430
I'll give you the plan.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.080
What?!

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.420
First, give us your current position.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.380
JoJo, do you read me?

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.100
What's wrong? Hey!

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.060
JoJo, respond! JoJo!

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.980
Yeah, I read you.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:14.550
But Speedwagon, no technique
or weapon will work on Kars.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.480
You said he was immortal.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.740
Yeah, I did.
Your plan to run is all we can do.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.500
Listen up, old man.
I have a different idea.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.070
What idea?

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.040
Now JoJo, don't do anything rash!

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.170
Just keep away from him!

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.010
We won't be able to stop him later!

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.510
No! Don't even think
of doing something on your own!

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.930
Just listen to me, okay?

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.180
He's the ultimate being on earth!

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:54.270
But he's from Earth.
This planet gave him life.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.030
And it might take him back!

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.400
What do you mean?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.730
How would the Earth take him back?

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.800
Magma!

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.620
Magma, the hottest thing on earth!

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:14.290
I'll drive him into the lava
at Isola di Volgano to kill him!

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.340
D-Don't! You've risked your life
more than enough times!

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.010
Let us and the Germans handle it!

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.090
Listen to him, JoJo!
Don't be crazy!

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.650
Kars will kill you!

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.460
Sorry, I can already see the volcano.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.270
The time is now!

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.900
Mr. Speedwagon...

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.610
It's happening again...

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.410
Jonathan's father,
Jonathan and George...

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.950
The men of the Joestar family
all led short lives.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.380
I don't want to lose you, too!

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.670
Please stop, JoJo!

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.970
For Lisa Lisa's sake, too!

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.760
Lisa Lisa is your mother!

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.020
What was that? Say again!

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.360
What is that noise?

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.610
This is insane!

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.410
Piranhas?!
What the hell?!

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.900
They're chewing up the plane!

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.330
How did they get in?!

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.830
Kars's feathers!

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.080
They transformed!

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.550
Damn it! My parachute!

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.020
You little bastards!

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.800
Wh-What now?!

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.980
JoJo!

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.730
What's going on? Respond!

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.920
JoJo!

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.490
JoJo! JoJo!

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.170
You're brainless.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:23.880
That parachute is like a spider's web
trapping you, JoJo.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.600
You're just a little butterfly.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.510
I'll take my time killing you!

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:33.760
What?!

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.770
I-It's a dummy!

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:45.080
Kars, I'm not going down
without a fight!

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.280
You're going with me into that volcano!

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.740
JoJo!

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.240
Damn you!

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.540
Lunatic!

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.260
Granny Erina, you told me about
my grandfather once.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:20.530
You said he sank into the Atlantic
with his lifelong foe to save you.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.440
I hate to sadden you again.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.850
But I guess
this is the Joestar blood in me.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:45.170
Did you really think I couldn't get away
before you hit the ground?

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.170
Kars!

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.130
You're dying alone, JoJo!

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.350
W-What the...?!

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.030
Kars, this plane will be your coffin.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.280
You!

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.860
Von Stroheim!

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.290
How and when did you get in there?!

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.790
I wasn't sure you could handle it alone!

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.290
It was cold in this pontoon.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.800
But you came.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.590
But it's time to jump, JoJo!

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.060
What do you mean jump?

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.350
But I don't even have a parachute!

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.310
Listen to me and jump out of the plane!

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.150
JoJo, respond!

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.410
Say something! Anything!

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.780
Just talk to me, JoJo!

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.330
JoJo...

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.770
Von Stroheim...you crazy bastard.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.460
You're even crazier than me!

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.900
B-But I have to thank you.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:35.240
Y-You look all right,
but what about Kars?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.070
Did Kars take a lava dive?!

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.250
You...worms...

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.520
Next episode

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.540
Did you say Hamon Overdrive?

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.520
Bless our mother earth!

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.580
Don't you wish to purge your fears?!

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.110
JoJo!

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.020
Farewell, everyone.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.490
