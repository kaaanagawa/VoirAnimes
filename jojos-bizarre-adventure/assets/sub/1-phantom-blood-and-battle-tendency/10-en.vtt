00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.870
This old man is familiar to us.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.200
Well, at least his bearing
and scar should be.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.670
Nice to see you again, Speedwagon.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.640
I hear you're an oil tycoon
in America now.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.760
That's an exaggeration.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.350
You look as young as ever, Straizo.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.930
I can't believe we're the same age.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.640
Hamon energy is life energy.
I must say I envy you.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.840
49 years after Jonathan's death,
a new age has arrived.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.820
Straizo has succeeded Master Tonpetty,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.610
and Speedwagon has made a fortune.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.490
They set off for Mexico
to see something.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.180
That something was discovered by

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.500
a digging team founded by Speedwagon.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.090
That something was a secret known
only to those select few.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.050
When you witness this, I think,
no, I am sure you'll feel a chill.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.290
It's frightful enough to make
your hair stand on end.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.440
It's even worse than the terror we faced

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.440
50 years ago when we fought Dio.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.870
This place is tremendous.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.880
This is why I summoned you.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.330
I-It's...

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.040
...the mask!

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.030
There are so many of them!

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.960
New York, 1938

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.960
It was the fall of 1938.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.890
I was out looking for a mark as usual.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.590
You must be kidding!

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.440
You've never heard of this beverage?

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.320
By your accent, I'd say
you're from England. Tourist?

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.610
Oh? You just moved here, eh?

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.860
Anyhow, if you want a drink, pay me.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.660
Money is the rule here.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.250
Hey, friend!
He took your wallet! After him!

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.450
What a sucker!
Piece of cake!

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.600
Hey, Smokey. Looks like
I finally caught you red-handed!

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.330
You worthless street scum!

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.280
I'll make sure
they lock you up for 20 years!

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.880
Take it easy!
I only pinched a wallet!

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.570
I hate all of your bottom-feeding kind!

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.570
But I'm a nice guy.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.470
Bring me twenty dollars
every week.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.130
Plus half of what you steal.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500
Excuse me.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.300
Oh, it's the stooge who got robbed.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.630
I'm keeping your wallet
as evidence.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.500
Well, how should I put this?
Let's see...

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.020
That wallet was actually a gift
to him, officer.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.240
The 195 cm giant of an Englishman
was covering up for me!

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.790
So I need you to let go
of the wallet and the boy.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.280
What's that?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.120
Like I said, it was a gift.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.920
He's a close friend of mine.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.000
Please let him go.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.300
A close friend?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.380
Tell me your close friend's name.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.860
Don't lie to me!

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.430
You want to spend some time in the pen?

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.130
You bonehead!

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.240
I'm curious.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.800
I don't understand why you did that.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.700
What was the purpose behind it?

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.750
There's no purpose!
I do what I feel like, dimwit!

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.380
If someone wipes a booger
on your right cheek, then--

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.210
You picked the wrong man
to mess with, pig!

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.300
Y-You're resisting arrest!

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.900
Shoot me!
But I'm warning you!

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.980
When you pull the trigger,
I'll break your finger like a match!

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.650
Not from over there!
I'll blow your brains out!

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.450
Suddenly, it seemed to me
like his body was glowing.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.830
It was like magic.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.580
The cap flew off with enough
force to snap the cop's finger!

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.760
I lost my temper again!

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.240
N-Now I'm in trouble.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.850
G-Granny Erina will be furious!

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.660
W-What is this guy?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.880
He beats up cops and then worries

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.430
about what his granny will say?!

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.030
So, Mr. Pickpocket,
shall we high-tail it?

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.470
He didn't know how he launched
the bottle cap with such force.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.720
He said he could always do it.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.460
His grandpa died young,
but he could do the same thing.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.460
His dad died in the War,
but had no such talents.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.880
He didn't have a mom, either.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.380
I owe you big time.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.890
My name's Smokey.
What's yours?

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.520
Joestar.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.000
Joseph Joestar.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.400
Battle Tendency

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.030
Chapter 10: JoJo in New York

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.910
You can call me JoJo.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.790
What is this?
Who is the man in that pillar?

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.490
It's not a carving.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.600
He has amino acids. He has cells.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.800
And though faint,
he has body heat and a pulse.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.050
This man is alive!

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.480
Straizo, what is he exactly?
How long has he been here?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.560
What are the masks for?
Why is he here?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.580
None of that matters!
We have one purpose here!

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.010
I called you so that you
could destroy him utterly

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.950
with Hamon while he sleeps!

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.120
What of Joseph Joestar?

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.000
How is the young man doing?

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.870
I hear he used Hamon
to save your life once.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.260
Why bring JoJo up now?

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.890
I believe it was back
when he was 13 years old.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:30.050
Yes, some men hijacked your plane
so that they could ransom you.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.610
Hey, kid! You can't stay back here.
Get up front!

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.010
You're hijacking Speedwagon, right?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.160
I'm just a bystander.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.710
I'm just going to read my comic.
You go do your business.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.560
Don't give me any lip, punk!

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.450
JoJo!

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.870
T-This is bad.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:14.400
That suit were a gift from Erina.
That'll set him off for sure!

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.900
Take it easy, JoJo!

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:24.150
You guys knew the plane might crash
if you hijacked it, right?

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.790
Was that Hamon?

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.160
T-The kid is crazy!
We're gonna crash!

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.270
Grab the yoke!

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.210
I can't fly!

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.890
Wrap the pilot in this!
We're jumping!

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.140
You never think things through!

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.050
I do think.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:01.080
At least enough to keep
you and Granny Erina safe.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.930
You're my only family, after all.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:12.660
He looks just like his grandfather,
but he's far from a gentleman.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.830
That was when I discovered
that Joseph could use Hamon.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:24.010
So he inherited Hamon breathing
from his grandfather Jonathan.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.240
That's right.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.930
But why bring that up now?

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.270
W-What the devil?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.560
I just killed these men.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.730
And when you die...

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.810
...Jonathan's grandson will feel
grief and anger.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.940
He will grow to hate me.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.700
S-Straizo!

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.700
Straizo...

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.810
A-Are you mad?!

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.680
Quite the opposite.
My thinking is very clear.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.710
I chose the path of Hamon
in order to forge my body.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:28.690
But as I trained, the aging of my body
became painfully clear to me.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.410
Hamon gives only the slightest edge
over ordinary people.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.290
Its practice cannot prevent
the aging process.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.250
In the battle all those years ago,
I secretly admired Dio.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.880
He was powerful, beautiful
and immortal.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.490
I coveted the power of the mask.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.470
I didn't care who got in the way!

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.570
Y-You've become twisted, Straizo.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.430
Your blood will now
grant me immortality.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.550
With you gone, only Erina and

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.400
Joseph Joestar will know of the mask.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.130
Once I am rid of them, I'll take my time

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.410
and learn more of the mask than Dio did!

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.660
Y-You mustn't!

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.960
T-There are terrible things
we don't yet know!

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.800
Eri...na...

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.050
Jo...Jo...

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.440
Why don't you look
where you're going, dolt?!

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.690
Go find a dog
to lick your butt clean!

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.650
Now get out of the way, you...

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.440
Hello! What was that? Slow down!

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.040
Say that again so that I can
understand your gibberish!

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.460
I might have to smack you!

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.750
JoJo.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.130
What are you doing?

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.880
G-Granny Erina!

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.930
What are you doing to that man?

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.430
Well, uh, you see...

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:19.970
Taxi!

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.700
I was just grabbing a taxi.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.920
Oh, JoJo, you're so thoughtful.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.650
Climb in, Smokey.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:35.310
The Joestar family,
just a grandmother and grandson.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.410
Over time, I heard bits of their past.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:48.670
Granny, Speedwagon called us
all the way to New York, right?

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.800
And now he's off on a trip?
He's unbelievable.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.040
I'm sure his oil business
has him tied up.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.930
Hey, Granny...

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.200
Was Speedwagon really
Grandpa's best friend?

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.230
That's all? Really?

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.080
What are you implying?

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.140
Well, he's single, right?

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.160
And you're a widow.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:23.080
I just wondered if that was
the extent of your relationship.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.830
You scoundrel!

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.740
Sorry! Ow!

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.340
I was wrong! Forgive me!

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.320
I know Speedwagon is just loyal!

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.380
The Joestars were short-lived.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.860
Erina lost her husband
in an accident at sea.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.320
The son she was pregnant with and

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.380
a girl who survived the wreck married.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.650
They became JoJo's parents,
but were claimed by war and disease.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.150
Granny Erina was extraordinarily gentle,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.620
to punks like me and anyone else.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.730
Maybe it was because she was lonely.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.410
JoJo was the same.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.830
Their kindness got him into trouble.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.460
It was for my sake.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.380
Hey, waiter! Waiter!

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.090
Yes?

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.510
You let that stinking animal in here?

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.440
His odor is ruining my appetite!
You shouldn't let that kind in!

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.770
Sir, as long as the bill is paid,

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.410
we are happy to serve anyone.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.700
What? You mean you'll let
beasts like that eat beasts in here?

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.450
I'll just be on my way.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.630
JoJo!

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.300
Granny, you aren't going
to stop me, are you?

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.880
No. People can have
their own opinions...

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.390
...but he insulted a friend in public.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.140
Take him down,
but mind the other customers!

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.520
I was hoping you'd say that.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.370
Looking for a scrap, boy?

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.630
If you're looking
for your brass knuckles...

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.790
...they're not in your coat pocket!

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.790
Check your back pocket!

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.080
No way!

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.760
Now you'll say,
"How did you know that, bastard?!"

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.510
How did you know that, bastard?!

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.010
By the abrasions on your right hand,

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.310
I know you fight using brass knuckles.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:00.240
Plus, the blood
on your shirt isn't yours.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.800
You just came from a fight.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.710
Since the blood is on your shirt,

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.360
I know you took your coat off to fight.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.210
So when you removed your brass knuckles,

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.990
you had to put them in your back pocket.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:25.300
Now you'll say,
"So what, you little punk?!"

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.180
So what, you little punk?!

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.180
Gotcha!

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.940
You like that?!
Don't get uppity with me!

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.070
I'm afraid you missed.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.030
What are you punching?

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.570
It wasn't me you were pummeling
so happily.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.840
I can predict anything your simple brain
can come up with.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.080
Don't you get that, moron?

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.750
Please forgive my underling, madam.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.220
You're Erina Joestar, aren't you?

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.920
I do a lot of business
with Mr. Speedwagon.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.830
He told me all about you
in London a while back.

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.400
I'm glad to meet you.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.220
I heard something through the grapevine

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.490
that hasn't appeared in the papers yet.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.080
Mr. Speedwagon was killed.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.000
Are you serious?

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.420
Rumor has it his killer
was a Tibetan monk.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.840
A monk?

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.750
Straizo?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.090
The bodies of Speedwagon and his team

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.060
washed up along a river in Mexico.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:55.430
No one knows why they were killed
or where the monk went.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.520
I think I might know.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.740
It has to do with something
Speedwagon said long ago.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.530
It must involve the stone mask and Dio.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.510
JoJo, that guy's a mafioso!

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.310
Don't trust him! It must be a scheme!

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.540
Believe what you want.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.170
Try your breast pocket
if you want your lighter.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:32.390
Smokey, I appreciate the warning,
but I believe what he says.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.100
These guys are only after money.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:40.900
Information like that is valuable
to the Mob, so I believe it.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:41.940
But!

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.420
Even if it's true, you can't just say

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.450
something like that to Granny Erina.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.040
Do you see how you've upset her?!

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.450
You're thoughtless!

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:06.630
Events from 50 years ago
are coming back to haunt us.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.010
Don't be scared, Granny.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.720
I'm here for you.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.890
No, Joseph. I'm scared for you!

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.140
I don't want you to get
wrapped up in this.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:19.890
I'll be fine.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.150
If it's my fate, I accept it.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.450
I don't understand
what is going on, but...

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.660
...these two must
have an unimaginable history.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.130
Hey, Smokey.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.380
Chilly today, isn't it?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.130
Take a look at this magazine.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.430
What is it?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.350
Do you think it can really
make them bigger?

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.660
What's this?
"Go from an AA cup to a C cup."

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.650
It's a bunch of snake oil.
Don't buy into it.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:04.480
What's that?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.480
I think $1.25 a pair is too...

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.990
Let's see...

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.360
I say.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.130
You look kind of familiar,
yet different.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.270
Tell me, have we met before?

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:38.560
Why isn't your breath steaming
when it's so cold out?

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.560
And I think I caught a glimpse
of fangs in your mouth just now.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.730
Was I just seeing things?

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.530
Don't try to fool me.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:03.420
Even out here in the streets,
JoJo, I'm taking your life!

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.710
Before your abilities grow!

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.880
You think so?

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.390
I knew he was crazy, but not this crazy!

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.730
He's right in public!

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:27.730
Where did he even get that
Tommy gun he's blasting away with?!

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.750
I was waiting for you, Straizo!

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.990
I don't think you'll go down so easily.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.300
That was for Speedwagon.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.800
This is war!

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.520
Next episode

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.480
So this is a vampire!

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.480
I'll demolish you, Straizo!

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.730
German medicine is the world's greatest!

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.320
You don't understand a thing!

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.530
Apologize in hell!

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.820
