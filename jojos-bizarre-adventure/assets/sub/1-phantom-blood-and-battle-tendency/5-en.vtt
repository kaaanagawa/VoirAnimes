00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.490
Wind Knights Lot, a valley town
surrounded by sharp cliffs.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.200
Built in the Middle Ages
to train knights...

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.500
...it now serves as a prison
where inmates mine for coal.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.160
Farms and fishing give the town life.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.800
Its population including prisoners: 517.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.780
A terrible doom will soon visit them!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.700
Two stars fallen from the heavens

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.910
Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.170
Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.370
The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.520
And for the man who follows
his ambition...

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.430
...a sacrifice awaits

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.620
With pounding heart
and burning will

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.950
With thundering fists

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.410
And overflowing bravery

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.700
He steps forward, free of doubt

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.870
A fate determined by his blood

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.760
JoJo!

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.020
Chapter 5: Knights of Darkness

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.280
Everyone is hard at work.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.290
Things still appear peaceful.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.060
But I know Dio is around here somewhere.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.840
What happened?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.380
Um, well, Speedwagon
has been begging me for a while.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.640
So I thought I'd help him create
just a little Hamon.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.900
And my finger kind of slipped.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.290
I'm terribly sorry, Speedwagon.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.390
W-Why...you...

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.090
It's a kid, sir.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.720
Rather spry for such
a young cutpurse, eh?

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.120
Why are you just standing there?!

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.330
All of our money is in that bag!

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.410
That little devil!

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.250
A grab and dash in a single move.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.090
Let's see...

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.930
I think he can serve us as a guide.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.690
H-He's not sinking!

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.480
JoJo, if you're up to your knees,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.420
you need to build up more Hamon energy!

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800
That was a nice sound, JoJo.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.170
Your Overdrive
passed through perfectly.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.420
Do you think this is the spot?

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.590
No, a couple steps to the left.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.110
I'll bet two pounds on it.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.550
It shocked me!

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.670
Nice catch!

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.340
H-Huh? What's going on?

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.840
Who are you?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.920
Something's wrong with the boy.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.250
Did I use too much Hamon?

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.090
The boy is not the only thing
that's wrong.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.490
Look around.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.330
This is...!

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.510
A graveyard!

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.560
Looks like we were the ones
nicely caught in this trap.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.940
The boy was under
some sort of hypnosis.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.840
Jonathan, above you!

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.840
The sun is gone.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.000
Time for your lives to go with it!

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.670
Dio!

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.140
T-They're crawling out!

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.550
I-I've been preparing myself
for this moment.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.180
But I can't help being dismayed.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.880
I'm sweating here!

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.930
That arrogant monster is
right there in the flesh!

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.920
He repaid Sir Joestar's love
with bloody betrayal!

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.570
I won't let him get away with it!

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.090
So that is Dio.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.200
I see. He and his zombies
can't operate during the day.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.840
So he hypnotized the boy and lured us

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.960
to an arena where he has the advantage.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.580
A man of such guile
must not have the mask.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.250
We have to destroy him somehow!

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.680
Zombie knights!

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.460
What's your name?

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.710
P-Poco!

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.060
All right, Poco.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.690
Hang on tight!

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.340
Let's move, JoJo!

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.860
Yes, sir!

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.050
Zoom Punch!

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.160
Wow!

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.630
Dio Brando...

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.790
We've never met before.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.140
But I say this to the mask
that has awakened you.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.390
We meet at last.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.960
Hey, baby!

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.890
Do you plan on fighting from that perch?

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.900
Come on down!

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.140
You're a cocky one for an insect.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.090
I am the pinnacle of life.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.410
A new being that will create the future.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.450
I am incapable of sinking
down to a human level.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.090
I've never felt such malice!
He already fancies himself a tyrant!

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.710
This is the only scar that has yet
to heal after my fight with JoJo.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.480
Come, conjurer!

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.390
Let your blood salve this wound!

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.650
How many lives have you taken
to erase those scars?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.530
How many slices of bread have you eaten?

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.150
Dio!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.500
Baron Zeppeli!

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.420
I will handle this.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.460
You're going to suffer!

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.790
Solar Hamon, shine on me!

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.010
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.660
He did it!

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.890
His Hamon is flowing up Dio's arm!

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.860
How feeble!

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.720
I-It's freezing!

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.770
No!

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.370
Zeppeli was it?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.960
Your energy comes
from the flow of your blood.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.670
So if your blood vessels are frozen,
you're powerless.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.400
Know that I have absolute control
over my body.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.900
I vaporized the moisture in my left arm.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.590
When it vaporized, it sucked up heat,
flash freezing your arm.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.860
And now!

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.760
Buffoon!

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.320
I'll smash through your arm
and your skull like a vase!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.700
Dio, I'm ending your madness!

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.170
I feel Dio's wicked blood
flowing through his hand.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.260
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.640
But you did quite well to stop my fist.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.550
I must say I'm impressed.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.010
JoJo!

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.230
JoJo, if I were you,
I'd keep my hands to myself.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.020
Take this, Dio!

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.180
Once your arm is frozen,
blood will no longer flow through it!

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.830
Your Hamon energy will not work!

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.640
H-He's too strong!

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.470
He's five times as strong
as both of us together!

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.160
No! He'll freeze JoJo's arm
just like mine!

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.670
I can't let JoJo be hurt!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.770
Baron Zeppeli!

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.110
T-This can't be!

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.040
S-So cold!

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.320
It's so cold it burns!

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.450
My skin is peeling
like I touched cold metal!

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.790
Baron Zeppeli's arm!

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.750
Without circulation, it will rot!

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.480
He can't be stopped without
solar Hamon!

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.360
Can we stand against him?!

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.680
Hamon?

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.070
A breathing trick?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.220
If you want to huff and puff...

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.140
T-The ground is shaking!

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.310
...then you should trumpet
a fanfare in my honor!

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.970
Tarukus! Black Knight Blueford!

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.410
This fight is beneath me. Arise!

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.020
Make their screams
a fanfare dedicated to me!

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.180
W-Who are these creeps?!

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.890
Poco, run and hide!

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.140
In the 16th century, an ill-fated queen
was slain by Elizabeth I.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.940
You, fierce knights who
served Queen Mary Stuart!

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.350
Settle this!

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.310
I leave the extermination
of these pests to you!

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.200
Enjoy.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.100
He lifted and crushed that boulder
with just one finger!

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.420
Those two zombies are moving for JoJo!

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.530
T-There's no way he can handle both.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.990
If I had a little circulation...

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.330
Then what?

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.900
I could heal my arm a bit.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.930
Is there some way to thaw my arm?

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.690
Baron Zeppeli, you need to
heat up your arm, right?

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.720
Y-You have a plan?!

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.910
How about this?!

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.740
Speedwagon!

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:48.130
In the Arctic, people treat frostbite
by putting the wound inside a seal!

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.920
Zoom Punch!

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.390
Your blood is mine!

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.470
H-He's draining my blood!

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.100
Speedwagon, I...

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:11.030
I didn't come here
to slow you and Jonathan down!

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:17.110
If he can drink blood through his hair,
I can send Hamon up it!

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.850
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.290
It's not working!

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.370
Is this bloodsucker weakening my Hamon?!

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.250
I didn't give you enough credit.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.400
I thought you'd be the type to flee.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.680
I apologize.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.010
I'll accept your apology
if we live through this.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.980
I-I need to get my arm
into fighting form and fast!

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.630
That sight chills me
more than your arm did!

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:57.150
That blade makes
Jonathan's 195 cm frame look tiny!

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.410
That sinister black hair!
Those faces!

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.120
They have secrets!

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.790
I can read people,
and those two have secrets for sure!

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.910
Every Englishman knows the legendary
knights Tarukus and Blueford.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.290
Even history bows to my will!

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.910
Long ago, around 1565, two queens
fought in a war of royal succession:

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.450
Queen Elizabeth I...

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.000
...and the beautiful,
23-year-old Mary Stuart.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.990
The great knights Tarukus and Blueford
were her loyal vassals.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:41.290
The pair had lost their families
and Mary accepted them with warmth.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:47.710
Even the strongest man seeks respite,
not in romance, in something larger.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.720
The pair found that in Mary.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.660
They swore to honor her,
even if it meant ending their lives.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.050
But one day, Mary's husband
Lord Darnley unexpectedly died.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.560
Seeing a chance, Elizabeth blamed
Mary for Darnley's death.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:10.580
The land turned against Mary,
and she was caught and imprisoned.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.700
Tarukus and Blueford fought to free her.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.780
Elizabeth bargained
with the two thorns in her side.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.020
Turn yourselves in.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.540
If you do so, I'll spare Mary's life.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.430
There is no reason to refuse her offer.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.840
I have no regrets.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.850
The two were arrested...

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.250
...and executed.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:45.510
Here are a few words as a parting gift:
Mary is already dead.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.020
You were deceived.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.020
See that lying over there
like a pile of rubbish?

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.770
That's your Mary.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:06.700
You vile fiend, Elizabeth!
You betrayed us!

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:12.660
With my final breath I curse you
and all of your descendants!

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.330
I lay my curse upon you!

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.870
The knights were beheaded.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:28.990
It is said that Tarukus's neck was stiff
with fury, and took several axes to cut.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:33.360
Blueford's hair coiled around
his executioner's feet...

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.440
...digging into his killer's flesh.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.510
And the story of their delusion
gave me goose bumps.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.930
These legendary heroes cursed the world.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.310
I dug them up and gave them life!

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.850
I turned them
into unstoppable revenants!

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.790
We swore fealty to Lord Dio!

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:01.300
We have come to end the world!
Death to everyone!

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:06.300
S-Such hatred!
Their scorn has been amplified!

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.690
Dio's made heroes into monsters!

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.690
Can JoJo overcome this delusion?

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.190
Hamon that burns in my left hand!

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.520
Scarlet Overdrive!

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.240
A-Astounding!

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.100
I-I had forgotten!
Much rides on Jonathan's shoulders!

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:37.690
His father's death
and his hope for the future!

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.540
And the hope of us all!

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.090
This boy has some skill.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.010
He's perfect for warming up
after a 300-year nap.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.700
This one's flesh belongs to me!

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.940
I'll gnaw on his yummy cartilage!

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.480
Another zombie!

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.900
This is no place for pawns.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.660
W-What speed!

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.990
Lord Dio, this young man
has a great deal of spirit!

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.980
I ask for the pleasure of
drawing the curtains on his life!

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.130
As you will.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.460
Tarukus, stand aside.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:32.680
Black Knight Blueford, a supreme fighter
and utterly without mercy!

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.640
You can practically feel the pride
and skill flowing from him!

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.020
This is so strange.
I learned about him in school.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.440
And now he's coming
to kill me.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.770
I have to steady my breathing
and relax my muscles!

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.690
O-Oh, no! He's got both arms
behind his back!

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.130
Which will he attack with?
Or will he kick?

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.710
No! He uses his hair!

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.350
N-No!

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.520
You've got a keen eye
if you dodged my hair's Danse Macabre.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.600
I'm enjoying this.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.600
Jonathan!

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.580
This is bad!
He can't breathe down there!

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.650
He won't be able to use Hamon!

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.280
We have to go help him!

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.700
T-Tarukus!

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.410
Damn! We can't even help Jonathan!

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.700
It's already over.
He can't touch Blueford underwater.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.580
My supervision is no longer needed here.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.670
I'll now turn Wind Knights Lot
into a town of zombies!

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.950
Just one more night, then they will
spread through England like a plague!

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.500
I-I need to breathe to create Hamon!

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.990
Just one breath!

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.000
Now swim for the surface, boy.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.190
You can't breathe down here,
and my armor weighs me down.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.000
I won't use my sword.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.250
This is a duel between heroes!

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.630
You need to make your move
before you drown!

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.880
Can I make it to the surface
before he does?

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.750
What are my odds?

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.890
As death threatened to take JoJo,
his explosive inner reserves awakened!

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.870
An ordinary man, his lungs screaming
for breath, would swim upward.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.650
But not JoJo!

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.780
Instead, he turned and swam
deeper toward the bottom!

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.650
W-What is he thinking?

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.890
Hmm? Danny won't let go of your toy gun?

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.050
It's because you're trying
to take it away.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.130
Change your thinking.
Try giving it to Danny instead.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.390
Wind Knights Lot is a coal town.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.340
That means the ground sunk long ago.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.300
There!

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.770
There should be air trapped
under the rocks!

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.440
I found it!

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.090
With just one breath,
my blood's beat has returned!

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.200
I-Impossible!

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.950
The tables have turned on you!

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.960
Hamon will travel even better down here!

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.010
Underwater...

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:53.920
Turquoise Blue Overdrive!

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.520
Next episode

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.630
Blueford is a mess!

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.440
I'm a master of slaughter!

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.910
This pain is nothing.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.330
You will be destined to die.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.530
Life Magnetism Overdrive!

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.120
Chapter 6: Tomorrow's Pluck
