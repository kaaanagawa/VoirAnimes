WEBVTT

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.330
From the silent depths

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.090
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.680
Crimson blood

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.560
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.780
If inherited love is called fate

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.910
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.580
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.340
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.920
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.100
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.930
Destiny written into your veins

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.690
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.610
Take hold of them

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.910
Chapter 23: The Warrior of Wind

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.920
T-That wind...
It's flowing toward Wamuu.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.570
My ultimate mastery:
Atmospheric Rift!

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.180
T-That's wind?!

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.220
You're near the flame,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.190
so I only know your
approximate location.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.570
But now that you can't use Hamon,
I'll find you eventually...

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.440
...and cut you down.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.030
Atmospheric Rift
is Wamuu's final weapon.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.040
The pipes he uses to cloak himself
suck up huge amounts of air

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.160
and then compress it.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.910
The air is then blasted out of
a paper-thin slit.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.210
It is a razor made of wind.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.720
But it creates a terrible amount of
heat and friction, even for Wamuu.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.470
His body can't handle it,
so it's falling apart.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.100
But that tragic figure
is truly breathtaking.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.860
Victory is yours!
Take his life to salve your wounds!

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.610
JoJo!

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.910
I-It's close!

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.360
I'll have to use one of my tricks!

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.870
This one's called the Hamon oil trick!

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.120
His lungs are like
high-pressure oxygen tanks.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.960
Those pipes...

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.380
If I can hit them...

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.130
...he'll suck in the flames and explode!

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.550
But this is the last ace up my sleeve.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.260
If I mess this up...

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.350
I've got you now!

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.220
Blast it!

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.100
Take this, Wamuu!

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.630
A firebomb?

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.190
Pathetic.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.070
I can sense things
that are away from the flames.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.030
You're out of tricks.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.830
And that cry gave away your position.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.000
Now...

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.330
Atmospheric Rift!

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.210
Caesar!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.800
Lend me your aid!

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.220
More fire?

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.260
I can sense things away from the flames.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.890
And now I will cut you in half
to claim my victory.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.350
JoJo!

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.230
H-He's finally won it.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.860
Wamuu...

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.990
You lost the moment
I threw Caesar's bandana.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.080
Don't you see I meant for you
to break the bottle?

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.460
Your ability to cut it so easily
led to your defeat.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.590
The oil that was inside is now vapor.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.300
And the bandana you sliced up?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.340
The fire...

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.520
...it's still burning.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.600
And I'm sucking it in!

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.220
Wamuu...

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.270
You were an admirable fighter.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.360
But a powerful ally named Caesar
was with me this whole time.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.310
H-He lost.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.350
He lost!

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.580
Lord Wamuu!

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.140
JoJo, that creature can regenerate,
even after exploding like that.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.820
Use your strongest Hamon
to finish him completely!

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.650
S-So it's finally over, Jo...Jo...

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.280
It is.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.530
You paid me back for Caesar.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.280
I did.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.370
Then do it.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.910
Finish me.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.580
I will!

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.100
W-What is this?!

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.720
That smoke isn't from the explosion.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.540
It's from your wounds.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.340
The Hamon from your limbs
spread throughout your body.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.110
I know how painful that must be
for your kind.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.060
I cannot mend you.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.490
But my blood can ease
your pain before you go.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.920
Do you wish to shame me as I die?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.880
Stop! I don't need your pity!

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.340
Pity?

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.210
Did you say pity?

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.490
So why did you ignore the bubble

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.450
that carried Caesar's bandana and this ring?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.390
Was it pity?

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.190
It was because that man
was a proud warrior.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.610
I wished to honor him.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.280
No, JoJo, you don't...

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.780
No, JoJo, you don't...

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.490
I do, Wamuu.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.830
A fight is a fight.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.000
My grief for Caesar is my grief.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.380
Somehow, I wanted to honor you in return.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.460
My blood pays tribute to you.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.470
I have lost, JoJo.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.930
It seems that as a warrior,
you stand taller than I did.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.520
Kill the bastard!

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.730
Hold!

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.860
What betrayal is this?!

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.610
What?!

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.580
You recreants!

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.290
Wamuu!

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.960
W-Why?

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.840
I am sworn to Lord Kars, but I will

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.300
not allow the vampires to attack you.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.840
I told Caesar this as well.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.350
It's not because I am sentimental.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.060
To me, only the strong are real.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.520
Victory alone is just and admirable.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.110
I merely lived according
to my own code of honor.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.820
To me, immortality was a trivial thing.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.160
All that mattered
was living up to my code.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.210
Now...

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.330
Drink the antidote for me.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.840
Do it before I fade.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.880
Will you see?

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.050
I don't need eyes, a horn, or words.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.430
I will know.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.510
The action is what matters.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.610
I have no regrets.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.820
I am glad I was able
to witness your growth.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:10.370
Perhaps I lived these thousands
of years in order to

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.790
meet you at the end.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.460
Fare...well...

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.170
Jo...Jo...

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.870
Wamuu merged into the wind.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.730
JoJo immediately gave
his opponent a last salute.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.060
Though he shed no tears,
they had shared a silent song.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.650
They had shared an affinity.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.720
Wamuu, kill him.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.590
B-But Lord Kars...

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.690
With respect, he's only a boy.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.230
A boy? That he is.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.690
That's why he must die.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.970
If these Hamon-users grow up,
they'll be deadly enemies.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.350
And humans grow quite rapidly.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.910
Can you do it, Wamuu?

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.350
Well, since you can't do it yourself...

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.730
...let me show you how.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.070
This is how it's done, Wamuu!

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.360
Wamuu...

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.120
He was too pure a warrior.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.490
That purity made him weak!

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.890
Hey, Wamuu just lost!

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.790
What a disappointment.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.480
That fool was just posturing.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.420
Your friends are so low,
it makes me want to puke.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.760
Lord Kars...

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.970
H-He's drinking us.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.020
Now only I remain.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.230
However...

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.450
I alone always stand on top!

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.990
Look at Lord Kars!

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.740
Lord Kars is...!

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.490
He's ready to fight!

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.960
But Lord Kars, there's no reason
to fight one-on-one!

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.250
Who needs rules? Let us take them!

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.970
We'll turn them into sprays of blood!

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.720
I thought you'd do this!

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.320
I told you!

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.390
T-The Red Stone!

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.130
It's me against Kars, one-on-one.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.730
But if you don't like those terms,

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.270
I'll just smash it!

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.030
I'm a man of my word.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.690
One-on-one.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.030
My promise still stands.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.890
That's why I revealed my horn to you.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:02.870
As for my underlings' behavior,
they're already dead, as you can see.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.420
Lord Kars?!

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.420
All I want is that Red Stone.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:16.260
However, Wamuu and Esidisi
were my comrades for 10,000 years.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.310
I must honor both their deaths
and their pride.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.440
I will fight you Hamon-users fairly...

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.690
...and finish this with my own hands.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:34.710
And Lisa Lisa, after seeing you fight,
I won't think of you as a woman.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.530
I will fight you with all my strength.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.290
Come!

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.790
We fight over there.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.540
The temple at Piz Berlina.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.340
Champions once came here to drink the

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.560
blood of the fallen mixed with liquor.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.550
They thanked the gods
for the joy of life.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.680
It's not an arena,
but it will add to our fight.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.940
C-Coach Lisa Lisa, you may be strong,
but you're still a woman.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.190
He looks weaker than Wamuu.
I'll take him!

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.400
You won't.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.950
I haven't lived my life so that
a stripling has to stand up for me.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.450
You're 50, all right!

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.190
I will use my Brilliant Bone Blade.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.460
I would offend Wamuu
if I didn't offer you a weapon.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.840
Take your pick.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.720
My scarf will suffice.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:39.800
I see.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.470
Then let us fight.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.940
T-There's no violence in Kars's stance.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.450
How can he fight without violence?

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.240
What's wrong? Not coming?

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.660
Then I'll have to make a move!

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.460
Kars disappeared with that light!

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.710
W-Where is he?!

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.090
Kars... I can feel something...

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.970
But it's coming from both
above and below.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.900
Brilliant Bone Blade!

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.480
A crack in the pillar!

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.820
Snake Muffler!

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:45.200
This Satiporoja beetle scarf
is a perfect Hamon conductor.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.540
It is a weapon and a life-detector!

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.380
It even picks up attacks from behind!

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.030
S-She did it!

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.220
That's my coach! Wonderful!

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:08.090
He didn't compare to Wamuu,
but barkers seldom bite!

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.270
Though you are better than me, coach!

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:12.980
Wha--?!

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.110
L-Lord Kars!

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.360
Kars is behind her.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.490
Who is b-below her?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.240
W-What the...?!

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.830
What the hell is going on?!

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.660
Kars wasn't the one fighting!

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.080
It was a double!

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.590
How utterly stupid.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.700
Why would I fight one-on-one?

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.010
All I want is the Red Stone.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.800
My goal is to be the ultimate life form.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.770
I am not a warrior like Wamuu,
nor am I a romantic.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.770
No matter what the method,
in the end...

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.780
...victory is all that matters!

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.490
T-That's why I felt no violence.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.370
He never intended to fight me himself.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.580
It's over!

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.710
Jo...Jo...

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.000
The Red Stone is mine!

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:22.760
Now all that's left is for all of you
to kill that annoying JoJo!

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.640
K-Kars!

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.140
You're going down!

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.520
Kars!

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.550
Out of the way!
I'll split your damned skulls!

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.120
Zoom Punch!

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.210
Your Hamon isn't working.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.700
He's weakened! Now--

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.580
Rebuff Overdrive!

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.800
You look worn out.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.620
Your breathing is ragged
and your Hamon is weak.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:11.770
And you're all that's left of
the Hamon-users Lisa Lisa trained.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.390
Will you last?

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.400
Will you last, JoJo?

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.160
Will you last?

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.570
S-Son of a...

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.700
Flay him alive!

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.700
C-Crap!

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.590
T-That light!

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.800
That face!

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.220
Listen up, vampires!

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.350
You're up against von Stroheim
and the German elite!

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.980
And we're the Speedwagon Foundation
Special Forces!

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.820
JoJo!

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.730
JoJo!

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.390
I-It's Speedwagon!

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.430
And Smokey from New York!

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.910
My right leg is a bit stiff...

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.000
...but my body has been repaired!

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.290
Now taste our anti-vampire weaponry!

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.230
Ultraviolet lasers!

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.930
The Speedwagon Foundation miniaturized them,

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.970
but he does like to brag.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.310
Crafty little creatures.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.690
Where is JoJo?

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.900
He's gone!

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.780
He's as quick as ever.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.870
Take your eyes off him
and he'll hatch a scheme in no time.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.920
You crossed a line
you shouldn't have crossed.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:06.630
You said you'd fight fairly,
but you cheated Lisa Lisa!

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:13.140
And that act betrayed the memory
of Wamuu, your fallen comrade!

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.140
You can save your indignation, scum.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.390
The end justifies the means.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.650
All that matters is the Red Stone.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.110
You have to save effort,
minimize danger,

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.240
avoid risks,
and move your pawns carefully.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.450
That is the real battle.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:41.000
And now I'll maneuver you
into my hands and to your death.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.380
Let me tell you something, Kars!

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.800
I've never hated anyone as much as you!

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.590
You hate me?

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.950
Then show me.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.310
One-on-one. We'll fight
one-on-one like you wanted.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.050
Lisa Lisa is mostly dead.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.810
But only mostly.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.820
I did that on purpose. I left her alive.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.320
Why would I do that?

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.700
She's another pawn.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.700
JoJo, she's a pawn I can use
against you.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.460
Bastard!

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.470
I've sewn her feet together
with this rope.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.680
Why am I doing this?

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.060
Here's why!

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.350
Lisa Lisa!

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.500
Off you go!

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.150
She'd be a bad pawn if she fell!

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:55.450
If you let go, she'll splatter
on the ground and die!

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.620
J-JoJo! Lisa Lisa!

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.170
Lisa Lisa?

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.750
That Lisa Lisa?

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:14.130
Do you mean the baby on the ship
Granny Erina told us about?

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.220
T-That means that woman is JoJo's...

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.990
Now you're glued to that spot.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.810
Welcome to real battle, JoJo.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:33.690
I'll just walk up to you
and slice you down while you can't move!

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.700
Kars, you bastard!

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.750
I hope you rot in hell forever!

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.210
JoJo doesn't know.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.660
He doesn't know that
that woman is his own mother!

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.480
Next episode

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.600
Are the vampires finished?!

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.230
I want to kill you at my leisure.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.360
The fire is a gamble!

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.130
This child... This child...

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.580
Don't, von Stroheim!

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.490
No!

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.850
Chapter 24: The Ties that Bind JoJo
