WEBVTT

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.870
Something isn't right.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.850
I've felt someone's eyes
on me since this morning.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.770
But nobody could be out here.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.610
I'm on a motorcycle
in the middle of the open desert.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.280
Who could be following me unseen?

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.230
There's no way.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.290
It has to be my imagination.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.400
You're a sharp one.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.510
You sensed my presence, a feat even
wild bats aren't able to accomplish.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.510
Who the hell are you
and why are you tailing me?!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.250
I'm not tailing you!

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.520
I'm capturing you so our army
can ask about Straizo, Joseph Joestar!

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.370
S-Straizo?!

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.410
Our army?!

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.040
From the silent depths

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.130
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.430
Crimson blood

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.230
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.490
If inherited love is called fate

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.660
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.250
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.050
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.260
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.770
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.650
Destiny written into your veins

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.400
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.740
Take hold of them

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.920
Chapter 12: The Pillar Man

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.920
By your face and accent,
I'd say you're German.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.670
What do you have to do
with Straizo and Speedwagon?!

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.220
Come on!
I'll beat some answers out of you!

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.270
You face the SS commando knife of I,
Donobang, with your bare hands?

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.230
I feel insulted.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.230
Come then, stripling!

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.960
Here! Have your flea-ridden
magic carpet back!

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.280
A-A cactus!

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.890
Victory!

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.920
You'll need to do better than that
to challenge me, you booger!

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.680
Now, my booger, say,
"I completely agree, Herr Donobang."

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.180
I-I completely agree, Herr Donobang.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.330
What's that? I can't hear you.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.820
You're a very nimble fellow.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.900
I wanted to save myself some trouble
so I'm lying down here for safety.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.890
What? You think you're safe there?

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.620
Have you lost your mind?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.660
Wh-What's with this cactus?

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.440
Take a real close look.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.830
The cactus was my goal all along!

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.690
Cacti are made up of 95% water
and conduct Hamon fabulously.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.840
Now, it's time to talk, Donobang!

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.690
Tell me everything you know.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.950
I see.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.350
When Speedwagon's body disappeared
I had my hopes, but...

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.700
He really was safe.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.460
Well. That's a fine piece of news.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.350
Granny Erina will be
pleased to hear it.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.890
But who knows how the Germans
are treating him?

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.390
I'll rescue him.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.310
Then I'll rush home
to see Granny Erina's smile!

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.240
D-Don't leave me!

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.410
Major von Stroheim,
the pillar is cracking!

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.170
It now holds the blood
of five prisoners.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.830
The subject's capabilities are unknown.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.420
Feeding it too much may be dangerous.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.800
How was the blood extracted?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.560
No! Don't answer that! I can imagine.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.780
Speedwagon.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.780
Why so scared?
Aren't you overreacting a bit?

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.040
Don't be too proud! He's dangerous!

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.210
Listen to me.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.790
That room is a bunker.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.750
Its iron walls are 50 cm thick!

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.930
It is equipped with flamethrowers,
machine guns and time bombs.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.510
What child fears a grizzly
in a cage at the zoo?

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.270
None at all!

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:54.940
I believe he's nothing more than a
cheap caveman who's lived too long!

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.700
Something's spraying out!

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.620
It's blood!

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.320
The blood it absorbed
is pouring out!

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.800
We can't see a thing!

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.460
Use the sprinkler system!

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.780
His outer layer is taking on
a flesh-like color and luster!

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.530
He's alive! He looks human!

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.610
He needs a name.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.040
"The Pillar Man" is awkward to use.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.270
I, Stroheim, will be his godfather!

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.330
Let me think.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.050
I'll name him after the
Mexican sirocco! Santviento!

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.180
He's standing!

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.680
Stand up for us!

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.310
Show us what you are made of, Santviento!

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.740
Look at that! Our Santviento
is quite the comedian, isn't he?!

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.790
The ultimate organism?!
What's ultimate?!

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.890
Behold, Speedwagon!

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.520
He's sniffing around like
a man barely out of the trees!

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.500
Do you think he has much brains?

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.010
This is a farce!

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.630
Whatever. Let's say he made the masks.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.510
You, begin the experiment.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.760
Open the door to the next chamber.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.510
Yes, sir!

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.690
W-What is that?!

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.550
A prisoner.
A prisoner with a mask, that is.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.450
A-A vampire?

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:53.950
A few days ago, he was a feeble,
toothless old man on death's door.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.070
We haven't fed him today,
so he must be thirsty.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.790
He'll attack quickly.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.090
How will they perform?
Let's watch and see!

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.090
What's this? What a surprise!

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.390
Is he just an ordinary man?

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.860
We have no other subjects to test!

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.820
Shall we use the explosives planted in

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.510
the prisoner's head, Major von Stroheim?

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.450
Major?!

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.160
Very well. Do it!

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.800
W-Wait! Belay that order!

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.130
His jaw. L-Look at his lower jaw!

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:47.100
A-And his arms. Look! Look at his arms!

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.970
I thought he was losing the fight,
but Santviento is absorbing the prisoner!

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.450
He is pulling him into his body.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.060
He's eating the prisoner!

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.000
What a fantastic creature!

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.990
The masked man is his fodder!

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.660
Santviento feeds with his whole body!

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:21.670
T-That means he'll take in all of
his prey's energy!

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.800
He ate him! He ate the masked man!

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.670
He ate him!

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.930
A-And he's grown!

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.680
Keep your head!

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.430
Remember he's in a sealed chamber!

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.660
He only gained some weight
after feeding.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.690
And his intelligence?

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.110
What of his intelligence?

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.030
Is he capable of thought?

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.830
S-Stroheim.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.450
What the...?! He spoke!

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.120
H-He said my name!

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.090
But he shouldn't be able
to hear me in there!

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:25.060
My cactus pal Donobang said this is where
the secret underground facility is.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.250
Speedwagon has to be in there.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.250
Now, how to get inside?

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:39.370
Vegetables, canned goods, meat, ham,
eggs. That's a basket of food.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.870
All right. Now we have to frisk you!

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.850
Don't make that face.
Smile when I frisk you!

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.400
Raise your skirts! And smile!

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.100
Go on through!

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.230
Next!

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.980
I've brought you some tequila.
Is that all right to bring through?

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.110
Put your hands up!
You twitch and we shoot!

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.520
Why? Why are you panicking?!

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.870
That's a furtive movement!

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.120
Fire!

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.790
Hold it! I-I understand! I won't move!

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.140
Damn! Y-You Germans are too smart!

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.550
You saw right through my disguise!

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.920
You're nuts! Of course we did!
What a creep!

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.720
No girl in the world is built like
such an ox, you ox!

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.560
Look at yourself
with clearer eyes, moron!

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.100
What was that?!

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.860
Hamon!

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.660
Oh, tacos!

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.200
Shoot, that was depressing.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.210
I suppose they won't see
through an army uniform.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.090
W-What's going on?

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.630
I-I can't tell.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.220
Weren't you watching?

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.970
Major von Stroheim, I was
looking away for a moment.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.720
You were here.
Everyone was here.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.230
But nobody saw.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.150
This is no time for refreshments!

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.740
I-It was only a moment.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.410
I only took my eyes off of him
for a few seconds.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:47.250
My vision is perfect, but I couldn't
see what was happening inside!

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.250
This is unbelievable!

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.240
The chamber is sealed!

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.830
But the subject somehow escaped!

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.340
The walls show no damage!

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.470
Listen up! Calm down and search for him!

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.470
I am sure he's just concealed
himself somewhere!

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.480
Cut off all oxygen!
We'll wait for him to come out!

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.200
The film record is ready for viewing!

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.710
Show it to us!

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.230
Yes, sir!

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.710
Begin.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.670
He's running for the wall!

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.500
H-He couldn't be...!

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:52.660
He's going into the ventilation ducts!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.300
The entrance is only
four by twenty centimeters!

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.360
But somehow he's stuffing himself
into that tiny gap!

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.260
Incredible! He didn't just
dislocate his joints!

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.750
H-He broke up his own skeleton
to twist and alter his shape!

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:28.140
T-That means he's somewhere
in the base's ventilation system!

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.390
The Pillar Man Santviento spoke your name
earlier, Major von Stroheim.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.150
He must have heard your name
through the vents!

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.900
Do the vents lead here?!

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.430
Soldier! Stand away from that vent!
You're in danger!

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.100
I-It's Santviento!

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:11.770
Major von Stroheim,
did something happen?

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.770
It's so dark! I can't see!

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.520
Who turned out the lights?

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.530
Santviento crawled into the soldier's body!

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.360
Where is everybody?!

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.410
Don't leave me here all alone!

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.920
I'm not sure what's going on...

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.220
...but I've never felt so full of life!

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.220
What a nightmare.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.730
If this creature escapes,
it will be a dire foe to the Fatherland!

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.000
We must destroy it!

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.730
It has to be killed here and now!

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:01.480
Very well! Shoot him!
Blast that soldier's body to pieces!

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.450
That tickles!

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.460
He's still alive!

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.400
I knew it!

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.750
He's immune to bullets!

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.220
What a monster!

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.270
Why is he pointing?

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.430
What's he gonna do?!

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.190
Wait! Do you think he's
making a pistol?!

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.440
Is he imitating us?

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.040
W-When he spoke, he only said my name.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.990
He's mimicking us!

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.410
It's just mindless aping.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.810
That means he's not intelligent at all!

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.960
If he's only as smart as a monkey,
perhaps we can still use him!

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.400
You...

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.590
Who among you disturbed my slumber?

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.390
H-He spoke!

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.390
He is capable of thought.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.600
A-And his intelligence is great!

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.600
He has learned our speech
in this short time!

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.610
Die!

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.070
What the...?

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:43.540
He took a bullet we shot at him
and fired it back at us!

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.500
Hey, old man!
Hide over here!

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.260
He's still got more bullets to fire!

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.050
No! I don't need any help
from a German soldier!

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:56.060
Good heavens.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.160
You never change.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.230
Still stubborn at a time like this.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.250
I-I can't handle this alone!

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.120
S-Stay away!

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.050
Hey, I need some of your hair!
Just a handful or two!

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.500
Yeeowch! What are you doing?!

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.590
It'll only hurt for a bit.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.750
You're assaulting an officer!

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.370
Who are you?

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.970
That brashness... It couldn't be...!

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.360
I call this one Hamon Hair Attack!

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.910
You're... You're...!

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.910
Joseph Joestar!

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:05.830
Barrier up!

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.080
I think you need to start moisturizing.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.940
If you aren't careful, you'll go bald,
Mr. German Army Man.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.070
W-When did you get here?

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.070
Hey, old man!

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.080
Ha...ir...

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.750
Anyhow...

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.300
...what a scene I've dropped in on.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.600
Next episode

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.650
His intelligence is incredible!

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.900
This is horrifying!

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.770
Now together, Santviento!

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.220
You primitive.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.610
He's crawling into the wound in my leg!

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.180
