00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.410
JoJo...

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.040
S-So you're JoJo?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.530
Listen up, JoJo.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.140
Santviento, the Pillar Man, uses the mask
to turn men into vampires.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.130
He makes them stronger
so he can eat them.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.510
He's a grave threat!
He must be destroyed!

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.810
Careful, JoJo!

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.360
Tag!

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.020
You spoke a minute ago, right?

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.840
Hello! How are you?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.490
Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.790
Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.650
Now together, Santviento!

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.040
Three, four!

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.250
Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.870
From the silent depths

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.620
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.330
Crimson blood

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.080
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.370
If inherited love is called fate

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.660
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.080
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.790
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.950
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.700
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.540
Destiny written into your veins

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.250
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330
Take hold of them

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.920
Chapter 13: JoJo vs. The Ultimate Being

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.850
Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.310
JoJo, stop fooling around!

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.270
JoJo, what are you doing?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.790
Well, I have a theory that
he's not a bad guy after all.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.280
I'm testing it out.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.160
I think it's wrong to assume
someone is evil.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.540
Don't be an idiot!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.330
Look at these dead soldiers!

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.430
Nonsense! You reap what you sow!

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.510
You experimented on him
and blasted him with guns!

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.090
Besides, Speedwagon, I came here

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.510
so that I can get you back to New York.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.380
I have no reason to fight.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.040
Now, everyone!
Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.820
What's this guy's problem?
He's just ignoring me.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.700
I'm a bit upset.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.290
Fine. I'll just stick my foot out
and trip him!

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.580
W-What happened?

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.050
Th-That was the strangest sensation.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.560
This is new to me.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.270
What is this tool?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.690
He spoke!
He really does understand!

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.780
Somehow he's mastered our language!

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.630
A-Amazing!

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.960
He's pulling it apart like
an expert watchmaker!

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.470
Soldiers need hours of drilling
in order to do that!

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.840
H-His intelligence is incredible!

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.260
So bright.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.340
This light is also new to me.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.600
We weren't the ones observing!

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.320
It was him watching us!

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.100
Listen here, pal!

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.960
If you can understand,
then respond!

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.610
Knock, knock!

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.860
Watch out, JoJo!

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.240
You begin to irritate me, primitive.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.910
What the...?!

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.140
Rib Blades,
also known as Fighting Ribs.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.200
Maximum reach: 132 cm
Maximum pressure: 825 kg/cm2

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.210
Capable of turning in
any direction!

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.290
JoJo!

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.850
Sparks?

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.810
What is this human?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.990
My body didn't absorb his.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.160
He flew away.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.020
His leg also appears fine.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.160
I have never seen such a human.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.610
Is he a unique specimen?

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.560
Or all humans of this age the same?

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.670
It appears that human is unique.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.520
JoJo, this is horrible!

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.900
Old man...

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.280
You bastard!

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.660
Let go of the old man!

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.050
Now I feel like fighting!

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.160
I'll have you mounted in a museum!

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.290
Humans have also evolved somewhat.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.220
I'll flood you full of Hamon!

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.220
The Hamon is making that blood...!

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.180
It's not working!

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.500
My Hamon is running off of him like rain

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.410
from a raincoat and into that blood!

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.000
His skin is acting like a ground
just like Straizo's scarf!

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.330
My body and his body repel each other.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.630
M-My hand...

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.890
...it's...

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.890
...it's...

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.430
...still there.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.020
Just a little joke.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.150
I rolled my wrist forward
in the nick of time!

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.050
But this is a serious pickle.
He's immune to Hamon!

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.720
What should I do?

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.490
No, he's not!

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.580
Hamon works! It's protecting you!

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.960
It keeps his body from eating you!

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.840
Fool! What do you do
when you eat a blowfish?

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.380
You kill it, remove
the poison parts and eat!

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.140
It will be no different for Santviento!

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.990
Well this is a perfect mess!
I have to think of something fast!

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.890
I need an escape plan at least!

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.860
Absolutely not!
You can't let Santviento get out!

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.440
He's a danger to mankind!

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.870
Shut up! Don't talk like
you didn't have a hand in this!

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.370
And you think I need more pressure?!

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:39.250
I'll send Hamon right into his body
through this knife!

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.140
His skin is bending like rubber!

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.890
But can you dodge this?!

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.270
Here's Hamon in your eye!

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.730
This is a surefire hit!

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.860
Wha-What?!

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.280
Even his eyes are like rubber!

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.490
No! JoJo, get out of there!

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.350
JoJo!

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.870
He won't be able to breathe after
being hit there!

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.960
He seems to create energy in
his blood through breathing.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.470
But while unconscious,
he's an ordinary human.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.040
JoJo! Use your Hamon breathing!

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.640
Breathe, damn it!

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.230
Use your Hamon breathing!

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.270
JoJo!

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.150
This is the end!
I have to use the self-destruct!

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.080
For the Fatherland!

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.480
For eternal glo--

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.080
Hold it, von Stroheim!

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.500
No need to panic!

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.790
I took a big gamble.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.530
Attacks from outside are no good.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.560
So I'll send Hamon into him
while he eats.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.010
JoJo!

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.220
I was waiting for him to try this!

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.520
This is perfect!

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.560
Enjoy your Hamon treat!

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.850
I-I get it now.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.210
After entering that foul body,
I understand its digestive process.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.270
Each of his cells uses digestive fluid

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.370
to dissolve the cells of his prey.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.820
That's why he appears to
absorb his opponents.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:00.560
I'm only safe because I sent Hamon
into him as he tried to dissolve me.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.300
But your Hamon was too weak!

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.200
It wasn't enough to destroy Santviento!

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.790
Chunks of his body
are trying to reform!

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.130
Straizo did something like this,
so I figured you would do the same!

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.300
Von Stroheim!

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.600
Pay attention!

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.810
Does sunlight hurt him?!

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.350
Y-Yes!

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.150
Joestar, it was written
on the walls of the cave!

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.280
Sunlight will hurt him!

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.450
He made the masks to conquer the sun!

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.750
What are you doing, Joestar?!

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.210
That door leads outside!

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:09.380
I'll destroy you with sunlight!

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.430
He's running out of breath!
He'll lose control of his Hamon!

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.180
He hasn't trained with it,
so the battle has tired him!

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.940
Cease this foolishness, primitive!

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.740
JoJo, use your Hamon breathing!

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.370
If I could breathe,
I wouldn't be so tired!

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.000
Damn it!

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.830
I've had more than enough of you!

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:53.170
I'm dragging you up these stairs
so you can do some sunbathing!

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.310
What the...?!

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.230
Heavy... I feel so heavy.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.190
Wh-What's happening?

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.190
Meat Invade, also known as Foul Flesh.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.360
Bits of Santviento are attacking!

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.590
They're draining me!

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.580
Y-You son of a...

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.580
Keep moving...

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:31.340
I never expected such a human
to be born while I slumbered.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.780
Leave the rest to me,
Rudol von Stroheim!

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.650
It's just this door, right?

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.360
I believe I can handle that for you!

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.090
Von Stroheim, you...

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.540
Cursed peasants.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.470
Just a few centimeters more!

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.880
A meaningless struggle.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.600
This is trouble.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.980
Joestar, could you do me a favor?

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.490
What is it?! I'm trying to think!
Be quiet!

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.150
Listen to me!

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.950
You see the axes on the wall?
Can you reach one?

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.740
Use one to chop off my leg!

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.500
Wh-What?!

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.110
Use an axe to hack off my leg!
Then I can reach the door!

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.840
B-But...

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.510
You're really asking me to do that?!

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.070
Just do it! He's starting to reform!

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.430
Don't ask me! I'm not a doctor!

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:11.280
I'm a proud servant of the Wehrmacht!
I am prepared to do my duty!

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.400
I would proudly give a few legs
for the sake of the Fatherland!

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.150
Do it now, Joestar!

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.740
Quit fussing!

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.410
If you want me to chop, I'll chop!

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.910
I want you to chop!

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.490
I figured he was all hot air, but when

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.780
it comes down to it, he's got real guts.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.880
We think differently,
but I respect your courage.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.510
Forgive me!

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.160
How do you feel now that
you're in the sun?!

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.500
Did we do it?

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.800
Wh-What?!

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.140
He's crawling into the wound in my leg!

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.560
Get out of there!

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.100
This is a shock!

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.230
Von Stroheim is safe and Hamon-free!

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.390
Santviento is inside me!

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.050
What a fearsome creature!

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.160
What tenacity to live!

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.670
If he's inside von Stroheim,
he is safe even in sunlight!

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.850
S-Such horror!

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.510
This is horrifying!

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.470
Do you know what frightens me, Joestar?

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:12.470
My leg doesn't hurt.
In fact, it feels quite pleasant!

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.310
Von Stroheim!

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.200
Hold on!

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.160
Y-You won't...

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.330
Joestar!

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.590
You've seen what Santviento,
the ultimate being, can do.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.420
There is no hope for me.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.430
I'll use this to destroy both of us.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.600
But I must tell you something
before I die.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.640
So listen up, you annoying Englishman.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.010
The Wehrmacht did not awaken Santviento

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.860
because of military curiosity alone.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.740
What?

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.780
Why so suddenly?!

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.120
Listen!

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.620
It is your destiny to hear this!

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:22.040
Recently the Wehrmacht discovered
another Pillar hidden in Europe!

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.090
W-What?!

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.380
Von Stroheim, are you serious?!

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.880
That means Santviento is not unique.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:39.640
The Pillar Men have slept for millennia
and we seek their fantastic powers!

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.020
Soon, they will awaken.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.860
If a weakness other than sunlight
cannot be found, all is lost.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.410
That is why we had to
experiment on Santviento.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:58.660
Events fifty years ago have
destined you to fight the Pillar Men!

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:04.050
Joestar, your Hamon is too weak
to overcome them!

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:08.010
Go to Rome! Someone awaits you there!

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.010
It is a man Speedwagon knows well!

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:20.390
H-He's trying to control my body
and make it hide in that well!

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.690
But soon I'll open myself up
and let the sun shine in!

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.320
Von Stroheim, you can't...

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.910
Human greatness is in proudly
facing down one's fears.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.420
The words of the
Greek historian Plutarch.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.420
Farewell...

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.390
...you annoying Englishman!

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.720
Don't do it! I still have questions!

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.100
Damn that crazy soldier!

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.980
Putting on a show like that...

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.000
Santviento!

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.210
Get out of my way!
If you don't, you'll die, JoJo!

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.470
Steady your breathing.
Use your Hamon breathing.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:51.400
Move it! You were doomed from the start!

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:57.660
A-And now you'll say,
I see through you, primitive!

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.660
I see through you, primitive!

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.670
It's high noon.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.130
The sun is above and reflecting off
the water. That'll cook you good.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.640
Try jumping into the well after thinking
about the movement of the sun!

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:26.190
I'm not letting you fall into the water!

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.040
I-I'm alive thanks to the sun.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.300
It's turned him into a solid statue!

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.560
Next episode

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.480
My grandfather died tragically.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.520
Then you couldn't even beat a pigeon!

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.860
Bring out more UV lamps!

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.570
Awaken, my masters!

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.990
