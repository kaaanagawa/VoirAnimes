WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.150
I knew he was crazy, but not this crazy!

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.000
Straizo! What will it be?
Smashing your brain, sunlight or Hamon?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.880
Those are the three ways to erase you.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.020
H-He's a murderer!

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.420
Help! He'll kill us all!

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.830
JoJo, w-what have you done?!

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.490
Yeah, the repair bill
will go through the roof.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.280
That's not it! You shot a man!

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.780
A man?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.040
You mean Straizo?

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.440
What's going on?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.790
The bullets I fired have
strange dents in them.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.750
Smokey, run outside!

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.970
I hope what I shot was only a man.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.340
If he was, time in jail
is the worst that'll happen to me.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.140
I-I don't understand.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
Calm yourselves!
I can't hear anything!

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.140
Get out now or I'll French kiss you!

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.930
From the silent depths

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.060
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.320
Crimson blood

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.110
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:18.410
If inherited love is called fate

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.670
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.180
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.010
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.020
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.690
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.570
Destiny written into your veins

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.440
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.000
Take hold of them

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.630
Chapter 11: Master of the Game

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.610
What in the world?
So this is a vampire!

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.610
Dio's failure was overindulgence
in playing with his powers.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.660
He wanted to experiment
with their limits.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
That made an opening
for Jonathan to strike.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.400
But my philosophy is different.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.420
I'll find the extent of my powers
after I've destroyed you.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.340
I'll show you no mercy!

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.720
And I'll start with the technique
that Dio used to kill Jonathan!

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.770
Out of ammo?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.680
My eyes can fire high-pressure essence.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.860
Face my Space Ripper
Stingy Eyes, Joseph!

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.950
JoJo!

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.200
A mere trifle.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.960
All that is left is Erina Joestar.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.870
And--

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.090
Now you'll say, "It will be easier than
drowning an infant."

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.390
Your next words will be, "How can
he live with a hole in his head?!"

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.390
H-How can he live
with a hole in his head?!

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.920
Too much time in a backwater
like Tibet isn't good for you.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.870
Life in the city makes you strong.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.950
You could've won if you were
a bit more observant.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.450
Take a good look
at the face of that clock!

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.230
I was told my grandpa was taken down

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.960
by Dio firing something from his eyes.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.960
A mirror?!

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.630
So you finally noticed, Straiz-oaf!

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.850
I also heard that you're as allergic
to Hamon as you are to sunlight!

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.180
I'll knock you out of the park!

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.730
Shoot!

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.150
Let's see, now. I hear
Hamon melts vampire faces.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.990
Now we find out.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.540
H-He's fine!

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.490
It's like nothing happened!

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.680
Was Granny wrong?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.440
No, you would grow into a deadly foe
if left unchecked for too long.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.810
A secret before you die.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.730
There is an insect in Southeast Asia
called the Satiporoja beetle.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.030
30,000 of their tiny stomachs were
dried and woven into this scarf.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.750
It conducts Hamon far better than
the human body, dispersing it.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.370
It's like an electrical ground.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.290
I am the successor of 4,000 years
of history in the art of Hamon.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.020
I know all its strengths
and weaknesses in battle.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.380
I am not ignorant like Dio!

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.070
Wow, that's really something!

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.640
But do you think I'd rely on
gimcracks like Hamon alone?

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.350
I'm also fast!

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.110
He put a grenade in my scarf! How?!

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.990
A pitiful trick!

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.920
You should've spent time in the city!

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.450
Take a look at the grenade you
knocked away!

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.120
You son of a...!

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.850
I-I got him!

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.450
W-What the heck is he?!

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.980
Smokey, don't look!

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.400
Too late!

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.720
God, I won't do anything bad again!

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.660
I won't steal or anything else!
Just save me!

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.140
H-He's a monster.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.730
D-Do you have a way to
beat a monster like this, JoJo?

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.610
Yeah, I do.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.440
Really? You do?

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.200
Yeah, I have one last card up my sleeve.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.990
One last card? W-What is it?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.700
I saved this one for last.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.500
Look at his legs.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.710
They were blown to smithereens
and haven't healed yet.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.320
That's our ticket.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.210
A-And your last card?

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.090
I'll use my own legs.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.720
Use your legs? How?

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.470
To hotfoot it out of here, Smokey!

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.760
Outta the way!

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.180
I can't believe this guy!

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.310
Follow me, Straizo!

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.770
Wait up, JoJo!

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:12.540
Even if I am immortal, it will take a
lot of energy to regenerate after that.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.750
All right! What a scoop!
The papers will eat this up!

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.750
Here's my chance to become a reporter!

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.630
Pressure applied
by fingertips: 235 kg/cm2

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.720
Leaping ability:
Currently 4 m 22 cm

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.130
I-Is something behind me?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.110
We should be safe now, right?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.830
I'm afraid not, Smokey. Listen.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.330
Listen to what?

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.120
Oh, the river?

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.370
Wrong! Look up!

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.940
H-Help!

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.800
He came after us! Run for it!

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.840
This woman is my hostage!

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.720
If you run, I'll kill her!

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.890
If you come up here, I'll let her go.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.730
What are you thinking?

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.090
I don't even know that woman, moron!

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.360
Let's run, JoJo!

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.730
This is a test!

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.070
If you flee now, I'll know
what sort of man you are.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.620
I need time to heal and
will not pursue you.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.370
You would not seek revenge
for Speedwagon.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.900
But if you come up here after the girl,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.690
your personality will be clear to me.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.600
You would pose a great threat
to me in the future.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.510
I would have to eliminate you
here and now!

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.020
In five seconds, I will kill her!

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.960
Climb up or run! Decide now!

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:22.860
I wouldn't fight for a hag like that,
even if she was my sweetheart!

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.750
I'll kill her by pulling down
on her lower jaw.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.300
I'll tear right through her neck
and into her chest.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.170
Would a master of Tibetan Hamon really do

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.610
such a cruel thing to a girl?

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.830
A-A tooth! He ripped out her tooth!

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.580
That bastard! He really did it!

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.330
I'll show no mercy!

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.340
You fiend!

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.590
Straizo!

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.950
You'll pay for that!

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.770
You're inhuman to the core!

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:27.900
You pretend to be cool,
but you're full of fire inside.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.990
I'll demolish you, Straizo!

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.990
Taste this!

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.740
I can beat that move now!

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.130
I won't fall for the same
tired old stunt twice!

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.080
Hamon!

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.170
Im--

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.240
"Impossible," you say?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.850
Impossible!

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.350
I deflected your shot
with Hamon glass!

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.890
I knew you'd aim for my forehead.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.240
It was easy to intercept.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:25.750
Apologize to Speedwagon in hell!

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.170
You'll sleep soundly tonight, Granny.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.270
Why save me from falling?

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.530
I might still have enough power
to blow your arm off.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:58.780
Shut up and do it, then!
I'll just punch you with the other!

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.770
I want an answer.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.790
Why did you throw
Speedwagon's body into the river?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.250
Something is fishy.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.540
Joseph, your grandfather Jonathan's
blood flows strongly in you.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.840
Outside you are opposites,
but you're both insatiably curious.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.720
And now I warn you that your nature has

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.310
trapped you in a fate you can't escape.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.830
What do you mean?

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.350
Soon you'll learn of the Pillar Man.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.570
Soon you'll meet the Pillar Man!

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.820
Don't feed me any of your nonsense!

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.410
I threw the bodies into the river
because of him.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.470
The pillar sucked blood
from the bodies in the cave.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.790
It was like a plant
drawing up nutrients.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.680
It was ghastly.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.880
So I dragged the bodies outside.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:01.140
But I am sure he will awaken soon
from his 2,000-year slumber.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.130
Joseph, you will meet him soon.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:15.730
Soon you'll learn the truth of him
and meaning of evolution.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.740
Your destiny is already written!

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.620
Hamon?!

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.250
That means you're creating Hamon
inside your own body!

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.010
I regret nothing.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:38.760
I want to go to hell feeling full
and young rather than withering away.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.510
Being young again was
a supreme joy for me!

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.600
Straizo, wait! I need to know more!

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.110
Farewell, JoJo!

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.370
JoJo...

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:14.000
1938, the year that the Second World War
began to engulf the planet.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:21.130
The German army sought to conquer all.
Their weapons were cutting-edge.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.760
They used astrology, sorcery,
alchemy and psychic powers.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.830
Every tool available was employed
in their bid for world domination!

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.800
Their spy network in Mexico

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.130
Mexico

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.360
caught wind of Straizo's actions.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.660
I-I'm terribly sorry,
Major von Stroheim!

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.160
M-My hand slipped!

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.120
Lick.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.380
You cut me, right?
Now lick my wound clean.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.800
Yes, sir.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.850
Don't make it hurt. Gently, now.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.770
Slowly, slowly.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.130
Ahh, I think the pain
is just about gone now.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.690
Watch out, now! Watch out!

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.740
You'll cut yourself!

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.570
Pardon me, Major von Stroheim!

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.040
The old man found on the bank
of the Rio Dada is awake.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.210
We will question him!

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.200
Are you all right? What's your name?

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.760
Let me escort you home.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.170
What was that for?!

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.350
How dare you call me a hag earlier?!

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.810
That punch was payback, jerk!

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.120
Did I...?

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.150
You did. Something about
not fighting for a hag.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.560
Seriously?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.210
Well, that's odd! But you're so pretty.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.360
How strange!

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.250
Yowch!

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.490
You can't even remember your own words?!

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.120
You ogress...

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.460
She was too scared
to feel the pain earlier.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.030
But I'm worried about
the Pillar Man Straizo mentioned.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.010
Let's go to Mexico!

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.630
How are you feeling, Speedwagon?

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.450
We have a saying in Europe.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.480
"A town where the old kill themselves
is soon to fall."

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.910
I think you hold a secret
as dangerous as that.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.800
And it's about that man!

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:20.060
We obtained the pillar from the location
we extracted from you!

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.810
God, why do this to me?!
Why not let me die?!

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.320
Why did you let me live?!

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.260
You're mistaken, Speedwagon.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.070
I am the one who made you live.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:39.250
And the Wehrmacht made you talk!

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:47.730
Though you are old, we know that torture
would not make you talk.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.930
You went alone and penniless into Texas.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.200
Near dead in the desert, you found oil fields

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.180
and changed the world economy.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.100
See?! German medicine
is the world's greatest!

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.980
It can do anything!

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.600
A truth serum?!

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.790
What more do you want from me?!

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.690
Everything! Tell us everything!

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.790
Tell us about the past!
About Straizo! About Joestar!

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.120
Tell us so we can awaken the Pillar Man!

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.880
N-No! You don't understand a thing!

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.380
He could destroy the world!

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.140
Prepare for the blood feeding experiment.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.930
I expect perfection!

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.140
- Help us!
- I don't want to die!

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.150
I have a proposal.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.170
Choose one from among yourselves.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.360
We need blood for an experiment.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:56.870
The lot of you must choose
who will be the one to die.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.870
The rest of you will be released today.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.830
I volunteer.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.920
If I volunteer,
you'll let everyone go, right?

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.760
Excellent, young man.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.930
Courage like yours is to be commended.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.640
We allow only the fit to live.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.140
Execute everyone except the boy!

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.510
Let the experiment begin!

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.520
Next episode

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.550
Don't be too proud! He's dangerous!

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.080
I've brought you some tequila.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.840
You. Who among you disturbed my slumber?

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.530
He's in the ventilation ducts!

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.290
