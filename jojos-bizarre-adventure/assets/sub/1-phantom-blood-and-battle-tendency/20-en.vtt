00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.700
Caesar was the son of Mario Zeppeli,
the best furniture maker in Naples.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.750
Mario was a proper Italian,
dedicated to his family.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.850
To Caesar, he was the ideal man.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.670
When Caesar was ten,
Mario left without a word.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.010
They were motherless, and
distant relatives stole all they had.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.530
Caesar became delinquent
and grew to hate his father.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.120
I bet he's living
carefree with some woman!

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.520
I'll find and kill him!

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.290
He threw away his youth
and his future.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.120
He committed theft, arson, assault
-- anything short of murder.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.410
Even mafiosos feared him.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.500
Hey, you're Caesar, right?
What's your last name?

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.040
I don't have one!

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.210
Then you aren't Italian.
Italians are proud of their families.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.160
Never holding back, he started
fights by using a wrench.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.020
With his foe stunned,
he finished them off!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.270
Though he didn't know it,
he was already using Hamon.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.720
Then, at age 16 in Rome...

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.620
No mistake. It's him!

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.200
Caesar felt he might murder his own father.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.460
However!

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.230
W-What is that?!

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.370
That's a diamond, all right.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.070
Boy, don't touch that stone!

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.910
You!

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.200
W-What's this wall doing?!

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.610
S-Stay back. It's a trap!

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.820
The events of 50 years ago
were unknown to Caesar.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.010
Will, Caesar's grandfather,
had died tragically.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.120
Mario had taken up his torch,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.470
trained with Hamon and
discovered these ruins.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.050
He searched the world for a way
to defeat the monsters within.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.160
But Caesar was totally unaware of this.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.120
Y-Young man, I ask you a favor.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.040
Speak with a woman in Venice
named Lisa Lisa.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.640
She is the only one who can stop them.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.700
Perhaps because Caesar had grown,
Mario did not recognize his son.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.650
Fa...

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.310
Caesar's father had left to keep
his children safe from all this.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.000
Father!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.900
From the silent depths

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.160
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.460
Crimson blood

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.260
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.390
If inherited love is called fate

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.560
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.240
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.070
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.000
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.840
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.710
Destiny written into your veins

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.340
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.640
Take hold of them

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.400
Chapter 20: Young Caesar

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.860
I see.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.130
Caesar's misunderstanding led to hatred.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.040
But that became pride in
his father and his family.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.640
So Caesar picked up
where his father had left off.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.170
He wants to avenge his father.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.510
Forgive me, Caesar.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.300
I didn't mean to speak ill
of your family.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.720
If you want to go in there
despite it being a trap,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.550
then you must have a way
to beat Kars.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.190
I've changed my mind!

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.480
If you're going in,
then I'm right behind you,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.410
Caesar Zeppeli!

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.280
One set of footprints leads in.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.830
W-Who was that?

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.740
I swear I saw someone.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.090
Am I seeing things?

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.340
No, that's not an illusion!

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.630
What the hell is that!

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.180
Caesar?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.850
He vanished!

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.270
But I know he's here.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.400
He's within a few steps.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.860
Does Kars have a new trick?

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.170
No, the sun is too strong.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.320
He can't be outside!

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.950
The cat stance, an element of kung fu.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.070
Caesar has never heard of kung fu.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:31.200
But he relaxes his limbs,
ready for attack from any direction.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.840
For him, it is a reflex.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.420
Caesar!

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.470
What are you doing?
Going in alone is madness!

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.260
Stay back, instructor!

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.010
I can't move, let alone go inside.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.850
Something is hiding in the entrance!

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.980
What's that?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.060
I can't see a--

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.310
A-A single footprint.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.270
He jumped!

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.980
He's coming from above!

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.430
I-It's...

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.950
...Wamuu!

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.620
Instructor Meshina!

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.160
What the hell? That was Wamuu.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.840
Are he and Kars in there together?

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.870
But how can Wamuu come out
during the day?!

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.240
He does look ghostlike somehow.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.070
Where is that smart-talking upstart?

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.490
JoJo...

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.410
I hear he's learned much.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.080
Where is the man who killed Master Esidisi?

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.540
Wind. Wamuu can control the wind.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.580
That's why he's transparent.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.210
Air is coming from
those pipes in his chest.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.800
It's slightly visible
because of water vapor.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.820
I've got it!

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.010
He's cloaking himself in vapor
from those pipes.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.080
It's refracting the light.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:19.570
It's like a suit that bends light,
protecting him from the sun!

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.150
That's why he's transparent!

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.360
So JoJo isn't here.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.450
You're Caesar, the bubble-user, right?

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:35.460
Just by looking at you,
I can see you've also learned much.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.380
Very well. You are worthy
of death at my hands!

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.920
We'll see who dies!

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.580
I feel like I did when I was poor!

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.310
Just like when you killed my father!

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.700
I'll use my viciousness to destroy you!

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.230
Don't think your wind
will just blow my bubbles away!

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.900
Some bubbles go through wind!

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.870
I've updated
my grandfather's Hamon Cutter!

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.870
Bubble Cutter!

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.420
High speed rotation
turns the bubbles into disks!

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.170
Hamon ensures they won't pop!

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.130
The wind protecting you
is just air to them!

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.670
Instead of defending you...

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.430
...it'll suck them in!

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.270
His skill with Hamon
is more than I bargained for.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.860
Now, Hamon-user!

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.860
Hold it! I won't let you go inside!

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.610
Gliding Bubble Cutter!

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.200
Now, while you're off balance...

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.490
...I'll give you a Hamon kick!

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.120
But Caesar was in for a shock!

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.930
If you are tripped, you try not to fall.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.460
Especially if you need
to escape the sunlight.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.380
But Wamuu was different!

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.550
He bent backwards!

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.310
He's not just an immortal monster!

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.400
With senses like that,
he's a fighting genius as well!

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.400
But my Bubble Cutter
must have damaged him severely.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.150
The advantage is mine!

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.670
I have a way to beat you indoors!

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.760
My nerves are honed to a razor edge.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.980
I can even feel differences in the air.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.850
I have the itch like when I was poor.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.320
My breathing is normal.
I'm not sweating.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.360
Perfect Hamon conditions!

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.450
Instructor Meshina!

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.880
Taken off your coat, have you, Wamuu?

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.440
Caesar and Meshina aren't here!

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.270
Are they already inside?

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.480
T-That's...

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.980
What happened?

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.770
Take this, Wamuu!

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.480
Bubble Launcher!

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.030
I said that won't work!

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.200
Bubble Cutter!

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.370
Running?!

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.840
I won't run or hide!

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.930
Bubble Cutter!

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.700
You're dead, Wamuu!

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.190
Gliding Bubble Cutter!

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.660
Wamuu!

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.500
No more games!

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.000
It's over!

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.580
Divine Sand--

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.130
Stop and look around!

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.210
My Bubble Cutters are now
Bubble Lenses floating in the air!

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.140
Lenses?

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.310
And that hole you knocked in the wall

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.830
is like the open shutter of a camera!

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.810
The lenses send sunlight...

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.980
...into the hotel!

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.110
Huh?!

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.180
You can't move!

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.740
You're film! A frozen image!

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.610
You're totally exposed!

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.170
Trying your barrier again?

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.340
I won't let you!

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.670
I'll finish you off
with a direct Hamon blast!

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.170
One point...

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.930
...at one moment.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.300
A tiny blind spot.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.330
Caesar's body created a shadow
at one point!

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.140
Wamuu didn't lose his chance!

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.900
He showed Caesar once again
that he was a fighting genius!

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.900
Wind power!
Divine Sandstorm!

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.950
S-Such destruction!

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.460
I-It couldn't be!

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.330
It's Wamuu's Divine Sandstorm!

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.300
So that means Caesar is...!

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.680
You had grown so much.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.470
I am satisfied.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.560
I haven't had such a fight in ages...

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.880
...warrior of Hamon.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.520
And it was a close one, too.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:40.190
If my wind didn't have the strength
to blow away your lenses...

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.870
...I have no idea how I could've
stopped the light.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:54.200
And if Lord Kars, who cannot use wind,
had met you here first...

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.050
...and met your power...

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.390
Even if he had won...

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.760
...he would've been in worse shape
than I am now.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.120
Don't.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.320
You will not fight again.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.990
My Divine Sandstorm
has shredded your body.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.120
Stop. The battle is done.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.620
You have no more Hamon.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.330
See?

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.130
You've almost bled out.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.590
That means you have no hope.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:46.850
Stop.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.060
Goodbye.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.980
Your life has ended.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.070
What?!

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.370
My lip ring with the antidote. Why?

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.880
I-I'm...not afraid to die.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.350
But I am a proud member
of the Zeppeli family.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.890
It is in my blood.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.600
Something like this might mean nothing

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.720
to an inhuman monster like you.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.400
My father didn't recognize me,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.190
but he sacrificed his life to save mine.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.450
My grandfather gave his Hamon energy

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.380
to JoJo's grandfather before he died.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.160
It's tradition. I have to do something.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.290
I can't let my life's flame sputter out.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:06.840
This is the Zeppeli family spirit,
from the past to the future!

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.600
It's the human spirit!

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.440
JoJo, this is the last of my Hamon!

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.110
Take it!

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.290
That's Caesar!

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.330
Did you hear that?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.330
Yes.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.210
Caesar can't be...!

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.500
Caesar!

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.520
He made a bubble from his blood.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.860
He must have used
all of his Hamon to make it.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:08.320
He saved it for this, for his friends,
rather than using it on me.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.080
I'll let it go.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.250
It's not because I'm sentimental.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.980
His talent as a fighter was real.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.550
He has my respect as a fellow warrior.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:33.680
I will hold you forever
in my memory...Caesar.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.730
A man as splendid
and as fleeting as a bubble.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.410
T-The place is a wreck.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.120
A Divine Sandstorm did this.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.370
And Caesar was caught in it.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.550
A bubble...

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.010
C-Could it be...?

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.550
No!

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.890
It's Caesar's bandana!

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.060
And...

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.060
A ring! Wamuu's lip ring!

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.750
This Hamon energy feels strange!

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.190
W-Whoa!

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.790
I haven't called Caesar's name
since we got here.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.160
It was because I was scared.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.490
If I cried out his name
and there was no response...

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.290
If there was only silence...
That's what scared me.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.010
I wouldn't accept it.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.810
So I didn't call him.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.060
But now I know.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.320
The Hamon in that bubble
told me everything.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.090
Right here, moments ago...

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.530
...Caesar died.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.750
Caesar, you bastard.
You were a showoff till the end.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.920
Leaving a gift like this...

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.210
Caesar, where are you?!

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.420
Where are you sleeping?!

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.130
I'll find you! I'll dig you up! Caesar!

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.880
JoJo!

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.810
This isn't the time to search or grieve.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.810
What?!

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.560
There are two of them and two of us.
Even numbers.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:51.650
But all that trail of blood says
Caesar hurt Wamuu badly.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.990
We're in enemy territory.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.120
Let's go and finish it.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.080
JoJo, come on.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.120
Take the antidote, then we'll hunt them.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.730
T-That heartless...

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.420
Not even a single tear for Caesar?!

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.470
Coach Lisa Lisa...

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.220
...your cigarette's backwards.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.400
She's our coach,
she has to keep a cool exterior.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.800
I know she wants to cry
much more than I do.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.530
He treated her like a goddess,

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.000
and knew her much longer than me.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.410
I have to hold my feelings back.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:53.660
Caesar, I know you thought
I was self-centered.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.690
But sometimes I understand
how others feel.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.180
I might be learning.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.030
But I'll fight them like the devil!

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.330
Your spirit rests with me!

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.860
Blood...

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.990
It's blood.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.510
That's where Caesar fell.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.290
Caesar...

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.800
Caesar...

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.840
Caesar!

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:46.010
They're in enemy territory.
Kars and Wamuu are near.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.850
But the two couldn't help themselves.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.360
JoJo called Caesar's name.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.860
Lisa Lisa's tears flowed freely.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.870
But their cries were only answered
by cold silence.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.120
Caesar was gone.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:11.380
The silence confirmed the fears
of JoJo and Lisa Lisa.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.880
Though his body had died,
his soul lived on.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.490
Rest in peace, Caesar Zeppeli.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.480
Next episode

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.770
I'm in a bad mood.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.720
I'll hug you to death!

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.360
We fight tonight, under the full moon.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.210
You have no tomorrow.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.490
Fight alongside me, Caesar!

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.950
