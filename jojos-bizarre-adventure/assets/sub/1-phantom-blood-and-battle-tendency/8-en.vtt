WEBVTT

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.570
Poco, where in blazes
were you at this hour?!

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.410
D-Dad...

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.710
I'm glad you're safe,
b-but where's Sis?

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.580
She went out to look for you.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.590
She... She went out?!

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.590
Poco, what's the matter?
You're acting strange.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.760
Sis!

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.020
Sis!

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.450
Two stars fallen from the heavens

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.040
Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.170
Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.520
The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.560
And for the man who follows
his ambition...

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.270
...a sacrifice awaits

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.450
With pounding heart
and burning will

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.080
With thundering fists

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.580
And overflowing bravery

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.840
He steps forward, free of doubt

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.890
A fate determined by his blood

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.890
JoJo!

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.240
Chapter 8: Blood Feud - JoJo &amp; Dio

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.370
Think about this.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.790
Take this lovely flower.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.380
Your youth is blooming
just like this flower is.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.880
Consider this carefully, mademoiselle.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.890
If this flower blooms fully,
it will only wither away.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.300
A shame, don't you think?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.890
She's sweet sixteen!
So pure and innocent!

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.360
Look at how full of delicious
life energy she is, Lord Dio!

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.450
Those without manners
aren't fit to live.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.040
So, mademoiselle...

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.460
I offer you a choice.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.210
Wouldn't you like to enjoy
your youth for all eternity?

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.920
However, I will not force my friendship
upon you, unlike some.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.600
You are free to choose your own destiny.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.020
Devil.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.230
What's that you said?

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.400
You're just a damned d-devil!

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.250
Alas. Though you will soon part,
allow me to introduce my companion.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.660
This is the dreaded Doobie.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.940
Since I am not to your taste,
you might enjoy his company.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.670
Bye, mademoiselle.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.050
W-Who's there?!

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.760
Who indeed?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.400
There's no need
for introductions to a zombie!

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:41.860
Sis!

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.850
Poco!

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.460
Bit you! Bit you!

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.250
What's lurking under his mask?

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.120
L-Look at that!

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.600
That zombie is full of snakes!

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.350
Venomous cobras and flesh-eating vipers!

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.850
Surprised, are you?

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.480
Those snakes bit his face,
and not just once!

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.320
How troublesome.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.980
I don't have time for Dio's games!

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.990
Impressive.
He squeezed out the poison.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.340
He's learned a lot about blood flow
in a very short time.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.640
It's because Baron Zeppeli gave
him his life energy before he died.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.420
I'll use a bit of Hamon to
boil the blood of those snakes!

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.730
Sis!

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.570
Poco!

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.780
Sis!

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.860
I'm back from hell, Dio.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.700
Still alive, JoJo?

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.910
I suppose that means
you've defeated my two knights.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.920
Lord Dio, we await your order
to eliminate him!

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.150
I'll let my fangs
make an impression on him!

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.130
Dio!

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.170
No. This one...

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.880
This one I will handle personally.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.510
Allow me to be frank, JoJo.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.890
I didn't want to have
to do this personally.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.980
We were raised in the same house.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.300
Making you undead does not please me.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.940
That's why I left this business
to my knights.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.160
But in the end, I underestimated you.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.400
Seeing you alive makes me realize
I was too soft of an emperor.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.670
Now I will slaughter you
without a hint of hesitation!

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.470
Same here.
I'll feel no guilt for killing you!

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.840
By the way, what happened

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.470
to that dapper mustachioed
gentleman you were with?

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.640
Did he run off?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.110
Dio, I must express my feelings.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.860
This shames me as a gentleman, but...

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:25.740
...truth be told, I, Jonathan Joestar,
will kill you to satisfy my anger!

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.030
Come, JoJo!

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.130
Come, JoJo!

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.920
Dire!

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.930
JoJo, stand aside.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.810
I have the right to satisfy
my anger first.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.590
Zeppeli was a companion through
two decades of harsh training.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.900
Dio, I will send you
straight to the bowels of hell!

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.320
Wait! He has hidden abilities
you don't know about!

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.080
What an interesting walk.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.460
With enough training, humans are able

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.170
to make themselves float on the air.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.550
But in just one night, I have gained
power beyond any human guru!

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.940
You think you can beat me
with such sleepy movements?!

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.490
You fell for it, fool!

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.070
Thunder Cross Split Attack!

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.030
Incredible! By crossing his arms

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.700
he can attack while keeping his guard up!

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.250
It's a perfect stratagem!

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.330
No fighter has escaped it.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.050
He's...!

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.140
Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.140
I-I can't move!

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.390
He's been flash frozen!

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.400
Dio vaporized the moisture in his body,
turning him to ice in an instant!

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.860
Dire can't send Hamon into Dio
unless his blood is flowing!

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:37.290
That Dio is truly fearsome!
He froze Dire's whole body at once!

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.460
Y-You...

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.360
So feeble!

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.090
You thought you would ever
be able to touch me, fool?!

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.010
You came here just to die like a dog!

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.760
I'll give them all a good show!

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.190
- D-Dire!
- Stop!

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.530
JoJo, it's time.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.700
You're the next one
to be sent to oblivion!

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.120
Dire!

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.170
A Hamon-filled rose's thorns do sting.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.010
Dire!

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.840
How...

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.720
How dare you scar my face?!

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.470
Dire...

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:42.980
Speedwagon!

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.730
Here!

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:52.570
Dio, I've just seen the way
to beat your flash freezing.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.200
I know how to send Hamon into you.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.870
Dire spent his life to teach me.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.250
I'll fill Blueford's sword of luck and
pluck with Hamon and slice you!

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.130
You dare touch me...

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.520
You dare touch me with your
Hamon filthier than frog urine?!

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.830
You've pushed your luck too far!

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.900
Now you'll be a feast for my zombies!

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.980
They'll gnaw the faces off your skulls!

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.660
Now he shows his true colors
as the worst man in the world!

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.330
His cool sophistication is
nothing but a cheap mask!

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:46.000
Now that he's had a humiliating taste
of Hamon, we see his real face!

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.880
I will show you no mercy!

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.970
I am Pajyu!

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.340
Jones!

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.220
Pluton!

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.720
Barnum!

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.180
Needle Vein Strike!

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:12.060
Roses are living things, so Hamon
will remain inside of them.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.320
But steel is different.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.080
I have to maintain contact.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.910
There is a great horde of them.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.540
I'll handle them for you.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.960
As far as I can tell, Dio
is as swift as a leopard.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.840
Thanks to Baron Zeppeli,
Jonathan just might keep up.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:55.400
But Dio is strong enough to
pulverize flesh and bone with ease!

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:00.530
The battle will be decided as they meet
in the opening moment!

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.590
I'll squeeze the life out of you!

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.340
I'll cleanse the world of your evil!

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.050
H-He grabbed some roses
when I wasn't looking!

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:25.850
Now!

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.520
W-Wow!

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.810
He circled to Dio's right
because that eye can't see!

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.730
D-Damn! JoJo is a veteran fighter!

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.330
Y-Yes!

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.880
He finally defeated Dio!

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.680
Wrong,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.090
you fools!

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.680
I-I...

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.850
I'm frozen!

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.730
So feeble!

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.730
Now you will become
one of my children of the night!

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.620
I've got your rubbery
carotid between my fingers!

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.200
So warm and springy.
What a pleasant feeling.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.620
A kick!

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.970
My legs are frozen, too!

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.090
Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.760
Enjoy this anguish, JoJo!

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:52.390
Move and this delicate
blood vessel will snap!

00:15:52.940 --> 00:16:02.360
I'll open your carotid and exchange
your blood for my vampiric essence.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.370
W-We have to help!

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.410
Zombies!

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.950
Keep those peasants back
for a moment.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.500
They just won't stop coming.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.290
We won't be able to help.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:23.800
Now, JoJo, I'll fill you with vampiric
essence and make you my slave!

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:29.680
Don't think you've won, Dio!
You've made a fatal mistake!

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.770
And how so?

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.760
You haven't frozen me completely
because you are still feeding.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.190
If you freeze me, my Hamon will stop,

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.540
but you can't drain my life, either!

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.370
Your tactics are flawed!

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.160
He put the sword in the flame!

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:57.670
That blade is conducting the heat
faster than I can freeze it!

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.550
Hamon is coming up the blade!

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.140
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.720
Take this!

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.390
He got him!

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.870
Look again! You can tell that
the Hamon didn't go through.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.310
My arm...

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.860
My arm is frozen again!

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.680
I only touched his face!

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.820
You underestimated me, JoJo!

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.790
I will admit it.
I admire your explosive tenacity.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:46.380
I must say that your use of fire
was marvelous.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.220
But JoJo, nothing can escape
my icy grasp.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.060
Just a touch on the arm is enough.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.730
I can freeze your whole body in
two seconds.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.570
He squeezed out
the vampiric essence!

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.410
Jonathan hasn't given up yet!

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.310
Why are you puffed up like that?
Still looking for a fight?

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:24.050
No matter how you struggle,
human ability is limited.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:31.960
Your Hamon training is useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.080
A monkey cannot stand
against a human!

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:41.270
And compared to me,
you are a mere monkey, JoJo!

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.840
Wrong! With enough conviction,
humans can do anything!

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.490
Humans will grow!
Let me demonstrate!

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.620
You won't, because
you'll be a zombie!

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.750
His hand, it's burning!

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.890
His glove is on fire!

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.260
It just might get through Dio's ice!

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.970
Which one of us will fall in the end?!

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.130
We find out now, Dio!

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.940
H-He was blocked!

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.320
No!

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.280
He's breaking through!

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.670
I'm disintegrating!

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.500
The pain! The burning!

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:03.770
My reign...was supposed...
to last...for centuries!

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.690
You had to be destroyed, Dio.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.070
I won't...

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.590
He shot his essence from his eye!

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.470
He was centimeters
from incinerating my brain!

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.510
T-That was close!

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.550
The last throes of a demon
clinging to life in this world.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.730
Dio's falling down the cliff!

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.950
Dio...

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.340
He's fainted!

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.230
He's worn out. He should be.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.720
He's seen too many fatal fights tonight.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.390
But why would he cry
after killing a bad guy like that?

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:28.480
He spent his youth together with Dio.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.990
But me? I can smile happily!

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.950
Are you watching, Baron Zeppeli?
He did it!

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.860
Jonathan finally did it!

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.910
Dio is dead.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.820
It may sound like an exaggeration,
but the world is saved!

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.480
Next episode

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.740
What a joyous occasion!

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.540
These are tears of joy.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.360
R-Run...

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.110
I want to stay like this forever.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.490
Is my new body here?

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.790
