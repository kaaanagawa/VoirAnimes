WEBVTT

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.500
Hey, rifle heads!

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.910
Do I have to wait forever for food?

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.450
Kars!

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.300
What?

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.330
Von Stroheim!

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.000
Double shock!

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.460
This is spookier than meeting a ghost!

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.840
Kars!

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.970
And von Stroheim, who I thought
was blown to bits in Mexico.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.060
They're both right here!

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.960
From the silent depths

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.090
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.420
Crimson blood

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.170
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.460
If inherited love is called fate

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.750
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.250
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.000
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.050
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.750
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.630
Destiny written into your veins

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.420
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.460
Take hold of them

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.650
Chapter 19: A Race Toward the Brink

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.250
Kars!

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.650
And von Stroheim, too!

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.740
His hand is metal!

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.160
And his face is wrapped
in strange machinery!

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
The Germans are hiding
incredible medical technology.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.120
Is it for military use?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.630
Is that what saved you, von Stroheim?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.130
JoJo, I've come back from hell.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.300
S-Should I be happy?

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.640
He's not exactly a bad guy,
but he's a German soldier.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.140
And I don't like how he struts around.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.100
Still, I'm a bit happy.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.610
Sit down on that sofa and watch me work.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.990
H-He's glaring at me.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.450
He knows I killed Esidisi!

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.580
And he hates me for it!

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.290
Even so!

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.290
Y-You think I'm gonna let you
psyche me out, Kars?!

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.420
JoJo...

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.970
Once I take the Stone...

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.620
...I'm going to end you.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.810
Too bad Wamuu is in Greece.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.440
I can't allow a Hamon-user
who could beat Esidisi to live.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.060
Are you speaking as a warrior?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.570
Or do you just want revenge, Kars?!

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.330
Over here, Kars!

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.280
I will be your final opponent!

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.450
No machine can stop me!

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.780
You think so?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.250
Arms don't bend like that!
Both of his are mechanical?!

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.460
Now for the fun!

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.730
He's...!

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.510
His fingers squeeze at 1950 kg/cm2,
almost twice Santviento's strength!

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.990
You utter fool!

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.720
German science is the world's finest!

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.480
My arms were built based on
Santviento's abilities!

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.470
And so, Kars...

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.040
...we've calculated how much we should

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.500
reduce you to eliminate your power.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.540
I'll pluck you like a chicken,
one square centimeter at a time!

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.540
Hey, JoJo!

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.460
Ouch!

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.960
Don't you dare feel sorry for me!

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.470
My proud new form...

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.680
...is the embodiment of the peak
of German engineering!

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.220
In other words, I am something
more than human!

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.110
Take this, Kars!

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.140
This machine gun can fire 600 rounds

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.320
per minute through 30 mm armor plating!

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.600
It'll whittle you down to size
in no time at all!

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.240
His torso is mechanical, too?!

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.340
What is that?!

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.550
Downstairs!

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.010
The Stone will be mine!

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.700
Getting it cost Esidisi his life!

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.430
I will not let his sacrifice be in vain!

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.270
That light!

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.520
The blade in his arm is glowing!

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.160
I control light!

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.280
Brilliant Bone Blade!

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.360
I-Impossible!

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.150
That blade is made of
hardened bone and skin!

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.710
It shouldn't be able to deflect bullets,
let alone slice them in half!

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.760
Why does his blade glow like that?!

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.550
Here he comes! Here he comes!
Here he comes!

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.460
T-That sound!

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.820
Up close, von Stroheim saw
and understood the blade's secret!

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.480
The edge wasn't a simple wedge!

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.520
It was moving at high speed!

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.490
Tiny, sharp claws like shark's teeth
slid along the outer edge of the blade!

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.750
Each claw refracted light, making the
blade look as though it were glowing!

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.670
We can't win!

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.210
Not with my weapons or
any modern technology.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.340
We can't beat him!

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.840
And what was Santviento?

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.050
Nothing but a child!

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.600
He was a guard dog!
He couldn't compare to us.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.940
Now I'll take the Stone.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.190
K-Kars!

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.650
That ice-cold sheen!

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.410
An edge that can cut bullets!

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.280
I can't block that thing
with my bare hands!

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.580
Even with concentrated Hamon,
it would slice right through me!

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.170
To be honest, I want to run away!

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.120
He's too dangerous!

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.800
I can't think of a way around that blade!

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.430
But I can't just let him take the Stone!

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.140
If he obtained the Stone's power,
I'd never be able to beat him!

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.230
Damn it all!

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.310
I have to get Wamuu's antidote!

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.180
Kars wants to kill me!

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.320
Was this in my horoscope?!

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.860
The Stone is in this pocket.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.450
The Red Stone of Aja!

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.710
I have waited for 4 --
No, 5,000 years for this!

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.960
And at last it is mine.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.460
It was destined to fall into my hands.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.460
Kars!

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.970
Wait there!

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.720
I'll kill you soon.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.100
T-That bastard...

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.520
H-He really does hate me.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.730
Letting him have the Stone
would mean the end!

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.660
Kars, you fool...

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.570
Don't think you've beaten me yet.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.990
German science is the world's greatest!

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.080
Von Stroheim, you idiot!
How can you boast at a time like this?!

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.840
UV laser, activate!

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.590
The Stone!

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.850
H-Hey, it's sliding down the slope!

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.360
Damn it!

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.400
The Stone is sliding toward the cliff!

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.740
If it falls off...

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.140
W-What the...?

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.820
W-What's going on?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.280
Kars!

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.000
JoJo, go after the Stone!

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.710
You can still grab it!

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.500
D-Dang...

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.340
He's moving so fast!

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.340
He plans to grab the Stone
and fall off the cliff!

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.090
He won't stop for the edge!

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.110
D-Damn it!

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.340
That cliff is hundreds of meters high!

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.320
Kars could survive the fall.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.860
But it's as high as a skyscraper!
It'd be certain death for me!

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.860
He's caught up!

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.570
JoJo plans to slow down at the edge!

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.530
But not Kars!

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.370
JoJo can't win!

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.290
I won't let this slime have the Stone!

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.330
Run hard, JoJo!

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:06.380
JoJo, when I reach down to grab
the Stone, I'll be vulnerable.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.340
You'll kick me then, won't you?

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.810
You'll attack me with Hamon,
even if the Stone falls.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.890
Will that work, JoJo?

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.020
JoJo... He's...

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.950
Right on the nose!

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.070
Here's the kick you ordered!

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.910
Ah! He used his legs to pick up
the Stone by its chain!

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.160
What's with that arrogant grin?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.460
I'm the one who should smile.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.670
I expected as much.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.310
A trick like that is really
not good enough.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.680
My kick was aimed at the snow!

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.970
And it worked as a brake!

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.940
Looks like I'm the one
who made the nice catch!

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.690
Enjoy your trip!

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.480
N-No way!

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.030
A blade from the foot?!

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.410
JoJo!

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.200
JoJo!

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.960
He's falling!

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.540
T-That blade!

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.090
Kars's blade is melding with my body!

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.010
S-Son of a...!

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.720
It's 175 meters to the bottom!

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.970
Five seconds until impact!

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.140
Falling with this guy?

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.690
No thanks!

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.230
Clinging Hamon!

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.650
S-So heavy!

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.690
Hamon goes through fluids easily,
but ice and snow are solid!

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.280
However, water is slowly sliding down

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.660
the ice, so Hamon works perfectly!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.540
That Stone will be mine!

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.900
T-That's it exactly.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.590
That tenacity is what scares me most!

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.760
I'm best at exploiting negligence.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.970
So a tenacious foe is the worst.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.300
It's the opposite of negligence!

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.390
It will be mine!

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.180
More icicles!

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.770
I have to get this blade out first!

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.940
Wait, I can just send Hamon
through the blade!

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.190
Take this!

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.320
Just as I thought.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.870
I knew you'd try using my blade.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.530
In that case...

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.160
...into the cliff with you!

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.330
And then...

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.710
N-No!

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.920
H-He's gonna cut me!

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.490
Kars is waiting for JoJo
to rebound!

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.670
JoJo can't dodge!

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:59.040
I'll slice you in half
and pick up the Stone at the bottom!

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:01.970
You--!

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.190
Y-You won't cut this, right?

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.740
You won't chop the Stone in half
along with me!

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.520
I can use your tenacity
as a defensive measure!

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.330
Hamon kick!

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.600
Eat this, Kars!

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.480
He's using the falling icicles
as a rope!

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.540
But they're falling!

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.840
He can't reach!

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.010
In that case, I'll lend a hand!

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.730
Caesar!

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.230
Nice timing, eh, JoJo?

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.440
Since when do you two
work so well together?!

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.610
Using falling icicles as a rope?

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.370
Only JoJo would try something
that stupid.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.120
It was predictable, that's all.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.500
And at last you're able to think up
a stupid trick, Caesar!

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.530
W-What?!

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.000
Nice! Nice!

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.870
Very nice, Caesarino!

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.470
If Lisa Lisa is up there,
give her a message!

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.680
The Stone is safe!

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.510
I kept it from him!

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.310
That was close!

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.230
Pull him on up, Caesar.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.600
Now, my German friend...

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.610
...your body is more durable
than even theirs are.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:38.610
If you stop with the snobbery,
we can work together.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.900
JoJo, you're a lucky one.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.400
I'll let you hold the Stone for me
for another day.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.830
Five days until the remaining ring dissolves.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.500
So this is Switzerland's
famous Saint Moritz.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.780
A winter sports hub often called
Sun Valley.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.260
Chic, relaxed and sophisticated.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.270
A resort the wealthy visit on holidays.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.940
Even the cats look
they're owned by actresses.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.610
Aren't we fussy?

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.260
Not even a glance for shrimp.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:10.420
This little princess doesn't know
a thing about the world.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.620
Well, then...

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.250
...would this smoked salmon
suit your palate?

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.630
Now, now!

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.950
I've found your preference.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.800
Reach! Reach!

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.050
Just a bit more...

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.400
Stretch up a bit more...

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.480
Gotcha!

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.060
Oh? Did I upset you?

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.370
Enjoy, you pompous puffball!

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.870
No, no.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.950
That was mean of me.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.790
It's just because I'm on edge.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.710
Five days till the ring dissolves.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.840
Kars is serious about killing me.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.180
I can feel the threats closing in.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.500
I have to relax.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.020
I'm the one always saying
that you can't mope about stuff.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.640
JoJo, what are you doing?!

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.690
Come here and look!

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.650
Yes, ma'am!

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.690
Be right there!

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.530
That building is the address
Esidisi put on the package.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.700
Looks like an old, closed-down hotel.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.410
A perfect hideout for Kars
during the day.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.130
The windows are boarded up.
No sunlight in there.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.730
I'm sure Kars hides
there during the day.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.340
I bet he's waiting for Wamuu.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.050
So, what is the plan?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.140
That's easy.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.100
We should attack now!

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.690
I agree. Kars can't go out
during daylight.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.070
We have the advantage.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.070
JoJo?

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.700
I...

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:08.910
I disagree.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.910
I think it's more dangerous
with the sun up.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:18.010
Kars has lived for thousands of years
like this.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.540
He won't have left himself defenseless!

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.540
Huh?!

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.080
Walking into his lair would be suicidal!

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.930
I won't go!

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.930
It'd be like a bug walking into a web!

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.470
Come on.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.560
JoJo, this isn't like you.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.890
Are you scared?

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.020
I'll take Sun Tzu's advice here.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.690
Only fight when victory is assured.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.610
I said I won't go!

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.920
Are you chickening out?!

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.200
Chickening out?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.440
My head is cool. I'm thinking straight.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.200
We have to wait for his move!

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.150
You want a sure victory?

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.530
Kars is alone. We are four!

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.130
We have the numbers!

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.720
We have to strike now,
before Wamuu arrives!

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.170
Caesar, you're going off half-cocked!

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.930
Keep your head. Calm down and think.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.850
If we walk in there,
he's the one in control!

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.260
I'm not half-cocked.
I'm gonna end this!

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:27.780
I'll finish the fight that killed
both of our grandfathers!

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.650
I'll destroy Kars!

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.150
You'll finish it?

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:35.280
What about our dead grandfathers?
Who cares?

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.660
Don't drag the dead into this,
you idiot!

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.080
What did you say, JoJo?!

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.770
Family you've never met
doesn't mean crap!

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:49.170
Only a complete moron
would die for that!

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.760
Caesar?

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.880
Watch your mouth, JoJo!

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.930
What was that for, you--?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.770
A sucker punch, eh?!

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.060
Oh, it's on!

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.050
What the hell, Caesar?!

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.730
Shut the hell up, JoJo!

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.840
Caesar, stop it!

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.030
You too, JoJo!

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.370
Caesar!

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.540
Y-You bastard...

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.960
Have you lost it?
You're acting like a madman!

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.960
JoJo, I thought you'd understand
inheriting a battle like this.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.300
I was wrong!

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.100
I'm going.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.680
Caesar, JoJo is right.
It's too dangerous.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.720
We don't know what might be in there.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.890
We will wait for Kars.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.060
That's an order, Caesar.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.000
Protecting the Stone
is our first objective.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.530
Coach, I'm sorry.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.660
I can't obey.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:58.580
You know this is a blood issue.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.650
It's a Zeppeli problem!

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:05.670
I can't leave it unsettled
while I know where Kars is!

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.920
I can't sit back
and wait for him to come!

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.540
Well?

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.780
Follow him and stop him from entering,
even if it means force.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.120
C-Caesar...why?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.150
Why are you so grim all of a sudden?

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.690
Why can't you wait a while?

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.540
JoJo, you've touched on
a piece of his hidden past.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:40.080
You didn't mean it, but your words
hit him where he's most sensitive.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.900
His hidden past?

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:49.000
W-What could it be?

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.520
Next episode

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.270
I feel like I did when I was poor!

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.390
I'll use my viciousness to destroy you!

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.530
Very well. You are worthy
of death at my hands!

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.890
Chapter 20: Young Caesar
