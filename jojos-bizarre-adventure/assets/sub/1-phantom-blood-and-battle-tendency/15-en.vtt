WEBVTT

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.290
You bastards!
Don't turn your backs on me!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.090
Time to face my Hamon Bubble Launcher!

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.060
From the silent depths

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.190
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:47.490
Crimson blood

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.290
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.590
If inherited love is called fate

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.550
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.310
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.940
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.110
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.870
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.450
Destiny written into your veins

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.500
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.670
Take hold of them

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.180
Chapter 15: A Hero's Proof

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.650
Th-This couldn't be...!

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.860
Great! He's a nuisance,
but at least his Hamon works!

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.660
You're surrounded by my bubbles.
Here's the bombardment!

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.790
H-He popped your Bubble Launcher!

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.170
Those wires on his head
didn't pop my bubbles.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.260
It was the wind they created.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.060
That means those wires are
anti-Hamon weapons!

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.230
They know the principles of Hamon!

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.230
- Wamuu -

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.110
They've met with Hamon before,
over 2,000 years ago!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.850
- Esidisi -

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.110
- Kars -

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.530
What is happening
to the air around them?

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.320
No, Caesar! Get down!

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.870
Wh-What the...?

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.860
Close your eyes!

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.960
That wasn't just wind,
it was the aftermath of a vortex!

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.000
Caesar!

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.210
The Hamon tribe.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.310
I thought we eliminated them all
2,000 years ago.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.390
But here they are in Rome,
waiting for us to awaken.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.350
Damn...you...

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.610
You killed my dear friend.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.860
You think losing an eye will stop me?!

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.700
Wh-What's so damned funny?!

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.830
The Hamon tribe
always says the same thing.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.590
It was the same when we crossed from

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.710
the western continent as it is now.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.060
You think losing an arm
or an eye will stop me?!

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.370
How dare you take my friend's life?!

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.850
That's why we laugh.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.020
Y-You monsters!

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.270
Let's go. We must find the Stone.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.900
G-Get back here!

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.900
You're running away?!

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.150
Your throat and lungs are your
weak points.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.920
We know that if you can't breathe,
you can't use Hamon.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.830
Now I'll say what I've always said.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.040
Come and face me again
when you are stronger, boy.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.050
When we meet again,
I want to admire your strength...

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.800
...before I utterly destroy you.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.690
It seems there are no other Hamon users.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.270
Let's move.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.410
Here! Look here!

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.910
Don't go and overlook me, now!

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.630
He only cut your eyelid.
Your eyeball is just fine.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.420
Take your little Bubble Launcher
and hang back.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.390
I'll take care of this.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.100
JoJo!

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.680
It's time to show off the brand new technique

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.430
I've worked so hard on.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.430
What?!

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.900
Let me introduce myself.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.280
I'm Joseph Joestar,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.320
the guy who mopped the floor with your buddy.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.160
I call this the Hamon Clacker Volley.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.960
I start off by filling
these clackers with Hamon.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.450
Oh, no!

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.360
JoJo, what are you doing?!
This is no time for foolishness!

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.770
My friend just died!
You're completely senseless!

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.190
Me? I'm dead serious.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.190
Caesar, you mourn
the loss of your friend.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.510
I feel your pain and anger.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.530
But more than that, I can't stand
egotistical jerks like these guys!

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.290
I'm not an expert yet, but see
what you think of my Clacker Volley!

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.710
I hate to say it, but my Hamon
is still weak.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.330
But I can use these steel clackers to
break your skin

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.340
and fill you with Hamon.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.180
That should even my handicap.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.890
Pretty good, right?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.180
Take this!

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.650
Let's go.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.150
This is absurd.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.010
Perhaps humans have regressed
over the years.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.530
Regressed?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.870
Perhaps so.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.540
JoJo, stop monkeying around!

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.130
You just tossed metal balls at them!

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:21.470
JoJo might be serious. He'd be fine
if he was facing a street punk.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.550
But these guys are
way out of his league!

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.180
It's silly enough to make me cry!

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.440
Blast it! Nobody here
takes me seriously!

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.810
Hold it, big guy!
You're gonna get hit!

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.270
Don't.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.030
Human lives are short enough.
Do not rush to die.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.780
Spaghetti al nero di seppia looks bad,
but it's a real treat.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.990
You need to try my Clacker Volley
before you judge it!

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.520
The clackers vanished!

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:04.470
I've been working on the railroad,
All the live-long day.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.590
L-Look!

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.440
Gotcha! Still fooled?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.850
If you don't get it...

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.000
...let me show you!

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.440
Take this!

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.820
Those moves are impossible!

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.790
And he's even faster than Santviento!

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.580
The clackers didn't even touch him!

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.200
I admire your weapon, courage and idea.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.050
This is becoming fun.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.090
Thus...

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.120
I'll give you one minute.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.270
I bestow on you a single minute
to fight the mighty Wamuu.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.600
JoJo!

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.310
As you see, I've cut your wrist.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:04.610
Your wound gives you one minute
of consciousness to stop the bleeding.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.960
Give me everything you've got!

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.580
Here is what I say to the Hamon tribe.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.910
Here is an hourglass
measured in blood.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.600
Wamuu, we'll be outside.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.960
Boy, go pick up your weapon.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.700
Huh? What was that you said?

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.430
Go pick up your weapon?
Is that what you said?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.860
I don't need to do that.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.680
There's no need to go pick it up.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.040
That was my Clacker Boomerang!

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.370
One minute is all I need to end you.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.620
Make fun of me, will you?
I'll smash you to pieces!

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.600
Then I'll fill you with Hamon!

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.130
Very well.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.710
Hit me all you like.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.130
You are the first person
to scar my face.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.720
And so I bestow upon you
this honor before you die.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.360
You say no one has ever
hit your face before?

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.940
Big words!

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.710
You didn't even notice
when you killed Mark!

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.910
I'll make you regret
holding your nose so high!

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.210
Look out! He's up to something!
That arm of his isn't broken!

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.510
Th-This is gonna be bad!

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.300
It was wise of you to jump back.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:58.520
I let you hit me to punish myself
for my lack of caution.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.890
But that has ended.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.020
JoJo, finish him now!

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.080
My ultimate technique.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.990
The Divine Sandstorm!

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.900
I-I'm in trouble!

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.030
He spins his left arm clockwise!

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.120
And his right arm counterclockwise!

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:21.670
JoJo is caught unaware, and Wamuu's
fists seem to grow before his eyes!

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.770
The space between his fists becomes
a destructive vacuum!

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.260
The whirling creates a microcosm
of wind and sand!

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.470
H-He ripped through that marble pillar
like a piece of old cloth!

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.230
I've never seen such power!

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.530
JoJo...

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.120
That was my Divine Sandstorm.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.540
Jo-JoJo!

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.000
No, stay back!

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.880
Mr. Speedwagon, you have to run!

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.210
I'll do something to hold him back!

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.800
The blood in my eye threw off my aim.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.130
But it was enough, even when you
hid behind the pillar.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.930
Dead already?

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.440
Ordinarily, I would ignore
humans like yourselves.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:31.150
But you witnessed my shame,
so I must be rid of you as well.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.450
Prepare yourselves.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.040
I'm imagining things.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.300
H-He couldn't be...!

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.300
U-Unbelievable. He's trying to escape!

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.800
Playing dead like that.
He's got no shame!

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.050
I can understand leaving me,
but Mr. Speedwagon?

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.660
He's spineless!

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.880
That guy is the
biggest menace I've seen!

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.860
My breathing is out of control.
I can't use Hamon!

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.870
All that's left is my specialty.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.340
All I can do is run!

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.730
Look at our dismal hero!

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.980
JoJo is on the ground,
forced to play dead.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.760
And he's about to
leave Speedwagon to his fate!

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.140
Even so, JoJo will remain
the worthy hero of this tale!

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.940
Here's why!

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.770
Still alive, are you?!

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.100
You coward.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.360
You thought you could
trick me and escape?!

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.480
I only needed to fool you
for a dozen or so meters.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.700
I just wanted to get to this minecart.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.210
So you only acted like a coward to lure

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.420
me over and let your friends escape, eh?

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.260
And you fell for another of my tricks.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.420
Get out of here now, old man!

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.180
Caesar, you too!

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.510
JoJo...

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.310
That chivalrous bastard...

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.310
I've sure painted myself into a corner.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.970
I need to come up with something.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:32.820
Can I get a break?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.570
An unbending hero!

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.820
Only when JoJo loses the will to fight

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.830
will he lose his status as a hero.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.650
JoJo!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.470
Damn him!
He's far more injured than me!

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:57.590
He may put on a foolish act,
but he takes his fate seriously.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.050
He knows he has to beat those monsters!

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:15.070
You speak quite brashly
for one in such a terrible state.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.150
You're a tough one.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.890
Weak-spirited, but tough indeed.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.570
How are you so tough?

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:28.350
Do you have bricks for brains,
or do you have another trick for me?

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.080
You want to know?

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.370
Don't tell me.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.320
Is it something stupid like going into

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.670
the mine and using explosives on me?

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.430
Oh, no! He knows!

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:47.600
Or do you plan to pull the brake
and send the minecart flying?

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:48.680
Something like this?

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.560
H-He did it again!

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.160
The time on your wristwatch
is almost up.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.370
There is no chance you'll survive this.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.990
You have no more tricks.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.840
But tell me this.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.130
Why don't I see defeat in your eyes?

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.840
You want to know?

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.710
You really want to know?

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.700
Forget it. I'll just kill you now.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:28.180
If you give me a month,
I'll become strong enough to beat you.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.520
What was that?

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.770
Give me a month and I'll outdo you.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.190
I'm the first person to scar your face.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.860
If I put my mind to it,
my potential is limitless.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.050
No, never mind what I said.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.630
Well, finish me quickly.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.750
It's an honor to be killed
by a warrior like you.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.210
Continue.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.330
Oh, I'm tired of talking.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.380
Make it painless, Wamuu.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.930
I told you to continue!

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.940
JoJo is still okay!

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:21.900
You have a long life ahead of you.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.160
You'll have to carry the shame
of being scarred by a human.

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.370
The only way to fix that is by beating

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.580
me in a fair fight after I've trained.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.580
What? Don't feed me your lies, JoJo.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.440
I've hooked him! Just a bit more!

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.130
He called me a coward when I ran.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.760
Using a word like that means
he's the proud warrior type.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.600
I can use that against him!

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.670
I'm rather new to fighting.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.820
But if I train with Hamon for a month,

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.510
I know I have the talent to beat you!

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.290
I was the first human to hit your head,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.540
and I carved a hunk out of it!

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.080
But you have a chance to kill me

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.000
before I grow into a real threat to you!

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.320
Why you...?!

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.000
Wamuu.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.890
Master Esidisi.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.340
His minute is up.
Why do you let him live?

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.680
Crap, we've got company!

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.900
Master Esidisi, I've grown fond of
this wielder of Hamon.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.530
I-I got him!

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.090
JoJo!

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.950
I agree to your proposition.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.130
You say you'll be stronger in a month,

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.830
so I will give you a month to live.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.330
You won't kill me?

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.460
That's right.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.290
We'll fight again?

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.340
That's right.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.050
This is a bad idea. You'll regret it.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.760
Yes! I'm safe for now!

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.180
However...

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.260
I need to ensure that
you will not simply run away.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.060
Wamuu, will you use
that old thing again?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.010
The Wedding Ring of Death.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.480
I will put this ring around your aorta.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.820
Wh-What are you doing?!

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.070
The ring will start to
dissolve in 33 days.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.600
Inside is a virulent poison.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.030
The ring cannot be removed.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.540
Any attempt will break
it, releasing the poison.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.800
You have only one way
to avoid the poison.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.440
Fight and defeat me within 33 days

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.220
and take the antidote from my lip ring.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.470
JoJo!

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.510
Till death do us part.
A true wedding ring.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:07.480
Midnight in 33 days at the Colosseum.
I'll be waiting, JoJo.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.000
You guessed wrong
if you thought you'd escape.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.490
I don't imagine we'll fight,
but here's a little gift!

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.160
I'll put it around your windpipe!

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.250
My heart and throat!

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.010
Mine is a different poison from Wamuu's.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.380
The antidote is in my nose ring.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.640
Kars, do you want in on this?

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.050
Nonsense.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.760
We are immortal.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:44.200
A worthy opponent is a rare thing
that gives our lives meaning.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.400
I can see why you do this.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:51.640
But our goal is to obtain
the power of the Red Stone of Aja.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.700
Do not forget that, you two.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.740
Let's go!

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.890
JoJo, grow strong and
overcome my Divine Sandstorm!

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.330
H-Holy smokes.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.460
A wedding ring?

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.130
That's a black joke
if I ever heard one.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.070
And now I've got two of them.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:16.800
Do I look like a bigamist or something?!

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.690
Well, at least Speedwagon
and Caesar are safe.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.810
There's no sense in moping about it.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.610
JoJo.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.610
You damned fool.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.670
Despite your blood loss, you pulled

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.540
a bluff a card sharp would be proud of.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:44.960
Good show.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.170
Let's study Hamon together.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.340
We'll grow stronger.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.960
You and me both.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.520
Next episode

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.940
I only said one month as a bluff!

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.980
Step through those doors and you'll see.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.520
Coach, no!

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.820
I won't hold back because you're a girl!

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.530
Welcome to Venice!

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.210
Chapter 16: Lisa Lisa, Hamon Coach
