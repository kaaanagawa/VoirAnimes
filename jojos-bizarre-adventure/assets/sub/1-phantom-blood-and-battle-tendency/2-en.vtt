00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.690
Seven years later, in the year 1888...

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.910
-London's East End, 1888-

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.710
...Jack the Ripper stalked the streets,
terrorizing the women of London.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.170
And a feud between JoJo and Dio would

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.400
unleash a new horror into the world.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.570
Two stars fallen from the heavens

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.740
Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.920
Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.440
The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.140
And for the man who follows
his ambition...

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.350
...a sacrifice awaits

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.450
With pounding heart
and burning will

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.960
With thundering fists

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.580
And overflowing bravery

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.580
He steps forward, free of doubt

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.480
A fate determined by his blood

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.720
JoJo!

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.940
Chapter 2: A Letter From the Past

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.200
He caught it!

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.980
The ball is intercepted by
the school hero, Jonathan Joestar!

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.030
Joestar, the mild-mannered, 195-cm giant

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.590
sprints for the goal with a roar!

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.090
Can he win his last game
before graduating?!

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.640
He's been tackled!

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.280
But he's still standing!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.850
Two more fly in!
Three men are on him!

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.490
Incredible!

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.520
He's dragging them along in
his charge toward the goal!

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.310
What power! What determination!
He's a juggernaut!

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.500
And another tackle!

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.380
He's wavering at last!

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.870
There's the pass!

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.380
It's good!

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.260
Look who caught it!

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.260
It's Dio!

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.730
That's our Dio Brando!

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.940
Can he make it?

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.670
He dodges one!

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.840
And another!

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.520
He's done it!

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.840
He's free!

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.850
He shows off his lightning speed!

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.720
Try!

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.520
They did it!

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.730
They've won their final game!

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.380
JoJo and Dio! What teamwork!
What an amazing duo!

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.740
We did it!

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.150
That was some fine running!

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.390
Yeah, but it was all thanks to you.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.140
Dio aims to graduate
with top grades in law.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.710
JoJo has written a fine
thesis on archaeology.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.370
This victory belongs to them!
They're the pride of our school!

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.850
JoJo, let's tell Father
about this right away!

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.360
How long has it been since
my dad adopted Dio?

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.280
I smile and act friendly, but I can't
think of him as a real brother.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.720
Why not? He's both talented and kind.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.730
But I can't forget
what happened seven years ago.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.890
Dio, can you tell us about
your friendship with JoJo?

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.180
That's an embarrassing subject.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.740
C'mon. We want to hear.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.490
Well...

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.580
Friendship?!

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.270
Don't stand next to me
with your idiot grin!

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.200
Once I graduate,
I'll have no use for Sir Joestar.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.030
I've spent seven years patiently
waiting and playing along.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.510
Now that I am old enough to take it,

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.890
the Joestar fortune will be mine!

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.730
How are you feeling, Father?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.300
Better, except for this cough.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.220
The doctors want me in the hospital.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.160
You should stay away
from the hospital.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.540
Hospitals don't cure anyone.
They're only after profits.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.960
I won't go. I feel better at home.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.350
My chest pains are better,
and the swelling has gone down.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.660
I'm getting better.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.970
It was only a cold.
Why has it gotten this bad?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.730
Oh, and congratulations
on your victory today.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.110
You already heard?

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.580
An old college friend informed me.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.420
Some friend!

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.360
We ran home to be the first to tell you!

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.870
I'm very pleased.
I'm proud to have such excellent sons.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.840
You've come especially far, Dio.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.380
Follow your dreams
after graduation.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.630
I'll support you in every way.
You're family.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.260
I am grateful that you have
lifted me out of poverty.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.980
I'll keep striving to improve.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.820
Only I know about it.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.090
What purpose could this mask
have been created for?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.630
But it belonged to my mother,
so it makes me think of her.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.720
I hope one day I can solve its riddle
and stir up a sensation!

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.850
Oops!

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.280
Thank you again, Dio.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.590
I must be getting old.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.820
Climbing stairs really wears me out.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.710
I just had a terrifying thought!

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.080
Dio is...

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.840
Dio is...

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.650
Dio!

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.650
What are you doing with that medicine?

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.520
What do you mean?

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.040
Have you always brought
Dad his medicine?

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.430
Yes. Why?

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.270
I came across an old letter
written by your real father.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.940
It says here, I'm terribly sick.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.290
I know it will be the end of me.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.660
My chest hurts, my fingers are swollen

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.450
and my cough won't stop.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.920
Those are the same
symptoms as Dad's!

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.710
What's going on here, Dio?!

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.210
What are you trying to say?

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.960
I'm having this medicine checked!

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:51.140
If you doubt that medicine,
you doubt our friendship.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.980
Our friendship will be lost!

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.280
I can't look him in the eye!

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.440
It's because I haven't confirmed
my doubt yet.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.220
JoJo, put the medicine back on the tray.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.250
We'll just forget this foolishness.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:19.590
Dio, swear your innocence
on the honor of your real father!

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:25.490
If you can do that, I'll do as you say
and forget all of this!

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.470
If my hunch is correct, his prideful
personality won't let him do it.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.280
Swear it to me, Dio!

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.610
Swear?

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.080
Swear on his honor?!

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.030
Don't be absurd!

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.250
That bastard never had any honor!

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.000
You just proved my doubt.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.350
Your reaction is unnatural.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.370
I don't know what happened between you

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.590
and your father, but you killed him.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.890
I'll defend my father, and my family!

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.320
So that's how it is?

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.310
I see what you've been planning!

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.420
You never had any love for me!

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.500
I won't let you near my father!

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.420
I'll analyze this medicine
and give it to the police!

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.840
Damn it! I was so close!

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.590
Was him finding out an omen?

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.230
No! I won't let a worm like him
interfere with my plans!

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.040
I have no use for a dead woman!

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.240
He pushed Mother to death.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.740
Just thinking his blood
flows in my veins drives me crazy!

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.270
There's no turning back now!

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.840
Dad, I'm going to London for a few days.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.340
While I'm gone, only accept
medicine from these doctors.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.770
You can't trust my treatment?

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.600
Please do as JoJo says.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.070
I don't know his reasons,
but I trust my son.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.580
D-Dad...

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.410
He's getting worse.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.960
He may need an antidote.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:08.000
I have to finish JoJo before he
finds out about the medicine.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.630
And it has to be a perfect crime.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.010
This mask reacted to my blood
seven years ago.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.810
If those spikes enter JoJo's brain,
he'll die instantly.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.710
And it will look like an accident,
so no one will suspect.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:32.080
JoJo, your curiosity will
be the death of you!

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.110
-London, two days later-

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.250
Whoa!

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.590
The university couldn't
identify the medicine.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.830
Chances are it's Asian medicine.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.330
That means...

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:53.770
Young man, that's Ogre Street,
the most dangerous part of London.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.010
I know, but I have no choice but to go.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.100
You can leave if you want.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.100
Dio lived in London.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.780
Asian medicine
can only be found here.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.110
I'll find it, my evidence
and the antidote.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.250
Another dead end.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.440
That cat was eating a puppy!

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.370
Take him, Tattoo!

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.770
Use that knife of yours
to slice that snob to ribbons!

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.930
I see this street has earned its name.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.690
This idiot just grabbed my knife!

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:58.450
All I have to do is yank
and you'll lose four fingers!

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.500
Try it. The instant you pull,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.830
my foot will hit your
groin like a sledgehammer.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.460
I can afford to lose a few fingers.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.990
I'm fighting to protect my family!

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.960
That's far more than you can say!

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.610
Tell me where they sell
Asian medicine around here!

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.660
Hey, you!

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.980
You said you'd be fine
missing four fingers!

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.120
Don't try to bluff me, rich kid!

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.080
Let's dance.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.580
I have to find that shop
no matter the cost!

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:56.460
Have you ever fought before?
You're only covering your head!

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.470
That went to the bone!

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.730
The knife threw me off,
but my hat still got you good!

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.280
He's a monster!

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:22.580
That was no bluff! He was prepared
to lose both legs, let alone fingers!

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.490
His will has overcome his pain and fear.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:33.090
I never should have picked a fight
with a guy as tough as him!

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.600
What? JoJo went to Ogre Street alone?

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.940
I'm sorry, but yes.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.900
Don't worry Sir Joestar with this.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.780
Yes, sir.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.440
I guess I won't need to use the mask.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.690
Has he already died like a dog?

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.200
S-Stop!

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.950
I won't allow anyone to lay
a finger on that gentleman!

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.250
Gentleman?

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.710
Tell me something.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.380
Why did you hold back on me?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:21.350
A leg like yours should
have totally ruined my face.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.850
I'm here for my father's sake.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:31.600
So I realized you must have a family.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.100
I don't want to cause them grief.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.090
Is this guy for real?
He's completely naive!

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:40.860
But...

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.460
Yes, my friends are all fine, too.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.760
He's a true gentleman to the core!

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.090
I like your style!

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.420
Tell me your name.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.920
Jonathan Joestar.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:05.220
You're looking for Asian medicine?

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.680
The man who sells it is as sly as a fox!

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.420
JoJo's been gone for three days.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.960
He does what he says he will.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.190
He's really grown into a man.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.700
That is why I was so hard on him,
maybe too hard.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.890
I'm sure JoJo is dead
in an alley by now.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.920
Did he find any evidence?

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.380
Why can't I stop drinking?!

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.550
Just like that wretched father of mine!

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.010
Damn it!

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.690
Watch where you're going, numbskull!

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.070
Hey friend, check if that brat
left a pee stain on my coat!

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.240
Are you deaf, you snot-nosed punk?

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.620
You won't get away with that!

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.630
A disgusting insect like you has a lot

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.590
of nerve to speak to me like that.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.880
What an excellent opportunity.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.260
I'll try this on you before
I use it on JoJo.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.930
What are you blabbering about?!

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.230
A live-body experiment!

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.780
What is that light?!

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.920
Was I hallucinating?

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.340
He's dead.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.100
Just a boring little toy for torturers.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.450
Impossible!

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.950
He's alive!

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.850
What is he?

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:43.920
Those teeth!

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.900
What incredible strength!

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.070
He's not stopping.
Does he feel no pain?

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.320
He shattered my shoulder
with just a tap!

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.890
I have to jump into the river.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.340
So thirsty...

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.880
I don't know why,
but I feel terribly thirsty.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.340
He's draining my blood.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.070
What the...

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.350
So this is the mask's secret.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.910
But...

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:55.050
No! I don't want the sun
to be the last thing I see!

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.130
The sun...

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.950
What's the matter?
Why is it dark in here?

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.170
JoJo!

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.630
I have proof of your devilish plot!

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.560
Next episode

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.730
JoJo, I have a final favor to ask.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:36.030
This guy stinks worse than
a pile of puke!

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.570
- I'm throwing away my humanity, JoJo!
- Dio!

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.390
