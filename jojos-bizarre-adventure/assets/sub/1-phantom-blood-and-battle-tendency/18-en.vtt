WEBVTT

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.160
I think I used my head too much.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.040
My shoulders are sore.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.700
They feel so heavy.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.260
From the silent depths

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.310
The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.650
Crimson blood

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.450
Summons the valorous to stand up

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.750
If inherited love is called fate

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.010
Then take another step with smiling eyes

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.510
Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.270
Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.320
Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.030
Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.910
Destiny written into your veins

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.660
The undying bonds of honor arise

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.880
Take hold of them

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.640
Chapter 18: Von Stroheim's Revenge

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.640
It's dawn.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.850
Caesar and JoJo should be back
before too long.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.810
Madam Lisa Lisa...

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.810
Which blouse do you like?

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.070
Suzie Q, thank you.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.530
White is always nice,
but something colorful can be fun.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.660
I'll let you decide.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.390
Let's see, then...

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.740
How about the white one?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.040
But I really do like this design.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.260
Did JoJo and Caesar
pass their final exams?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.960
Somehow I'm worried.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.420
I have a bad feeling.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.340
Let's go with
the refreshing white!

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.850
Suzie Q...

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.760
Yes?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.260
Send Caesar and JoJo to my room
when they arrive.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.140
I'll tell them.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.610
I really like the clean design
of this one.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.150
Which is better?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.320
Which to choose?

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.490
White!

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.990
Then again...

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.780
This is nice, too.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.580
Oh, what to do?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.840
The colorful one
will do nicely, Suzie Q.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.960
Good choice, madam!

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.890
I'll just leave these here.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.230
I'll clean up the broken glass later.
Be careful.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.740
Thank you.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.000
Hey.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.670
Suzie Q.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.550
What are you screaming about?!

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.840
Be quiet, dummy!

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.640
W-Who... Who are you?!

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.640
There's a stranger on the island!

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.850
You're calling me a stranger?!

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.350
It's me! Joseph Joestar!

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.940
JoJo?!

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.660
No way!

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.510
You always had a mask on before.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.200
What a surprise!

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.950
You haven't seen my face
in all this time?

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.830
And so? Am I handsome?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.290
Weird lips.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.960
Even with these weird lips,
if we were to fall in love...

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.190
...you can kiss them all you like!

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.640
In your dreams!

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.510
Blech!

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.470
What's up?

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.710
Nothing.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.770
Nothing at all.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.650
Oh yeah, Madam Lisa Lisa wants you
to go to her room.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.530
But she's in the bath,
so wait half an hour.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.660
Got it. I planned to go anyway.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.160
They know about the Stone.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.120
You mean Madam Lisa Lisa's Stone?

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.880
Don't worry about it.
You don't want to get involved.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.380
Um, JoJo...

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.720
Hmm?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.970
You're actually pretty hot.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.570
That's odd.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.740
My shoulders have loosened up.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.200
One ring neutralized at 6 a.m.
The other dissolves in six days.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.750
The news I have is important,
but Lisa Lisa is taking a bath.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.460
So I'm supposed to wait half an hour.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.480
If I was told to wait, I'll wait.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.190
Where to spend half an hour?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.990
I think the best place is here
by Lisa Lisa's door.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.450
Would it be wrong if I peeked
through the keyhole?

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.700
Nice!

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.040
Suzie Q?

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.670
What's she doing in there?

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.300
When did she go inside?

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.510
That was fast.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.260
I thought she was on the docks.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680
What the...?

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.680
The knob is covered in slime.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.690
So, Suzie Q, have JoJo and Caesar
returned yet?

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.200
Suzie Q?

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.910
Suzie Q!

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.550
Where did you put the Red Stone?!

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.560
Who are you?! Where is the Stone?!

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.320
N-No!

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.820
S-Something's inside Suzie Q!

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.860
You have reduced me to nothing
but a brain!

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.000
But I challenge you to one last fight!

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.500
I put the Stone on the boat
that just left.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.050
I am here to stop you from chasing it!

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.800
You will not follow that postal boat!

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.390
The woman I am inside of
is still mostly alive!

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.850
You will have to kill her
in order to destroy me completely!

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.110
Can you do that?
Are you capable of that?

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.820
Esidisi!

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.110
JoJo!

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.740
You never give up, do you, Esidisi?

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.990
JoJo!

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.580
Oh, Caesar!

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.120
It's about time.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.250
You...

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.520
You survived your bout with Esidisi?

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.200
You're a lucky one.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.640
JoJo! What were you doing
with our coach?!

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.670
Cool it, meathead.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.740
It's not like that. Look at Suzie Q!

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.440
Huh?

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.280
What's going on?

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.310
It's Esidisi.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:06.240
His brain and blood vessels
have taken over her body!

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.450
Damn him!

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.370
Save me, Caesar!

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.650
Please...

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.120
Everyone picks on me...

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.880
...but you won't, will you, Caesar?

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.700
Don't fall for it.
She's not the one talking.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.920
Esidisi is using her.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.260
Caesar, the Stone is on a postal boat.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.850
Leave this to us. Go after the Stone.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.310
If the Stone reaches a train in Venice

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.570
we have no idea where
in the world it might go.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.860
You're not going anywhere!

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.580
You have to kill me first, wiener heads!

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.490
A male voice!

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.840
His blood vessels are controlling her
from within!

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.670
Come on!

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.050
Bring it!

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.690
Use your Hamon and kill me!

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.970
It would be easy to destroy me
in my current state!

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:21.440
But you know that this girl's heart
can't take a Hamon shock like that!

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.110
Are you willing to take
this girl's life?

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:31.910
If you can, then hurry up and do it,
fools!

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.660
Hey!

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.450
I'm not soft, Esidisi!

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.620
I only have to end the life of one girl

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.250
and I can save the entire world.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.130
I consider it a necessary sacrifice.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.610
A-Are you serious, JoJo?!

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.520
Time to go to pieces, Esidisi!

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.490
N-No!

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.270
JoJo!

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.730
I'm really gonna do it!

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.320
Damn it! I can't hit her!

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.160
This bastard!

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.990
I thought he'd pop out of her,
but he's unfazed!

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.500
Enough of your bluffing.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.730
You could never kill this girl.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.310
The Stone has likely already
arrived on the main island.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.810
You're too late.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.560
A-And now...

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.820
W-What is he doing to Suzie Q now?

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.690
S-Stop this, Esidisi!

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.150
And now I will explode this girl's body,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:59.290
and cover you all
with blood as hot as lava!

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.410
H-His blood is boiling hot!

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.670
S-Suzie Q's body is falling apart!

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.920
If this keeps up, it's not just Suzie Q,
we'll all be in trouble!

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.880
V-Very well.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.510
JoJo, use your Hamon on Suzie Q!

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.140
C-Come on!

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.560
Don't make me do this!

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.690
I still have nightmares about
chopping von Stroheim's leg off!

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.070
A plan!

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.940
We need a plan!

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.820
I-I'll do it, then.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.240
N-No, Coach! Let me do it.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.360
W-Wait! I thought of something!

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.960
Remember Hell Climb Pillar!

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.670
We'll try that! It's do or die!

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.040
Let's go for it!

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.170
You and me! Two types of Hamon!

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.540
Two types?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.140
I-I see.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.090
I-It might just work.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.020
Got it?

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.350
JoJo! Caesar!

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.310
I understand.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.860
JoJo, follow my breathing.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.490
Now!

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.420
JoJo creates a burst of positive Hamon!

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.800
Caesar focuses negative Hamon
on Suzie Q's heart!

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.050
At that point, the Hamon is
negative positive zero!

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.350
You've forced him out.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.150
JoJo!

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.490
No. It's all right.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.950
Let the sun take care of it.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.740
That low-down scum.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.330
Hiding away in a girl's body like that.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.790
No, Caesar. You don't understand.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.070
I fought with him, so I know.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.330
He threw away his pride and did all he

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.550
could to get the Stone for his allies.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.060
For thousands of years
he lived his life to its fullest.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.880
Whether it was good or evil,

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.690
I respect his life.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.990
JoJo...

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.960
Suzie Q...

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:56.090
While Esidisi controlled you,
you must have been semiconscious.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.460
Answer this.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.590
Where is the Stone headed?

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.470
Switzerland.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.100
Saint Moritz.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.730
A package.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.260
An envelope with
Madam Lisa Lisa's crest.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.860
The address is...

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.360
Switzerland?!

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.280
Are Kars and Wamuu there?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.750
I just checked.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.910
A cargo train for Switzerland
left ten minutes ago.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.960
The Stone has to be on that train!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.500
Saint Moritz
Venice

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:37.590
And we have to beat that train
to Saint Moritz!

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.470
In order to keep the Stone
out of the wrong hands,

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.760
we might have to do some dirty work.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.480
We might break the law.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.770
Some of us may end up dead.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.690
I won't.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.810
I wasn't ready before,
but I won't lose now.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.610
I'll eradicate them.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.620
Caesar!

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.120
Right. We're out of here!

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.640
Hey, Suzie Q! Look over here!

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.310
This is goodbye, Suzie Q!

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.440
But I'll be back in Venice one day!

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.560
Really?!

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.900
Yeah!

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.190
Heal those ugly wounds before then!

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.330
Later!

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:54.330
JoJo, you just make sure
you come back here in one piece!

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.080
Don't be pushy!

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.590
You may be an old lady first,
but I'll return!

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.970
You stupid jerk!

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.650
I'll be back soon.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.700
Saint Moritz, Switzerland

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.660
Drive the damned car!

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.820
What's with your arms?

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.500
Something's wrong with the wheel!

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.340
Esidisi hasn't called.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.590
He said he learned
the Stone was in Venice.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.470
Has something happened to him?

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.390
Hey, JoJo.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.600
JoJo!

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.640
JoJo, wake up!

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.360
5:00 p.m.
6 days until remaining ring dissolves

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.060
Huh?

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.360
JoJo, we've caught up!

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.390
They're in customs.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:52.120
It's less than an hour from
the border to Saint Moritz.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.450
I'm glad we caught up.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.500
Look sharp, JoJo.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.250
Listen, I'm just saving up my strength,
that's all.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.360
Let's hurry up and get that Stone.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.650
Then we need to plan for the
fight with Wamuu.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.640
Wait until we cross.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.100
What the hell?

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.620
Knock it off!

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.560
If you want to go on, just pass us!

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.020
German soldiers!

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.190
What are they doing
on the Swiss-Italian border?

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.490
You're looking rather spry.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.950
My, how you've grown, Mr. Joestar.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.460
W-What did you say?

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.330
What was that?

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.090
G-Get back here!

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.590
Who are you?!
I don't know any German soldiers!

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.610
Look at the train!

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.680
So many soldiers...

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.930
We found it, Colonel!

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.560
That crest! It's the package!

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.560
And we know what's inside!

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.820
The Red Stone of Aja!

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.490
W-Why do the Germans want it?!

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:18.160
We are taking the Stone as a specimen
for our research.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:24.080
For the past three weeks,
we have been watching you in Venice.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.320
We started when we lost
our team in Rome.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.170
We saw your training. We saw Esidisi.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.970
And we knew you were chasing the Stone.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.010
Our base is a lodge up ahead.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.390
Follow us.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.150
We want to ask you about the Stone and Kars.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.310
Let us work together, eh?

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.990
We are not complete strangers, JoJo.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.260
Hey! What are you blabbing about?!

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.120
Don't think you know me, bastard!

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.330
So the Germans are here.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.580
C-Coach?

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.960
We have no choice.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.500
At least Kars doesn't have the Stone.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.220
At that time, the German army
was marching across Europe.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.570
March 13, 1938: Annexation of Austria

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.940
March 15, 1939: Annexation
of Bohemia and Moravia

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.840
They wanted to ensure their rule
was permanent.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.830
September 28, 1939: Division
of Poland with Soviet Union

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:24.300
The power of the mask and Red Stone
would solve their problem perfectly.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.710
The Germans needed the ultimate power

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.690
of immortality to conquer the world!

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.550
Five hours later - 10:00 p.m.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.420
I'll read the heat inside.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.740
The fireplace is lit.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.230
Four lights on the wall,
two on the ceiling.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.920
Two on the desk...

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.340
No, three.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.360
Four humans standing by the wall.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:06.350
From the right, their heights are
178 cm, 174 cm, 181 cm, 178 cm.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.610
One human is by the fireplace.
He's 183 cm tall.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.480
Five humans, all male.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.040
One, two...

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.670
That's four.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.790
And five.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.090
So you're Kars?

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.590
You're fast.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.850
In just a few hours, you heard
about your friend's defeat,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.560
then learned that we had obtained
the Stone,

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.480
and have come for it.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.230
And this brutal, calculated assault...

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:58.490
None of my men made a sound
before they died.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.370
I'm sure there were five men
in this room.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.000
So, why can't I sense your body heat?

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.330
Hey, rifle heads!

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.750
Do I have to wait forever for food?

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.000
Kars!

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.130
It's mechanical!

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.880
You're...

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.400
...von Stroheim!

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.650
Next episode

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.740
We should attack now!

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.990
That building is the address.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.960
That was mean of me.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.330
This is German science!

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.080
No machine can stop me!

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.130
Chapter 19: A Race Toward the Brink
