00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.860
-England, 1868-

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.490
Hey! Look at that wreck!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.920
Yikes! This guy died on the spot.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.670
They must've slipped in the mud
and fell off the cliff.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.680
But boy do these nobles
have some fancy clothes.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.640
Look!

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.410
The woman inside is dead,
but the baby is still alive!

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.190
She must have protected it.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.350
A baby?!

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.980
Who cares about a baby?!

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.690
What are you doing?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.860
What does it look like?!

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490
I'm taking their jewelry!

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.870
What's that?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
What a creepy mask.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.000
It's worthless to me.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.960
Give me a hand!

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.380
Let's yank out their teeth!

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.170
They'll fetch a good price!

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.840
You...

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.720
You came to rescue me.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.840
Thank you.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.140
My wife...

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.600
My wife and son...

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.600
Are they all right?

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.550
They cr-- Uh, I'm afraid your wife
and the driver are dead.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.610
But the baby is safe.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.990
Perhaps this is fate...

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.450
My name is George Joestar I.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.750
I must thank you for saving my life.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.630
Please tell me your name
while I am still conscious.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.630
He thinks I came to save his life!

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.300
What a fool!

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.510
It won't hurt to say my name.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.390
Dario Brando at your service.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.850
Mr. Brando, the Joestars
will not forget our debt to you.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.690
-12 years later-

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.970
There's a good boy!

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.950
I'm off, Dad!

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.080
Take care, JoJo!

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.540
Let's go, Danny!

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.430
Dio!

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.700
Come here!

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.350
Dio! Are you deaf, boy?!

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.900
What do you want, Father? Medicine?

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.530
Idiot! I don't want any snake oil!

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.490
If you have money,
go buy me some booze!

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.670
JoJo, manners!

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.420
Sorry, Dad.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.290
Check.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.380
Fine.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.220
Feeling smart now, kid?!

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.770
Stop! Give it back!

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.820
Hey, Erina!
Your daddy buy you this doll?

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.780
He makes a lot of money
for being a quack!

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.990
I know!

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.370
Let's peel her clothes off!

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.500
We'll see if it looks like
the real thing!

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.340
She cried!
Erina's a crybaby!

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.210
Knock it off!

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.620
Give it back to her!

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.800
Who're you?

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.220
Erina's friend?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.740
I don't know her,
but I'll fight for her!

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.060
You dumb jerk.
Fighting 'cause she's a girl.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.820
Huh? He's a total pushover!

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.610
How embarrassing!
Now our brave knight needs saving!

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.710
This guy's the only son of the Joestars!

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.460
The one thing I can't stand
is a rich kid!

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.340
You stuck up snob!

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.050
Have some of this!

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.430
Dio, my time is almost up.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.930
Listen!

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.980
When I die, take this letter
to the Joestar mansion!

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.500
They owe me something big.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.920
You're a smart boy. Go out there
and become the world's richest man!

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.440
Just stay on your own land, rich kid.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.410
Let's go.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.920
Are you --

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.340
Just leave me alone!

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.720
Go away!
I didn't attack them for your sake!

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.770
I want to be a true gentleman!

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.620
You were a lady in distress.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.770
A true gentleman has to be brave enough

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.820
to go into a fight he knows he'll lose.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.330
But one day,
I'll be strong enough to win.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.490
You were ugly and sly.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.450
You drove Mom to death.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.210
You were a terrible father!

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.960
You want me to be rich?

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.960
Don't worry. I will be.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.960
And I'll use any means necessary.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.800
I'll start with this Joestar.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.510
You pig!

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.560
No one will bring me down.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.370
Jonathan Joestar.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.960
This is a tale of two youths and
a stone mask that alters their fates.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.250
Chapter 1: Dio the Invader

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.030
Who is he?

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.780
You're Dio Brando, right?

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.790
And you must be Jonathan Joestar.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.630
Everyone calls me JoJo.
Nice to meet you.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.040
Danny!

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.090
See him? That's Danny.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.590
He's my dog.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.550
Don't worry.
He doesn't bite.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.310
What was that for?!
You'll pay for that!

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.870
So this is the Joestar heir.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.730
He looks like a pampered brat.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.030
We'll see who has it all
after I get through with him.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.990
What's the matter?

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.020
What's going on here?

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.830
I'm sorry. The dog jumped at me.
It was a reflex.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.920
Welcome, Dio.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.920
You are part of our family now.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.550
Everyone, I owe my life
to this man's father.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.390
Treat him as you would JoJo.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.060
Yes, lord.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.270
Dio, this is your home now.
Live like JoJo does.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.810
Thank you for your hospitality,
Sir Joestar.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.400
You've both lost your mothers
and you're the same age.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.450
You should get along well.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.490
JoJo, forget about Danny, all right?

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.240
Yes, Dad.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.500
I'm sure I'd be surprised if a strange
dog jumped at me, so I understand.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.740
I do wish he'd apologize.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.630
But we'll be living together,
so I have to be nice.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.470
This way, Dio.
I'll show you your room.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.430
Yes, sir.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.730
Hands off!

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.650
No one touches my bags!

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.090
Keep your dirty paws to yourself!

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:03.990
Got it?!

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.990
I was trying to help!

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.990
No thanks!

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.620
I'll have a servant carry them.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.700
Listen closely, JoJo.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.040
I might be your guest,
but I won't take any lip from you.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.090
I always come first! I'm number one!

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.710
No one looks down
their nose at me!

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.050
But I just want to be friends!

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.860
And another thing, I hate dogs.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.270
They don't scare me.
I just can't stand their bootlicking.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.810
So keep that dumb mutt
Danny away from me.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.360
What's keeping you two?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.310
Hurry along.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.860
Yes, sir!

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:49.500
With Dio's arrival, JoJo's happy life
spiraled into misery.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.120
That's another mistake, JoJo!

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.460
Look at Dio!
20 out of 20 correct!

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.800
JoJo, you call yourself a gentleman?!

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.710
Where are your manners?!

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.760
Clear JoJo's place.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.180
No dinner for you.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.560
Looking at Dio, I see I've spoiled you.
I've been a shameful father!

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.520
Dio's manners are impeccable!

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.070
What an oaf.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.910
In this corner is Jonathan Joestar!

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.830
He's looking stronger lately!

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.500
And his opponent...

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.960
...has been changed.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.460
All we know is his name!
He's the new guy in town!

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:47.970
It couldn't be!

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.140
Introducing Dio Brando!

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.480
You know the rules.
One hit to the face wins it.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.060
Begin!

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.480
- Get him, JoJo!
- Take him down!

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.240
Look at those moves!

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.860
I've never seen the like!

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.570
I can't connect!

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.950
JoJo is better than I had expected.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.000
But...

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.340
I'll show him how we do it in the
bad part of town, Booth Boxing style!

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.630
Eat this!

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.010
There it is!

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.550
JoJo is out!

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.970
It's not over yet, JoJo!

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.190
I'll jam my thumb in his eye
and follow through!

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.770
Did you see that?!

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.030
Dio!

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.320
Dio, that was amazing!

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.030
How did you do that?

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.880
It's just a new defensive technique
in boxing.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.330
I'll teach it to you guys as a favor.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.210
Really?

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.670
But don't teach it to JoJo.
He can't keep a secret.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.100
- He can't?
- Thanks for the warning.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.970
Why?

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.760
Why do that on purpose?

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.520
Loneliness will make a man hollow.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.520
I'll turn JoJo into an empty husk!

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:31.430
Bit by bit, I'll steal his life.
When I'm an adult, he'll have nothing.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.120
Damn that Dio!

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.370
This is awful.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.370
It's like he's taking over my life.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.330
Hey! Get a move on!

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.540
Hey! What are you doing?

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.000
Come here!
Let me join in on the fun!

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.010
Did you guys hear something?

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.550
Ignore it.
It's just a snitch.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.720
What?!

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.100
Get back here! Who's a snitch?!

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.220
Let's split.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.870
You're a snitch, JoJo!

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.490
You'll blab to anyone
over anything!

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.350
Squealer!

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.110
Hold on! Get back here!

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.440
I never squealed on anybody!

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.030
JoJo the squealer!

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.030
Dio! Dio did this!

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.140
He's spreading wild rumors about me!

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.540
He's trying to destroy me
for some reason!

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.330
Curse you, Dio!

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.510
Ever since he showed up,
everyone's turned on me!

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.580
Danny, you'll be my friend
no matter what Dio does.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.490
Who was that?

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.750
I feel like I've seen her before.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.290
My handkerchief!

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.210
Aha!

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.590
Thanks for the grapes!

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.720
I'll be here tomorrow!
Come see me!

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.500
She went off without a word.
Girls are so cute!

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.190
In that dark time, Jonathan's heart
was spurred on by love!

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.570
They quickly became friends,
and Jonathan was enchanted by her.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.320
Erina.
Erina Pendleton.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.830
She's an angel!

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.500
What are you doing, JoJo?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.500
JoJo! You can't do that!

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.880
You're no good!

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.960
See you!
Bye bye!

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.980
Hi. Are you Erina?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.490
You and JoJo look happy together.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.360
I knew something was wrong.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.240
He's been happy
where he should be miserable.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.670
He did it!

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.470
That's our Dio!
He's got way more guts than we do!

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.930
He's my idol!
I want to be him!

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.310
Have you and JoJo kissed yet?

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.480
Not yet, eh?

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.270
Your first kiss was not with him!

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.940
It was with me!

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.940
Even if I stole it, the fact
that I kissed her is enough!

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.770
Their little romance is over!

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.410
He won't have a single
friend or lover!

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.920
Look! What is she doing?!

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.840
What is she thinking?

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.170
She's washing with puddle water!

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.720
Is she nuts? There's a stream nearby!

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.180
You wench!

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.430
You're just doing that to insult me!

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.610
Dio, you fool! Don't lose your head
over a dumb girl!

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.740
We're done here! Let's go.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.870
Hey, Erina!

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.380
Erina, wait!

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.930
This isn't right. What happened?

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.400
Look at that sorry look on his face!

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.560
Go tell him why she ran away!

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.560
But I just couldn't bear
to see JoJo cry!

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.060
Why you...

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:18.940
What did you do?

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.400
What did you do to her?!

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.820
Dio!

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.330
I wouldn't use my name lightly
if I were you.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.920
This ends now!
I won't let you hurt her again!

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.050
Your fight is with me!

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.220
So you heard about your darling Erina?

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.810
Now you want to take revenge,
with your fists, eh?

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.020
I won't let you insult her!

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.770
You're just twisted by jealousy!

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.690
You want more of what happened
when we boxed?!

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.860
I can't beat him.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:15.200
But if I lose here, I'll have to spend
my life cowering in Dio's shadow.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:20.210
But most of all,
I have to fight for Erina's honor!

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.840
I'm going to pulverize him.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.300
And I'll do it fair and square.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:33.680
That way he'll know beyond a doubt
he can never beat me.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.230
Not in a fight, and not in life.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.940
Come!

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.600
That's it! That felt good!

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.700
How could he grab me after that kick?!

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.570
How about some more?!

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.040
Dio!

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.170
I'm going to beat you until you cry!

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.420
How could rubbish like him beat me?!

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.940
You...

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.480
You...

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.110
You...

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.570
You have a lot of nerve, don't you?!

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.570
He's crying.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.830
You filthy cur!

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.750
What's going on, you two?!

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.000
Dad!

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.210
Boys fight. That can't be helped.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.330
But JoJo, you were beating
Dio while he was down

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.630
and unable to defend himself!

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.180
- That's not civil!
- But --

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.260
No excuses!

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.390
To your rooms, both of you!

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.540
You'll both be punished later.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.570
What's that box?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.400
Oh, well.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.200
I bet a maid threw it away.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.460
What's that?

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.420
Something's banging around.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.920
Is someone in there?!

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.390
No! They're burning alive in there!

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.270
Erina...

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.600
Damn that Dio!

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.530
This is what you were aiming for!

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.720
Well, you got what you wanted!

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.880
The sight of him was too much to bear,
so we buried him quickly.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:04.210
The police say a burglar probably
wanted Danny out of the way.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.370
Dio...

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.840
Dio? He hasn't returned from school yet.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.390
JoJo went to his room and slept.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.490
After he woke, he thought about Danny,

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.280
the companion he had lost, and cried.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:32.660
I evened the score by killing that mutt,
but I had no idea JoJo was so strong.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.900
The more you beat him,
the tougher he gets.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.410
My anger makes me vulnerable.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.080
I have to fix that.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:46.540
I must learn to cool my temper.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.820
Seven years passed...

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.520
Next episode

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.790
Seven years later...

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.020
And Jonathan Joestar steals the ball!

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.380
I just had a terrifying thought!

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.650
You said you'd be fine
missing four fingers!

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.000
Our friendship will be lost!

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.530
I'll defend my father, and my family!

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.520
