00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.600
-Tibet, 1863-

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.750
You have endured our training
for three long years.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.540
You can run for dozens of miles
without losing your breath.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.730
You will soon be ready for the training
we call the Celestial Gate.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.060
However, I tell you again, Zeppeli...

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.740
...if you continue your training, you
will not be able to escape your doom.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.830
The time for turning back is now.
You can still start a new life.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.580
Master Tonpetty...

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.040
...please read the waves
of my life once more.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.300
When am I destined to die?
Where am I destined to die?

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.090
What would you do if you knew?

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.020
I have a purpose in my life.
I cannot set it aside.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.860
I want to know in order to
fulfill that purpose.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.330
I will accept everything
when I know when I will die.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.610
I will be satisfied.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.990
Very well, if you feel
you are prepared...

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.870
...I will tell you.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.310
In an ancient, hidden chamber
that reeks of death...

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.140
...a child will open the way.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.770
In order to release a chained
young lion into the future...

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.240
...you will burn your own wounds
and after, a cruel death awaits you!

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.870
Baron Zeppeli...

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.370
Be careful, Baron!

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.170
Here I come, JoJo!

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.590
In order to release a chained
young lion into the future.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.440
Two stars fallen from the heavens

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.780
Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.830
Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.440
The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.140
And for the man who follows
his ambition...

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.060
...a sacrifice awaits

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.540
With pounding heart
and burning will

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.020
With thundering fists

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.550
And overflowing bravery

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.500
He steps forward, free of doubt

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.830
A fate determined by his blood

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.630
JoJo!

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.520
Chapter 7: The Inheritor

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.910
This collar won't budge!

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.410
And Tarukus hasn't shown off any of his

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.590
tricks for fighting in this room.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.250
That worries me.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.800
Come, fools! You want to hit me
with some of your Hamon?

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.260
You cowards won't be able
to lay a finger on me!

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.640
What's the matter? Scared stiff?

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.650
Well done, Baron Zeppeli!

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.790
Try this, Tarukus!

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.080
Tornado Overdrive!

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.670
H-He just...!

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.870
Above me?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.170
No, the chain is coming from below!

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.180
You're both right!

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.680
I call this the Hell Heaven Snake Kill!

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.320
I'll strangle you both to death!

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.840
I-I can't breathe.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.490
My Hamon won't...

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.880
Jo...

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.600
JoJo...

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.200
Lord Dio, I have executed
both of them as you ordered.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.500
Th-This is...

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.840
This is just too cruel!

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.600
Jonathan!

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.290
Still alive, even with
a broken neck, are you?

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.410
Allow me to finish you.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.620
Jo...

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.330
JoJo...

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.630
The other one is still alive, too?

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.880
My ultimate...

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.800
My ultimate...

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.140
My ultimate technique
is now yours, JoJo!

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.230
JoJo, please, take up my torch!

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.820
Ultimate Deep Pass Overdrive!

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:11.980
JoJo, I have given you
all of my life energy.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.700
B-Baron...

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.400
B-Baron Zeppeli!

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.800
I'll grind both of you into paste
beneath my boot!

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.350
Y-You...

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.320
Jonathan pulled Tarukus off the ground!

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.150
Baron Zeppeli's Hamon
healed his broken neck!

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.670
Idiot, you think you can yank that open?
You, a pathetic human?

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.750
I couldn't pull apart that steel

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.460
even with the power Lord Dio gave me!

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.590
You'll pay, Tarukus!

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.600
Jonathan!

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.700
W-What the...?!

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.480
You are utterly twisted by your madness.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.070
You willingly sold your soul to Dio.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.260
S-Such strength!
His body can barely contain his power!

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.510
Jonathan received Baron Zeppeli's power

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.180
and it has synergized with his own!

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.030
Tarukus, I will allow nothing of you
to remain in this world.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.770
I will banish your evil spirit!

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.650
Drown in the depths of history!

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.570
Enough talk, you little brat!

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.060
Your little trick didn't work!

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.380
It's over!

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.070
Baron Zeppeli!

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.830
Baron Zeppeli...

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.330
I can't...

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.050
I can't believe this.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.050
Without you...

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.350
Without you, what will we do?

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.850
JoJo, you fool!
Have you lost your wits?

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.360
This is no time to grieve!

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:49.530
Now...

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.410
Now you are...

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.320
Now go.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.190
Defeat Dio.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.710
Destroy the mask.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.170
Baron Zeppeli!

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.430
I...

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.150
I am satisfied with my fate.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.530
When I was young, I was married.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.900
But I abandoned my family
to pursue the mask.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:41.160
Even so, I am satisfied with my fate.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.510
I accept it completely.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:54.680
In the end, I passed along
all of myself.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.720
JoJo...

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.770
...you are my hope.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.770
Baron Zeppeli...

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:10.900
You feel like both a son
and a best friend to me.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:18.420
And now I will live on...

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.870
...within you.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:37.050
The 19th century novelist
William Thackeray wrote this:

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.730
To love and win is the best thing.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.700
To love and lose is the next best.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:59.570
So JoJo took up his mentor's
life's quest as well as his spirit.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.580
Farewell, Baron Zeppeli.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.300
P-Please...

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:27.230
Please spare the life of this child.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.690
Let me confirm your desire, madam.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:42.620
You will give your life to us,
but we must not touch your child.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.700
Is that right?

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:55.130
Please, leave my child alone.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.510
You move me to tears. Okay.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.680
I, Dio, swear that

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.930
neither I, nor any of these
servants will harm your child.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.150
However, all of them bowed to their fear

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.790
and gave their souls to me willingly.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.320
It would be better for both you
and your child to join us.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.410
You would have no worries.
There would be no hate between you.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.250
Please, just spare this child!

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.040
Just this child...

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.250
Okay, okay...

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.480
My sweet baby!

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.780
We won't harm the child, as I promised.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.980
Instead you do it yourself.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.930
It is a tragedy of your own choosing.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.470
Jonathan's expression has changed.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.760
His face is darker.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.430
And I am the same.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.800
We must endure our sadness and anger.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.150
We cannot grieve until Dio has fallen!

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.610
Jonathan, Dio said he would wipe out
the town in one more night!

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.920
Zombies will create zombies,
breeding like rats!

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.770
What is happening down there?

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.040
Is Wind Knights Lot still alive?

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.540
Is my sister all right?

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.790
Let's hurry.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.680
Mr. Adams!

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.620
Poco, why are you
wandering about at this hour?!

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:17.120
Mr. Adams, is Sis all right?
Is the town all right?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.940
Is she all right?!

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.770
You really think she's all right?!

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.410
She's furious!

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.830
She'll lock you in the
barn when you get home!

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.150
I guess the town is safe.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.540
Let's move!

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.040
Thanks, Mr. Adams!

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.720
A child!

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.770
I want to drink the fresh,
warm blood of a child!

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.110
He's already been turned!

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.370
Can you escape this speed?!

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.410
It looks like it is too late.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:23.440
That's correct.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.860
The outskirts are infested with zombies.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.100
Another one?!

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.930
My name is Dire.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.150
A kick, but why so slow?

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.660
Try this! Thunder Split Attack!

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.460
H-He's incredible!

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:10.760
A normal man would pull his head back,
but he head-butted me instead!

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.050
Wait, Jonathan Joestar!

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.680
I am human.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.810
Forgive me.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.810
I wanted to see
how well Zeppeli has trained you.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.320
Did you say Zeppeli?!

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.450
I did. He is a dear friend who has been

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.320
through 20 years of trials with me.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.870
Indeed.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.780
I am Straizo.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.660
Look at this.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.080
A letter...

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:44.640
It's from...

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.670
...Baron Zeppeli!

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:52.230
He sent that letter to request our aid.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.350
He wrote about the location of the mask

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.680
and the man who bears it.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.210
This is our master, Tonpetty.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.200
A pleasure to meet you.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.580
You're Baron Zeppeli's teacher,
Master Tonpetty.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.230
Where I come from,
shaking hands is not a custom.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.100
We greet each other this way.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.450
And where is Zeppeli now?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.210
I see. Zeppeli has passed.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:11.710
Even if we had come earlier,
his fate would not have changed.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:18.520
But this Dio's power is overwhelming!
