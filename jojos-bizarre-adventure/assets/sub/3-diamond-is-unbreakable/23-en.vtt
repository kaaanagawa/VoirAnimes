00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.850
Look over here.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.360
J-Jotaro! L-Look!

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.980
Watch out, Koichi! Don't go any closer!

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.240
Hey, I told you to look over here.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.330
Is that his Stand?!

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.670
J-Jotaro!

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.780
H-He's here! He's taking the jacket!

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.390
Good grief.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.540
Who would've thought he'd 
come to get his suit now?

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.770
The jacket is evidence!

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.640
Wait!

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.600
Don't run after it without thinking.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.790
Something about that Stand...

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.070
is dangerous!

Episode 23    Heart Attack, Part 1

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.450
Centipede Shoes

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.420
It's a bomb... It's a bomb Stand!

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.060
So this is how it got Shigechi?

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.510
That's why we couldn't find him, 
no matter where we looked.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.740
He's... He's getting away!

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.680
Don't go after him, Koichi.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.290
Huh? Don't go after him?

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.810
What are you saying?

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.440
If we go after him,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.230
we'll get to see the face of the person 
who killed Reimi and Shigechi!

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.610
We need to cautiously 
observe and act, Koichi.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.770
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.740
We just happened to miss the 
name tag on that jacket.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.970
But considering how big the jacket was,

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.680
we can tell that the guy's 
about 175 centimeters tall.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.580
He's an office employee, and not married.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.920
If he had a wife,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.510
he wouldn't have brought his 
jacket here for a button repair.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.720
He's between the ages of 25 and 35, 
and he looks pretty rich.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.680
Judging from the material and design, 
that jacket was a high-end brand.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.200
Even if we don't follow him now,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.900
we've significantly narrowed 
down who it might be.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.630
I-I see...

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.740
W-Wait! That doesn't mean
we shouldn't go after him!

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.400
He's a murderer!

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.430
It's not that I don't want to 
pursue him, but we can't.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.830
Because that bomb Stand 
is somewhere over there.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.450
Huh?! The Stand?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.990
Y-You saw it?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.560
I didn't see it, but it must be there.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.000
Slowly walk outside through the door.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.080
It "must be"? Hang on.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.010
How can you know it must 
be there if you can't see it?

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.880
If he were the kind of guy to leave right 
after getting rid of the shop owner,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.370
then he never could've kept getting 
away with killing for fifteen years.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.550
He's someone who gets rid of all evidence.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.740
Which means he plans to get rid of us.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.560
Hold on a sec... Aren't you being too cautious?

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.510
If the Stand isn't here,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.690
the murderer must be far away 
with that jacket by now.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.920
Listen up, Koichi.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.420
Observing doesn't simply mean to look.
It means to look carefully.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.080
Look

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.240
Look
Carefully

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.430
It doesn't mean to just 
listen, but to listen well.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.820
Listen

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.860
Listen 
Well

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.080
Otherwise,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.430
we're going to die.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.940
H-He's sounding high-and-mighty, 
but my Reverb isn't useless.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.690
It's matured a lot, so isn't 
Jotaro underestimating me a bit?

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.810
I wonder if the bomb Stand 
is really still around.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.920
If it's not, we're gonna look really stupid!

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.080
Look over here.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.580
I-It's really here!

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.620
I-If I keep touching it, it'll explode!

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.960
Star Platinum!

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.770
After all those hits I landed... 
This thing's pretty hard.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.940
It's going to explode!

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.320
Star Platinum! The World!

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.670
I hate doing anything that's tiring, 
so I'm going to destroy you now.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.640
Y-Yes! You must have stopped time.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.640
Now no matter how much we 
touch it, it won't explode!

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.570
I will make sure the people searching for me

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.770
die in an explosion.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.580
My Deadly Queen's Heart Attack 
always gets its prey, no matter what.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.360
I-Impossible! It wasn't destroyed 
by Star Platinum's power!

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.960
A-A Stand that's this hard... Impossible!

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.480
Stay back, Koichi.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.850
It's still perfectly fine! 
It hasn't slowed down at all!

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.600
Get back, Koichi!

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.210
Y-You've hit it so much that you're hurt,

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.540
but it hasn't sustained any damage!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.340
Get further back, Koichi!

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.630
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.450
What are you doing?!

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.310
It'll explode if you're touching it! 
Let it go, quickly!

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.090
Look over here.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.360
Good grief. I've never met 
such a sturdy Stand.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.750
I think my confidence is going to break first.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.820
J-Jotaro, at this rate, 
it's going to blow us up!

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.590
You need to get further away.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.890
This time, I'm going to take it apart for sure.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.860
I-I'd like to say something.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.820
A Stand controlled from far away

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.100
doesn't move with that much power.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.430
But that thing's power and explosive attacks...

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.600
The power behind those explosions wouldn't 
be possible if the user wasn't nearby.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.340
The user should be within fifteen... 
no, ten meters of here!

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.350
And?

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.680
"And"?! It's ten meters!

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.900
My Reverb has a range of fifty meters!

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.370
It can find the culprit!

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.230
I told you, Koichi. Don't go after him.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.820
You just need to think about protecting 
yourself with your Reverb.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.520
Don't do anything else.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.380
Wh-Why?!

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.370
The culprit is no longer nearby.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.590
This is a remotely controlled Stand.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.200
I've had many encounters with 
various Stands, so I know.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.890
Look over here.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.400
Its actions are too simple for it 
to be controlled from nearby.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.400
You know from experience?

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.240
That's not logical at all!

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.590
There's no way a Stand that powerful 
can be controlled from far away.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.820
The user has to be close by!

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.230
So Jotaro really is underestimating me.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.350
I've grown, too!

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.250
I can find the culprit and defeat him, too!

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.630
Distance, ten meters.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.010
H-He's there! That's him! He has the jacket!

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.120
But something's weird... 
H-He's too far away.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.560
He's more than fifty meters away...

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.470
And he's only getting further away.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.560
He's outside Reverb's range!

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.610
Th-The bomb Stand is being 
controlled from far away?

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.640
That's impossible!

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.420
Having that power and being 
that far away is inconceivable!

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.540
Look over here!

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.790
Wh-What? It's heading toward me?!

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.890
I figured it out.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.670
That Stand goes after things 
with higher temperatures first.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.160
That's why it's so powerful, 
despite being controlled from far away.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.540
Bring out Reverb and protect yourself!

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.790
Even if I stop time, you're too far away!

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.310
C-Crap!

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.810
Reverb is...

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.970
fifty meters away, where the culprit is!

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.820
I'm sorry!

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.690
Good grief.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.700
Star Platinum! The World!

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.710
The reason this thing attacked 
the shop owner first

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.490
was because he had a hot drink.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.280
And it targeted Koichi because

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.580
his body temperature rose
from being so worked up.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.850
If there's something hotter, 
it should go toward that.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.050
Time has begun to move again.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.170
I was right.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.320
It goes after things with the 
highest temperature first.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.070
I'm saved...

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.790
But if body temperature is 
enough to make it explode,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.450
then when it's near fire...

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.070
This power...

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.330
Huh?!

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.920
Jotaro!

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:50.350
H

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.430
He

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.520
Hea

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:50.600
Hear

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:50.730
Heart

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:50.810
Heart A

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.890
Heart Att

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:50.980
Heart Atta

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.060
Heart Attac

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.980
Heart Attack

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:51.730
Yoshi

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:51.810
Yoshikage

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:51.940
Yoshikage Ki

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.980
Yoshikage Kira

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.530
How could this happen?
This is all my fault, Jotaro!

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.280
This happened because I went after the culprit.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.830
If he hadn't caused the fire for my 
sake, it wouldn't have gotten him!

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.040
Wake up, Jotaro!

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.360
Jotaro! Jotaro!

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.880
That explosion wasn't a human!

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.750
Look over here.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.380
It's going to deal the final blow!

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.570
It's too strong!

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.140
It's just like Jotaro said!

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.500
It'll attack something that's hotter 
than body temperature first.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.500
Look over here.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.610
I have to take this chance to run!

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.760
I want to call Josuke.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.390
He'll fix Jotaro!

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.510
I have to call him!

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.140
This is... the kitchen!

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.060
There's plenty of heat here!

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.020
I need to buy some time 
and run out that door.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.400
There's a phone!

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.600
W-Wait a sec! It's not a gas stove!

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.250
Why does this house have an electric stove?!

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.340
It's going to take some time to warm up!

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.170
The oven's electric, too!

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.340
Wh-What should I...

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.670
I know! There should be some hot water.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.670
Go over there!

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.220
It's empty!

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.520
Look over here.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:17.010
Wait. If I observe carefully, like Jotaro said...

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.580
This thing has a weakness!

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.130
A weakness I didn't notice earlier!

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.570
And I'm starting to get pissed off.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.710
Why do I have to regretfully run away

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.600
in fear from a murderer, like, 
"Please, God, save me"?

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.480
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.450
Why do I have to think that I'd rather

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.690
be looking for a public restroom while

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.250
I have diarrhea if I could only get 
out of this situation safely?

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.610
Isn't something wrong?

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.870
The one who should be 
running away in fear...

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.790
is you, murderer!

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.250
It always attacks based on temperature...

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.680
But that's exactly what your weakness is!

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.340
The fact that you never give up 
on that is your weakness!

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.640
It's been almost three minutes.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.280
I don't know what's going 
on at that shoe store,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.900
but there's one thing I can say with 
more faith than anything in this world.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.860
Heart Attack has no weaknesses.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.400
It'll track down its target, no matter what.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.780
Now, then... Since that's over with, 
I have to call Josuke on the phone.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.660
He should be home now...

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.670
Sizzle

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.470
Now that thing's lost track of us.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.680
Keep chasing after the word "sizzle" forever...

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.410
Just like a donkey chasing after a 
carrot hanging in front of its face.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.250
That's what your weakness is.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.690
Hello, Higashikata residence.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.570
Josuke, this is Koichi! There's trouble!

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.780
Jotaro is hurt bad, and it's my fault. 
Please hurry and get here!

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.440
What?! Don't say that so suddenly!

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.900
I don't get what you're talking about!

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.480
Just hurry up and get over here. 
It finally happened!

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.310
We encountered the murderer!

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.600
I've captured his Stand here.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.670
What did you capture?!

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.800
Say it so I can understand! Where are you?

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.080
Wh-What's happening?

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.830
Ow, hot! I turned it off, but now 
it's getting hotter and hotter.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.740
What's with this piece of crap?

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.200
How can you cook anything good with this?!

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.110
Hey! I'm asking you where you are, Koichi!

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.510
Look over here.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.490
Crap! It's ignoring the 
letters and coming this way!

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.200
Koichi, where are you? 
Hurry up and tell me, you dumbass!

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.870
I'm at Centipede Shoes! Hurry!

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.540
Crap, Reverb's tail letters also...

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.220
Reverb's tail letters got destroyed!

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.640
The damage...

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.350
That explosion wasn't a human.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.280
Look over here.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.060
A-Again! It's coming after me again.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.710
But I can't use the tail letters anymore.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.320
Wh-What am I going to do?

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.360
How can I fight it?

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.580
Reverb Act 2!

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.790
What's wrong, Reverb Act 2?!

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.540
Act 2!

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.020
Where are you, Act 2?! 
Why won't you come?!

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.770
Act 2 was killed in the explosion!

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.940
It's split in two!

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.710
N-No, wait...

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.950
If the explosion killed it, I'd be 
dead too, because I'm the user.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.790
N-Now I remember! It looked 
like Reverb died once before, too.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.760
A-And then...

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.420
C-Could it be...

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.800
Boooom

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.930
Reverb Act 3!

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.930
Um, is that who you are, sir?

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.430
Please give me orders.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.110
D-Does this mean I've grown?!

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.070
You're amazing, Act 3!

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.590
Please give me orders.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.570
Er, I don't know what your 
powers are, so... F-For now...

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.580
Please protect us, Act 3!

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:12.460
Um, protect us, please. 
You can do that, right?

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.090
Understood.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.380
This air pressure!

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.010
Th-This Stand has incredible speed!

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.930
It has way more speed than Act 1 and Act 2!

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.320
Snap

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.240
Special move: Reverb Act 3 Freeze!

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.950
Kerbam Bam

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.080

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.540
<c.colorc8018b>Crash</c>

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.110
H-Hey, Act 3?!

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.110
It's too strong. I can't.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.530
You can't?!

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.800
This enemy has a seriously heavy power.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.030
S-H-I-T.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.810
I pushed, but I lost.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.700
You pushed and lost? You can't be serious!

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.810
I'm telling you to protect us!

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.610
I have finished protecting us,

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.320
just like you ordered.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.570
Look over here.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.910
You finished?! In what way?!

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:30.080
You're completely useless! 
We haven't grown at all!

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.340
Look over he—

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.470
Wh-What?

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.640
This is taking far too long.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.380
Why is Heart Attack taking so long?

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.400
Wh-What's going on? My left hand just...

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.430
My left hand that released 
Heart Attack just suddenly...

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.130
Sir, what's wrong? Are you all right?

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.220
Oh, it's nothing. 
Allow me to pay for the cup.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.170
I'll be leaving, so can I get my check?

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.170
Th-This is...

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.420
M-My left hand... is heavy!

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.670
S-Sir?

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.970
I-Impossible! My left hand! My left hand...

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.130
It feels like there's a 40 
or 50 kilogram weight on it.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.480
What's going on over there?

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.570
Sir, are you all right?

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.270
D-Don't mind me.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.270
Please, allow me to give you a hand.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.270
It's heavy!

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.030
What are you doing, sir? How could you?

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.950
It's sunken into the pavement 
and having a hard time moving...

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.290
Act 3! What did you do? This power...

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.780
3 Freeze!

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.290
I've rhymed "three" and "free."

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.350
Act 3, what is this power?

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.480
Why is it moving slower? Tell me.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.550
There's really nothing to explain about it.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.100
It's heavy...

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.850
For whatever reason, 
Heart Attack has gotten heavy.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.930
This isn't good. I need to retrieve it.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.590
I have to go retrieve Heart Attack myself.
