Memo

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.320
Good morning.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.330
This is Kosaku Kawajiri.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.410
I realize this is selfish of me,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.330
but I will be around fifteen 
minutes late to the office.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.080
Yes. I have to discipline 
my unreasonable son.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.090
Yes, sir. I realize this would sound 
highly trivial to anyone else. Yes.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.370
I am terribly sorry.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.530
Yes, as soon as I'm done.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.970
Yes, I'll head right to the office.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.100
Yes.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
Yes. If you'll excuse me, sir.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.340
Curse that Kosaku Kawajiri 
being so apologetic.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.730
Did you want to climb the 
corporate ladder that badly,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.820
despite how anxious you were?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.910
The reason Josuke went into that house

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.420
is because he knew he'd have the upper 
hand in a close-quarters battle.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.920
I will admit that's true.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.620
It's best that I avoid close-quarters 
combat with Shining Diamond.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.460
If I can figure out just where Josuke is,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.240
I can shoot an air bullet from here, but...

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.820
Hey, you.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.940
What do you think you're 
doing on this property?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.570
What? Are you saying you're 
not on this property?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.210
Don't get nitpicky with me, 
Mr. Goody Two-shoes.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.700
Is this your house?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.320
How long have you been watching?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.580
Hey, I'm the one asking the questions here.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.130
I live next door.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.660
I was thinking about sleeping past noon

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.330
when I was woken up by some kind of noise.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.970
You make me suspicious.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.080
Rio, from next door, said her 
underwear gets stolen all the time.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.990
And since everyone's 
gone around this time...

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.660
I'm envious...

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.690
Huh?

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.520
Of all the free time you seem to have.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.980
Hey, are you running away?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.070
Damn him... Going after Rio like that.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.090
Pisses me off!

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.860
He was an underwear thief after all!

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.910
These panties...

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.800
Th-They're Rio's...

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.520
P-P-Pan...

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.690
Woohoo! I'm so lucky!

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.530
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.530
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:24.100
Episode 38   Shining D (Diamond) is Unbreakable, Part 2

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.080
I-It's no use! The phone line's been cut!

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.660
Okuyasu is dead...

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.780
I'm going to beat the crap out of

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.000
Yoshikage Kira with my Shining 
Diamond and defeat him.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.930
I'm going to end this within a few minutes.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.440
Hayato, stay along the wall there 
so that Kira can't see you.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.950
Where is he...

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.340
going to enter from... is the question.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.980
Huh?!

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.880
Wh-What?

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.440
J-Josuke!

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.900
It's an air bullet!

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.990
There's one heading toward you right now!

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.600
It's about the same size as earlier...

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.620
B-But that's impossible!

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.120
There's no way he can tell 
where you are from outside!

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.370
How does he know?!

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.130
Great...

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.910
I know, Josuke Higashikata...

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.430
I know the exact distance.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.180
Three meters until impact...

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.560
I... I can tell...

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.700
We can tell where the ball of air is.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.650
Yes!

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.150
You'll be able to dodge it!

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.620
No matter how many come through, 
you'll be able to dodge them... now...

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.220
What?

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.870
I-It's going after Josuke?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.260
Yoshikage Kira knows where I am.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Where is he? How is he seeing me?

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.170
There were no windows in that room!

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.990
The curtains are all drawn, too!

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.380
There's no way he can see you from outside!

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.740
It's automatic! It must be 
automatically chasing you!

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.160
No, that's not right.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.360
The version of Deadly Queen that's

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.350
automatic goes after heat 
and is called Heart Attack.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.160
But... It's not going after 
the lit cigarette there.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.060
More importantly, if it was 
automatically tracking me,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.920
the air bullet wouldn't be 
able to go through the wall,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.790
and Yoshikage Kira plans to do the final 
detonation himself to finish me off.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.050
It's a mystery, but he knows exactly where I am!

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.300
It's getting faster!

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.980
Find Kira for me!

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.900
Find out how he's watching me!

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.350
I-I found him!

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.330
H-He's right outside the gate.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.610
Two meters until impact...

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.860
He's outside?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.570
I can't figure out how he's able to 
pinpoint your location from there, Josuke.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.950
Hurry and run!

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.950
That bastard! I don't know 
how he's watching me...

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.700
One more meter!

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.460
But I didn't want you chasing 
me in the first place!

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.790
Shining Diamond!

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.710
All right, it's going to impact on Josuke!

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.460
Detonate!

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.930
Yes! It was a direct hit!

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.220
Deadly Queen!

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.980
My, my, that was close.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.620
But I was on my guard.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.170
Your willpower to try to 
get one final blow in...

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.810
That's why I won't go near 
you, Josuke Higashikata.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.440
J-Josuke!

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.410
H-He's alive...

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:46.270
Hmph. It was a direct hit, 
but he wasn't blown away.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.610
There's a slight discrepancy 
when I detonate by hand...

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.340
But the damage is absolute.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.760
I can finish him off with the next shot!

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.570
W-We... We have to get away from here!

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.410
Y-You're pulling me the wrong way...

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.850
This is the opposite direction...

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.950
Not that way... It's the opposite direction!

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.640
I'm going to kill him!

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.530
We need to go in the direction 
of Yoshikage Kira...

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.080
My Shining Diamond

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.440
can't fix my own wounds...

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.320
But once my blood has left my body and 
hardened, it's just another object.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.720
It's no longer part of me.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.340
Therefore, I can gather it and 
stick it onto other things.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.620
So I stuck some inside a shard of glass.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.230
The rain stopped, and the blood 
stain on his jacket earlier...

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.060
should have hardened by now!

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.190
That's my automatic tracking bomb.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.280
Sh

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:58.360
Shi

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:58.450
Shin

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:58.530
Shini

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:58.660
Shining

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:58.740
Shining Di

00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:58.820
Shining Dia

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:58.910
Shining Diam

00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.990
Shining Diamo

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.070
Shining Diamon

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.950
Shining Diamond

00:09:59.530 --> 00:09:59.660
Jo

00:09:59.660 --> 00:09:59.780
Josuke

00:09:59.780 --> 00:09:59.910
Josuke Higashi

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.950
Josuke Higashikata

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.460
The shard of glass that I was 
able to guard against...

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.480
It must be this blood stain...

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.470
This stain must have led that 
glass shard right to me!

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.990
I-It was a direct hit!

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.490
It's embedded right into Kira's back!

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.400
That's...

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:36.570
Josuke Higashikata's Shining Diamond is 
a Stand whose actions I can't foresee...

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.490
But the damage Josuke sustained 
is greater than mine.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.170
Just one more shot!

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.830
One more shot and I, 
Yoshikage Kira, will be victorious!

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.960
I-It's here! Th-This one's big enough to see!

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.840
That must mean...

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.440
that this is his final shot.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.600
This will be mine, too!

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.050
I-I don't think the same attack 
will work twice on Kira!

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.980
He'll dodge it!

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.600
We'll just have to see about that...

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.070
By the way, Hayato, sorry,

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.550
but the lighter from earlier is in my pocket.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.340
Could you get it for me?

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.200
It's a bit hard for me 
to get it myself with

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.700
this pole sticking out of my stomach.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.730
The smoke is useless now!

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.370
You can see the air bullet!

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.630
The air bullet isn't what I want to 
use the lighter to see this time.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.520
I'm going to look at something else... So...

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.270
Let's find out why he can see where I am.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.390
Don't move, Hayato.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.120
J-Josuke? Wh-What are you...

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.480
Stay still, Hayato.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.280
He might not be watching...

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.910
He might be listening.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.610
Kira had a cell phone.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.040
Did he just happen to have it? No!

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.600
So then, who was he talking to?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.290
Was it his boss from the office? 
No, that's not right.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.960
There's only one person that Kira 
would be calling right now...

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.490
I'd completely forgotten about you, 
old man in the picture...

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.230
The one who's trying to 
protect Yoshikage Kira!

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.650
I have no idea when he got 
inside my pocket, but...

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.110
So this was the answer!

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.160
Th-The air bullet passed through the window!

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.540
Get back!

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.170
It impacted!

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.720
Josuke... is running away three meters ahead.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.990
Sh-Shit!

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.930
I-It passed him!

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:14.010
And he's now moving diagonally 
right, then up... Three meters.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.770
He hasn't figured out that it's Josuke 
because he's using a raspy voice!

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.110
And now, he's running away 
one meter to the left...

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.590
What?! How can you do that, you bastard?!

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.620
Right there. Detonate!

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.790
Yoshikage!

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.950
I did it! Josuke's been 
blown away, hasn't he?

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.170
Yeah, he was gloriously blown away.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.760
All the way to Hell, with my directions.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.540
Though, I mean, he was 
a ghost to begin with,

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.060
so it's more like he finally made it over.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.610
Josuke...

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.490
J-Josuke!

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:16.210
Th-This must be some kind of mistake...

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.220
Something this horrible...

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.220
should not be happening in my life...

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:31.970
when I just want to live 
as peacefully as a plant...

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.970
But what I mustn't forget 
at times like these

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.210
is that it's in times like these,

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.980
horrible times like these,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.980
that opportunities present themselves.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.090
I've learned that in the past.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.540
When I'm backed into a corner, 
if I think things through rationally,

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.200
opportunities will make 
themselves available!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.650
I, Yoshikage Kira, have always done this.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.480
There is no trouble that I was

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.440
unable to overcome...

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.710
Ever!

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.390
You're within my range...

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.760
Yoshikage Kira!

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.620
H-He's near him!

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.990
H-He finally got near him!

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.530
This is a close-quarters match, 
and it'll be over in an instant.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.130
Josuke's ability is greater,

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.750
b-but if Kira touches him,
he'll be turned into a bomb!

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:51.630
A-And the wounds in Josuke's 
leg and torso from that blast...

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.310
Josuke, you shouldn't even 
be able to stand right now.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.810
Josuke Higashikata!

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:05.610
Bring out... your Deadly Queen...

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.830
Deadly Queen!

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.310
H-He's strong...

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.820
I'm going to be defeated...

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.190
I, Yoshikage Kira, am going to be defeated!

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.680
N-No... How could...

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.700
We were so close! 
Josuke is stronger than him!

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.460
Is fate really on the side of that murderer?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.250
M-My fists didn't hit him...

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.580
These air bullets acted like cushions!

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:18.040
B-But it wasn't my intention 
to have it guard me...

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.850
I didn't have time for that!

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.020
Stray Cat!

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.800
I see... Stray Cat thought 
it was being attacked,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.020
so it instinctively blocked the attack!

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.600
This is my chance! This is that chance!

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.660
A opportunity has presented itself 
at the worst of times, after all!

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.340
Deadly Queen!

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.240
Change that air bullet into a bomb!

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.160
I've won!

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:46.390
I've changed it into a contact bomb!

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.130
It'll explode if anyone touches it.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.330
Josuke, with the damage you're 
currently suffering from,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.920
you won't have the strength to dodge this!

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.010
Yoshikage Kira!

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.180
It's a contact bomb?!

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.910
Josuke! It doesn't matter 
if it's glass or wood!

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.040
Hit that and take cover!

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:14.030
I've won! This always happens 
when life deals its worst to me!

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.780
Luck is on the side of Yoshikage Kira!

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.450
Wh-What?!

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.920
Th-The air bullet went off its course!

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.090
Y-You're...

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.460
You're...

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.970
You're...

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.470
O-Okuyasu!

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:45.100
You know, I always wonder

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.980
where all the stuff I scrape 
away with The Hand goes.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.260
Though I'm not really smart,

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.320
so whenever I think too much 
about anything, I get a headache.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.130
There.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.570
What?!

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.660
I-I can't believe it... I-It's Okuyasu.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.530
But his heart and breathing 
had completely stopped...

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.330
I had a weird dream...

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:18.220
While I was walking amid the darkness 
in that dream, I saw a light.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.010
And I saw my dead brother...

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.140
My big brother, Keicho.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.400
He asked me where I was going,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.400
so I said that I was going to follow him.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.530
I mean, my Bro was always reliable.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.410
He never made any bad decisions, 
so I'd have nothing to worry about.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.870
But then he said I should decide for myself.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.600
He said, "Okuyasu, you're the one who 
has to decide where you're going to go."

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.670
I thought for a bit,

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.370
and answered that I was going back 
to Morioh, and then I woke up.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.760
It was a really sad dream.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.440
Okuyasu...

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:17.270
Y-You've got some nerve, 
dreaming at a time like this!

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.000
There's that lousy attitude! 
Despite your wounds,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.500
you seem pretty okay.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.020
Shut up!

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.790
If you were alive, you should 
have woken up sooner, damn it!

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:37.830
I-Impossible... Fate should 
have been on my side...

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.800
I should have been given my opportunity!

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.050
Stray Cat! Shoot another shot!

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.390
Wh-What?!

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.400
Wh-Wh-Whoa... Whoa, there.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.900
Y-Yes! Now Kira won't be able 
to use his air bullet bombs!

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.100
Th-Th-There's...

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:15.140
There has never been any trouble that I, 
Yoshikage Kira, was unable to overcome!

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.380
Look, Jotaro!

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.480
That loud sound must've 
come from that house.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.130
I wonder what happened. Was it a gas explosion?

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.640
L-Look! That man is injured!

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.290
Josuke and Okuyasu are there, too!

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.200
That kid is Hayato Kawajiri from the picture.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.670
And that man is Kosaku Kawajiri.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.410
It looks like everything's falling into place.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.500
Any fate that would side with you...

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.500
Any opportunity that would come your way...

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:09.180
is nothing compared to the heart 
of justice that's here right now!

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:14.480
It's definitely here! It's right here for sure!

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.990
Compared to that heart, you're nothing!

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.460
