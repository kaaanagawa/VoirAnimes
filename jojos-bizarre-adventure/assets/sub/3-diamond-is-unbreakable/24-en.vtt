WEBVTT

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.600
Doing things that bring attention to myself...

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.290
That is what I, Yoshikage Kira, hate the most.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.170
And to think that I'm experiencing this 
humiliation in front of total strangers...

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.380
To think that the invincible auto-pilot 
Heart Attack would get caught...

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.550
Damn... I have to undo this spell somehow...

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.200
Hey, mister. You okay?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.170
You sick or something?

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.750
Want me to call your mommy?

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.270
It's nothing. Get lost.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.060
Hey, hey, hey, did you hear that?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.660
You seeing some sweet dreams during the 
day after drinking too much, mister?

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.110
Is it fun? Does it feel good?

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.850
Grasp

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.970
That's a nice suit you've got on.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.900
We've been fired and don't have any money.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.620
We can't even get any bitches.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.250
Seeing guys like you piss me off.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.760
At least try to defend yourself.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.390
Hey, mister. Your shoelaces are untied.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.050
I'll tie them for you.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.100
A square knot! That's super nice of you!

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.640
H-Hey, what's wrong?

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.260
Deadly Queen's first bomb.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.710
It turns anything it touches into a bomb.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.120
Th-The doctor! Call the doctor!

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.970
What a terrible day.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.230
Get me a doctor!

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.520
I just want to live a quiet life,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.800
and yet I had to deal with those 
two pieces of trash today...

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.700
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.700
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.460
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.460
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.250
Episode 24     Heart Attack, Part 2

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.460
Hey, Josuke.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.020
What the heck happened at Centipede Shoes?

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.480
I don't really know, but it wasn't good.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.400
Hurry! It'll take about five minutes.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.950
There are cracks in it.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.770
That means the bomb Stand's user 
has been damaged, too, right?

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.830
Please don't go too far away from me.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.910
My range is five meters.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.310
Act 3's is five meters.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.610
We have matured.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.820
We're even more powerful now.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.250
It can't be helped that my 
range is shorter than Act 2's.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.620
Gravity

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.940
If you move more than five meters from me,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:18.270
5 Meters

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.670
the weight on that thing will disappear.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.280
It'll stop struggling and regain its vigor,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.900
and rush toward us like a dog in heat.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.530
On the other hand, the closer you get to it,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.480
the heavier I can make it.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.900
What would you like to do?

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.580
N-No... This distance is plenty.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.280
I hope Josuke gets here soon.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.850
Apparently, a gym will be opening 
near Budogaoka High School soon.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.940
I was really considering 
getting a membership.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.910
I have to gain more stamina.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.050
But I wonder if I'll be 
lifting the same dumbbells

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.360
who've been playing with their dicks
after not bathing for a week,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.090
or getting in the same pool with them.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.880
It took me three minutes to get here.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.380
I felt my lack of stamina the most 
when I tried to cross at the crosswalk.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.260
By the way, who's going to show up here?

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.430
You called someone for help, didn't you?

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.890
Josuke Higashikata and Okuyasu 
Nijimura live the closest.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.830
It'll take them about five minutes, 
so two minutes to go?

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.740
You're their friend, aren't you?

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.620
H-H...

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.530
Yukako Yamagishi and the woman

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.960
who runs Salon Cinderella are also 
what you call Stand users, aren't they?

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.290
You wouldn't actually call 
a lady for help, would you?

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.620
H-He's...

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.220
I left my jacket with the button behind.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.170
I'll go get it later...

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.460
After I'm done with you.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.510
H-He's... right in front of me!

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.500
This man...

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.600
The one who killed all those people 
over all those years...

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.560
And Reimi and Shigechi...

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.370
Let him have it, Act 3!

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.930
Dogyuun

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.530
Deadly Queen!

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.000
Why does he have two Stands?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.170
I thought a user could only have one Stand!

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.170
Heart Attack is a tracer bomb that was 
launched from Deadly Queen's left hand.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.180
That's why the damage 
is only in my left hand.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.380
Warning, Sir Koichi.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.690
You have just left my range of five meters.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.820
The bomb Stand's weight will disappear.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.780
S-h-i-t. I'll have to attack 
it with 3 Freeze again.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.270
I see... Range, eh?

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.820
Who would you like me to hit?

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.420
The actual murderer, 
or that shitty bomb Stand?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.090
3 Freeze cannot make two 
things heavy at once.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.080
Even if we make the user heavier,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.850
the bomb Stand is on 
auto-pilot, so it won't stop.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.350
Even if we make the bomb heavier, 
the user will come after me.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.520
Which will it be?

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.310
Please hurry and give me orders.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.360
Which one are you going to attack?

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.650
S-Stop the bomb!

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.340
3 Freeze!

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.900
<c.colorf69d40>Ker-bam-bam</c>

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:06.040
It appears that, no matter who you attacked, 
you were still fated to lose.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.410
However, to think that Heart Attack, 
which I thought had no weak points,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.120
would be completely useless...

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.260
I had to pay some expenses at the café,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.080
then ended up in a scuffle with some 
hooligans. I feel like I've been had.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.620
This is the first time

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.450
I've ever felt so cornered.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.480
I even feel a slight sense of defeat.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.820
Goodness. I must show you some respect.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.570
You're rather impressive.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.700
By the way, do you have any pocket tissues?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.450
A handkerchief would work, too.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.400
Hm? I've shown you some respect.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.960
The least you can do is talk to me.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.430
I don't... have any.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.270
Then, here. Use mine.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.140
A lot of blood is coming from your nose, right?

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.730
It's just so you can wipe that off.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.570
I'm about to beat you to death.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.480
I have a little over a minute 
before your friends get here.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.910
Otherwise, I just won't be satisfied after 
having to face such humiliation in public.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.910
Now, now, stop screaming 
in such a weird way.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.610
I endured the same pain you feel now

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.980
as I was heading over here, but I didn't scream.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.760
You're a boy, aren't you?

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.510
You should take after me.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.580
See? You need some tissues now, don't you?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.760
I'll wipe it for you.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.270
They say your brain slows down 
when your nose is stuffed up.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:57.150
But you know, I was on the ground 
a little while ago, too, just like you.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.230
I'll blow you away with 
Deadly Queen in another minute.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.100
Until then, you need to be like 
me and just endure the pain.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.510
You need to be like me!

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.930
Y-Your name...

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.790
is Yoshikage Kira...

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.730
Yoshikage Kira is your real name...

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.310
My driver's license!

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.780
When did you take it out of my wallet?

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.080
You little brat...

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.730
You said you paid some expenses 
at the café earlier, right?

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.660
That's when I had an idea.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.560
So what?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.140
What do you gain from knowing my name?

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.170
You're about to be erased.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.570
Yeah, you're about to kill me.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:04.670
But even I was able to figure out your name.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.980
You're not that big a deal.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.060
You might get away for now, 
but how do you feel?

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.150
A little brat like me managed 
to find out what your name was.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.010
I'll say it again.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.410
A little brat found you out!

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.120
You're a complete idiot!

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.840
I'll be looking forward to 
seeing you in the next world!

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.420
You bastard!

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.960
Damn it! What is this sense of defeat?!

What an infuriating little brat.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.810
I still have a minute before
Josuke and Okuyasu show up.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:03.410
And I was trying to beat the crap 
out of him to calm myself down.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.750
He's got his socks on inside-out.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.910
Doesn't that bug him?

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.790
Ugh, it sure bugs me!

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.940
Not that way, Okuyasu!

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.660
But Centipede Shoes is this way.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.240
If we go this way, we'll get 
there in a minute! Hurry up!

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.640
Wear them properly.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.000
Now I can finally relax.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.570
And now I can blow you to kingdom come!

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.570
Deadly Queen!

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.410
The tip of this finger can 
turn anything into a bomb.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.290
I guess, in your case, I'll make 
your student badge a bomb.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.420
The first bomb!

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.880
Koichi, you were winning against 
that man psychologically.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.250
What?!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.100
Well, this is a surprise.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.540
I never thought you'd be able 
to stand with those wounds...

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.900
However, you would have been much 
better off if you had stayed down.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.500
I can almost see the view behind 
you through your wounds.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.840
That's a nice watch.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.660
But I'll break it so you can never 
see the time on it again...

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.210
By that, I mean I'll break your face.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.210
You seem like quite an interesting fellow.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.770
I'd love to learn your name, 
as well as various other things,

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.220
but I must take my leave.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.760
I only have twenty seconds left.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.980
I don't have time for idle chit-chat.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.870
Your Stand just now was very weak.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.250
I was easily able to catch it, like a pop-up.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:14.700
Do you really think you can defeat 
my Deadly Queen with so little power?

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.610
<c.color6389ea>Smash</c>

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.640
Wh—

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.170
H-He's fast...

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.250
Wh-What's with this speed?

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.470
Upon closer inspection... 
Good grief, what an ugly watch.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.970
But you won't have to worry 
about that anymore...

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.350
Because your face is going to end up

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.480
even uglier.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.740
What is this Stand?

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.870
It's so fast, it's like it stopped time!

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:10.340
Koichi, if it weren't for you, 
I would have been dead.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.320
You did well fighting all by yourself.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.220
You have my respect, Koichi.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.340
You've matured.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.240
Hey, Koichi!

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.600
Koichi!

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.210
Wh-What the heck happened here?

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.630
K-Koichi! Jotaro!

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.260
Be careful, Okuyasu.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:56.110
What the heck happened?! Jotaro! Koichi!

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.670
Calm down. I need to find out 
if Koichi is alive or not.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.570
If he's alive, I can fix his 
wounds with Shining Diamond.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.480
Yes! Jotaro is alive! Just barely, though.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.270
K-Koichi's alive, too. 
But he's not breathing!

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.830
Hurry! Hurry up and fix him, Josuke!

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.160
Hey, he's not waking up at all!

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.580
But I've already fixed him up.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.490
This is awful... Josuke and Okuyasu are here.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.370
He's hurt really bad!

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.210
It's gonna take a while for 
him to regain consciousness.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:26.820
What a day... I've never had 
such an awful day in my life.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.840
I have always been able to 
get through any dilemma...

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.920
I'm going to get away, no matter what.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.890
What are you doing?

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.240
Hey, he's awake.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.360
Hey, don't try anything funny.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.510
Turn this way slowly. Show us your face!

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.240
Be careful! Don't go to Centipede Shoes!

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.830
There's going to be some crazy explosion!

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.010
The owner just suddenly came flying out!

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.210
Those two, too!

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.790
An explosion?

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.050
H-Hey, calm down. Were you caught in the blast?

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.770
I'm just an office employee.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.810
But now I'm going to die... 
Look at all this blood.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.740
I-It hurts!

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.240
H-Hey, calm down. It's all right now.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.150
I'll patch you up.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.220
Where did you get hurt?

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.110
I think one of my ribs might 
have punctured my lung.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.060
H-Hurry up and fix me, please!

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.740
Hurry?

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.690
Oh? No matter how you look at me, 
I just look like a high school student,

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.590
so why would you ask me to fix you?

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.140
I have trouble just getting 
into pachinko parlors,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.260
yet I look like some doctor who 
graduated from med school to you?

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.470
You totally fell for it.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.520
You saw my Shining Diamond, didn't you?

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.270
Crap... I got too impatient.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.360
Which means you're the enemy.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.110
This was a draw.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.240
Th-This guy's the murderer?!

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.840
I guess this means I've lost.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.370
Yes, the one you're all looking for is me.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.790
My face has been seen, 
my Stand has been seen,

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.930
and my name has been discovered.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:37.130
It appears I won't be able to 
sleep peacefully anymore...

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.640
But only tonight!

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.140
Deadly Queen!

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.940
What the hell are you doing?!

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.770
Exactly what it looks like. I cut it off.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:58.740
I-It hurts... It's so painful, 
and I'm bleeding a lot.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.570
I'm even crying.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.380
But winning or losing means nothing to me.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.200
I'm going to survive.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.430
I'm going to survive in peace.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.830
I have to live with the fate of being 
unable to fight the urge to kill people,

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.750
but I will live happily!

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.720
Heart Attack, you are free!

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.480
I leave the rest to you.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.550
Protect me.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.890
What the hell is that wimpy-looking thing?

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.810
Josuke, that's a bomb Stand 
that goes after body heat!

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.690
And it won't break!

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.690
It's going to explode in reaction 
to your body temperature!

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.400
It won't break?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.720
Break?

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.930
You've got it backwards. I fixed it.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.250
If that guy left it behind...

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.050
This is a pretty gross idea, but that 
hand is heading toward the murderer.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:56.880
Let's go after it!

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.210
Yeah!

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.700
You're not getting away that easily, dumbass!

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.350
H-Hey, look at that...

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.850
Now I'll be able to sleep peacefully...

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.980
K-Kira? Why is your face all bloody?

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.740
Hello, everyone. Is it 
already time to head home?

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.370
I'm in a hurry, so I'll be seeing you.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.700
The murderer's name is Yoshikage Kira.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.890
His address is Morioh Kotodai 1-128.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.420
He's 33 years old.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.000
His Stand is a short-ranged 
bomb Stand, Deadly Queen!

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.140
Hey, where is that guy headed?

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.570
It doesn't matter where 
he's headed. He's finished!

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.680
He's in this building.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.270
Hey, wait... This is...

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.720
Salon Cinderella!

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.480
What's he doing here?!

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.530
A-Aya! Are you here?

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.820
Dr. Aya Tsuji!

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.630
A-Aya's...

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.380
Aya's...

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.840
What is this? What the hell is this?!

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.850
He's dead... Why is Yoshikage Kira dead?

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.370
Aya!

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.820
Th-This is...

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.440
What the hell happened?

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.860
Wait! That man isn't Yoshikage Kira! 
He has his left hand!

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.110
Huh?

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.370
He d-doesn't have a face!

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.300
What?!

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.200
He's missing his fingerprints on his 
right hand, too. Who is this guy?

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.480
Guy...

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.710
He's wearing the same suit...

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:07.220
He brought in that guy, 
and killed him in front of me.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.370
He's too terrifying...

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.290
He made me switch his face using Cinderella.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.100
And his hair and fingerprints, by force...

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.310
So he's someone else now?

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.440
Yes...

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.360
H-His face...

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:25.560
Shining Diamond!

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.430
H-His...

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.510
Josuke, don't touch her! Get away from there!

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:33.540
His face...

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.420
Aya!

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.800
On the other side of that door!

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.970
You're not getting away, damn it!

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.390
Th-This is...

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.660
I-It's time for everyone to go home...

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.480
S-So many...

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.150
Wh-Which one is he? 
Which one is Yoshikage Kira?!

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:15.050
Yoshikage Kira, you coward! Show yourself!

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.410
He managed to get away.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.490
He's not going to be quivering, or hiding.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.500
He's not even going to leave Morioh.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.600
He's going to live his life in 
this town, like he always has.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.850
Aya Tsuji: dead.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:34.380
Aya Tsuji: Dead

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:34.380
Yoshikage Kira Changes His Face, Name, and Address,
Becoming a Different Person

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:33.760
Yoshikage Kira changes his face, name, 
and address, becoming a different person.
