WEBVTT

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.110
What unbelievable luck!

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.230
If that coffee hadn't spilled this morning...

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.440
How... How is that possible? I...

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.140
You brat...

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.370
To think that you knew 
about Stray Cat, as well!

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.410
I guess it's futile.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.630
So long as I don't undo Bites the Dust, 
it'll keep automatically protecting you.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.790
I... I failed!

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.640
I-It's almost time!

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.530
The fact that you tried to kill me 
using Stray Cat's air bullets...

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.740
Hayato, you wouldn't have 
come up with that idea

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.730
if you hadn't repeated this morning 
three, no, four times.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.490
And the fact that you've 
returned for the fourth time...

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.830
It means that Bites the Dust's fate

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.120
is to blow up not only Rohan,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.210
but another one of his friends, as well.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.860
That means you must have told 
people other than Rohan about me.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.630
No... Perhaps you were just asked about me.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.500
Who did you kill?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.020
Hm? Was there a shrimp named Koichi?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.490
What about Jotaro Kujo?

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.980
I'd be very happy if he were to die.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.480
E-Everything's over...

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.070
Letting you return to this 
morning again is dangerous.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.400
Because I'll be attacked again.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.120
Once the others die, I'll undo 
Bites the Dust for a short while.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.720
Bites the Dust is invincible!

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.480
Luck is on the side of Yoshikage Kira!

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.390
That name... The name you said just now...

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.770
Oh, did I just say my real name?

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.090
Yes, my name is Yoshikage Kira.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.530
I don't care if you tell that to anyone.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.370
By the way, what time is it?

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.030
I...

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.350
I didn't tell anyone.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.790
I never said a single word to anyone 
about you in the first place.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.930
I only made a phone call.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.520
He said that he overslept and was late,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.270
so I found his number and woke him up.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.420
I made a call from the house 
this morning. That's all!

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.770
You're the one who said it.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.280
You're the one who said it yourself!

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.940
I was just waiting.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.680
I was just waiting for him to hurry up 
and get here without oversleeping!

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.950
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.950
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.610
Episode 37   Shining D (Diamond) is Unbreakable, Part 1

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.100
Hey, Josuke.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.800
We're gonna be on time 
to meet up with everyone.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.210
Hold it, Okuyasu!

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.930
I'm not sure if it's coincidence or fate,

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.010
but this guy just said a name 
that I can't believe I heard.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.050
I-I-Impossible!

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.570
You said "Yoshikage Kira" 
just now, didn't you?

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.020
Huh? What?!

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.300
H-How could such a coincidence...

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.020
It's no coincidence!

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.380
It's not fate, either! This was a gamble!

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.980
I made a gamble!

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.870
And he came!

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.630
I know I heard you say it!

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.990
You definitely just said that name!

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.780
It can't be...

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.940
You bastard!

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.320
If you just coincidentally 
have the same name as him,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.890
I can fix your wounds at any time.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.210
H-He's Yoshikage Kira?

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.260
Th-That's impossible... You brat!

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.340
H-How could this be?

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.310
I need to undo Bites the 
Dust and protect myself!

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.770
Return, Deadly Queen!

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.260
Cold... The rain is going down my back.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.170
Honestly, does no one show up on time?

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.720
Oh?

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.640
That's Koichi and Jotaro.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.270
Yes! I made it in time! I won against fate!

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.340
I don't need any intense joy.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.180
But I didn't want any 
deep despair, either....

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.700
My goal was to live a 
peaceful life, like a plant.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.710
You've shown yourself!

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.670
Now I'll make sure your face 
doesn't look so peaceful.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:45.380
I guess this picture that Rohan 
took was an instant jackpot.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.270
Looks like it wasn't coincidence 
that we ran into him, Okuyasu.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.990
I don't know the details,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.650
but since he gave his real
name to Hayato Kawajiri,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.820
we may have gotten here 
just in the nick of time.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.530
Just so you know, I wasn't 
running away from you.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.240
If I wanted to kill you all, 
I could have done so at any time.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:18.860
The reason I didn't was just 
because I don't like fighting.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.670
Strife is the exact opposite

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.500
of the peaceful life that 
I aim for, so I hate it.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.460
It's easy to win one battle,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.570
but then you accumulate 
stress for your next battle.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.180
It's a foolish thing to do.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.850
Fighting with others is a 
sad and endless process.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.600
We were coming after you because 
you killed Shigechi, you dumbass!

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.330
A pig bastard like you whose 
hobby is to kill people

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.320
doesn't have the right to talk about 
what he wants to do, you dipshit!

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.240
Be careful, Josuke!

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.790
Don't touch that shitbag Deadly Queen's hand.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.250
That's the only reason I 
didn't dispose of you all.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.350
You're the only three destroying 
my peace right now.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.800
I have no choice but to fight the 
ones who find out my identity.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.430
Hey, get behind us, Hayato Kawajiri.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.770
Shining Diamond's range is 1-2 meters,

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.730
and it has the ability to fix 
anything that's been destroyed.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.940
I won't need to use that ability against you!

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.530
I'm just gonna kick your ass!

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.000
Josuke!

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.870
Dora.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.330
He's strong...

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.810
Yes! I can't see it, b-but that's amazing!

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.840
Kira just spit blood and went flying!

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.670
You're moving way too slow, Deadly Queen!

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:04.140
I guess yearning for a peaceful life 
has left you lacking in motivation.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.000
Looks like your Stand isn't cut 
out for one-on-one battles.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.860
Josuke, don't let your guard 
down just because he's slow!

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.410
If it's best to fight him 
without touching him,

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.240
it'd be better to use my Stand, The Hand.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.210
Bring it!

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.100
Scraping away space to teleport, eh?

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.000
I attacked Josuke, but now the 
direction of my attack has turned...

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.550
Toward you.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.010
I-Inside my backpack...

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.020
What?!

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.040
Though I guess it worked out.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.360
It still hit right on the dot, 
despite being the first time I've used it.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.350
I-I wasn't touched... I-I wasn't even touched...

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.130
The air... The air breathed fire!

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.370
Okuyasu!

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.030
Th-The air... breathed fire?

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.080
The air...

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.010
The reason I kept that 
thing around was for this.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:22.350
I can use Stray Cat's ability to control 
the air for Deadly Queen's explosions.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.600
Hayato, You brought it for me!

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.270
Invisible air and an unstoppable explosion!

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.850
Could any two things in this world 
be more compatible than that?

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.240
He was keeping it just for this purpose...

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.560
And I'm the one who brought it here!

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.240
I said that it appears luck is on my side, didn't I?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.710
In Japanese, "fate" is written with 
characters meaning "luck that brings life."

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.470
How fitting.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.590
The

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.800
The Ha

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:54.960
The Han

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.920
The Hand

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:55.630
Oku

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:55.750
Okuyasu

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.880
Okuyasu Niji

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.920
Okuyasu Nijimura

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.990
Is something wrong, Jotaro?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.480
No, it's nothing.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.770
I just thought the rain 
sounded like Josuke's voice.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.060
I'm sure he overslept.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.590
If he doesn't show up in 
the next five minutes,

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.490
I'm going to head to Hayato 
Kawajiri's school without them.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.740
I'll fix you right now, Okuyasu!

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.580
That's not going to happen.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.440
Because I'm going to blow you away first.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.430
It launched air like a bullet!

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.490
And he turned that air into a bomb!

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.360
It's coming! You've got to run away!

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.870
You can't see it?

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.980
It's that area that looks distorted!

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.310
I-It's going to hit!

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.050
Fix?

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.320
He's trying to use that 
ability to fix Okuyasu...

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.830
The ability to fix things...

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.260
To think it's so fast that you were able 
to create a wall from the broken slate.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.160
I-It's shooting again!

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.830
I-It's coming!

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.760
Presumptions are more 
terrifying than anything else.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.540
Especially when you're
under the impression that

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.060
your strengths or abilities are impressive.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.660
I-It's starting to come through!

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.000
Even though it came in contact 
with it, it didn't explode!

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.660
Hmph. I thought it might blow his head off,

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.290
but it appears that the 
explosion was a bit shallow.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.180
Deadly Queen's explosions aren't 
limited only to things it touches.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.170
That would be a presumption.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.180
It can explode at any given distance.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.840
No matter where you might hide,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.310
or how fast you might try to guard 
yourself with a wall or metal plate,

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.880
it can go right through and explode freely!

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.060
You cannot run anymore.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.290
Die!

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.940
It's no use! There's no way to dodge it!

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.630
I can't run?

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.030
I have no intention of running away...

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.640
And I haven't from the beginning.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.700
Then I wouldn't be able to fix Okuyasu!

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.950
He's heading toward it?!

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.880
I-It went through!

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.760
You can make it explode at any distance?

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.510
Looks like there's an exception to that.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:53.150
If I happen to explode when 
I'm close to you, Kira,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.210
you're not going to be safe, are you?!

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.020
All right, Okuyasu. Now I can fix you.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.530
Don't touch him!

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:11.030
I think... he might have just 
used Okuyasu's body and...

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.790
Damn that Hayato...

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.000
Impossible...

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.040
I didn't see Deadly Queen touch Okuyasu.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.150
How can you tell, Hayato Kawajiri?!

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.300
You're not a Stand user!

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.450
I can tell!

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.400
I've lived in the same house 
as him until this morning!

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.270
I can tell by his expressions!

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.280
It touched him without us noticing!

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.350
There's no doubt!

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.810
Okuyasu's body's been turned into a bomb!

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.110
Yoshikage Kira!

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.930
I'm not sure...

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.180
Since you were charging toward me,

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.030
I'm not sure if I was actually 
able to touch Okuyasu or not.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.670
It all happened so fast.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.660
Should I just try pushing the button?

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.920
D-Don't, Yoshikage Kira!

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.570
Hurry up and shoot the next air bullet!

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.260
Shoot it at me, damn it!

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.050
There's really no need to rush 
into attacking you right now.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.740
Josuke Higashikata, I lose nothing 
by deciding whether to attack or not

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.270
based on your movements.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.540
There's a chance that Okuyasu 
wasn't turned into a bomb.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.530
You might be able to fix 
him with Shining Diamond.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.020
This might be too forward of me,

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.290
but there's only one way to save 
Okuyasu's life in this situation...

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.940
And that's for you to touch him and fix him.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:46.450
Even if I turned him into a bomb, 
if you touch him using Shining Diamond,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.950
you might die from the 
explosion, but Okuyasu won't.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.560
If you were to sacrifice yourself,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.140
you'd at least be able to fix your 
best friend's wounds, wouldn't you?

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.810
D-Don't touch him!

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.760
I'll wait until you make your decision.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.380
You can decide whether you're going 
to touch your best friend and fix him,

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.570
or come after me.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.470
I'll wait as long as it takes 
for you to make your decision,

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.920
but I guess there's no way you'll touch him,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.330
even if he is your precious best friend...

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.990
I have proof that you shouldn't touch him!

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.950
I'm sure he can't control 
more than one bomb at a time!

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.420
Once he's used his explosive ability,

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.560
he can't create the next bomb 
until the first one has gone off.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.160
As proof, he could be 
shooting off tons of bombs,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.120
but he's only shot off one at a time!

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.850
He changed Okuyasu into a bomb, 
so he can't shoot now!

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.940
What are you trying to say?

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.410
I'm telling you that there's 
a way to save Okuyasu-san!

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.190
And for that...

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.070
Deadly Queen, switch on the bomb.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.530
I just need to touch him!

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.790
What?!

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.930
H-Hayato, you...

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.840
All right! Shining Diamond!

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.640
You're insane, Hayato Kawajiri... 
You've got some guts.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.730
Are you really a grade-schooler, kid?

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:32.030
If I wasn't expecting you to use your 
ability to f-fix things, I couldn't do it.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.740
Besides, you can't die.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:40.100
If you die, he can easily kill me, 
and then he'll be free.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.600
He'll eventually kill my mom, too...

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.500
and other people in this town again!

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.780
No, you'll die.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.900
To think that your ability to fix things

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.130
is so powerful that it can fix what 
I've blown up instantaneously...

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.880
I've just been reminded that it's the most 
troublesome ability to have against me.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.680
Deadly Queen!

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.220
Josuke, he's firing!

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.940
I'll detonate it upon impact so 
you can't put your guard up.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:19.080
However, since there's a chance you'll 
dodge it if it detonates on impact,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.720
I shot a small one so it'd be hard to see.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.410
I wonder if you can dodge it while

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.250
holding Okuyasu, and with debris from 
the explosion stuck in your wounds...

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.530
Hurry up and run, Josuke!

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.420
If the explosion so much as grazes
you next time, it'll be fatal!

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.680
Okuyasu! I fixed your wounds.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.720
Wake up, Okuyasu!

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.880
Hurry and move! He's going to get you!

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.180
Eight meters until impact.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.100
Come on, you can wake up now!

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.000
You're totally fine now, Okuyasu!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.050
Josuke!

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.310
Just seven more meters.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.730
Just open your eyes, Okuyasu! Hey!

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.740
Hey, Okuyasu! Hurry up 
and open your damn eyes!

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.740
Hey! Let's work together like 
we always do and kick his ass!

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.870
Josuke...

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.580
I'm going to place that bomb 
right under his nose,

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.310
as precise as one of 
Joe Montana's touchdown passes,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.660
and then detonate it from there.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.750
Four meters until impact.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.290
L-Let go! If you don't run, 
you'll be hit head-on!

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.010
Okuyasu is... Okuyasu is already...

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.260
Shut up!

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.560
You need to hurry up and 
run away yourself, kid!

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.240
Two more meters until impact.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.770
The explosion will cover 
approximately a three-meter radius.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.440
I see it! It's about two 
meters in front of you!

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.110
Hurry up and run away!

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.450
Okuyasu... Okuyasu is already dead!

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.690
He's not dead!

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.200
Okuyasu is fixed!

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.870
He's going to open his eyes!

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.710
I'll get it one meter closer 
and then push the button.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.300
Josuke!

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.300
Splash

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.430
Th-The air bullet was split 
by a knife of blood!

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.470
Did the blood flowing through Josuke

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.890
just fly out with immense 
power and cut it like a knife?

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.270
That's it! Just like when I stabbed it with

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.210
the needle from the compass in the attic,

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.520
the air from the cat weed shrank!

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.250
He used the blood from his wound 
like a water pressure cutter

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.350
to cut through it...

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.610
But I wonder about the air bullet.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.320
It didn't shrink! It's heading toward you!

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.110
An air bullet that's become a bomb is

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.670
kept stable by Deadly Queen's abilities.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.470
That's why it won't shrivel!

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.510
No matter if you try to crush it 
or cut it into pieces,

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.640
the bomb ability won't go away!

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.330
It'll detonate as soon as you touch it.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.350
All right, impact.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.480
Huh? H-His body...

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.360
is floating?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.500
Detonate!

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.490
No, it's not floating...

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.610
I can't fix my own wounds with 
Shining Diamond's abilities,

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.880
but if it's debris from the road

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.960
that got into my wound 
in the first explosion...

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.880
I can fix that!

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.260
Th-The piece of the road that was 
in his wound pulled his body!

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:29.900
I don't have a choice.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.830
It's someone else's house, 
but we're going to run in here, Hayato.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.890
P-Please leave Okuyasu behind.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.110
If you're holding Okuyasu, 
you'll be killed!

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.070
He'll catch up and he'll get you!

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.910
Would you just shut up, Hayato?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.120
Okuyasu and I get along 
great. He's my friend!

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.690
That's not what I'm talking about!

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.870
When you fixed Okuyasu's 
wounds, he was already dea—

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.940
Stop!

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.170
Don't. Don't you dare say any more.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.620
Think about defeating him!

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.800
I don't like it...

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.600
If he didn't have that 
ability to fix things,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.050
my bombs would be invincible.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:16.500
The most terrifying thing getting in the 
way of my peace of mind isn't Jotaro.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.260
It's him!

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.030
Josuke Higashikata!

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.460
