00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.650
July 12th (Mon) 5:05 PM

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.360
Yoshikage... My son...

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.440
Where are you right now?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.470
I'm sure you've probably changed your 
face and name, and have hidden yourself.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.790
How pitiful...  And yet...

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.620
Right. We need to find out about any 
people who've gone missing recently.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.440
Including those considered runaways.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.760
Kira is probably hiding.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.610
Do you think he'd commit 
murders again in that state?

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.010
Serial killers like him can't easily 
keep their impulses in check.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.980
He will strike again.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.170
Are you sure we don't need to do anything?

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.740
We haven't been able to find 
a single clue about Kira yet.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.970
That's what I was thinking, too.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.780
But Jotaro said it was fine.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.310
He said he'll have us move 
when he finds something out,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.730
but until then, he wants us 
to continue being students.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.790
I'd rather look for Kira than study.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.540
We managed to corner him that one time,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.530
so it should be pretty easy, shouldn't it?

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.050
Kisara
Drug

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.090
Yes. As long as I'm repairing my house, 
I'd like to do some renovations, too.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.840
Curses! He's actually taking pictures 
of everyone to try to find him!

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.390
I guess I'll have someone come 
by to give me an estimate.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.440
Jotaro and all of his other Stand 
users are doing whatever they want...

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.570
I need to make a new Stand user

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.950
to take care of those meddlesome bastards...

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.950
Hm?

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.310
That's...

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.870
There's no doubt about it!

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.670
Even though his appearance has changed,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.610
our bond as father and 
son bring us together.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.250
There's no way I would mistake my own son!

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.970
I've found you, Yoshikage...

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.890
I'm gonna find out

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.850
who the guy disguised as my dad really is.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.350
It can't be...

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.410
At this rate, those Stand users will...

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.610
I won't allow it! 
I won't allow that to happen!

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.990
I will protect Yoshikage!

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.670
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.670
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.610
July 15th (Thurs) 7:50 AM

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.160
I'm heading out.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.330
I'm gonna be late... 
And I've got class duties today!

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.850
Episode 31    July 15th (Thurs), Part 1

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.470
July 15th (Thurs), 8:02 AM

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.030
So tired...

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.300
I stayed up way too late last night.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.620
I got plenty of sleep, so I'm 
in top shape again today.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.020
Look, Josuke.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.000
Binoculars.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.120
There's a pair of binoculars on the ground.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.390
You're so easily intrigued by 
things that are on the ground.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.050
Don't pick them up. They're dirty.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.800
What? Really?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.990
I am not dirty!

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.370
Hello, Josuke and Okuyasu.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.670
I-It was you? Don't scare 
us like that, Mikitaka.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.890
You're gonna give me a heart attack, damn it!

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.470
Oh, stop...

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.340
Don't get bashful. 
It's not a compliment!

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.590
Though, yeah... You showed up at a good time.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.190
There's something I wanted 
to get straightened out.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.960
The thing about you being 
an alien is a lie, right?

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.020
You're just a Stand user who 
thinks he's an alien, right?

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.100
Stop being ambiguous and 
clear things up, damn it!

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.220
I have been clear from the beginning.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.910
I am an alien.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.480
Why are you talking like 
that all of a sudden?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.960
That's enough.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.720
More importantly, what are you doing,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.230
turning into binoculars 
on the road like that?

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.040
Oh, yes. I wanted you two 
to look at that thing,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.910
so I was waiting here for you.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.530
That thing?

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.190
That thing... The electrical 
pylon right in front of you.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.170
Electrical pylon?

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.970
That's not really an electrical pylon.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.470
It's a remnant stripped of its 
wires that's no longer in use.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.890
When construction started on
Morioh's residential areas,

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.010
most of the cables got put underground, 
so these weren't needed anymore.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.210
What about it?

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.190
Are you trying to communicate 
with some other planet?

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.430
There's smoke coming out of the 
middle of that pylon, isn't there?

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.010
Huh?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.860
Y-You're right...

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.730
Please take a good look at it.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.960
H-Hey, it's a kettle!

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.590
What? In a place like that?!

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.800
It's, like, 20 meters off the ground!

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.470
Would you mind taking a look 
about five meters higher?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.060
What the heck is that?

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.390
L-Let me see, too.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.130
There! There he is!

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.550
There's a guy up there! He's cooking!

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.540
What?! Let me see!

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.930
He must be living on that pylon.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.600
He's actually making a living there!

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.600
He's fishing from the river, 
and even has cucumbers growing.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.330
That's really convenient!

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.930
I see! So it's basically a 
self-sufficient dwelling.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.840
Some people in this world
do very strange things.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.560
Look out!

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.440
H-He's...

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.710
It's a new Stand user!

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.200
Yeah! I just saw him fly!

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.790
But what's a Stand user 
doing living up there?

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.530
It would seem there's a need to 
find out more about that man.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.680
I can see them... They're finally here.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.470
Are they interested in me?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.520
Come on over.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.970
It's been a while since 
I've spoken to other people.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.410
Look. It looks like he sees us, too.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.070
Want to go over there?

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.470
Yeah, but be careful.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.980
We still don't know if that 
Stand user is a friend or foe.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.890
July 15th (Thurs)  8:05 AM

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.880
Huh? D-Do you need something?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.030
I'm in a bit of a hurry right... now...

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.080
Huh? Huh?!

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.240
July 15th (Thurs)  8:11 AM

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.470
Looking at it up close, 
it's bigger than I thought.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.390
You guys, stop right there!

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.720
Don't come any closer to this pylon.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.470
Huh?

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.800
Move back a bit more.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.310
I just relieved myself, so you need 
to step back, or you'll be in trouble.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.820
What are you talking about?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.210
D-Don't tell me this is...

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.620
I told you so.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.470
You'll get covered in feces and urine!

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.430
That's gross!

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.630
Gross? How rude!

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:46.040
I made it spray like that so I could 
fertilize the wildflowers over there!

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.960
I like to recycle everything I possibly can.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.240
On the right are Asiatic dayflowers, 
mountain udo, and watercress.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.720
They're all edible wildflowers!

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.890
Not to mention, if there 
are wildflowers around,

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.770
I can catch wild rabbits 
that come to eat them,

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.470
so it's killing two birds with one stone.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.810
So you really are living up there?

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.070
Doesn't this pylon belong 
to the electric company?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.160
What are you talking about?

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.570
This is my house that I 
bought with my own money.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.290
I bought this abandoned 
pylon for 100,000 yen

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.780
and made it my own ideal 
self-sufficient house!

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.110
Bought?

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.450
For 100,000 yen?

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.200
That's right. Just 100,000 yen.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.720
Because I'm self-sufficient, 
I don't have to work at any company.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.640
And even if I never leave here, I get all the 
exercise I need by moving around the pylon.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.180
Take a look at this spectacular view.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.360
Huh? W-Wait a minute.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.100
Even if you never leave? Just how long 
have you been living on this pylon?

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.100
Let's see... About three years now?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.720
Th...

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.060
Three years?!

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.280
I probably haven't touched 
the ground in about a month.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.730
H-Hey, Josuke. I had no idea that 
an idiot like this lived in Morioh.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.930
This guy isn't an enemy, 
he's just a damn weirdo.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.630
I don't think he's going to attack us.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.840
True...

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.890
I guess, for now, we can just 
head back and report to Jotaro.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.750
But...

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.540
Something's still bugging me...

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.010
July 15th (Thurs)  10:15 AM

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.390
What's he doing?

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.720
Well, I guess kids take videos, too...

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.670
But since he's hiding behind that pillar,

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.650
it looks like he's doing the same thing I am.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:43.110
He's following someone and 
recording their actions...

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.410
Could he be recording someone here?

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.280
Hayato Kawajiri

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.500
"Hayato Kawajiri," huh...

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.170
There's something strange...

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.250
about this kid.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.420
July 15th (Thurs)  7:33 AM

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.840
I'm home.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.930
Silence

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.530
That's strange.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.940
Josuke, you haven't left for school yet?

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.690
Josuke!

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.370
I'm hungry.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.480
Josuke, that bastard... This is so rude!

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.770
How dare he take a bite out of my favorite

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.180
Kamakura Custar and then put 
it back in the fridge?!

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.690
Not to mention, there should have been two left.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.440
That kid seriously pisses me off.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.920
July 15th (Thurs)  8:14 AM

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.770
Hey, something fell out of your pocket.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.240
Is that a photograph?

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.990
Would you guys mind leaving now?

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.910
You don't have to pick it up. 
I'll get it myself later.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.880
It looks like a Polaroid. 
What's he panicking for?

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.230
Seriously, it's okay! Just leave!

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.170
What?! You're...

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.380
Hey! J-J-Josuke!

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.250
You're Kira's dad!

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.930
I knew the ghost dad was involved in this!

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.470
So you've finally come in. 
I've been waiting for this.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.940
When you tell people to come in, 
they become guarded and don't come in.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.890
But if you tell people not to come in, 
they get pissed off and come in.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.910
You've finally stepped into 
Superfly, Josuke Higashikata!

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.990
Wh-What?!

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.660
Well done, Toyohiro Kanedaichi!

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.270
Well done luring that idiot 
Josuke into Superfly!

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.370
I commend you!

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.360
Something's not right! Come back, Josuke!

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.530
No, Kira's dad is right there! 
The arrow's right there!

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.880
You bastard!

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.380
Why, you—

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.200
What?!

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.740
You see, when someone enters this pylon,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.690
they can't get out until 
the next person comes in.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.190
If they try to force their way out, they 
become a part of the pylon themselves.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:24.420
That's my Stand, Superfly!

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.870
You fell for it, Josuke Higashikata!

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.170
Don't let him get away, Toyohiro Kanedaichi!

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.980
Josuke!

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:41.370
S

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:41.470
Su

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.570
Sup

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:41.670
Supe

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.770
Super

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:41.870
Superf

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.970
Superfl

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.960
Superfly

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:42.670
Toyo

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.750
Toyohiro

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.840
Toyohiro Kane

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:42.920
Toyohiro Kaneda

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.960
Toyohiro Kanedaichi

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.440
Josuke!

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.090
Damn it...

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.030
I said it was my Stand,

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:57.220
but Superfly isn't a Stand that I can control.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.690
It's actually an independent Stand.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.540
I can finally leave, now that 
you guys have shown up.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.990
Even I, its user, was held captive by Superfly.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.490
Well, good luck living here in my stead!

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.540
That bastard!

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.480
He must've been working with 
the guy in the photograph.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.250
Okuyasu, is there anything that I can do?

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.620
You'll just get hurt, so stay out of it.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.860
Your job's over.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.520
If you could actually turn 
into dynamite instead of

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.470
dice or binoculars and blow this 
pylon up, things might be different.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.710
That I cannot do.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.480
I can't produce any strength 
that isn't my own,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.380
and I can't turn into anything 
complicated like explosives.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.310
But I'd like to be of some use.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.630
Shut up.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.390
I'm telling you that there's 
nothing you can do.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.650
Leave the dangerous stuff to us.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.580
That bastard's starting to run 
away because he's convinced

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.480
that he's got him trapped in there,

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.370
but he must not know who we are.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.370
Hey. You gonna do this, Okuyasu?

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.910
I know you're up to it, too.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.410
What's the big deal about this pylon?

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.380
Let's crush it, Josuke!

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.300
Yeah. There shouldn't be an 
issue if I crush it and get out!

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.140
Watch it!

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.650
The hell? What's with their power?!

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.640
This thing's pretty sturdy.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.470
But if we keep attacking it, 
this pillar will snap in two.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.030
And look. It looks like that 
guy's about to fall off.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.610
Y-You idiots! How can you 
do something so terrifying?

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.320
Of course I thought about that possibility.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.100
But haven't you noticed?

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.930
This pylon is draining your powers and

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.170
distributing them throughout itself.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.080
Huh? What the hell is that idiot talking about?

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.360
Josuke, just a little more, 
and you'll be out of there!

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.650
Here we go!

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.180
Hold up, Okuyasu. Listen.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.440
Something's not right. 
What's that weird sound?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.830
It's the sound of all 
the power you guys threw

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.470
into the pylon, moving throughout it.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.320
What?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.550
And think about this carefully.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.600
You know that whole 
"law of conservation of energy"?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.330
Energy that's running around has to 
be able to escape from somewhere.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.340
So where's all that energy's gonna go?

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.910
It can't be...

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.790
Okuyasu, duck!

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.430
What?!

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.110
You can attack it all you want,

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:49.900
but all the attacks on the pylon are 
just gonna come right back to you.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.170
If you hit it, it'll hit back. 
If you cut it, it'll cut back.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.970
Just think about it.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.910
No matter who comes around 
with whatever kind of ability,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.910
no one can destroy this pylon!

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.420
Okuyasu!

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.790
Th-This isn't good, Josuke...

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.620
I couldn't dodge it completely.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.920
It ripped a hole in my side.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.450
I guess I should've warned you about that.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.890
And next, you're probably going to think

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.560
that if you defeat me, the user,  
you'll be able to get out.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.690
But that's futile, too.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.790
This pylon is an independent Stand.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.800
Even if I were to die,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.890
this pylon would probably continue 
to trap people inside for eternity.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.070
That's what Superfly is.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.960
Josuke...

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.080
For eternity?

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.170
But don't get too depressed about that.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.360
You just have to lure someone 
else in, Josuke Higashikata.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.350
If one comes in, one can get out.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:55.570
Just have some sucker take 
your place and get out.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.720
It's sort of like playing Old Maid.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.830
It's like human society.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.650
You just need to pass off the 
old maid to someone else.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.000
Am I wrong?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.730
Indeed, if someone else is pulled in, 
Josuke will be saved.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.830
Huh?

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.980
What?

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.780
You should be the one to return, 
then. Into the pylon...

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.320
you go.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.080
You...

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.830
Mikitaka! When did you...

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.720
Who the hell are you?

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.080
Why were you an electrical wire? 
When did you get there?

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.190
What the hell is that ability?

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.210
Why, thank you for asking.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.180
You see, I'm an alien.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.180
What?

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.680
Y-You actually can be useful!

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.660
Now's your chance. 
Please step outside, Josuke-san.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.890
Y-You bastard!

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.310
You have my praise, Mikitaka!

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.170
Josuke, hurry up and get out.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.110
Get out of the pylon!

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.530
R-Right...

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.580
I did it!

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.070
You bastard! What the hell?!

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.620
The guy in the photograph didn't tell me

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.080
that Josuke had a friend like you!

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.580
I'm an alien, so I'm unaware of 
this game called "Old Maid,"

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.610
but to suddenly trick Josuke and 
tell him that he cannot leave...

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.970
It's like an adult beating a child at a game

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.250
on New Year's by tricking them.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.810
This is why you should be the 
one to remain in the pylon.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.310
You will remain here.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.060
After all the time I spent 
living here, I ended up

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.610
with these thick calluses on my hands.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.450
There's a lot of stuff in here.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.410
Take this!

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.910
It seems you're under the impression 
that that's a part of me,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.780
but that is incorrect.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.420
That is not me,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.800
but the pylon's wire that you 
were hanging off of earlier.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.250
Yeah!

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.060
All right! Now, go to the top 
and come back out, Mikitaka!

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.070
You're the one who finally 
stepped into this pylon.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.440
Do you really think I'd let you escape?

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.780
I'm a man who has thought of nothing but 
getting out of here every single day!

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.780
Did you forget?

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.640
This pylon will return whatever you do to it.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.710
That wire's also a part of this pylon!

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.700
The angle at which the wire was cut 
was made so it would return to you.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.380
H-Have I been defeated?

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.240
M-Mikitaka! Hurry up and get out of there!

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.430
I can fix a wound like that!

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.970
Nope, he's not getting out.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.890
I'm the one who's going to leave!

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.450
The direction and angle are perfect.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.280
If you strike it, it'll strike back.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.830
Mikitaka!

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.280
Y-You bastard!

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.360
I went through some trouble 
getting out because of you,

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.050
but now I can get out easily.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.250
I'm sure that's gonna hurt when 
you try and pry those out,

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.060
but you'll have plenty of time to treat it later.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.130
There are some medicinal plants down there, too.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.870
You bastard! Do you think you can 
escape just because you're out of there?

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.850
I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth, damn it!

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.420
Of course I can escape, and rather easily.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.350
You guys haven't even been able 
to find Yoshikage Kira, have you?

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.690
July 15th (Thurs)  10:42 AM

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.490
Who is that? I've never seen him before.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.700
July 15th (Thurs)  8:14 AM

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:58.620
July 15th (Thurs)  8:14 AM

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.750
July 15th (Thurs)  10:38 AM

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.940
I'll find him out... no matter what.
