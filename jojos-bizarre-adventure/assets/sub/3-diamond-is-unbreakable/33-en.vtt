00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.040
There's nothing in there. 
Both pockets are empty.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.770
Other than this piece of paper...

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.510
The scent is no longer in the pocket...

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.410
Could it be...

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.140
It's just a plain, white piece of paper.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.630
What?!

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.670
Blam

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.970
J-Josuke!

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.680
July 15th (Thurs)  12:42 PM

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.730
Swip

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.280
Now you've done it!

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.050
You should really be more careful.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.360
I told you that the floor up 
here was burnt, too, didn't I?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.620
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.450
It's a perfectly fine back...

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.040
I-It's over... I'm finished...

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.530
I don't know why,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.240
but I have this fear that if 
someone sees it, it's all over!

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.590
H-Hey...

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.080
I'm already finished!

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.470
C-Calm down.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.770
I'm sorry.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.860
I just couldn't hold back my curiosity...

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.740
What?!

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.220
That's a Stand attack!

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.650
There's a Stand on his back?!

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.290
If there is, then even if I read 
him with Heaven's Door...

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.370
I see. No wonder there was nothing written.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.490
This architect had already been 
attacked before he came here.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.630
This architect was a victim

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.510
of the enemy Stand that's 
going to attack me.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.960
Carry me on your back.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.880
It's here! The enemy Stand is here!

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700
Carry me on your back. Okay?

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.470
Carry me on your back.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.070
On your back... Carry me on your back, okay?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.660
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

July 15th (Thurs)  1:39 PM

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.360
These are all the people missing 
from Morioh, including runaways.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.640
Episode 33    July 15th (Thurs), Part 3

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.130
These are all from after Kira disappeared, 
so there aren't that many.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.400
So there's a possibility that Kira's 
victims might be among them.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.250
I'm not sure about that, 
but the possibility exists.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.310
What's important is to not 
miss any of his movements.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.750
If a guy holding his breath makes 
even the slightest movement,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.540
there will be some kind of change.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.630

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.660
Carry me on your back.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.970
What?! I-It can't be...

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.110
Has it possessed my back?

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.020
Did it transfer to me because 
I saw the architect's back?

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.860
Damn it!

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.780
Burn the pictures...

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.500
Hey, burn the pictures.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.270
Pictures?

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.080
Burn them, okay? Burn away those pictures...

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.720
What are you talking about?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.050
The pictures I took...

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.990
Could it be there's one among them

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.080
that might get us closer to Yoshikage Kira,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.310
and you're here to get rid of it?

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.060
Just burn all of them, okay? 
Burn them away, okay?

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.520
Shut up!

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.400
Heaven's Door!

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.570
Let's see...

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.640
If I read about who you are 
and write in some orders...

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.740
Ow!

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.920
What?!

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.640
I'm a Stand that was born when

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.200
Masazo Kinoto's back was 
pierced with an arrow...

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.560
Cheap Trap.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.240
But my user now is you, Rohan Kishibe.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.080
You're my user now.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.930
Wha?!

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.090
Do you get it?

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.560
It basically means that you're 
using a Stand to attack yourself.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.470
You get that? Okay?

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.940
I'm a Stand with a will of my own.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.150
Even though Masazo Kinoto created me,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.750
he couldn't become a Stand user 
that could actually control me.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.300
He could only hear my whispers,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.810
and had only the fear that he mustn't 
let anyone see his back, okay?

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.010
Do you get it? Okay? Do you get it?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.950
Do you get it? Okay?

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.900
My ability is to just whisper to people.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.300
Okay? If you get it, burn the pictures.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.830
You bastard... Get away from me!

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.520
Damn it! Why, you...

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.190
How do I get you off of me?!

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.440
That's easy. You just have 
to show someone else.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.260
If you show someone your back...

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.620
Okay? I'll go away and transfer over there.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.300
You just have to show someone.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.110
Hello, Rohan-sensei!

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.330
I always read your manga.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.940
Next time, could you draw a nude?

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.730
A nude girl!

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.260
Bye!

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.650
Burn the pictures, okay?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.580
July 15th (Thurs)  12:47 PM

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.290
Josuke!

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.300
H-He wasn't shot.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.170
Y-You asshole!

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.750
Shining Diamond, eh?

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.220
Well, looks like it's just as I heard,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.930
and a bullet from a gun won't do much...

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.610
That was scary, right? 
Bite it, Josuke Higashikata.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.950
Bite your lower lip.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.130
Are you gonna bite it?!

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.490
Bite it! Come on, just bite it
and show me your sign!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.690
So this is his Stand?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.410
Pretty crappy-looking Stand, 
just like the old man in the picture!

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.320
Not going to bite it yet, I see...

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.870
Looks like he's covering up his fear with anger.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.670
I guess I have no choice. 
I'll have to show myself.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.970
You've got some nerve, you asshole!

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.660
This is it... This creepiness.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.000
He's been hiding all this time, 
so why is he coming out now?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.570
He showed up on purpose.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.360
He showed up on purpose 
so you would attack him!

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.160
He's dangerous... He's too dangerous, Josuke!

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.990
True... My Stand's ability 
might be a crappy one.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.060
But if I were to explain my ability to you...

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.400
I can make various things

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.230
into paper and file them away, 
and it's extremely useful.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.080
And this paper is Koichi Hirose.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.180
You bastard... So that's 
where you were hiding Koichi!

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.800
That's Koichi's scent.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.440
He didn't have something of Koichi's... 
He had Koichi himself!

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.700
He's alive, of course, because my 
Stand ability is a crappy one.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.790
I don't have the power or 
ability to kill someone.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.530
Though that's not the case if someone 
rips it up, like I did just now.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.250
I'll let you off the hook with just an ass-kicking

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.580
if you bring Koichi back here right now.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.120
Just try and get him...

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.070
If you can.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.280
Koichi Hirose

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.040
Koichi!

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.720
Because my Stand ability is a crappy one.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.410
I don't have the power or 
ability to kill someone.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.350
Though that's not the case 
if someone rips it up.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.280
That's the trap!

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.100
If it were me, I wouldn't 
go after that paper.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.440
Josuke, ignore it.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.090
You bit it! You finally bit it!

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.030
Misterioso was waiting for this 
moment, Josuke Higashikata!

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.830
It was waiting for the moment you bit your lip!

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.800
You bastard...

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.810
You showed your sign of fear!

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.740
No matter how you resist, 
once you've shown your fear,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.390
you're powerless before Misterioso.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.170
Thud

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.510
I feel bad for Josuke, 
but I'm glad I didn't help him.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.170
If I had helped him, that guy 
would have probably

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.270
gotten rid of me first, since I can find scents.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.180
Do you understand now that there's no power

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.040
in the world that can stop Misterioso?

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.380
Wh-What?

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.530
That metal rod is fixed...

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.850
He's trying to use that power to get out.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.200
That paper there

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.770
is probably not the paper 
that Koichi's trapped in.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:34.150
I knew it was just bait with the name
"Koichi Hirose" written on it.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.510
That's because the only reason you 
were confident enough to show yourself

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.710
was because you were holding 
Koichi as a hostage,

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.240
and it's because he's alive 
that you can threaten me.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.190
I knew that piece of paper was a trap...

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.320
It was, wasn't it?

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.770
But the reason I still tried 
to save that piece of paper

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.430
was because there was still a 
possibility that it was Koichi.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.140
If there's even a 1% chance that it's Koichi,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.890
then my only choice is to try to save him!

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.770
Misterioso, you win.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.580
Looks like this is as far as 
Shining Diamond's powers go.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.530
However, let me just warn you of one thing...

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.400
If you turn me into paper,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.040
you should immediately rip 
me up and get rid of me.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.460
If I'm able to come back 
from this, I will kill you!

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.460
L-Look at you, talking big...

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.350
You weren't a big deal at all.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.100
Koichi Hirose

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.640
Yuya Fungami, huh?

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.490
Not helping out Josuke was 
a very smart thing to do.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.120
I could have gotten rid of you easily.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.100
Your sign of fear is to poke at
your chin with your fingers.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.550
But the old man in the picture 
didn't tell me to get rid of you,

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.420
so I guess you get to stay alive.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.680
That's the smart thing to do.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.290
Want to hear something 
interesting about this paper?

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.650
Anyone can take out what's
inside if they open it.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.500
It's a very simple thing to do, but it's 
quite hard for someone who's in fear.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.780
To Morioh Grand Hotel.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:54.300
All right! We got rid of 
Koichi Hirose and Josuke Higashikata!

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.240
Right about now, 
Rohan Kishibe should also be...

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.160
July 15th (Thurs)  2:21 PM

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.000
Which is it?

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.720
Which picture has something 
to do with Yoshikage Kira?

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.090
Which picture is the old man in
the photo trying to get rid of?

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.470
Burn them, okay? Burn them.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.830
It's no use...

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.530
Right now, there aren't enough clues.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.820
So let's burn the pictures, okay?

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.480
Shut up! You're annoying!

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.140
Damn it! I have to let them know...

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.860
I have to let someone know about this thing.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:26.610
Mis

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:26.820
Miste

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.070
Misterio

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.030
Misterioso

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:27.740
Teru

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:27.820
Terunosu

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:27.910
Terunosuke

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.990
Terunosuke Miya

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.030
Terunosuke Miyamoto

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.950
July 15th (Thurs)  1:20 PM

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.060
Er, that was Morioh Grand Hotel, right?

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.540
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.200
Are you spending the night?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.340
No, there's a lot there, so...

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.430
A lot there, indeed...

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.410
No...

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.790
You won't be going to Morioh Grand Hotel.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.430
Josuke, you bastard! 
Trying to play it cool...

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.560
If, just if, as stupid as this is, 
if the one turned into paper

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.340
was one of my girls who 
makes me smile every day...

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.650
If it was any one of my girls,

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.930
I would have done the same thing!

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:14.250
Letting you or Yoshikage Kira live 
in this town would be totally uncool.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.020
Hand over Koichi!

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.970
What you're doing right now 
isn't the smart thing to do.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.310
So you're saying that you want to fight me?

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.630
You're saying that you're going 
to make Kira's dad your enemy?

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.390
Very well!

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.380
63, 64, 65 kilometers...

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:39.060
Though it lacks power, my Highway 
Go Go will never stop its pursuit.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.030
The taxi stopped...

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.780
Even though it's not at the hotel yet.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.160
No one's gotten out of the taxi yet.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.860
His scent is emanating 
strongly from the car...

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.880
But where is he? Where is he hiding?

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.720
The scent of this paper...

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.340
There's no doubt about it!

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.590
This paper smells like Koichi and Josuke!

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.640
Wait, Highway Go Go! 
Don't open the door just yet.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.910
That bastard is underestimating me.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.040
This must be another trap.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.350
So he's trying to lure me in, huh?

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.630
Very well, I accept!

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.120
I said I would do it!

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.900
He's after my fear.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.900
How is he going to try to scare me?

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.170
I need to find that out.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.660
What? What is this piece 
of paper stuck in the door?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.590
Underestimating me again. This scent...

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.430
This piece of paper is the trap.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.400
I figured out what kind of trap it is.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.300
Open the door, Highway Go Go.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.560
Foom

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.330
To think he can turn flames into paper, too...

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.530
But I saw through the trap!

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.400
Josuke, Koichi, I'll save the two of you!

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:15.210
But I smell something other 
than Josuke and Koichi...

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.660
This looks dangerous to 
just go ahead and open.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.090
What is this?

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.840
A scent I've never smelled 
before is moving around.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.170
It's faint, but it's moving 
inside the paper...

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.760
What?!

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.260
Crap! Highway Go Go!

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.920
Wh-What is this liquid?

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.850
I-Is it some kind of chemical?

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.410
Damn it, it's one thing after another...

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.810
W-Wait...

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.300
I smell iron from inside there.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:53.780
C-Calm down. What he's after is my fear.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.350
If he manages to scare me, he wins.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.870
Iron...

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.490
What is it? A machine?

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.250
Damn it!

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.290
I have no choice but to open it!

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.090
Josuke! Koichi!

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.090
Koichi Hirose

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.090
Josuke Higashikata

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.170
Th-That's an electrical current.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.730
He's even got electricity inside the paper!

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:20.180
The smell of machinery that I could
smell from this paper was...

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.100
A...

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:28.860
A shredder!

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.130
It won't turn off!

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.240
Josuke and Koichi are getting sucked in!

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.580
Damn it! Highway Go Go!

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.850
I-It's no use.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.550
Highway Go Go's powers can't 
destroy this thing to stop it!

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.490
Josuke! Koichi!

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.060
You finally touched it, Yuya Fungami.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.620
You finally got scared 
and touched your chin...

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.810
You look pathetic.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.930
It was so easy to scare you, Yuya Fungami!

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.750
There's no one that Misterioso 
can't turn into paper!

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.150
No matter who it is, it can do it easily!

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.320
Easy? That's why it's so great!

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.630
It turns anyone into paper instantly...

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.940
That's why it's great!

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.340
I lost. You really freaked me out.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.550
But I'll gladly declare my defeat.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.470
Because, now that I'm a
thin piece of paper,

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.550
I can stick my hand inside the shredder!

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.250
What did you just pull out?!

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.020
Don't you dare open up that piece of paper!

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:57.420
I'll gladly turn into a piece of paper.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.100
Josuke Higashikata

00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.920
Koichi Hirose

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.050
Yuya Fungami... You're...

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.330
actually sorta cool, after all.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.040
Josuke Higashikata... Koichi Hirose...

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.430
S-Stay back, Josuke! Look at this paper!

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.470
I-I'll rip it!

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.360
Yuya Fungami is in this piece of paper!

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.190
Act 3! 3 Freeze!

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.570
S-So heavy...

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.010
Let's see, what was it?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.200
There was something that I was 
supposed to remember about you...

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.440
Oh, that's right. I remember.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.430
I said that I would kill you.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.330
That's right... I definitely said that.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.770
I said I would never forgive 
guys like you, right?

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.940
Guys like you

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.230
who take hostages and try to 
threaten people emotionally...

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.280
W-Wait a minute!

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.470
I just liked observing other 
people getting scared!

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.060
I just recently got this Stand, so I got cocky.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.190
I-I apologize. I feel really bad.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.820
There's something I realized 
after watching you...

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.900
Huh?

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.910
You have a habit of closing one eye 
when you get scared, don't you?

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.430
That's a habit, right?

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.320
But...

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.350
When you're even more scared, you close both.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.390
You like observing? Then keep doing it.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.980
Quietly and calmly keep observing.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.270
I-I'm a book...

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.180
The Misterioso boy, Terunosuke Miyamoto,

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.650
became a book and is thus unable to fight.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.380
Josuke didn't read the contents of the book,

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.640
but the book is at Morioh Library.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.880
If you give the staff the title "Misterioso,"

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.520
they'll bring it for you, 
though you can't take it home.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.870
When reading this book, you sometimes 
feel like you can hear a voice.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.880
Well, that's that.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.870
Morioh
Library

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.780
Or probably not at all.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:27.140
Maybe this means that we're 
getting closer to Yoshikage Kira.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.760
Though we don't know anything.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.200
Curses... Those resilient bastards!

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.690
July 15th (Thurs)  4:10 PM

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.490
It's no use calling for help.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.490
Hurry up and burn the pictures, okay?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.280
July 15th (Thurs)  4:30 PM

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.180
All right, I'm heading out for a bit.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.330
Where are you going?

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.240
To find out what he's 
going to do even quicker,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.880
I'll check out the surroundings 
of the missing people listed here.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.010
People cannot escape the fate 
into which they were born.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.260
He'll definitely make his move.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.720
July 15th (Thurs)  4:52 PM

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.520
I'm going to film it...

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.270
I'll film the proof that Dad isn't Dad.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.950
No matter what.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.460
