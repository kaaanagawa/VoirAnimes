00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.490
Good morning! Greetings, all. 
This is Morioh Radio,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.520
and your host, once again, is me, 
your neighbor, Kai Harada.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.610
What a refreshing morning.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.810
And I have the perfect song 
here to start off the day.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.210
Here's our first song of the morning.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.710
Oh, there we go.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.670
We usually get good reception 
when we pass that tower.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.370
Is this your first time in Morioh, sir?

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.090
Yeah.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.720
What kind of place is it?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.310
Morioh? Hmm...

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.220
Oh! The beef tongue cooked in miso is good.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.360
Anything strange about it? Any incidents?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.500
No idea.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.980
Sorry, I actually don't know that much about it.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.910
Oh, where was I supposed to drop you off again?

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.550
In front of the station is fine.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.270
Understood.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.410
Good grief...

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.840
I just hope nothing annoying happens.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.010
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.010
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.670
In April of 1999, on my very first day
of high school, I met two bizarre men.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.480
Episode 1  Jotaro Kujo! Meets Josuke Higashikata

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.310
I finally start high school today...
I wonder what the people will be like.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.340
My name's Koichi Hirose.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.990
Though you don't really have to remember that.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.240
I was so nervous on my first 
walk to my new school that I...

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.730
Bam

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.800
Eh? H-Huh? That's strange. 
We just ran into each other,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.420
and the things in my bag flew out...

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.420
Sorry I wasn't watching where I was going.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.630
H-He's huge! He's over 190 centimeters!

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.610
I have a question.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.870
Do you know of a Higashikata 
household around here?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.360
Higashikata? No...

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.640
Then how about this address?

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.310
It's Johzenji 1-6.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.230
Jotaro
Kujo

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.230
Jotaro Kujo...

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.540
If you take the #3 bus, 
it'll get you to Johzenji.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.570
If you wait a little while, it'll get here soon.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.820
Thanks.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.390
The first guy was this man, Jotaro Kujo.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.270
I found this out later, but he's 28,
and he's a marine explorer.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.270
He's famous in the scientific world 
for his ecological research.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.660
He seems really wild, but 
intelligent... or cool, I guess.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.070
Hey! Are you a new kid?

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.530
You better introduce yourself.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.150
Y-Yes, sir! My name is Koichi Hirose,
and I'm a new student.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.300
Good morning, Senpai!

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.270
All right. Well said.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.000
S-So scary...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.330
Oh, it's okay. They're getting on a different bus.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.340
The hell are you doing, you bastard?!

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.640
Who do you think you are?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.890
What am I doing? Well...

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.470
The turtle that lives in this pond woke up 
from hibernation, so I was watching it.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.760
I don't handle turtles really well. 
I'm scared to even touch them.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.850
So I was thinking it's about 
time I got over my fear...

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.820
That's not what I asked!

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.270
Stand up, dumbass!

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.370
You're pretty tall for a first-year.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.270
But before you have the 
nerve to dress like that...

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.720
You dumb shit! Who said you could wear that?

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.820
You need to talk to us first!

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.700
W-Wait... I'm not a fan of reptiles.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.490
They scare me...

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.480
Slap

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.490
What the hell are you smiling at?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.850
I'm sorry. I had no idea, Senpai.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.360
There are a lot of guys

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.260
I last saw in a hospital after they 
said they didn't know and were sorry.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.300
You wanna end up

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.220
like this turtle?! Huh?!

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.060
Th-They're awful...

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.980
I'll let you off the hook this time.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.920
Take off that jacket and the pants, 
and leave them here.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.060
With your cash!

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.860
Yes, sir! I'm very sorry!

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.190
That just means if you don't want them 
after you, don't dress like that.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.010
What pisses me off more is that

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.640
he isn't even mad after what 
they did to that turtle.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.060
Hey, wimp. Why don't you tell me your name?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.740
Yes, sir.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.130
Josuke Higashikata, from Class 1-B.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.500
What? Josuke Higashikata?

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.090
Student ID 
<font size="17">Name: Josuke Higashikata</c>

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.090
"Jo" and "Jo," eh?

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.480
Josuke, we're gonna call 
you "Jojo" from now on!

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.350
Okay... Thank you very much.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.000
Hurry up and take off that uniform.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.700
The damn bus is here.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.940
If you don't hurry it up, I'm gonna 
shave off that Astro Boy hair, too.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.250
Well, what are you waiting for? Hurry it up!

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.050
Hey, Senpai...

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.110
What did you just say about my hair?

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.250
What? A Stand?!

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.590
My nose... My nose!

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.220
I won't let anyone get away with making 
fun of my hair, no matter who it is!

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.550
Did you say my hair looked like Sazae-san?

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.810
Huh?! No one said that...

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.130
I heard you, damn it!

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.910
What the heck? That punk just went flying.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.980
Some kind of Stand just 
appeared from behind him.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.410
Huh? That turtle's wounds are...

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.780
What the heck?

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.060
Where you got punched 
is going back to normal!

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.250
Hey, he's all better!

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.460
But does it look like it healed all weird?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.450
His face looks kinda different.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.920
Huh?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.880
No way! What does it look like? Hey!

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.340
I had to touch that turtle,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.350
even though I didn't want to, thanks to you.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.860
What are you gonna do about that, huh?!

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.180
Wait! My nose! What's it look like? Huh?

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.660
Good grief. So he's...

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.870
Gah! That scared me!

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.190
Oh, it's just the turtle again.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.250
I was right. That turtle's all better.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.230
Josuke Higashikata...

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.010
Born in 1983.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.770
Your mother's name is Tomoko.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.180
She was 21 at the time,
and was going to college in Tokyo.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.840
You've lived here ever since you were born.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.160
In 1987, when you were four, you came down 
with a fever due to an unknown cause,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.350
and for the next 50 days, 
no one knew if you'd survive or not.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.320
Your father's name is...

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.230
Good grief. This is such a rotten role to play.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.980
Your father's name is Joseph Joestar.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.650
He's currently 78.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.210
He's the founder of Joestar Realty.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.050
I've heard of him before.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.590
Apparently he's a huge 
real estate mogul in the US.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.600
He's still doing all right,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.930
but when I was looking into how
to split up his inheritance,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.700
I found out that he had a son 
in Japan, which would be you.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.470
He didn't even know about it himself.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.630
That old piece of shit...

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.860
Going on about how he'd 
only ever love his wife,

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.210
yet I just found his son who was
born when he was 62 years old

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.190
as a result of an affair.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.390
Whoops. I guess I shouldn't have said that.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.000
My name's Jotaro Kujo.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.140
I guess, technically, I'm your nephew.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.370
How bizarre.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.040
Nephew? Oh, uh... Nice to meet you.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.180
Let's talk while we walk.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:00.320
And so, eventually, you're gonna get 
a third of the old man's inheritance.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.780
I came here to tell you that.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.800
The whole Joestar household is in chaos 
since the old man's affair came to light.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.270
It's in chaos?

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:14.030
Yeah... My grandma, Suzie Q,
is the angriest she's ever been

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.820
in their 61 years of marriage.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.700
I-I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry 
I've caused such a fuss!

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.970
Hey, now. Hold up.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.080
Why are you suddenly apologizing?

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.400
Well, I mean, causing trouble 
in a family is no good.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.820
My mother has told me that she was 
in love when she gave birth to me.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.220
I accept that, too.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.790
Could you tell, uh, my dad, um... 
Mr. Joestar, I mean,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.400
that he doesn't have to worry about us?

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.220
That's all.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.110
What's with this kid?

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.450
I came here prepared to take
a punch intended for the old man,

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.540
and instead, he's actually apologizing?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.060
Hey, it's Josuke!

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.190
Oh, it is!

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.380
Josuke!

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.530
How are you?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.530
Talk about a coincidence!

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.030
Let's go to school together.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.960
Your hair looks as cool as ever.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.990
You're looking sharp.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.360
You're so different from the other guys.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.900
Um... I'm actually in the middle of 
something important right now...

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.020
Huh? What the heck?

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.950
If you don't hurry, we're going to be late.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.210
You can talk later.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.970
Hey, Josuke.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.020
I'm not done talking to you yet.
Run these girls off.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.270
What's his problem?

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.380
Hey, have your stupid talk about hair later.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.010
H-He actually said it.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.290
He talked shit about his hair!

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.920
You bastard...

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.190
What were you saying about my hair, huh?!

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.570
This isn't good.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.770
Don't blame me!

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.670
Josuke hates people insulting
his hair more than anything else.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.170
It's just like what happened earlier!

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.820
Hold it, Josuke.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.930
I wasn't insulting <i>you</i>...

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.020
Shit! Here it comes!

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.420
Bash

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.530
Josuke!

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.710
There's blood!

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.530
Did you see it, Josuke?

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.860
This is called a Stand.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.350
It's the physical manifestation 
of your psychological energy.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.630
Joseph Joestar has one, too.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.810
Stands can only be seen by other Stand users.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.800
It pisses me off when someone
talks bad about my awesome hair.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.980
I can't even help it!

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.450
So this is Josuke's Stand!

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.040
Th-This power...

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.640
You're wide open from your chin down!

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.500
Bastard!

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.230
What?!

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.400
Huh?

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.210
When did that happen?

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.160
What's going on?

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.190
When did y—

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.710
Josuke!

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.240
No!

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.670
Josuke!

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.710
Shut up!

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.600
It pisses me off when girls freak out!
Get out of here!

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.850
Fine...

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.760
It seems like they know each other.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.170
Besides, he's scary.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.290
But he's kind of hot...

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.990
I don't get it...

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.210
I have no idea what's going on!

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.740
But something is definitely happening!

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.090
It's been a while...

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.950
Actually, it's been ten years.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.830
But I was able to stop time for half a second.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.020
If I hadn't stopped time...
I doubt we would've been killed,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.840
but one of us would've been badly injured.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.500
Here, Josuke.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.100
Ah, uh... No. It's okay.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.040
I see.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.660
There's actually another 
reason I came to see you.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.950
The other reason is this picture.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.350
Something is hiding in this town.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.020
Something very dangerous is approaching.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.700
When Old Man Joseph tried to 
get a spirit photo of you,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.980
this is what he got instead.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.140
We're not sure why...

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.620
But he's probably a Stand user.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.020
This doesn't concern you, but I wanted 
to at least show you the picture.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.760
You've been warned.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.320
Koichi-kun...

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.780
If you happen to see him, 
don't go anywhere near him.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.770
Calling the police won't help.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:05.890
Just run.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.510
Josuke...

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.810
Don't lose your temper 
and go after him, either.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.940
You'll get hurt, just like a moment ago.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.510
Oh! The entrance ceremony!

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.310
Ack! Look at the time!

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.180
Aw, shit...

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.780
Who knows what my mom'll do to 
me if I'm late on the first day?!

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.460
Hey, I'll listen to everything 
you've got to say after school.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.620
Hey, Koichi, was it? Let's go!

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.260
Huh?

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:31.920
Hurry!

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.730
Right!

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.650
The other bizarre guy I happened 
to meet is Josuke Higashikata.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.680
He's unpredictable and can go 
right from goofy to pissed off.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.840
I guess his family situation is complicated.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.930
And we only just met...

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.360
Josuke Higashikata... What a weird guy.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.930
And his Stand...

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.610
This hat... It's back together?

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.190
So his Stand reforms things into a 
different shape after they're broken?

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.610
If it had been my face or head...

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.160
Talk about creepy.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.190
But if I think about him as a 
potential ally, he should be reliable.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.570
If you overlook his ridiculous 
personality, anyway.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.310
I just hope this has nothing to do with Josuke.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.340
Shi

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:26.420
Shini

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:26.510
Shinin

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:26.590
Shining

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.720
Shining D

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:26.800
Shining Di

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:26.880
Shining Dia

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:26.970
Shining Diamo

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.050
Shining Diamon

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.010
Shining Diamond

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:27.720
Jo

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:27.840
Josuke

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:27.970
Josuke Higashi

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.010
Josuke Higashikata

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.010
Hey, girl!

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.770
Where are you headed? I'll give you a ride.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.200
Hey, don't be so cold!

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.870
C'mon! C'mon!

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.260
Ooh, v-very pretty!

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.400
You'll go wherever I want?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.820
Hell yeah! I'd go anywhere with you.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.220
Then you can go straight to Hell!

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:53.780
Huh?

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.350
Crush

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.100
Hey, you okay?

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.960
Officer!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.510
G-Go get that crazy bitch!

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.330
She injured me! That's a crime!

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.930
Nah, I can't do that.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.500
What?!

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.450
That's my daughter.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:14.930
Huh?

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.480
Well, you know. You caused trouble for others,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.940
then you called my daughter a crazy bitch.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.760
I'll let it go this time,
but be more careful in the future.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.520
You okay, Old Lady Murakami?

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.610
Come on. Grab your bag.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.920
Hey, Tomoko!

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.040
Dad.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.450
You headed home?

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.240
Yeah.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.960
Let's go home together. I'm done for the day.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.020
How's Josuke?

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.040
Today was his entrance ceremony, right?

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.220
He'd better not be up to any trouble.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.680
Hmph. Who knows?

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.200
That idiot can seem calm, 
then get pissed off outta nowhere.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.020
I wonder who he took after.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.920
Hey, now...

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.270
But...

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.150
Deep down, in the bottom of his heart, he's kind.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.390
No need to worry about him.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.590
Oh, yeah.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.620
Why don't we celebrate him 
starting high school tonight?

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.550
Yeah, I'm planning to.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.360
But I wonder if he'll come home early.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.070
He'll probably stop somewhere again.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.160
No doubt.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.270
Hey, I want to stop by Kame Yu.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.800
Huh? I just bought you an 
expensive bag the other day.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.310
I want to look at, like, clothes today.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.710
Watch it, dumbass!

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.940
Pay attention to where you're walking, moron.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.450
He's super creepy.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.390
He's not even gonna apologize 
after running into someone?

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.080
Forget him. Come on.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.670
I know. You just wanna go to Kame Yu, right?

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.990
Huh?

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.060
Anjuro Katagiri, a.k.a. Angelo.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.750
Born in Morioh in 1964.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.900
His IQ is 160.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.500
He was sent to juvie for robbery 
and rape when he was just 12.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.260
Since he committed that first crime,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.510
he's become the most awful

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.140
and disgusting criminal in Japan's history.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.080
He spent most of his youth in jail for his crimes,

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.760
a total of 20 years by the time he'd turned 34.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.620
His last crime was so vile, it'd make
even a rat in the bathroom puke.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.020
He was eventually arrested, 
and the sentence they gave him

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:37.950
was death.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.340
But, somehow, the execution failed to kill him.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.160
Shortly after, Angelo escaped.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.820
He most likely became a Stand 
user right before his execution.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.540
I'm not sure why,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.640
but he's hiding out in this quiet town...

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.700
Somewhere.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.440
Koichi, you heading home?

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.310
Oh... Yeah.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.920
We're in the same class.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.810
Yeah... Talk about coincidences.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.110
Well, see you tomorrow.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.490
Ah... Hey! J-Josuke!

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.900
Huh?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.450
Oh, you want to hear what 
that Jotaro guy has to say?

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.760
It's been bugging me,
and it has to do with this town.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.260
You're amazing. I'm gonna pass.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.380
Why?

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.670
I'm sort of curious,
but when I thought it through,

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:39.300
I don't think getting involved with being
some guy's lovechild is a good idea.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.790
Why?

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.040
Well, I mean...

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.430
Things are just fine as they are right now.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.130
I see...

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.070
I wonder what that is.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.980
Maybe an accident or something?

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.490
Wanna go after it?

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.280
Yeah.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.410
What? Are they shooting a drama?

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.170
It's dangerous, so step back. Step back!

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.420
Talk about a huge commotion.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.020
A man robbing that convenience store
took a female employee hostage inside.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.710
Huh?

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.160
Look! There he is!

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.750
Don't move! Drop the knife!

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.010
Let the girl go!

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.890
Shut up! Get back!

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.400
Th-That lady has rung me up before!

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.360
His eyes are messed up.
He'll totally kill her if he loses it.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.740
All of you, get outta the way!
I'm getting into the car!

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.840
This isn't good, Josuke! Get back! Back!

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.480
R-Right.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.620
Hey, you with the stupid hair!

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.620
Sorry, let us step back—

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.990
I told you to get away from the car!

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.590
I'll kill you!

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.850
I have...

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.000
a bad feeling about this.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.380
I knew it!

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.260
Loom

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.260
C-Crap! Here it comes!

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.760
At a time like this? In this situation?

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.350
After Mr. Jotaro warned him!

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.350
Who's that?

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.180
H-Hey! Stop!

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.020
What did you just say?

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.870
Wh-Who the hell are you? Get away from me.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.360
You don't care what happens to her?

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.520
Get back, you fool!

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.280
What are you going to do if he loses it?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.870
I told you guys to stay back, too!

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.240
D-Damn it! You're pissing me off!

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.270
I've made up my mind! I'm gonna stab this girl!

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.700
Oh, really?

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.550
Th-There's a hole in his body!

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.770
I pissed you off?

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.020
That's my line!

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.360
Huh? I-I'm fine?!

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.940
She's back to normal. It's happening again.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.610
M-My army knife! It's inside my stomach!

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.580
H-How?!

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.370
You'd better get a surgeon to take
that out... in the prison hospital.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.250
S-Seize him!

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.880
What's going on?

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.000
Josuke!

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.320
Hey, Koichi.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.110
Are you okay?! That was...

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.630
What the...

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.230
What are you doing, opening your mouth?

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.710
Who would have thought

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.640
I'd find another Stand user here?

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.620
I possessed this man and was having 
a blast with that robbery, and then...

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.560
How dare you get in my way?!

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.760
He's the guy from the picture!

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.730
I'll be watching you from now on.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.820
I'll be watching you all the time.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.790
What'd you say, you bastard?!

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.290
Josuke!

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.710
You idiot! Get him!

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.620
What were you thinking?!

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.170
M-Mr. Officer! W-Wait a sec...

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.100
What Mr. Jotaro said was true.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.550
Let me go! I didn't do anything!

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.510
There's something in this town...

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.820
I can feel the presence of 
something completely unknown.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.260
Something bad is here in Morioh.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.430
Hey, Josuke! Answer the phone!

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.460
Josuke! Answer the damn phone!

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.780
Yeah, yeah. One sec.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.640
Hello?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.550
It's Jotaro.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.050
Oh, hi.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.360
We didn't have a chance to 
actually talk yesterday.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.430
We need to talk about the 
guy hiding in this town.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.020
Oh, I actually wanted to 
talk to you about that.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.600
Mr. Jotaro, where are you right now?

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.850
The Morioh Grand Hotel.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.220
What happened?

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.940
Well...

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.360
Damn it, this pisses me off.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.860
Where the hell did I put the shovel?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.320
That little brat...

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.170
Looks like he's got a cozy little family.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:19.750
Not to mention he's got himself 
a hot, young mother...

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.750
I'm jealous.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:27.710
Josuke Higashikata, don't get cocky, now.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:33.720
I'm going to destroy your livelihood, 
your soul, and your life.
