00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.770
I swear I'll save you, 
so wait for me, Rohan!

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.830
So it learned my scent?

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.660
It's going to chase me forever,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.530
and as soon as it touches me, 
it'll suck out my nutrients?

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.580
Yes!

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.080
That thing can't go faster than 60km/h!

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.150
This bike'll have no problem beating that.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.840
But how the hell am I 
supposed to find the user?

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.860
I guess I'll sort out everything 
I know about him first.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.870
First, why did he set up 
a trap inside the tunnel?

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.060
It would have been easier to 
ambush us from the roadside.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.650
Second, I think there's more 
to his sucking out nutrients.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.430
There's got to be a reason for that tunnel.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.790
I've got to check out that tunnel!

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.480
I need information about 
the Futatsumori Tunnel!

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.370
Koichi!

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.280
I need to call Koichi and have 
him use Reverb to find the user!

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.840
Now, now. What's the matter? There, there...

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.490
All right. There should be plenty 
of distance between us now.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.800
Where's my card?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.000
Y-You can't be serious!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060
Why'd it suddenly appear?

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.390
I ran away at 80km/h, 
and it was going 60km/h.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060
Even doing simple math,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.610
it should have taken another 
two minutes to get here.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.060
That thing is a Stand.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.540
It can appear and disappear freely...

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.590
He managed to make it appear 
somewhere near where I am,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.580
and now it's going to accurately

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.990
attack me by following my scent!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.520
S-Sixty kilometers...

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.170
Wh-What?!

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.700
Shit! A baby carriage!

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.290
What's the matter with you? 
You're so fussy...

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.310
If I slow down, I'm gonna die.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.660
Rohan will die, as well.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.250
Sorry, but I'm gonna have to ride through.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.810
I have to just bust through!

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.540
But, Shining Diamond!

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.720
Fix.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.330
Good!

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.320
I'll never be able to make 
a phone call like this!

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.690
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.690
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.710
Episode 29     Highway Go Go, Part 2

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.860
Listen up, Yoshioka.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.260
In one minute,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.930
you will receive a very 
important call on your phone.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.970
This is a deal worth one billion!

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.710
You'd better not mess this up!

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.620
I'm counting on you, Yoshioka!

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.070
Y-Yes, sir! Please leave it to me.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.870
This is it! This cell phone!

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.570
It just happened to show up 
at the perfect time. Lucky me!

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.260
I will do my absolute best!

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.020
Talk about a silver lining!

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.020
Hello?

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.850
Huh?

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.570
Gah! One billion yen!

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.640
Did that happen when I grabbed it?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.460
My silver lining just broke!

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.170
If you hate me, just hang up on me!

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.620
H-How can you say that, Minayo?

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.390
Say it! Ask her to marry you!

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.970
Minayo, will you m-marry—

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.210
Man, I think I might be lucky today.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.600
Huh? What? What is it, Akira?

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.600
Talk about good timing!

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.330
Hello, Hirose residence.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.240
Koichi!

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.870
So that's what's happening.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.250
If I don't find the user, 
I'm gonna get killed.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.600
I think it's a guy who has some kind of

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.550
obsession or grudge with that tunnel.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.010
Are there any incidents 
involving that tunnel?

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.510
Th-There is. It's in the 
paper from two days ago.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.540
I saw the news on TV, too.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.920
Some thug on a motorcycle was driving drunk

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.080
and crashed into the tunnel's entrance.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.650
John Doe is unconscious and in critical 
condition with injuries all over his body.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.320
He's undergoing intensive care 
at Budogaoka Hospital now.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.160
Sounds like he's a victim of the Stand, too.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.320
Anyone else?

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.220
W-Wait a sec.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.290
When I saw the scene of the accident 
on TV, there was blood all over.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.540
Th-That Stand is one that 
sucks up nutrients, right?

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.290
This sounds like a different injury.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.330
Isn't it possible that the John Doe

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.170
who's in critical condition 
could be the Stand user?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.390
He needs nutrients from other 
people to heal himself...

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.720
What? I-It's the ocean!

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.290
If I keep going straight, I'll be in trouble!

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.140
I need to turn somewhere, or I'm 
gonna plunge into the ocean!

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.390
That corner!

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.010
I'll have to take it going more than 60km/h!

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.010
Hello? Josuke? What's wrong?

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.480
Koichi! Keep me on the line. Don't hang up!

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.810
Here I go, damn it!

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.530
Crap! I might crash!

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.530
No.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.480
I can do this right now.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.520
I can make this turn. 
I will make this turn, damn it!

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.580
Yes! I made the turn!

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.160
Did you see how I hung in there?! Take that!

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.970
Wh-What?!

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.090
The ocean's on this side, too!

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.090
No Entry

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.350
It's Morioh Harbor!

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.390
Shining Diamond!

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.530
Now for the crumbled wall...

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.780
Fix it!

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.790
Th-That was close...

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.940
It was trying to head straight toward me,

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.260
so it couldn't see this wall.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.090
Like a mosquito that can't see a screen, 
it's following me by scent alone.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.300
It doesn't have the ability 
to think or plan its attacks.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.190
Its only goal is to take nutrients from me.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.580
The theory that this guy's the critically 
injured patient makes sense.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.990
Everything fits together.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.630
Josuke!

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.230
Koichi, the hospital!

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.690
That John Doe must be the Stand user!

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.610
Find out his name for me.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.550
Got it.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.650
But, man, this situation is heavy...

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.940
H-How am I supposed to get out of this?

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.880
How far did he go? That little shit Josuke...

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.050
When this arrow wanted to 
pierce a motorcycle thug

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.380
who was about to die after an accident,

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.640
I was wondering what the 
hell it was thinking, but...

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.150
This is amazing! Just amazing!

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.300
Who would have thought he would 
create this amazing Highway Go Go?

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.370
A Stand ability is all about 
the user's mental strength!

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.420
The hungrier someone is, 
the stronger they are!

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.360
No one can defeat the power of a man 
so hungry to heal his own injuries.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.260
But I really would have 
loved to see Josuke die!

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.130
What should I do? What should I do?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.000
A culvert!

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.200
I'm glad I found a culvert 
that drains into the ocean,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.080
but it just keeps getting closer and closer.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.530
H-How am I going to get out of here?

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.600
Wh-Which way should I go?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.400
Um... The ocean is behind me,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.800
which means it's also to my right.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.240
The ocean is definitely bad news.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.660
The left is the way I came from... I think.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.220
Wh-Which way do I go now?

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.630
I think the left might be the ocean, 
but if I go to the right...

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.480
Th-There's the middle, too...

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.480
Wh-What's happening?

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.650
I'm pressing the gas, but 
the speed keeps dropping...

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.940
I-Is it breaking down?

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.150
Wh-What?! It's not broken?

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.400
Then why am I losing speed?

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.950
I'm gonna stop!

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.290
I-It's coming!

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.750
Could it be...

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.550
Am I out of gas?

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.560
Man, don't scare me like that.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.680
I'm just out of gas...

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.240
Then there's no problem at all.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.160
I thought it was some

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.060
major malfunction that even 
Shining Diamond couldn't fix.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.560
This isn't a problem.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.690
There'll be no problem escaping this.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.370
Still no problem.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.900
I can fix this with no problem.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.790
And the motorcycle, too, of course.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.220
I can't get too relaxed 
since that thing teleports,

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.980
but gasoline is not a problem.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.300
But it seems

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.690
that I do have a problem after all...

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.810
I'm lost!

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.680
Wh-Which way is the hospital?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.310
H

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.380
Hi

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:25.450
Hig

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:25.520
High

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.660
Highwa

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:25.730

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:25.870
Highway Go

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:25.940
Highway Go G

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.950
Highway Go Go

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.040
Budogaoka
General Hospital

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.040
Pardon me. I'm in a huge hurry.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.330
I'd like to know which room 
the young man who caused

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.710
the motorcycle accident at 
Futatsumori Tunnel is in.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.150
What's his room number?

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.430
Please tell me!

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.440
Now, listen...

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.930
Can you not see what's written there?

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:47.870
Huh?

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.430
Visiting hours are over for the day

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.680
If you need an eye exam,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.750
you can come in after 9:30 AM tomorrow.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.380
Um, I'm not actually here to visit him.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.560
But there's a reason I need to know his name!

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.360
Please, tell me!

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.450
Didn't you hear me tell you to go home?

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:09.770
Worthless brats like you are such a bother.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.040
You seem pretty short for 
a motorcycle gang member.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.440
Do your feet even reach the ground?

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.700
Jeez.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.970
Act 3...

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.220
Okay, Master! Let's kill da ho!

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.060
Beeetch!

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.480
O-Oh, no!

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.100
That was close...

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.360
These medicines costs 50,000 yen a bottle.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:41.740
Huh?

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.270
They're heavy?!

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.260
They're going to fall!

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.990
Hey, you! Help me! Hold me up!

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:56.250
Um, by "Hey, you!" did you mean me?

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.630
Yes! Who else is here?! This is really heavy!

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.220
Well, yeah, but still...

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.880
You did just tell me to go home.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.310
Not to mention, I'm so short, 
I don't know if I can reach.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.060
Are you going to get in trouble 
with your boss if those break?

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.650
Then you're going to be like, 
"Oh my gah!" Isn't it?

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.430
All right, fine! I'll tell you!

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.920
He's in room 525!

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.990
Yuya Fungami is in 525.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.240
Take that elevator to the fifth floor!

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.700
Huh?

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.040
Josuke!

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.540
Koichi...

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.290
Did you find out where he is, Koichi?

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.660
Room 525! His name is Yuya Fungami!

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.410
It's room 525!

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.050
Thanks, Koichi!

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.080
It's on the fifth floor! 
Hurry and get into the elevator!

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.700
Sh-Shit...

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.190
I-It just keeps coming in!

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.880
Koichi! Reverb Act 3!

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.040
You really are a guy I can 
count on. Thanks, Koichi!

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:22.440
But 3 Freeze can only attack 
one place at a time.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.340
The rest of them are following Josuke!

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.930
There it is! Room 525!

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.890
I'm finally here!

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.560
The vent!

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.320
You bastard!

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.550
It's only a few more 
meters to the room...

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.040
This distance is a pain!

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.290
I'm just gonna cut through 
and kick your ass!

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.590
Damn it!

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.040
I'm going to get there, no matter what!

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.930
I'm going to get there

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.810
and kick your ass...

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.520
Who the hell is that brat?

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.760
This is Yu's room!

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.160
Don't mistake it for your own, you dumbass!

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.350
Don't worry about him.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.300
You okay?

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.170
I thought it had been a while

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:35.780
since I got nutrients from that 
first guy in the tunnel, but...

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.670
So you're the second one I've 
been chasing around, huh?

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.920
I'm surprised you really made it here.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.690
I'm a little shocked, actually.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.210
Yu, you know this guy?

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.290
Huh?

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:57.060
Nah, I don't know him, 
and I don't give a shit.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.890
Great job, Highway Go Go.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.500
I've healed up quite a bit.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.620
If I can get nutrients from two or three 
more guys with abilities like his,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.820
I'll be fully recovered.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.930
Hey!

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.730
We told you not to lay your lazy ass down there!

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.830
And I just told you not to worry about him!

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.270
More importantly, come over here 
and give me some attention.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.100
Little ol' me can't even move yet.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.840
I really have to take a piss. 
My bladder's super full.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.230
Ooh! That's my job!

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.860
We promised we'd all take turns doing that!

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.590
It's my turn this time!

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.600
What? No, it's me!

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.770
I don't care who it is.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.580
Just hurry up and bring the 
urine bottle and help me go.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.760
Okay!

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.480
Then I'll...

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.020
Hey, Akemi.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.130
That peach is rotten.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.940
Peel a different one.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.200
How can you tell it's rotten?

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.970
Why? Because it reeks.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.940
It totally smells rotten.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.460
From over there?

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.190
You've got a point.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.460
I think my nose suddenly 
got much more sensitive.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.420
Oh, you're right... It really is rotten.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.100
One of you three is on your period, right?

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.660
Am I wrong? Someone's 
on her period, right?

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.430
Huh?

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.000
Ha, so it's you, Yoshie!

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.600
Looks like I was right.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.940
And one of you is also really 
pissed off right now, huh?

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.540
When you get mad or excited, 
your body releases adrenaline,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.190
and I can smell it.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.700
What the hell are you mad about? 
Is it you, Reiko?

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.010
Huh? I'm not mad.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.540
We're all really happy that 
you're feeling better, Yu.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.880
Yeah, we're super happy!

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.960
There's no reason for any of us to be mad.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.440
Hey, hey, something's not right.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.220
It totally reeks of someone being pissed off.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.990
Don't lie to me.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.990
Which one of you is mad?

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.730
It's me!

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.730
I'm the one who reeks of all that adrenaline!

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:14.970
Impossible!

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.570
You should be completely dried up by now!

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.490
How the hell are you standing?

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.490
That's because...

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.940
You were drinking my IV fluid?

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.540
It wasn't much, but I replenished myself.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:39.260
Release Rohan, the guy you're 
holding captive in the tunnel!

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.710
You fool!

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.660
Highway Go Go still remembers your scent!

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.480
Yu!

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.560
You three, don't move!

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.910
My name is Josuke Higashikata.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.670
My Stand's name is Shining Diamond.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.550
Though its target range is small,

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.080
it can throw punches faster than
a ho-hum speed like 60km/h.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.740
I've never actually measured it,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.000
but if it gets closer, 
it can go about 300km/h.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.960
Hey, stop! Wait!

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.440
M-My spine is still broken.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.770
My arms and legs are still 
broken and I'm bedridden.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.210
I'm critically injured!

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.010
And you're saying that you're 
going to hurt pitiful ol' me?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.620
All right, my bad. 
I'll free the guy in the tunnel.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.250
I think he's still alive.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.630
If you replenish his nutrients, 
I think he'll live...

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.060
S-So...

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.750
You wouldn't do something 
as cowardly as kicking

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.900
an injured person's ass, would you?

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.120
That's not something a man would do!

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.030
Yeah! That's cowardly!

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.270
Oh, I see.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.310
It's true that I probably 
wouldn't feel too great if

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.170
I kicked an injured person's ass.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.730
It's definitely not manly, 
and it pains my heart.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.550
Right? The guilt will stick with you 
forever if you kick my ass.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.190
I thought about that, so I already fixed you.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.050
Huh?!

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:05.810
Eh?

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.070
Can you move?

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.430
You can, right?

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.810
Your wounds are all healed up, aren't they?

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.860
Th-They are...

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.380
Right.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.940
I figured if I fixed you up first,

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.200
it wouldn't be cowardly at all, would it?

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.960
Yuya Fungami continues his hospital stay.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:38.620
If he ever tries to use Highway Go Go 
again to try to heal himself,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.220
Josuke threatens to kick 
his ass over and over.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.730
I feel so refreshed.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.180
I feel like it's New Year's morning

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.380
after I just put on a fresh pair of underwear.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.590
Yu!

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.680
However, it's rather enviable 
that he gets to be nursed

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.870
back to health by his fangirls.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.720
Meanwhile, Rohan...

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.950
Josuke Higashikata...

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.460
U-Um, look, Rohan-sensei,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.930
a lot's happened, but I, uh...

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.930
Why did you heal me?

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.130
Huh?

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.920
You meddlesome brat.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.450
I would have rather die 
than be saved by you.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.790
Not to mention, you stepped into the 
enemy's trap after I told you to run.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.890
How stupid can you be?

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.310
Wha—

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.340
Just so you know, I don't consider 
this a favor I need to return.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.900
...apparently still doesn't 
get along with Josuke.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:44.900
Also...

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.780
After all this happened, 
Koichi Hirose took his dog for a walk.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.270
