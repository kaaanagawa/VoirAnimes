00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.150
Yukako Yamagishi has been depressed lately.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.130
What? There's someone you like?

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.850
Yeah! We both like each other!

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.790
I went to the Angelo Stone the other day and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.380
there were a lot of tourists taking pictures.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.660
Wow, it's that famous now, huh?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.990
What's wrong, Koichi?

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.470
If I can just keep Koichi in my heart, 
that's all I need to be happy.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.720
I thought that once, but it's really hard...

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.780
I wish he'd look at me, even just a little.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.580
But I just don't know what 
I'm supposed to do...

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.190
"My makeup will
help you encounter love"

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.770
Cinderella?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.000
How lucky can I be?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.620
I can't believe such a wonderful 
guy proposed to me!

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.240
Thank you, Dr. Aya! Thank you so much!

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.380
Phew...

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.230
I guess a woman's youth is better spent

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.140
happy and ugly than dark and beautiful...

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.230
Come in.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.760
"My makeup will help you encounter love."

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.980
What's written on that sign is true.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.240
If you're interested...

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.070
Welcome to Salon Cinderella.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.900
Episode 20    Yukako Yamagishi Dreams of Cinderella

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.630
Please, come in.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.180
My name is Aya Tsuji.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.500
Phew... I'm the owner of 
this place and an aesthetician.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.010
I talk like I have low blood pressure, 
but don't let it bother you.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.380
Phew...

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.130
But I'm very motivated by my work.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.260
Phew...

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.870
You...

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.310
are quite beautiful.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.350
Phew...

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.560
I had no idea there was 
someone so beautiful in Morioh...

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.570
Now, please have a seat right over there.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.960
Write your name and address on that form.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.820
I haven't decided that I'll do this yet.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.330

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.500
"Makeup to marry a celebrity"?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.670
This salon is a bit different 
from ordinary salons.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.730
I'm an aesthetician who 
creates faces of happiness.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.600
Physiognomy—that is, the shape of one's face—

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.590
High Brows

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.590
Double
Eyelid

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.590
Big, Wide Eyes

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.900
can change someone's fortune.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.590
If you have a face that will be loved,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.070
it'll heighten your luck 
with encountering love.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.280
Hmm... Too bad.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.840
The shapes of your eyes and 
eyebrows aren't good.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.690
Phew...

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.310
I'm going to be blunt.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.470
This is so stupid that 
I'm beyond disappointed.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.320
You're trying to charge money for this?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.700
With that face, the more you love a boy, 
the more he's going to run away.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.180
Am I wrong?

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.500
Have you not experienced that?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.900
You're wrong.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.920
I've never had that happen in my life.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.330
Oh, no? Very well, then.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.460
In your case...

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.540
I'm not very accustomed to working with CG.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.930
This is the face that will encounter love.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.120
Wait... This is cosmetic surgery.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.570
You do surgeries?

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.440
This is a face we'll create using
only makeup and beauty massage.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.980
But it only lasts thirty minutes.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.570
If you don't encounter love,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.980
I will return the thousand-yen fee to you.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.450
Would you like to try it?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.100
All right. If it's just makeup...

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.450
I have nothing to lose, 
so I guess I can give it a try.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.120
Thank you. Let's get started, then.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.330
Close your eyes.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.900
Make sure you don't open your eyes.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.250
Don't move.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.070
My hands may slip if you do.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.890
Koichi...

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.280
This is the makeup that'll 
help me encounter love?

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.850
Will my luck really change just by altering

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.900
the lines of my eyes and eyebrows?

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.200
Koichi?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.600
I-I've been looking for you, Yukako.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.160
Huh? Me?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.860
Yeah... You passed by Rengatei 
earlier, didn't you?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.630
You looked really sad back there,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.300
a-and I sort of got worried...

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.690
Worried?

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.550
You were worried about me, Koichi?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.340
Y-Yeah... A lot happened between us, 
but it doesn't bug me anymore,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.420
so I don't want you to feel down about it.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.360
R-Really?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.440
Yeah...

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.370
I can't believe it...

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.280
Is this really because of the makeup?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.190
K-Koichi...

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.380
Rather than standing around,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.570
why don't we find a place to sit and chat?

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.480
Huh?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.340
U-Um... Only if you want to...

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.200
Well...

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.450
I guess I am a little thirsty...

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.510
Huh? Huh?!

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.560
I really am lucky.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.210
Things are really changing!

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.480
I get to be near the cute, yet strong, Koichi...

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.480
I suddenly want to eat a chocolate parfait.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.340
Does that make me seem girly?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.180
Huh? No! Not at all!

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.770
That's what I wanted, too!

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.950
This is like a dream...

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.790
Physiognomy really does exist!

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.330
I'm really on a roll right now.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.910
My luck is really on a roll right now!

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.480
I... I can't believe it...

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.330
I can feel Koichi-kun's 
warmth and beating heart.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.700
I'm so happy...

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.580
This is the happiest I've ever been.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.120
Oh, It's 4 PM! I can't believe it's this late!

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.360
H-Huh?!

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.600
M-My stomach hurts!

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.010
Ow...

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.680
Y-Yukako, I'm sorry!

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.290
I'm gonna head home.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.860
K-Koichi!

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.700
Why...

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.940
Why is it only thirty minutes?!

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.340
Hey, lady! Can't you see the light's red?

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.430
Shut up!

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.540
It's the light's fault for turning red!

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.320
Why is it only for thirty minutes?!

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.870
Make it longer!

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.840
You encountered love, didn't you?

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.870
You should be satisfied with that, 
and come back tomorrow.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.510
All of my other customers have done that.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.420
No! I can't stand luck that 
only allows me to be with

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.930
Koichi for thirty minutes,
and then rips us apart!

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.730
Phew...

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.180
Next, do the one that captures love!

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.110
You can do that, right?

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.310
You really don't listen to others, do you?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.770
I said, "do it!"

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.360
Phew... Yukako.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.520
Cinderella was able to 
encounter a wonderful love,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.110
even though she was bullied, 
because she had a pure heart.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.530
Which means you need to have the willingness 
for such a wonderful encounter to occur.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.540
Are you able to do that?

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.220
Willingness? What are you talking about?

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.530
Just changing your physiognomy 
isn't enough to change your luck.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.670
Phew...

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:33.070
I became an aesthetician because I admired 
the fairy godmother in <i>Cinderella</i>.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.930
I want to live giving happiness 
to others, just like her.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.530
You're very beautiful, and I like you.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.220
So I'll do this specially for you.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.810
However...

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.530
We're going to have to work on various parts.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.310
Phew...

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.180
It's your whole body... The whole body

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.080
must be transformed into 
a body to capture love.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.920
And the willingness you need to do that is this.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.820
You need to apply this 
lipstick every thirty minutes,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.510
except when you're asleep.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.550
It's to maintain your body 
after I've worked on it.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.060
If you can do this, you'll have the 
luck to capture love for eternity.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.630
The price is 72,000 yen for 24 hours.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.690
Fine. Do it.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.480
Good... Now, don't move.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.700
Make sure you don't open your eyes.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.290
I knew you weren't a normal aesthetician.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.150
Th-This power...

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.630
You can see my Cinderella?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.440
I see... so they were Stand powers.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.130
But the more I think about it, I don't care.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.480
If you wanted to harm me, 
you would have already tried.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.570
I trust you. You're my fairy godmother.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.520
You startled me...

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.270
Just start already.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.180
What a wonderful girl...

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.730
All right. I'll work my magic.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.790
Cinderella is a Stand that 
transforms the body's image.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.790
This perfectly completes the work 
on your body to capture love.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.960
Yukako, your body has become 
invincible when it comes to love.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.600
The pain in my stomach suddenly went away...

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.750
Oh, this is Yukako's bag! Whoops!

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.890
I have to go back and return it to her!

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.860
Koichi.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.480
Y-Yukako...

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.540
O-Oh, yeah. Here! This is your bag.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.540
Huh?

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.370
And this is mine.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.710
I accidentally took it. Sorry about that!

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.750
W-Well, I'll see you later.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.510
W-Wait, Koichi!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.010
Look at me.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.100
Don't you feel something 
when you look at me?

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.550
W-Well... Well...

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.920
Well...

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.410
Hey! If it isn't Koichi!

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.900
Rohan-sensei!

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.380
I'm heading to the Kame Yu 
department store for research.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.910
Come with me.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.880
I was planning on heading home...

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.320
It's embarrassing taking pictures in a 
department store by myself, you know.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:46.950
So please?

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.460
What is this?

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.930
You're so needy... Jeez.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.170
Wasn't I supposed to become 
the invincible heroine?!

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.500
What happened to the effectiveness

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.300
of your Cinderella's powers?!

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.470
Oh, Ko.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.970
No, Koichi's heart definitely 
belongs to you now.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.970
Oh, Mom. Sis.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.900
But his reasoning is denying you.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.190
Did something happen between 
you and Koichi in the past?

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.350
That must be it.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.240
Oh, this gentleman is a manga artist?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.110
He's lovely. May we join you?

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.110
But don't worry.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.950
Luck will eventually take your side.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.180
Cinderella is absolute.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.880
By the way, it's 4:45. 
It's almost been thirty minutes.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.490
Make sure you don't forget 
to apply the lipstick.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.250
Yes, I'm doing it now.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.000
Luck will take my side, huh?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.760
What? You're going to Kame Yu? So are we.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.720
Huh?!

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.670
What's with these people?!

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.630
There are even more of them!

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.300
And now the person I want here 
the least, his mother, is here!

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.390
Luck is on my side, my ass!

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.890
I'll kill that salon bitch!

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.610
I guess I'll start taking pictures here.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.330
H-Hey, are you using the flash?

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.900
This isn't good, Josuke.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.490
She's been startled, and the 
stress is making her disappear!

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.660
H-Hey, Old Man! Head outside!

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.660
P-Pardon me!

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.730
Move out of the way, please!

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.130
Huh?

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.040
What's going on?

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.790
Ah!

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.170
Whoa! Sorry, Koichi!

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.050
Y-Yukako..

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.060
K-Koichi...

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.530
This... is luck.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.950
This is it!

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.040
Our hearts are understanding each other.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.630
Koichi's heart is flowing into mine...

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.610
This is my all...

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.760
And my life is going to 
change starting now...

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.460
Ci

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:57.630
Cin

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:57.830
Cinde

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:58.000
Cindere

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.960
Cinderella

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:58.880
Aya

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.960
Aya Tsuji

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.460
Josuke, Okuyasu...

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.300
I... ended up kissing Yukako. Yeah.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.180
Flail

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.180
Flail

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.610
What did she do to you?!

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.750
That bitch must have tried 
to pull something again!

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.170
Calm down! It's not like that...

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.980
I just...

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.720
It seems I've fallen in love with Yukako.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.570
Huh?

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.550
I'm starting to think that her 
personality isn't so bad...

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.700
It makes me feel warm inside.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.580
Is this love?

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.870
I'm not really sure...

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.870
Hey, Okuyasu, did you hear him?

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.730
Even a Stand would be blown 
to the moon if it heard that.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.190
He and Yukako...

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.840
Gush

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.720
Hey, hey, hey! 
You don't have to cry about it!

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.340
But, Koichi...

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.770
I don't know what led to this sudden 180,

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.830
but if you and Yukako both 
have feelings for each other,

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.070
then there shouldn't be a problem.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.400
That's not it, though...

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.320
Yukako has refused to see me ever since.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.850
That's the mystery.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.170
She hasn't come to school for two days.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.570
She won't answer the phone...

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.790
She hasn't contacted me 
at all. Nothing. That's it.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.930
Y-You mean ever since you guys kissed...

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.350
You haven't heard anything?

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.320
Not at all.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.170
Hmm... That is very bizarre.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:30.050
If anything, I admired Yukako 
for her dedication to love.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.390
But honestly, I don't think you're going to

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.310
get an answer unless you ask Yukako in person.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.560
We really shouldn't get involved...

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.690
Y-Yeah...

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.080
But if you're in danger, let us know!

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.690
We'll be right there!

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.250
Thanks. I'm gonna go now.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.130
Yeah.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.060
But...

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.800
Damn Koichi! I can't believe he kissed a girl!

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.200
Seriously, it's no reason to cry.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.380
Th-That hair!

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.710
Yukako!

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.010
W-Wait, Yukako!

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.510
U-Um...

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.020
You've got the wrong person.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.480
U-Um... You looked just 
like her from behind, so...

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.280
Actually, no, wait!

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.870
K-Koichi...

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.350
How dare you do this to me, 
you stupid dumbass?!

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.190
My face just keeps falling apart!

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.230
Even if I put on makeup, it just falls off!

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.770
You asshole woman!

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.690
Turn my face back to normal!

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.110
It appears

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.100
that you broke your promise.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.730
That's too bad.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:25.380
I persistently told you to reapply the 
Cinderella lipstick every thirty minutes...

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.650
I just forgot, that's all!

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.590
Wh-What is this? My hands...

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.600
They're turning into mush!

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.370
Your palm lines and 
fingerprints are disappearing.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.040
You shouldn't have broken the promise.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.940
That lipstick was to guarantee your luck.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.580
You need a lot of energy 
to change someone's luck.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.570
And now that has gone away.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.280
It's your own fault for 
underestimating your luck.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.320
D-Do you want to die?!

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.790
Die?

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:03.330
I'm not running a salon for the 
sake of ambition and money alone.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.520
I wanted to be like the fairy godmother

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.190
in <i>Cinderella</i> who brings people happiness.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.410
It is truly a shame.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.340
I shouldn't have tried to 
make your wish come true.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.980
Your face and your palm lines are now gone.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.990
They've been eliminated from this world.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.350
What... did you say?

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.810
They've disappeared.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.480
There's no use for someone 
who's missing parts.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.890
My face... is gone?

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.110
What kind of life does someone 
with missing parts live?

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.460
Yukako!

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.200
K-Koichi!

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:40.960
Why is he...

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.230
No, I can't... He'll find me out.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.560
N-No, you've got the wrong person.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.920
Dr. Aya, men aren't 
allowed in here, are they?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.460
Hurry and throw him out, please.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.740
It's that personality...

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.470
That insanely tough personality.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.140
No doubt about it. You're Yukako.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.190
I sort of fell for that personality...

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.460
And that lady is a Stand user, right?

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.690
And she did something to you...

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.400
It's all over.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.140
I can't go on living.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.410
I'll kill you, Aya Tsuji!

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.160
I'll kill you!

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.040
Calm down.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.020
That's... P-Part of her face went flying!

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.970
There we go.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:36.970
Phew...

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.680
So this is Koichi... Phew...

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.710
He was able to figure out that you were

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.120
Yukako Yamagishi, even though 
your face is different.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.310
Even though you've denied yourself,

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.980
some people can see others' personalities.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.890
All right, Yukako.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:58.840
On his behalf, I'll give you one 
last chance as a fairy godmother.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.830
Your last chance is to choose one of these.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.830
Your real face is now gone,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:13.460
but my Cinderella has memorized 
every face we have ever worked on.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.210
Choose your own face out of these.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.470
If you can pick your own face,

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.010
it's possible to return your face to normal.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.660
Your palm lines and fingerprints 
will return naturally, too.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:30.100
Just like Cinderella's glass slippers, 
pick the one that's the perfect fit for you.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.560
You should've let me do that 
to begin with, you dumbass!

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.430
I can figure that out easily!

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.490
I look at my face in the mirror every day!

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.220
But if you choose someone else's face,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.070
that face will never suit you.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:50.000
In fact, speaking in terms of 
my own beauty standards,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.750
I will warn you that your 
face will become hideous.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.210
And your luck will be forever based on that face.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.220
Y-Yukako...

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.940
Choose carefully.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.720
Remember, your face in the mirror is reversed.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.870
R-Right...

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.720
The correct answer is that they're all wrong.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.890
None of the faces there are yours.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.110
If you can figure that out, 
I'll fix your face.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.700
That is my rule as Fairy Godmother.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.120
Once I start second-guessing, others 
look like they might be mine, too...

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.870
But...

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.700
This is it! There's no doubt about it!

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.000
I know, because it's my own face!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.790
Are you sure?

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.120
You'll find out once you try to put it on.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.660
N-No... This isn't it.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.940
My eyes look a bit more slanted.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.020
Wh-Which is it?

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.600
I-I really can't tell after all...

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.160
What's the matter? Hurry up and choose.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.330
No, I'm not going to choose.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.080
What?

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.790
What are you saying?

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.960
You want to live your life without a face?

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.420
I'm going to have Koichi choose for me.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.450
Because... No matter what face 
it is or what luck it carries,

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.470
so long as it was chosen by 
Koichi, that's all I'll need.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.610
I can live with that.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.600
I won't have any regrets.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.070
B-But that's not...

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.610
I don't care.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.210
Please choose, Koichi.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.620
O-Okay...

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.840
This is it.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.470
I don't know why, but I have 
a feeling it's this one.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.560
But if it's not the right face...

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.970
That's Reverb, my Stand.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:17.600
U-Um, use your Stand to hurt 
Reverb's eyes, and make me blind.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.110
You said you wouldn't have any regrets,

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.990
but knowing your personality,

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.020
I'm sure you won't want me to look 
at your face if it's not your own.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.560
Because I've fallen in love with you,

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.660
I would really hate for that to happen.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.550
So I think the best solution is 
for me to not be able to see.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.290
Koichi...

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.800
All right, Yukako...

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.710
Yes.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.240
L-Look, Koichi!

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.400
It fits perfectly!

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:02.730
Koichi!

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.680
We did it, Yukako!

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.110
It's because you chose my face for me, Koichi!

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.920
<i>Who would have thought he'd say</i>

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.680
he'd go blind so he couldn't see her face?

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.290
I bent my rules as Fairy Godmother a bit, 
but I fixed your face for you.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.520
If I took the eyesight of a boy 
who has nothing to do with this,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.370
my reputation as Fairy 
Godmother would be tarnished.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:27.130
Yukako, it seems that you do, at least, 
know a good man when you see one.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.770
Salon Cinderella is currently open.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.300
Her makeup will help you encounter love.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.260
