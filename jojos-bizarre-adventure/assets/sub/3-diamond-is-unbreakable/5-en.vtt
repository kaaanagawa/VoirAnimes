WEBVTT

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.310
My plan is already finished.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.730
What?!

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.800
Okuyasu's big bro was a pretty great danger.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.580
Koichi, let's get the heck out of this house.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.340
Huh?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.950
Wh-What about the bow and 
arrow that sh-shot me?

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.490
The bow and arrow?

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.700
Looks like Okuyasu's big 
bro hid them somewhere.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.190
Are we going to look for them?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.270
Y-Yeah...

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.610
You know, I could swear they 
mentioned having a dad around.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.400
I took some pretty major damage,
so let's just leave for today.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.320
W-We can't!

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.920
I-I'm alive because you healed 
my wounds for me, but...

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.460
If someone else is shot with 
that bow and arrow again,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.750
they might actually die!

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.100
Here in this town!

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.630
S-Stay here. I-I'll go look for them myself!

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.640
N-Not to mention, I don't think 
their dad is here right now.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.650
I-If he was, I'm s-sure he would 
have shown himself by now.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.580
He's a lot braver than he looks.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.150
He can be tough when it counts...
Or maybe just reckless.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.540
But right now, we should really 
hurry up and get out of this house.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.540
Hey...

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.590
Wh-What? D-Don't try to stop me.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.710
I won't.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.230
Let's hurry up, snap that 
bow and arrow in half,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.840
and get the hell outta here together,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.030
Koichi.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.540
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.500
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.760
Episode 5  The Nijimura Brothers, Part 3

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.940
They have an attic. Maybe the 
bow and arrow are up here.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.410
Th-There they are!

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.600
The bow and arrow!

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.210
They're hanging on the far wall!

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.460
Hey, I think this was a bad idea.
There's something in there.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.540
Is something chained up in there?

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.110
I-Is it a dog?

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.430
Those sounds can't be from a human...

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.440
I-It sounds like an animal.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.560
No, I'm scared! What should we do?!

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.100
What should we do?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.670
It was you who insisted on going!

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.120
Yeah, but...

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.170
We're just gonna have to do this.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.410
Listen up, Koichi.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.930
You're gonna kick in the door as hard 
as you can on the count of three.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.130
We're gonna scare it.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.860
Then, I'm gonna run over and
snap the bow and arrow in half.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.660
Got it?

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.600
Yeah.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.230
Here we go.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.300
One...

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.610
Two...

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.380
Three!

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.210
Grab

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.490
What the hell is that?!

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.780
Koichi!

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.290
Help!

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.320
That hand doesn't belong to a Stand. It's real!

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.040
That's a real body!

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.970
H-Help me!

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.780
Bleh...

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.190
I didn't mean to chop it off...

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.100
Wh-What the heck is that creature?

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.670
I can't believe that thing's 
been living near my house...

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.070
Bleh...

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.620
Looks like you finally saw the 
thing you weren't supposed to see.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.980
You bastard...

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.330
That thing right there... is our dad.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.090
My dad needs these.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.090
Th-The bow and arrow...

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.640
I want to find a Stand user for my dad's sake.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.190
That's why I can't let anyone else

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.530
have this bow and arrow or destroy them,

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.500
no matter what!

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.260
Is it some kind of disease?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.240
Disease? No.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.270
My dad's perfectly healthy,

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.510
and he's got an appetite.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.010
But he just keeps moaning, and he 
doesn't recognize me as his son.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.060
So you were looking for a 
Stand user to fix your dad.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.400
Fix?

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.150
You gonna fix him for me? 
That's not it, either.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.620
It's the opposite.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.830
I'm looking for a Stand user who'll kill my dad.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.900
Dad won't die, no matter what.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.060
Whether you smash his head in,

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.840
or grind up his body, or rip 
things off, nothing works!

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.900
I just want to let him die normally.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.150
I swore when I was a kid that I'd do 
anything to make that happen.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.350
And to do that, I need this bow and arrow.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.360
Otherwise, my dad will probably 
live like this forever.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.190
Because my dad had some 
guy named DIO's cells

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.790
implanted in his head,
so he ended up like this!

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.740
DIO? Did you just say DIO?

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.080
That's the guy Jotaro talked about.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.520
Let me tell you a bit about the past,

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.680
Josuke Higashikata.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.310
After all, you're not completely uninvolved.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.570
Everything happened eleven 
years ago, in 1988.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.070
At the time, I was seven, 
and Okuyasu was four.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.250
We lived in Tokyo.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.210
The world was carefree,
thanks to the bubble economy,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.600
but at the time, my dad had no luck.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.280
Our mom died of an illness,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.620
the business that my dad 
was running went under,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.120
Luxury Houses
Nijimura Land

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.910
and he was in massive debt.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.380
He would hit us for no reason all the time.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.010
Our dad was a total loser.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.930
But then, suddenly,

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.310
money started rolling in to my dad.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.490
Even jewels and precious 
metals, too, sometimes.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.030
He wasn't even really working.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.420
I found out later when I did some research

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.420
that my dad had apparently 
already sold his soul to DIO.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.720
He became one of his minions 
in exchange for money.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:33.730
It seems that DIO was looking for anyone 
with Stand potential back then.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.160
Somehow, he found out that 
my dad had the potential,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.920
though I have no idea now 
what his Stand was like.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:48.780
But one day... Even though it was ten 
years ago, I still remember it vividly.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.740
When I got home from school, around 2:00 PM...

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.130
Okuyasu!

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.470
Did Dad hit you again? That scum!

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.160
N-No!

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.250
Huh?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.280
DIO...

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.880
DIO's dead...

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.660
That has to be why!

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.800
Dad?

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.570
Dad, let's call an ambulance.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.640
It's no use! This isn't an illness!

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.140
The flesh bud has gone berserk!

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.610
I'm done for!

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.680
Dad!

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.250
About a year after that, he became
a glob of flesh that can't even tell

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.450
that we're his sons anymore.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:49.920
DIO would implant his own cells into 
the heads of those he couldn't trust,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.250
and order them around when
he wanted to control them.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.140
Dad had one of those flesh buds 
implanted in his head.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.140
I spent ten years researching everything.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.280
About Stands, about Jotaro...

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.560
Then I found out about the 
old woman named Enyaba,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.230
and obtained the bow and arrow.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.050
But as I learned all of this,

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.190
I also had to accept that 
my dad would never recover.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.950
Because DIO's immortal cells 
had become one with him.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.990
This is all he does, all day long.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.870
Every single day...

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.560
Day after day, for ten years,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.460
he uselessly scratches 
around that box of junk.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.960
If I take the box away from him, 
he just cries for days.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.640
It pisses me off.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.510
Watching him just makes me 
hate the idea of living.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.000
How many times have I told 
you not to make a mess?

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.160
He can be obedient if I discipline him,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:04.350
but he never stops digging 
around in that box!

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.120
Bleh...

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.100
Hey! You're the one who needs to stop!

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.100
He's your dad!

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.900
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.900
He's my father by blood.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.220
But right now, he's as much 
my father as he's not.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.610
He's a man who sold his soul to DIO,
and got what he deserved.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.720
Yet, on the other hand,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.410
do you know how it feels, not being able 
to finish him off because he's your dad?

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.030
That's exactly why I want him to die normally.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.710
Once he's finally dead,
my life can actually begin!

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.150
Damn it! I told you to stop that!

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.820
It pisses me off!

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.450
Hey!

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.670
That's enough!

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.970
I can't let you have this bow and arrow.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.550
No matter what!

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.360
Don't get the wrong idea!

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.390
I'll worry about the bow and arrow later.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.270
Right now, that box has my attention!

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.940
Dogyaa

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.690
Do

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.690
Th-The box?

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.940
gyaa

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.850
I saw him grabbing at some paper scraps,

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.390
so I was curious about what it was.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.790
I see now.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.460
A family photo...

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.170
S-So there was a reason.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.480
There was a reason for the
behavior he repeated for ten years.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.110
He was looking for the photo 
of his sons at the time.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.430
He might not understand 
what's going on right now,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.740
but deep down inside,
he still has his memories!

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.820
Memories of the past!

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:28.590
The

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:28.800
The Ha

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:28.970
The Han

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.930
The Hand

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:29.630
Oku

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:29.760
Okuyasu

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:29.890
Okuyasu Niji

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:30.930
Okuyasu Nijimura

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.440
Instead of looking for a Stand to kill him,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.960
if you'll try to find one that can cure him,

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.860
I don't mind helping you out.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.080
But hand over that bow and arrow.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.250
I'm gonna snap them in half.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.640
You planning to run?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.930
Big Bro, let's stop this.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.950
Okuyasu!

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.640
Come on, let's stop all of this, okay?

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.140
You were still here?

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.650
Dad might get cured, right?

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.610
Even if his body doesn't go back to normal,

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.800
maybe his mind and his memories 
will go back to how he used to be.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.440
Right?

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.630
Okuyasu! What do you think you're holding?

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.130
Big Bro...

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.060
Out of the way, Okuyasu!

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.050
I can't turn back anymore, 
no matter what happens!

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:57.390
I've already killed so many people in 
this city with this bow and arrow!

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.240
Besides, I don't even think of you 
as my little brother anymore.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.900
Since you're not my little brother, 
I can kill you without hesitation!

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.020
B-Big Bro...

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.040
You guys...

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.980
Do you have any relatives 
here besides your dad?

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.000
Relatives? There's only the three of us.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.320
Th-That's...

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.600
It came out of the electrical outlet...

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.390
Okuyasu! Stop spacing out, you dumbass!

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.360
Big Bro!

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.380
I'm taking this bow and 
arrow, Keicho Nijimura!

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:57.040
I, who got shot by this bow and arrow, 
and had my Stand ability awakened!

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.610
You think...

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.080
someone like you can handle 
this bow and arrow?

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.910
Keicho Nijimura!

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.160
You said Stands depend on 
one's mentality, didn't you?

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.210
Well, I've grown!

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.840
How else do you think my Stand,
Chili Pepper, grew this much?

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.550
Worse Company!

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.050
Shut up!

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.890
Th-That's...

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.130
Electricity!

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.520
Okuyasu's big brother is being 
turned into electricity,

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.460
along with the bow and arrow!

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.560
Big Bro!

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.110
Don't touch me!

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.890
You'll be dragged in, too!

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.700
Big Bro...

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.800
D-Damn it! It's taking the bow and arrow!

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:41.720
Okuyasu...

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:48.290
You were always holding me back!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.130
Big Bro!

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.680
Josuke!

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.200
I could have sworn I just saw 
someone who looked like

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.460
the user looking in through that window.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.240
Do you know anything about 
that Stand we just saw, Okuyasu?

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:19.240
N-No. My big bro found a lot of 
Stand users I didn't know about.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.500
J-Josuke! Th-That's...

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.170
Okuyasu...

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.240
My big bro... deserved to end up like that.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.860
There's no way he could 
have lived a decent life.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.640
That was his fate.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.650
But you know...

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.220
In the end, my big bro...

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.700
In the very end, my big bro 
defended me, didn't he?

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.830
Josuke, you saw it, right?

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.950
Yeah. I definitely saw it.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.970
Your big bro defended you.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.230
Is this Jotaro Kujo?

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.300
I don't recognize your voice.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.200
Who are you?

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.860
That doesn't matter.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:45.780
Jotaro Kujo, I'm asking 
you to leave Morioh.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.510
I don't think I'll listen to someone

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.280
I don't know suddenly telling me to leave.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.630
Would you leave, no questions asked,
if you were in my shoes?

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.920
I'm the one who has the bow and arrow.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.670
I got it after I killed Keicho Nijimura.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.820
I don't mind killing you either,
Jotaro, but I hear that

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.920
you have the ability to stop 
time for a second or two.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.460
You sound like a tough opponent,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.420
so I thought I'd give you 
a call and warn you first.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.240
Are you also Stand user?

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.700
What do you plan to do 
with the bow and arrow?

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.990
I don't plan on giving you any trouble.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.470
And as long as Josuke Higashikata 
doesn't try anything,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.570
Unavailable Number  Public Phone

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.580
I won't do anything to him, either.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.300
I just received this Stand ability.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.260
I just want to have a little fun.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.950
I'm fed up with my annoying life of 
entrance exams and getting a job.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.380
Are you a student?

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.910
What difference does that make?!

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.560
Listen! If you overstay 
your welcome in my city,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.730
I'm gonna kill you and Josuke, too! Got it?!

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.730
How many other Stand users are in this city?

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.730
Good grief...

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.010
Keicho Nijimura was buried 
in Kunimi Peak Cemetery,

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.290
which is west of Morioh.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.520
The stolen bow and arrow remain missing.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.260
Nijimura Family

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.490
Okuyasu Nijimura decided to settle down

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.760
with his father in Morioh for a while.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.410
And...

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.300
Josuke, would you get that?

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.080
Yes?

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.490
Hey, Josuke! Let's go to school.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.820
Huh?

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.610
I'll be going to the same school 
as you starting today.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.190
Even so, you don't have to come and get me.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.440
We're not in grade school.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.990
Man, I had no idea your house was, 
like, right in front of mine!

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.010
Yeah, you could call that a shocking truth...

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.200
Come on. Let's hurry up and go.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.470
Oh, is that a friend of yours, Josuke?

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.290
Hi! I'm Okuyasu Nijimura!

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.270
Come on in and have a cup of coffee 
while he finishes getting ready.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.970
Really? Thank you very much!

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.270
Your mom is totally hot.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.630
Pardon the intrusion!

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.950
This is just great... and heavy...
