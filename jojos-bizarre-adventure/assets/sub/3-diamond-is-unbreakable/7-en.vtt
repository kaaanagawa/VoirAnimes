00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.770
This is Morioh Radio,
and our next segment is

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.350
"Help Me, Midnight Discussions!"

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.520
Our first letter is from 
"Forever 21, Pretty Baby."

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.060
"Listen to this, Kai.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.610
I was late meeting someone 
because of that thing again.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.260
Yeah, the one by the station!

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.270
The railroad crossing that 
never lets you through.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.970
Ugh, it just goes ding, ding, ding, ding, 
ding, ding... It just needs to shut up!"

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.060
Now, calm down, Pretty Baby.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.470
Oh...

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.440
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.440
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.140
See ya.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.510
Seriously?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.590
Episode 7  Toshikazu Hazamada (Show Off)

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.810
There are Stand users besides us at this school?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.520
Yeah. He's Toshikazu Hazamada,
a student in class 3-C.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.700
This Hazamada guy apparently got into

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.890
an argument over something silly with a 
friend right around the start of spring.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.720
One of them had insulted the other's 
favorite idol or anime or something.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.500
That night, surprisingly, the friend 
he got into the argument with

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.790
gouged out his own left eye 
with a mechanical pencil.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.170
Isn't that insane?

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.770
Apparently Hazamada's friend 
said this at the hospital:

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.320
"Next thing I knew, I was staring at my left eye, 
which I'd gouged out, with my right eye."

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.100
So you're saying that this guy gouged out

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.070
his left eye using some kind of a Stand?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.420
Could be, but maybe not.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.660
Normal people can't see Stands.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.910
Something about this is really fishy.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.590
What'd you say?!

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.610
Josuke, you've got no right to criticize me.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.830
I've got a real job now, y'know!

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.420
Huh? You've got a job?

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.270
Yes, Master Koichi! I found myself a 
little job that involves financing.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.840
Financing?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.830
You don't mean you became a loan shark, do you?

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.270
Well... It's a very reputable 
establishment, though!

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.390
Still, though, we can't just ignore this.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.500
Wait up, Josuke!

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.600
M-Master Koichi!

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.330
Are you going, too?

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.830
Just leave it to that idiot Josuke.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.800
There's something scary going on in my town.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.230
If Morioh is in danger, 
that means my parents, my sister,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.660
and everyone else important to me 
will have to face that danger.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.290
So even if it's scary, I gotta do something!

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.970
Wh...

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.660
What a tough thing to say.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.450
Nothing less from the man I've chosen to admire!

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.490
But...

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.550
I'll be heading home now!

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.640
Be safe, Master Koichi!

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.940
Yeah, totally.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.900
Looks like he's not in the classroom.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.630
But if that Hazamada guy really 
did gouge out his friend's eye

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.790
and can still blend into normal school life...

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.670
He must be one creepy guy.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.720
Hazamada

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.340
H-Hey, Josuke!

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.000
I'm gonna check out his locker. 
Watch my back, Koichi.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Tell me first before you break it!

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.810
For starters... His bag is still here.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.100
So he's still at school. Be careful.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.320
R-Right.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.480
So he's in the tennis club and likes manga.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.750
Still, this guy's got way too much stuff.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.640
I don't think the bow and arrow 
would be in here, but...

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.830
What's this wooden thing?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.460
A Sta—

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.470
N-No... This is a physical object.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.840
Is this one of those dolls they sell 
at art stores for sketching?

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.900
It scared me...

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.490
Huh?!

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.120
What? Why?!

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.620
It turned into me when I touched it.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.520
But now we know for sure...

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.750
Hazamada is a Stand user!

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.490
This is just great. You've got 
some nerve, turning into me!

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.730
You've heard of <i>Perman</i>, right?

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.670
I-It talked! It sounds and talks just like him!

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.930
You know the copy robot from <i>Perman</i>?

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.980
Isn't that thing convenient?

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.150
Don't you think it'd be great to have one around?

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.140
Hey, Koichi. What is he talking about?

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.530
What the hell is <i>Perman</i>?

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.510
You haven't heard of <i>Perman</i>?!
I can't believe it.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.160
And you call yourself Japanese?

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.250
Shut up! I'm the one asking the questions here!

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.880
M-My arm!

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.960
Josuke!

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.340
But mine is a copy doll that replicates
people I don't want around.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.100
Once it copies you, you'll
mimic all of its movements.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.020
Which means it's not a puppet,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.710
but a puppet master!

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.170
K-Koichi! Move!

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.140
Crunch

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.870
Koichi!

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.540
And one rag's been hung out to dry.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.810
Oh, but I'm not the one who did it. 
The one who did it was you, his friend.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.940
Stuff like this

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.920
pisses me off more than anything.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.180
When you don't do anything yourself,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.960
but use others to do things for you.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.560
That makes me want to kick 
your ass like nothing else!

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.190
That's just great. Tee-hee!

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.300
Looks like you're out of range.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.230
If you can't move from that spot,
your Stand can't get any closer, either.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.280
Which means if I maintain this distance,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.280
Josuke, you stand no chance against me!

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.810
This Stand's name is Show Off.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.250
By possessing a doll,
it has gained a physical form...

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.260
Which means even normal people can see it.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.450
Hazamada! You bastard!

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.070
My goal is to beat the shit out of Jotaro Kujo

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.060
and run him out of this city.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.490
He's got some nerve!

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.130
An outsider, coming here and 
trying to dig up dirt on us...

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:41.710
But I heard that his Star Platinum
can stop time for a second or two.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.720
There's no one in our group that 
stands a chance against him.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.160
That is, no one besides my Show Off,
now that it's copied you, Josuke!

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.270
I'll have to knock you out now.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.970
The genuine article would just be in the way.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.300
Squish!

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.400
Crushed, huh? That's a satisfying sound.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.220
As long as you didn't cut the nerve,
you'll be able to see again...

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.700
If you're lucky.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.640
Looks like he's gonna be out for a while.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.390
That was super easy.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.470
Hey! Pick up my bag.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.960
We're gonna go straight after Jotaro.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.470
Easy enough.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.840
I'm pretty sure the hotel that 
Jotaro's staying at is...

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.840
Squish!

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.220
Squish!

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.920
Uh...

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.450
The Morioh Grand Hotel.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.140
Yeah, that's the one.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.490
K-Koichi!

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.150
Koichi!

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.270
J-Josuke, are you okay?

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.090
Th-Thanks... But man,
you've really got some guts.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.360
Even though you're hurt, you managed 
to use your Stand to trick him.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.550
What are you talking about?

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.760
That's only because,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.080
as soon as I got hit, you fixed my 
broken bones with Shining Diamond.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.430
And, uh...

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.370
I'd appreciate it if you could fix the 
injuries I got from breaking down

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.930
the door and window right after that, too.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.280
R-Right!

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.960
Hello, this is the Morioh Grand Hotel.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.660
Oh, uh, could you put me through 
to Jotaro Kujo in Room 324?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.010
Certainly.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.320
Ugh! We have to hurry up and 
tell Jotaro about that Stand!

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.100
Thank you for waiting.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.440
The line for Room 324 is currently in use.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.100
Please wait until the 
current call is completed.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.570
The line's in use?

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.360
What?!

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.840
Of course! It must've been the copy!

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.620
It called him before I did!

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.000
Are you certain, Josuke?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.100
There's another Stand user at your school?

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.670
Yup! I'll tell you the details at Morioh Station.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.120
Please come to the station plaza.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.080
You should be able to get 
there in fifteen minutes.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.400
All right. In front of the 
station in fifteen minutes.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.070
Too easy.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.140
I-It's no use! He's not answering.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.700
He must have left the room.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.650
They must have lured him out 
to meet them somewhere!

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.820
Damn it! We're just gonna 
have to go after the copy!

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.120
I really couldn't tell the difference 
between you and the copy.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.830
Yeah. What really creeped me out

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.750
wasn't when I saw its face.
It was the fingers.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.520
You see your fingers more often 
every day than your face, right?

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.260
I could tell that it had copied me 
right down to my fingerprints.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.340
Oh!

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.100
Josuke, you're early.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.630
Where's Master Koichi?

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.870
H-Hazamada?!

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.210
What are you doing here?

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.540
Tamami Kobayashi?

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.920
You don't know why we're together?

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.240
N-No, I don't...

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.990
No idea at all?

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.630
No idea! Why?!

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.800
Then...

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.340
Good!

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.790
Hurry, please.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.280
We've got to hurry and 
catch up with Hazamada,

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.880
or Jotaro's gonna be in trouble!

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.100
9

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:13.180
9 Mi

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.270
9 Minu

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:13.350
9 Minutes

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.430
9 Minutes Le

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.520
9 Minutes Left

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:13.600
9 Minutes Left Un

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:13.680
9 Minutes Left Until

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:13.770
9 Minutes Left Until the

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:13.850
9 Minutes Left Until the Me

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.930
9 Minutes Left Until the Meet

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.980
9 Minutes Left Until the Meeting

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.060
There'll be trouble if Jotaro meets the copy!

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.380
It'll definitely be bad!

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:18.980
Yeah.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.280
I don't know what we should do,
but we need to catch up!

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.320
Bye-bye, Josuke!

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.870
See you tomorrow!

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.020
Bye!

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.520
Josuke!

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.520
Bye, Josuke!

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.540
Why the hell are you the
only one they say goodbye to?

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.130
I've never had anyone say that to me.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.720
All the girls in this school are ugly, anyhow.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.670
Josuke...

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.380
Hey, read this.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.980
B-Bye.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.440
Why the hell did you accept that?
Rip this stupid thing up!

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.820
Damn it... What the hell is the 
difference between you and me?

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.800
Why does that even matter?

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.690
Wha...

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.410
You don't have any time to waste, do you?

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.700
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?!

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.730
Ow!

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.440
You scraped your hand? That was dumb.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.150
I'm made of wood, remember?

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.730
Shut up! Get away from me!

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.070
Damn it, I'm getting pissed off.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.670
It's my own Stand, but this happens every time.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.790
The other day, I had it copy my crush, Junko,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.250
but I got pissed off because it 
kept doing things to piss me off,

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.880
so I never even got anywhere.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.030
Doesn't anyone in this world have
a decent personality? Damn it!

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.790
That stupid Josuke!

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.980
I'll hurry up and take care of Jotaro first,

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.160
then I'll crush him to bits!

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.040
I can't wait!

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.740
My bike!

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.840
It's dirty.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.550
Damn it, that dumbass! I'll kill him!

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.430
Hey, it's not like he meant it. And he'll hear you.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.390
Like I care! That's exactly why I said it.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.390
Wobbling around like that...

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.090
Man, he looks like a dying cricket.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.350
That's a good metaphor! I like it!

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.820
Yeah? It was a good description, huh?

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.870
Huh? What?

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.080
Hold him, Show Off.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.830
I'll carve him up myself.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.960
Wh-What are you doing?

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.420
You don't have to worry about that.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.290
I'm just going to make sure

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.850
that you'll never be able 
to open your mouth again.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.970
S-Stop!

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.680
A shard of glass?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.710
J-Josuke Higashikata?!

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.780
Why... And the shrimp, too?

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.240
Hazamada!

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.670
We finally caught up with you, asshole!

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.420
But did you already forget?

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:26.170
When you come face to face with 
Show Off, you become a puppet, Josuke!

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.130
Control him, Show Off!

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.380
Don't be so sure about that.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.610
Wha... That shape...

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:41.020
I didn't throw that shard to hit you.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.480
I threw it so I could put it 
back in its original form!

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.330
Swoosh

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.940
M-My right hand!

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.330
It turned back into wood!

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.620
This isn't good, Hazamada!

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.820
Calm down!

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.030
Just pretend you have 
your hand in your pocket!

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.330
No one will notice!

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.120
The real problem is

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.410
that Jotaro should arrive at the station soon!

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.750
I'm shocked that Josuke was safe,

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.440
but let's give up on beating him right now!

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.140
H-Hazamada! Wait for me!

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.510
I see...

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.890
So they're meeting him in front of the station.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.260
J-Josuke, we have no time to waste!

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.390
The way they went is the fastest 
way to get to the station!

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.720
And that's why I've got you, Koichi.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.660
Looks like Josuke's not here yet.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.410
Can you see Josuke anywhere?

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.960
Nope.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.640
If I see any sign of him, 
I'll just take control of him.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.210
Don't worry!

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:59.710
Ding Ding Ding Ding

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.020
Hazamada! A train's coming through.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.450
The railroad crossing that 
never lets you through!

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.720
We'll have to wait a minute or two...

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.050
All right. We'll go through the station building.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.980
Emergency
Stop
Button

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.980
No Crossing

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.510
Even if he catches up with us, 
the train will stall Josuke!

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.770
Just one more minute!

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.850
I'll head over to the meeting spot first!

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.670
I won!

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.050
Huh?

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.200
That's Josuke!

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.320
Wh-What happened to the train?!

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.420
Why's the crossing open?!

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.000
Hazamada, look!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.220
Wh-What the hell is that Stand?!

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.880
Ding Ding Ding Ding

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:44.490
That was great! You see? 
That's why I said I've got you.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.240
Ah! There he is!

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.740
J-Jotaro! It's me, Josuke!

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.140
Hey.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.530
We made it in time!

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.770
We got Hazamada good, didn't we, Josuke?

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.780
Did something happen?

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.040
A copy?

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.470
A Stand that copied you 
down to your fingerprints?

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:14.990
That's right!

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.520
There would have been trouble 
if he'd gotten here before me.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.990
But now we can relax.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.050
That copy bastard is missing 
his right hand, so it'll be easy.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.930
I blew off his right hand.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.690
Use that to tell us apart.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:29.860
All right.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.350
They should get here at any moment.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.680
Huh? Why do I have this thing?

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.170
Why did I get a pen out of Jotaro's pocket?

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.780
I-I can't move!

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.720
My arm just stopped moving on its own.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.200
O-On the other side of the glass...

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.720
Th-That's...

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.980
Josuke Higashikata...

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:20.900
You're gonna stab Jotaro in the head 
with that pen and kill him instantly.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:26.530
After all, if his death isn't instant,
your Shining Diamond will just fix him.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:31.590
Josuke! This is your fault 
for getting outta line!

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:37.380
I was just gonna halfway kill Jotaro 
to chase him out of town.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.410
But now you're the one who'll kill Jotaro!

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.240
It'll be all your fault!

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.310
Now! Let him have it, Show Off!

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.020
J-Jotaro...

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.420
You bastard!

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.400
Something wrong, Josuke?

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.220
Huh? No...

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.950
Looks like those guys finally found Hazamada.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.100
You little shit!

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.780
You were just across the pedestrian bridge 
at the station, just like that Josuke said.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.950
He's a great guy.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.330
He treated our wounds, and I'm not 
even sure how, but they're all better!

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.260
I'll make sure I pay you back in full for earlier.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.780
Let's take a little trip behind the restroom.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.250
That Stand is pretty 
terrifying if it catches you.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.080
Well, I guess I'll break this doll now.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.680
It'll make me feel better.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.840
Meanwhile, unknown to anyone else,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.550
Tamami was admitted to the hospital.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.650
What a fool!

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.600
Well, you have my condolences.
