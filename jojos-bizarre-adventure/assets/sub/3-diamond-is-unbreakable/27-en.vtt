WEBVTT

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.690
Arrow, where are you headed?

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.110
We're going to shoot him, too?

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.370
That young man will be the 
sixth new Stand user...

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.060
But that should be plenty.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.290
I'll be able to kill anyone who tries 
to get near my son, Yoshikage!

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.820
T<c.color6d9396>i</c><c.color709598>n</c><c.color96bcbb>g</c>

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.010
What?!

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.010
Ow.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.450
Wh-What's the meaning of this?

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.520
The arrow chose him, but it was deflected.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.700
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.700
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.600
Episode 27      I'm an Alien

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.980
That's all the information 
we were able to gather.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.940
Profile
Yoshikage Kira

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.030
It appears he's done a good job of disposing 
of all evidence of his crimes up to now.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.230
Yoshikage Kira...

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.120
What do you look like now, 
and what is your name?

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.120
Where are you?

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.990
Summer...

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.960
There are many more tourists around town now.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.590
Yeah...

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.590
I doubt that he'll be able to stay put.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.890
I'm sure he won't be able 
to resist making a move.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.350
The summer season is finally upon us.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.240
On July 1st, the beach and rivers in 
Morioh were opened to the public.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.590
There are hordes of tourists 
from the capital and S City,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.820
making the town even livelier.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.860
Relaxing at a summer villa, 
camping, fishing, yachting...

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.020
There are many fun activities 
to find here this time of year!

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.600
How are you all going 
to enjoy your summer?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.830
Yes, many fun things...

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.330
I'm sure he has

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.090
many fun things to do, too.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.740
People live while hiding what's 
deep in their hearts from others.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.890
But...

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.720
Is there anyone who has

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.530
been able to hide their true 
self from others forever?

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.790
Damn it!

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.770
I want to show that woman 
the true Yoshikage Kira.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.120
I want her to hear how 
I feel deep down inside...

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.630
That I want to take your 
slender neck into these hands

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.870
and strangle you to death.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.080
When my nails are growing, 
I become unable to suppress my urges.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.770
I just need to be patient until it subsides.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.430
I'm still not able to perfectly
mimic his handwriting.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.920
Kosaku Kawajiri

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.300
Kosaku

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.610
Josuke Higashikata... Jotaro Kujo...

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.190
It's because of them that I'm in this mess.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.510
Um...

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.610
Uh... What... are you doing?

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.750
O-Of course. It should be obvious.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.350
You were reading a book.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.660
Um, I poured some tea for you.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.150
I know you probably think that's rare,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.240
b-but if you'd like some...

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.180
If you don't want it, that's fine, too...

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.220
Oh, look at the time.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.580
I think I'll go to bed...

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.340
Open up your heart to that woman.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.100
Show her your true self,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.060
Yoshikage Kira.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.450
D-Darling?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.910
Crap. Opening up is a bad idea.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.870
They'll find out.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.620
I'm sorry I startled you.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.490
H-He was trying to undo 
the buttons in the back?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.630
"I'm sorry I startled you"?

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.290
Not at all! All of your actions lately

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.490
have been exciting me to no end!

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.960
And they make me feel thrilled! I...

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.810
I've fallen

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.680
in love with you.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.720
J-Josuke, l-look over there.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.200
What the heck is—

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.560
Is this... Could this be...

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.050
T-Terri Funk—

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.280
It's a crop circle!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.490
Yeah! A crop circle!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.170
Th-That's amazing!

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.640
I can't believe one of these 
showed up in a field in Morioh!

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.430
Something's not right, Okuyasu.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.550
Take a closer look at the middle of that thing.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.070
Something's really wrong here!

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.250
You're gonna go in?

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.240
We don't have a choice!

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.800
Be careful.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.080
Yeah.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.930
I-Is he alive?

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.900
He's got a scratch on the back of his neck,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.800
but I think he's just unconscious.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.720
Hey, wake up. Are you all right? Hey!

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.530
I've never seen him at our school.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.060
Oh, looks like he's awake.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.290
Where...

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.070
Where am I?

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.450
Where?

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.950
You're right in the middle of 
a field in Budogaoka, Morioh.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.080
Is this Earth?

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.350
Last night, I suddenly felt ill.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.310
I then lost consciousness, it would seem.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.080
It's past eight, so I was unconscious 
for thirteen Earth hours.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.190
He totally tried to pull one over us!

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.390
Damn! I can't believe you tried 
to pull such an elaborate prank!

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.790
Man, you sure got me!

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.200
You're a really funny guy!

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.860
So you made a crop circle and waited

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.230
under the grass until someone came by?

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.070
Amazing! That's amazing!

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.460
I can't breathe! My stomach hurts!

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.980
Stomach Medicine

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.260
That's so stupid!

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.720
What school do you go to?

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.540
School?

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.850
We love guys like you!

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.950
My planet is in the Magellanic Clouds,
but it has been destroyed.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.500
I came to Earth to find out

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.080
if it's a suitable place to live, 
and if the people are nice.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.990
That's enough of that. 
If you take the joke too far,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.740
you're going to ruin your own brilliant idea.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.370
Here, have a tissue.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.750
Thank you. That was quite delicious.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.110
W-We should really get to school.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.180
Y-Yeah, you're right.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.460
Let's go.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.840
That guy ate the tissue.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.140
He's a guy who takes jokes too far.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.060
The ice cream shop's closed!

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.550
And it's our only comfort on Monday mornings...

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.960
It can't be helped.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.720
Let's give up for today.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.030
Would you like some ice cream?

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.820
Well? Do you want some?

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.560
Yeah, but the shop's closed, 
so there's nothing we can do.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.330
There's no reason for you to give up.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.670
I just happen to have two.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.440
We can call it a trade for the tissue earlier.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.800
Earth seems like a very nice place to live.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.760
It's cold...

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.220
Wh-Why did you have 
ice cream cones in your bag?

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.690
Are those ice cream cones not good enough?

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.350
That's not what I'm asking! 
Who the hell are you?

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.860
I believe I told you that moments ago...

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.280
Ah! You want to hear me introduce myself?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.610
It must have slipped my mind.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.830
My name is Nu Mikitakazo Nshi.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.280
I am 216 years old.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.660
My occupation is a spaceship pilot.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.620
My hobby is having pets.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.850
I'm even currently carrying 
a house mouse in my bag.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.380
It is very happy when I pet its back.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.490
This guy's a Stand user. 
There's no doubt about it.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.270
Let's kick his ass, Josuke!

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.940
Calm down, Okuyasu.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.800
Do you really think a Stand user

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.640
would say that he's from 
the Magellanic Clouds?

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.770
Th-Then what the hell is with him?

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.770
There, there, there.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.680
I have no idea.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.430
We're gonna have to investigate.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.370
Don't eat that ice cream.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.360
Huh?!

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.410
So you're 216, you say?

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.110
Yes.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.410
Hmm...

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.410
Hmm...

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.740
And your occupation is a spaceship pilot?

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.280
Why do you keep copying me?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.960
So, what?

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.640
Are you trying to say that you're an alien?

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.100
An alien!

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.740
An alien! Yes!

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.990
I should have used that word to begin with.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.560
I'm an alien.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.990
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.920
Then, like, your... flying saucer?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.270
Could you call over your spaceship?

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.690
You can, right?

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.780
Of course.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.000
But, sadly, as it is currently on standby 
in space, 1,500,000 kilometers away,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.720
it would take about three days.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.990
I can't bring it immediately.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.430
Are you going to call it 
with that watch of yours?

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.660
Oh, how did you know?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.370
But this is a secret between us.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.620
Please don't tell anyone of this.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.670
This guy is totally messed up in the head.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.910
He wasn't joking earlier at all.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.930
He's a delusional, crazy bastard.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.360
Should I punch him?

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.870
You always want to throw punches first.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.260
Let's take it a bit further, just to be sure.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.170
Do you have, like, a ray gun and, like,

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.770
an ultra hyper anti-gravity 
device in your bag?

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.760
Of course I do.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.530
But I didn't come to Earth to fight, 
so I left them in my spaceship.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:44.510
Aw, come on. If you're an 
alien, show us something.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.980
And your blood wasn't even green.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.290
Yeah. Alien blood is always green.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.670
Do you two doubt me?

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.080
Hey, calm down.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.340
You finally got it? You moron!

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.380
I don't mind going along with pranks,

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.090
but I don't have time to deal 
with delusional freaks like you.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.150
You didn't have to just come out and say that!

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.100
Shut up! It's better to be up-front!

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.810
What? Is there a fire somewhere?

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.610
Wh-What the hell?

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.300
This sound... I don't like this sound.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.120
This sound...

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.000
Stop this sound!

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.730
I don't like this sound!

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.000
I'm allergic to it!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.340
Make it stop!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.130
Josuke, this guy's dangerous!

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.770
Let's go. We shouldn't mess with him.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.380
But don't you think

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.960
leaving him like that is a bit cruel?

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.720
He said he's allergic to that sound, 
right? Just leave him be.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.710
I'm leaving, Josuke.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.220
H-Hey!

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.730
Damn it, Okuyasu.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.360
H-Hey, you okay?

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.110
No... Please,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.490
take me somewhere I can't hear this sound...

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.660
Wh-What?!

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.460
Please take me away!

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.620
A-Are you actually...

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.130
I have a power that allows 
me to turn into anything.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.260
H-Hurry... I feel like my head 
will split open amidst this sound...

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.310
Please...

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.910
I'll turn into sneakers, so please, 
wear them and take me with you!

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.930
In return, I'll do anything for you!

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.560
Are you a Stand user?!

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.100
Whoa! Y-You're super fast!

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.450
With your powers plus my powers,

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.940
our speed and jumping strength are doubled.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.060

You...

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.640
You can't see this?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.940
He can't see it!

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.730
He's not a Stand user.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.280
Then what the hell is this power?

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.070
Who the hell are you?!

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.820
You're rather persistent, aren't you?

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.830
I told you earlier that I was an alien...

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.850
Hang on a sec.

L-Let me sort this out in my head.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.620
Anyway, you saved me by 
taking me away from that.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.880
The people on my planet can't 
stand the sound of sirens.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.090
It's a wavelength that aggravates our nerves.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.340
I'd like to do something for you 
to thank you for saving me.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.140
Shall I turn into a fan and fan you?

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.590
Or maybe a back scratcher 
so I can scratch your back?

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.390
Whoa, it's not like I saved you because 
I wanted something in return...

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.650
You'll really do anything? 
Please! Do it! Thank you!

C-Can you turn into anything?

Like something light, or multiple
 numbers of something?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.870
Yes. I can turn into almost anything.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.260
However, I cannot turn 
into complicated machinery

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.290
or anything more powerful than me.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:26.340

Yes.

I-I...

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.130
just had a brilliant idea.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.050
It's an idea that'll make everyone happy.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.890
Happy?

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:37.640
Yeah!

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.850
See, I managed to make some 
money from a lottery ticket,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.650
but my mom found out and 
froze the account I put it in.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.370
Once she finds something like that, 
there's no convincing her.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.000
It sucks not having any 
money for the summer season.

Can you turn into this? This thing.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.310
What is that?

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.370
They're dice!

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.050
I'll make some money using these,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.380
then I'll split it with you, 
and everyone will be happy!

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.710
What do you do with those?

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.340
Huh? You don't know what dice are?

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.470
I-I'm sorry...

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.660
You don't have to apologize.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.640
It's really easy. I'll show you.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.750
These are tools that people 
who like games really love.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.440
They're hard, and they have six sides.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.280
This divot represents the number one, 
and it has them from one through six.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.470
Ah, yes. I think I'm starting to understand.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.040
So when there are five divots, 
it's the number five, right?

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.610
Well done, alien!

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.640
And three divots represent a three.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.660
Yes! Try turning into one.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.080
Understood.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.420
That was simple.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.920
What are you talking about? 
You're way too big.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.800
You're only supposed to be about this big.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.590
Also, you've got five on two sides.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.010
The numbers on a die are from one through six.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.060
The numbers on one side and its 
opposite side should equal seven.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.810
Oh, pardon me.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.460
How about this?

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.400
Th-That tickles!

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.870
Hey, don't laugh. Dice don't talk.

Huh?

Come on.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.530
I-I'll do my best.

I'm a bit nervous about this, but...

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.330
Yes, you're good! Very good! This is perfect!

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.200
I'm getting excited!

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.300
Rohan Kishibe, I hope you have 
some money waiting for me!

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.300
I-I can't breathe...

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.370
Oh, look who it is.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.550
What does Josuke Higashikata want with me?

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.390
This is a rare occurrence.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.100
Did you get more information concerning Kira?

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.050
No, not exactly...

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.880
Um, well...

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.480
Are you done with work today?

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.090
I was wondering if I could have 
a peek at your next chapter...

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.270
What are you plotting?

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.530
Just spit it out.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.030
D-Damn...

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.820
I can't hide anything from you, Rohan-sensei.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.670
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.850
Please! Play Cee-lo with me!

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.550
Cee-lo?

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.300
To be perfectly honest,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.320
I have no spending money for the summer.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.080
Well, I have 30,000 yen. 
It's my life savings.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.560
But...

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.150
Nowadays, 30,000 yen is gone 
after you make one or two trips

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.320
to an amusement park and get some food.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.570
So all that's left is to make 
more money, or go flat broke.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.610
Wagering on the thrill!

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.000
Isn't that what youth is all about?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.740
That's what I think! Don't you agree?!

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.280
Look, I'll be straight with you. 
I've always disliked you.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.340
So why should I have to play Cee-lo with you?

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.290
Yeah, you're right.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.560
I'm sure you're not hurting for spending money,

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.220
so you have no reason to play.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.900
But... All right.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.170
Huh?! You'll do it?

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.170
I don't dislike games, and this seems fun.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.810
Come around to the back.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.600
Thank you, Rohan-sensei.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.700
The shooter rolls 3 dice into the bowl

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.700
This will result in paying double

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.700
This will result in winning double

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.700
The larger number wins (here, the 6)

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.370
Do these rules work for you?

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:22.700
No arguments here.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.520
Chips cost 1,000 yen each.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.420
And when you roll the 
three dice into the bowl,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.860
if even one spills out, 
you lose then and there.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.950
Got it.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.460
All right. Let's tape the rules up here.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.050
Okay, let's do this!

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.340
Wait.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.520
We won't be using your dice.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.340
Huh?!

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.630
We'll be playing with these 
dice I had in the house.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.970
U-Um, is there something wrong with my dice?

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.580
No idea. There's just something 
that I don't like about them.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.750
And...

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.980
I did say this seemed fun, 
but I wasn't talking about Cee-lo.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.860
I meant that it'd be fun taking 
your 30,000 yen from you.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.000
When you lose, you'd better pay up for real.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.790
It doesn't matter how well
acquainted we are, Josuke-kun.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.540
Yes! Those dice are the ones 
that the alien turned into!

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.350
I snuck them into your house ahead of time!

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.470
I'm such a villain.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:30.530
It won't be much, but I'll be making 
some money off of you, Rohan-sensei.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.100
Now, let's roll to see who goes first.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.690
I rolled a four.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.360
Yes!

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.350
All right, you go first. Go ahead and roll.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.180
Ow!

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:42.740
O...

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.570
O-Ow! I accidentally hit the table.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.830
Hurry up and bet and roll your dice.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.060
R-Right...

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.580
I-I'll start off with two, I think, 
so that'll be 2,000 yen.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.340
Okay, here's two.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.690
If I roll a one, a two, and a three,
I'll have to pay double,

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.090
so I really need to make sure 
I don't get one, two, and three.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.310
Better not get a one, two, and three! 
Not a one, two, and three!

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.620
I-I'll go really lightly on the first roll.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.560
Just to test the waters...

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.810
Here we go... Lightly.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.510
How's that?!

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.660
Huh?!

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.190
What?

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.560
A-An omen...

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.680
What?

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.250
Triple sixes, AKA "omen."

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.450
Josuke wins five times what 
he wagered from Rohan.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.380
S-Stupid! You're not supposed 
to start off with that!

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.340
E-Er, I mean...

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.710
I meant that was some stupid luck!

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.550
A triple six, meaning you have 
to pay five times my bet...

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.070
It almost seems like I'm cheating!

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.710
Hmph. It seems you've already earned 
10,000 yen in spending money.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.530
Let's continue the game.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:59.160
I can't believe my luck myself...

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.160
It's my turn next.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.270
I want to get back what I just lost, so I'm...

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.780
going with ten.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.280
Ten?

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.530
All right! Go!

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.280
One, two, and three. The wager is doubled!

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.160
The shooter rolls 3 dice into the bowl

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.160
This will result in paying double

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.160
Rohan has to pay Josuke double what he wagered.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.050
This is too much! This is way too much!

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.720
Does that alien not know 
what "holding back" means?

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.340
Crap... He's totally suspicious of me!
