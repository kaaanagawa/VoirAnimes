00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.120
What was it?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.630
I've had this feeling ever since last night 
that I'm supposed to do something...

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.150
Man, my shoes and bag sure feel heavy today.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.990
Huh?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.750
Th-This house...

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.170
Why?

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.640
I somehow ended up walking to
Rohan-sensei's house without realizing it.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.380
The door's open...

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.050
I'd like to stop by and 
thank him for yesterday,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.850
but then I'd be late for school.
It's probably a bad idea.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.760
He might still be asleep, 
since he's a manga artist.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.700
I really shouldn't just barge into his house.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.750
It's a bad idea...

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.410
Rohan-sensei...

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.940
He's working so frantically.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.330
But I wonder what it is...

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.360
I can't shake the feeling that
being here is actually terrifying.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850
What is it?

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.690
I'm glad you came.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.960
I've been waiting for you.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.710
You're right on time.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.710
Huh?

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.340
However, could I ask you 
to wait a little while?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.860
Two more pages, and I'll be done 
with the manuscript for next week.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.930
I think I'll be done in about twenty minutes.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.310
Twenty minutes?

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.250
Did he just say he'd finish 
two pages in twenty minutes?

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.840
Did I hear him wrong?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.320
Two totally blank pages of
manuscript in twenty minutes?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.280
No way... And he said next week's?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.830
We only just read this week's manuscript 
yesterday, and he'd just finished it.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.750
What?! You're not going to do pencils first?!

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.770
I-I can't believe it...

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.860
He didn't even draw that 
complicated story in pencil first!

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.520
It's getting more and more complete... 
And he's even drawing the backgrounds with it!

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.170
Wh-What was that just now?!

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.620
I couldn't really see it. What did he do?!

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.080
What?! H-He's doing the beta!

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.850
He's flinging ink around like shurikens,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.540
and hitting exactly the right spots 
without going out of the lines!

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.230
Th-This technique...

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.300
Aren't you supposed to fill in beta 
by hand with a brush?!

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.050
Boom

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.560
He's already done with the beta!

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.290
It's only been about two minutes 
since the page was completely white!

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.560
It's all thanks to you, Koichi.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.950
The urge to work keeps welling up in me!

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.840
I want to draw so bad, I can't help it!

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.220
I just want to keep drawing!

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.240
This is the first time I've been able

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.780
to draw nineteen pages in one night!

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.340
I'm drawing a masterpiece right now!

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.790
Your experiences are amazing!

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.290
It's because I'm using your experience 
as the source of my story, Koichi!

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.580
Huh?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.290
What...

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.230
Hurry! I want your next reality!

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.840
Let me see your next page!

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.330
The more pages I take, 
the more weight you'll lose,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.760
but you don't care, right?

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.960
Because you're going to become 
a masterpiece and live forever!

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.050
Flip

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.420
I-I remember now!

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.400
Heaven's Door!

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.990
Y-You're a Stand user!

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.660
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.660
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.340
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.340
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.670
Hey, now...

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.350
Episode 15  Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 2

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.360
I've managed to make a book

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.050
from a single panel rather 
than an entire work!

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.360
This is amazing!

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.420
I'm growing as a manga 
artist and as a Stand user!

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.410
I'm going read this now, Koichi.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.510
Oh, my...

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.260
Those faces belong to Shining 
Diamond's Josuke Higashikata

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.220
and The Hand's Okuyasu Nijimura.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.380
How curious.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.600
Why would those two be at my house?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.070
There's no way Koichi would 
tell those two about me.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.140
How strange...

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.650
Huh?

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.810
I-It's Josuke and Okuyasu!

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.660
I'm not sure how they found 
out I was here, but...

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.290
N-Now they can save me somehow!

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.530
Somehow...

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.250
I have to get them to save me!

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.590
Huh? Okuyasu and Josuke?

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.200
How did you know I was here?

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.390
Now, then...

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.040
Right now, I don't have any 
interest in Josuke and Okuyasu.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.820
I'm just going to finish up the 
last two pages for next week,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.230
and steal even more material from Koichi!

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.940
I'm so excited!

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.340
Huh? You were watching a 
manga artist do his work?

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.450
This is where that manga artist works?

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.930
Rohan Kishibe?

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.500
Is he famous or something?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.790
Have you heard of him, Josuke?

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.420
Nah. Even that bastard Hazamada

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.310
made fun of me for not
knowing what <i>Perman</i> was.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.930
That wasn't it.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.570
That wasn't what I wanted 
to say to them just now.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.510
But what was it?

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.360
Well, we were following you 
because we were worried

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.280
since you were just wandering around,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.190
but if nothing's wrong, then good. I'm relieved.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.390
Thanks.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.760
Do you want to come inside 
and watch with me?

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.520
Nah, I'll pass.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.580
I'd get nervous around somebody famous.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.800
Same here.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.260
I'm just satisfied knowing that you

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.200
didn't come here to meet some chick.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.030
See ya, Koichi.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.850
Okay.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.180
I know I'm forgetting something.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.210
I know I forgot to tell them 
something really important.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.220
I remember now!

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.260
I-I was going to ask for help!

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.500
Josuke! Okuyasu!

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.190
I'll head to school soon!

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.060
Sure!

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.540
Don't be late.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.730
Got it!

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.230
N-No!

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.640
That's not what I wanted to say!

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.680
I can not attack the manga 
artist, Rohan Kishibe

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.990
can not

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.450
It's no use! I can't ask them for help.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.320
C-Can there be a Stand as terrifying as this?!

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.250
Heaven's Door is way too strong! 
There's no way to attack it!

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.840
Scribble Scribble Scribble

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.200
Ah, I see...

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:18.060
Scribble Scribble Scribble

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.620
At this rate, he's going to rip 
everything out of me and kill me!

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.970
Stop

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.810
Someone's coming into this mansion!

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.780
What did you do downstairs just now, Koichi?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.590
Huh?

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.420
Okuyasu!

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.520
Whoa, there! Don't you dare turn around.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.180
Try anything funny, and I'll crush 
you with my Stand, you little shit.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.490
Okuyasu!

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.210
I don't know how you knew that 
I was in danger, but I'm so happy!

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.080
It appears he figured it out coincidentally.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.930
I just realized, but the wound on your hand

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.480
must have signaled him 
that something was wrong.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.880
It looks like you scratched it or 
caught it on something while crawling.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.510
I-I was so absorbed, I didn't even notice...

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.220
That's how you figured it out, 
right, Okuyasu Nijimura?

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.180
Stand name: The Hand...

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.550
You have a complex regarding
your dead brother, Keicho,

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.740
and whenever you try to make a decision,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.080
you wish that your brother were there.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.980
Wha...

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.960
What? Who the hell is this guy?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.590
Hey, Koichi, tell me what 
this guy's Stand is!

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.460
W-Well...

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.580
I-I can't!

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.800
I can't say anything that'll put 
Rohan Kishibe at a disadvantage.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.880
If you see even one panel, you lose!

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.310
I want to tell you not to look!

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.590
Don't look at that manga!

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.810
Hey, I told you not to move!

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.250
Okuyasu, I wasn't interested in you,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.740
but now that you're in 
this house, I have no choice.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.820
I'll have to turn you into material, too.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.290
You bastard!

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.300
What?!

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.330
H-He's fast!

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.920
Okuyasu!

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.020
What the hell is this?!

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.550
Josuke Higashikata,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.000
you're there, aren't you?

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:29.650
Ro

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:29.850
Rohan

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.100
Rohan Kishi

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.060
Rohan Kishibe

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:30.690
Hea

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:30.730
Heave

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:30.810
Heaven

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:30.850
Heaven's

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:30.980
Heaven's Do

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.060
Heaven's Doo

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.060
Heaven's Door

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.760
Okuyasu!

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.700
What the hell is up with this manga artist?

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.960
Oh, shut up.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.110
Now, then... Koichi, 
I have a question for you.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.830
Huh?

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.210
Why do you think Josuke Higashikata

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.330
is hiding behind that door there?

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.250
Well? What do you think?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.880
Why won't he come out, Koichi?

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:03.080
Josuke is hiding so he won't see your manga.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.600
Yes, that is correct. You're pretty smart.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.630
Okuyasu Nijimura there didn't 
know about my Heaven's Door,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.430
so I was able to trick him.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:19.490
But unfortunately, because of that, Josuke 
Higashikata now knows who I really am.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.320
On that point, I feel I'm seriously,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.480
no, without a doubt, put at 
a very big disadvantage.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.830
There's also another reason that Josuke 
Higashikata is hiding behind the door.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.080
What do you think that is?

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.630
In order to prevent that from happening,

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.630
I have to somehow drag him 
out from behind that door.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.350
He's in the middle of trying to figure 
out how he's going to kill you!

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.850
That's also true.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.640
But it's not the exact answer I'm looking for.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.560
The correct answer is...

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.770
Josuke Higashikata is contemplating whether

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.820
he should flee this mansion alone or not.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.200
Josuke would never do that!

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.010
Right, Koichi.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.600
It was written in your files that 
Josuke Higashikata's personality

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.880
would never allow him to abandon you two.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.610
But you see, manga artists 
have a habit of thinking about

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.210
every conceivable possibility 
because of their job.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.410
Like, what are all of the possible actions

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.020
that the protagonist can 
take in this situation?

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.050
In this case, having Josuke run away 
now that he knows who I really am

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.100
is truly troublesome to me.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.640
Run... Actually, that might be a good idea.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.310
He'd be able to get Jotaro,

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.450
and if Yukako finds out 
what's happening to Koichi,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.400
she'll be super pissed off.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.650
Ah! We could win with her hair!

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.910
Though I don't want to see her!

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.010
Do that, Josuke! Hurry up and let them know!

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.200
You fools!

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.330
I explained that to you 
so that it wouldn't happen!

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.890
Okuyasu! I already wrote that into your body!

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.920
Huh?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.920
I'll allow you to explain what I wrote 
in there to those two, Koichi.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.640
No!

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.260
What's written there, Koichi?

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.270
B-But that's... No...

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.860
We can't run anymore!

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.890
You can't run away from this!

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.860
I'm asking you what's written there, Koichi!

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.360
If Josuke Higashikata makes
trouble for Rohan Kishibe,
I will commit suicide
by self-immolation

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.110
If Josuke Higashikata makes
trouble for Rohan Kishibe,
I will commit suicide
by self-immolation

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.330
S-Suicide?!

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:35.830
You'll commit suicide if 
Josuke even tries to help us!

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.210
H-Hey, hey! I'll commit 
suicide by self-immolation?

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.840
Don't be stupid! Like I'd die 
in such a horrific way!

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.220
Huh?

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.770
But you will! He's invincible!

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.130
We can't defy him, no matter what!

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.560
Stop! My right hand!

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.870
So you've come out.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.770
It's not that he came out, 
but he was basically dragged out.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.620
Ah... That's rather childish and simple, 
but it might be quite effective.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.510
This room is small and 
there's nowhere to run.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.580
If you can defeat me in a single blow, 
Heaven's Door will disappear,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.890
and Okuyasu won't commit suicide.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.250
Josuke!

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.250
Closing his eyes is pretty simple, 
but it might be a good idea.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.130
As long as he doesn't see the manuscript, 
Heaven's Door is powerless.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.140
Just come charging straight in like that!

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.270
Which means...

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.420
I just need to open your eyes somehow.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.340
Oh! He was able to withstand that.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.470
This isn't good...

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.950
If he comes charging at me, I'll be finished.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.750
If I were a protagonist in a manga, 
what would I do in this situation?

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:58.710
seconds

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.940
How would I get him to open his eyes?

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.460
Go, Josuke!

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.840
Hurry up, Josuke!

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.160
I know!

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.670
There was something written in Koichi's file...

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.360
There! This is it!

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.950
I'm going to laugh at your hairstyle, Josuke!

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.820
That's from, like, twenty or thirty years ago!

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.870
You actually think that's cool?

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:22.650
How's that?

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.360
Looks like he gets angry if I say that.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.920
It's sort of hard to believe, 
but the file doesn't lie.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.200
It's 100% true.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.010
What did you say just now?

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.830
J-Josuke, calm down!

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.460
Just try and say that one more time!

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.840
You opened them...

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.250
Didn't you hear me?

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:54.030
It appears that you think 
that hairstyle is cool,

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.770
but it doesn't look good on you at all.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:57.610
It's lame!

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:04.280
Though a dirty little bird might 
like to make your head its nest.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.480
That's just a maybe, though.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.900
Heaven's Door!

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:18.990
I've won.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.600
Huh?!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.750
What?!

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.560
Wh-What was that?

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.560
I-I know that I opened his eyes 
and showed him the manuscript!

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.530
W-We're back to normal!

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.220
I'm certain that I showed it to him... Why?

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.280
Where the hell did you fly off to?!

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.740
Come back out here, damn it!

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.750
No, he totally didn't see...

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.180
He didn't see?

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.050
Do you mean that he's so worked up,

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.560
he doesn't even know what he's doing?

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.500
Where are you hiding, you dumbass?!

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.840
Get out here!

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.670
Yeah... He's the kind of guy that loses sight

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:23.450
of everything, even that manuscript, 
when someone disses his hair.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.930
I had no idea he actually got this mad.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.900
This is way worse than I imagined.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.890
What?

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.950
S-Something about Josuke's personality 
that Koichi didn't know?

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.170
That means it's information 
that's not in the file!

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.800
Why? Why does he get so 
mad about his hairstyle?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.340
There has to be a reason... Why?

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.350
I won't forgive anyone who disses my hair!

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.430
I won't keep quiet, no matter who it is!

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.880
The reason behind his hair...

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.020
I think I heard a little about it before.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.610
That just might be why...

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.610
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.820
It has to do with when 
Josuke was a kid, but...

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.170
This story is going to include my own

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.450
guesses about why this happened.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.040
Apparently, when Josuke was four,

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.840
he passed out from an 
inexplicable high fever,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.390
and for fifty days, they weren't
sure whether he'd live or die.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.390
Josuke...

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.490
He found out later that it 
was right around the time

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.360
when Jotaro and Mr. Joestar

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.660
went to Egypt to defeat the man named DIO.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.360
But at the time, they had 
no idea it happened,

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.810
so Josuke's mom drove him 
to a hospital in S City.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.490
But on that day, Morioh was hit with 
its worst blizzard in 18 years.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.910
It's no use... What should I do?

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.920
Cars don't come by here often,

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.600
and there are no pay phones.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.200
I should have called an 
ambulance at the house.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.820
I shouldn't have brought 
Josuke out in this snow.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.960
That's when it happened.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.310
Wh-What do you want? Go away!

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.190
That kid is sick, right?
I'll push your car for you.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.450
Huh?

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.040
Hurry up and
step on the gas.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.420
Once you get moving,
don't stop. Just keep going... 
Or your tires will get stuck in the snow again.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.110
O-Okay...

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.230
Thank you!

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.080
His mom looked for that boy later,

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.110
but couldn't find a single lead.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.960
Though the boy didn't personally
save Josuke's life,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.350
the four-year-old Josuke 
thought that what the boy did

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.230
made him his hero.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.530
He's an inspiration that's 
burned into his heart,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.330
and his example of how to live.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.840
So when someone insults that,

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.560
something deep in his heart snaps.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.040
I don't know who he is,

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.060
but I admire him so much 
that I copied his hairstyle.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.650
And I won't forgive anyone who insults it,

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.630
because it's the same as insulting him.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.690
I think that story might be the reason.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.610
Though I thought Josuke was making it up,

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.190
so I wasn't listening very carefully.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.790
Huh... I had no idea something 
like that happened.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.630
Rohan's holding a pen!

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.060
Bastard! You're going to try again?!

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.260
N-No...

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.890
I-I wanted to sketch this and write
a memo before I lost consciousness.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:36.210
What a wonderful story! And I just 
experienced something amazing.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.520
I'm so happy.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.580
I don't get to experience 
something like this often.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.400
If I can make it work in my own project...

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.970
I'm so lucky.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.780
I'm so glad I moved to Morioh.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.260
It's no use.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.650
Until he dies, he'll keep trying 
to use anything as material

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.830
for his manga, no matter how 
horrible the experience.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.610
At this point, you have to commend him.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:01.670
Putting good and bad aside, 
I have to admire that attitude.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.280
He really is a super manga artist.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.300
There you are, manga artist!

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.950
I'm not done punching you!

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.180
You sort of have to commend him, too.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.810
Y-Yeah...

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:25.180
Sorry!
