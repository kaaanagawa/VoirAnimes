WEBVTT

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.830
So that guy, Hazamada, says

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.360
he doesn't know anything 
about the electric bastard

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.880
that killed my big bro?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.580
Yeah. He said he's only ever 
talked to him on the phone.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.300
And you believed him, Josuke? 
Did you torture him?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.390
If Hazamada actually knew who that guy was,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.470
he would probably have
already come to silence him.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.250
R-Right... Just like my big bro.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.470
Yeah. Seeing as how Hazamada is alive,
that proves he really doesn't know.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.230
But Hazamada did say this...

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.480
Stand users, for some reason, seem to 
be unknowingly drawn to one another,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.080
even if they don't know each other.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.480
They say that you're bound to 
the person that you're going

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.610
to marry by the red string of fate, right?

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.890
It's sort of like that.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.240
You just end up eventually meeting them.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.440
They might be an enemy, a friend, 
the guy who steps on your foot on the bus,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.380
or someone who just moved in next door.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.480
You just don't know.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.590
Morioh's not very big...

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.210
I don't know how many Stand 
users are in this town right now,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.220
but no matter how they try to hide, 
they'll eventually show themselves.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.800
He knows that's going to happen eventually.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.110
He wants you to disappear.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.810
Damn it.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.640
What a coward.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.880
He needs to attack us already!

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.260
But that also means that he's cautious.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.700
When guys like that attack,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.720
it's probably only when they're 
certain they're going to win.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.850
Oh?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.000
Hey, that's Koichi.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.380
Why's he trying to act all cool, drinking tea?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.130
Hey, Ko—

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.220
What?!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.970
A... A girl?!

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.900
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.900
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.750
Episode 8  Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 1

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.180
Koichi, was me asking 
you to come here, um...

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.470
a bother?

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.640
Huh? No, it's not a bother...

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.230
But I was wondering what you needed.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.340
Wow, so Koichi's with a girl...

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.930
That chick's in my class! 
Her name is Yukako Yamagishi.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.110
All right! Let's get a bit closer!

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.520
If you wanted to see my 
notes on some homework,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.500
my grades aren't that good, 
and my handwriting's messy.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.410
If it's money, I can probably 
manage about 1,000 yen...

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.870
Or did you want me to switch 
weekly duties with you?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.830
That's not what this is about.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.050
Huh? It's not? Then what is it?

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.760
If you need someone to take 
in a kitten or a puppy,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.430
we've already got a dumb 
dog named Police at home.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.800
Koichi!

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.010
I'm just going to come out and say it.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.890
Koichi...

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.770
I'm in love with you, Koichi.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.440
Huh?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.440
What?!

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.750
U-Um... Uh, um... Wh-What?!

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.120
You're the only thing I think 
about all day, Koichi.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.050
I've been so afraid to 
express these feelings...

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.500
But if I don't, I feel like 
my chest is going to burst.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.430
I don't mind if you hate me.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.210
I just thought I'd be brave and tell you.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.350
Wh-What is going on? Did someone 
just confess her love to me?!

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.510
To me?!

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.390
I can't believe it, but she 
did just say that, right?

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.140
I-I'm so happy...

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.420
Why is it Koichi? You can't 
be serious! Come on!

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.170
Even I've never had anyone tell me that!

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.700
You don't have to cry about it.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.580
But seriously? I'm surprised, Koichi...

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.290
I'm sure that you must have 
a girlfriend, Koichi...

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.540
Huh? I-I don't...

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.000
But, um... Are you making fun of me?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.630
I'm serious!

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.940
Koichi, your face has gotten sharper lately.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.640
You look like a man with 
courage and conviction.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.770
But you're also so cute when you smile.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.000
Yeah, she's definitely got a point.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.190
My face is pretty sharp too, isn't it?

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.030
I think the best thing 
about a man is his future.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.470
And Koichi, your future is shining.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.710
Wh-When you speak that highly of me...

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.200
I'm sure you must hate girls 
like me that aren't cute.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.210
Huh? Not cute? That's not true...

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.700
Damn it, she <i>is</i> cute!

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.480
Just say yes already!

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.090
That bastard has all the luck!

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.340
Do you hate me?

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.970
Huh? Uh, n-no, I don't, but...

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.810
Then do you love me?

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.060
Huh? Wait a sec... It's just that, um...

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.020
So you do hate me...

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.650
Huh? That's not it!

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.400
It's just, when you ask me that so suddenly—

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.550
Which is it?! Do you love me or don't you?!

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.560
Just answer me already!
I've already told you so much!

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.660
I spilled my coffee! This is all your fault!

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.420
Um... I just got all worked up...
I-I'm sorry. I'm just...

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.030
By the way, you will come 
see me again, right?

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.780
Y-You know... I feel like a 
balloon that's been deflated.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.540
All my jealousy just flew away somewhere.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.710
Y-Yeah...

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.030
Let's just pretend we never saw anything.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.320
Yeah.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.870
What's wrong with this cola?!

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.460
Th-Th-There's so much... <i>hair</i> in it!

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.960
Stand users are drawn to one another...

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.040
Nah, it couldn't be.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.000
Chemistry Lab

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.550
It's me, Koichi.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.020
Y-Yukako!

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.400
What are you doing?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.480
Um, as you can see,
it's my turn to clean the lab.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.100
Fourth period was chemistry lab.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.410
Ah...

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.540
Koichi...

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.410
I said some weird things yesterday.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.540
Would you just forget all that?

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.260
I get that way when I think too hard.
It's so embarrassing.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.550
People are supposed to be more broad-minded.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.800
Uh, r-right...

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.770
It was a little surprising,
b-but I didn't think anything of it...

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.520
Will you still be friends with me?

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.400
O-Of course! I would be honored, yes!

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.890
Thank goodness.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.260
I was so worried about 
what I'd do if you hated me,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.080
I couldn't sleep all night.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.750
That's a bit dramatic.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.830
And to make it up to you... Here.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.990
I was up until this morning 
knitting this for you, Koichi.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.790
Thank goodness! It's a perfect fit!

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.460
I knew your height and chest size, but
I was worried how it would fit your shoulders.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.580
Charm

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.160
I made you a good luck charm, too...

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.510
In hopes that you'll find a wonderful love.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:03.930
I also prepared lunch so we 
could eat it together...

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.610
I bought this shrimp at the 
fish market this morning.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.570
You can't find this freshness at a store.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.420
See this flounder meuniere?

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.570
I personally took out all of the 
bones, one by one, with tweezers.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.690
Here. Say, "Ah."

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.700
Ahh...

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.740
There's one thing I know now...

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.040
Yukako Yamagishi, to be completely 
honest, is extremely strange!

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.330
Ahh...

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.170
I have to hurry up and turn her down!

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.600
B-But if I eat this, it'll be like saying yes...

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.630
Ahh!

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.500
But if I refuse it, she'll probably get mad.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.970
What should I do?!

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.950
Hirose!

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.800
Why are you wasting time?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.480
You need to hurry up and throw this 
garbage away before class starts.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.780
I-I'm saved!

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.980
R-Right! Right!

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.920
I-I'd better go throw it away.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.820
Ugh, you're useless.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.370
Here, give me that.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.700
I'll hold half of it for you.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.380
Huh? N-No, I'd feel bad...

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.410
Just give it to me!

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.410
I'm the class rep, so I'm 
the one who'll get yelled at.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.090
Jeez!

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.260
S-Sorry...

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.950
Hey, you.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.720
Would you stop bothering Koichi?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.500
Koichi? You mean Koichi Hirose?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.360
I haven't the slightest idea 
what you're talking about.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.980
I know what you're doing.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.240
The stench of a homewrecker is all over you.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.860
Homewrecker?! What are you talking about?

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.870
Listen well. If you ever 
come close to Koichi again,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.300
I'll make sure you regret it.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.330
Just one second.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.210
I tried to be classy about this, but...

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.710
Koichi Hirose?

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.590
I couldn't care less about him!

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.220
You have no right to tell me what 
the hell I can or can't do!

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.340
Dumbass!

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.840
Ow!

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.790
What was that?

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.780
What the hell is her problem?!

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.900
She's not right in the head. 
She actually likes Hirose?

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.570
Hmph. Hilarious. I'll tell the whole school!

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.950
Huh?

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.450
What is that?

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.750
Something's hot... Something's wrong.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.480
Something's not right...

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.460
It's insanely hot...

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.470
W-Water!

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.970
S-Someone! I need w-wa...

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.690
Hey, Josuke...

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.860
Looks like Yukako Yamagishi 
really was a Stand user.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.450
Her Stand has hair that moves.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:12.460
Yeah. But it doesn't seem like she's
an enemy, or going to attack Koichi.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.420
By the way, Okuyasu, what are 
you gonna do about her hair?

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.470
I can't fix something after 
your The Hand takes it away.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.320
She can't complain. I saved her 
from getting burnt to a crisp.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.350
Sorry, but I'm not a beautician.

Quiz 2     Koichi Hirose

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.540
This is my English test from earlier.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.840
I'm worrying so much about Yukako,
I can't concentrate on anything else.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.800
Even I did better! I only got 32 points, though.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.380
To be honest, I was a little happy at first.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.160
I'd never had a girl tell me she loved me before.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.390
I get that. I totally get that! 
So much it hurts!

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:18.500
But I'm the one who let it come to this 
by not being up-front with her.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.740
I'm thinking about telling her straight

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.170
that I don't like her or anything, 
so she needs to leave me alone.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.240
That's not a good idea, Koichi.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.610
If you say that, you're only going to add 
fuel to the flames of Yukako's passion.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.240
You'll piss her off.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.120
Y-You think so?

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.600
Of course! Listen.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.000
Convincing Yukako Yamagishi not to use 
her Stand of hair for evil will have to wait.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.520
Right now, we have to figure out 
how to make her not hate you.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.390
But how?

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.870
No matter how strongly she feels about you,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.710
if she gets an idea in her head that you're 
a disenchanting, horrible, boring guy,

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.240
everything will be happily ever after, right?

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.470
Y-Yeah...

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.600
So you've just got to act that
way on purpose in front of her.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.370
Yeah, that totally makes sense!

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.900
You're so smart, Josuke.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.320
Thanks!

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.950
But hearing that from you doesn't 
make me feel better.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:21.290
I wonder what I need to do to 
make Yukako think I'm terrible.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:26.920
Well, most girls aren't into
bad hygiene or mama's boys.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.190
I-I don't want her to think I'm a mama's boy!

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.470
She might get mad at my
mom and put her in danger!

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.690
Then it's bad hygiene for you!

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.480
Starting today, no more baths.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.120
Huh?!

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.740
Yeah, and don't brush your teeth
or change your underwear.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.860
How about getting some lice 
or spiders in your hair?

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.980
Having smelly socks is pretty bad.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.800
Maybe you should fart everywhere.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.530
Yeah, she'll totally hate that!

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.940
Stop messing around! I'm serious about this!

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.050
I'm being serious, too!

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.040
You need a snotty nose and some drool, too.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.790
What?!

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.040
If you don't want to do that, 
then you need to become a guy

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.930
who seems like he doesn't have a future.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.430
You need to make her give up on you.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.690
We'll help you out. All right?

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.180
Okay...

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.860
What? Koichi Hirose did that? Unbelievable!

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.310
He was really shoplifting? That's awful.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.870
Yeah! Koichi said so himself.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.650
He was talking about it like he was proud of it.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.690
You know what else?
Koichi never keeps his promises.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.500
I lent him money, and he never paid me back.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.490
He cheats on his tests
and steals girls' underwear.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.000
He's got no future. He's gonna 
bring about his own downfall.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.770
I'm gonna stop hanging out with him.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.510
I'll cut ties with him, too.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.030
Man, that girl is intense.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.980
Now as long as Koichi confirms he 
did all of this stuff by tomorrow,

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.780
she'll give up.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.990
Josuke, Okuyasu...

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.250
I hope they did a good job with all that stuff.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.520
I hope she actually gives up on me.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.260
What is that?

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.940
My eyes are closed... Is this a dream?

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.530
A woman?

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.530
I-It's Yukako!

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.890
I can't believe this. She's even 
showing up in my dreams...

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.300
I can't rest at all!

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.910
It appears that your friends don't 
think too highly of you, Koichi.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.430
But don't worry. You have me.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.810
I'll properly discipline you and 
make you into a fine man.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.970
You have something that other men don't.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.280
You must live up to that potential.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.540
J-Josuke! This totally backfired!

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.730
Where am I?

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.210
Koichi, are you hungry?

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.230
Breakfast will be ready shortly.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.240
O-Okay...

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.990
She has that hair Stand...

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.320
I'm going to have to wait for a chance to run.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.900
That's my only hope!

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.750
Th-There's something I want to ask you.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.740
Yes?

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.750
Your hair last night... Wh-What was that?

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.880
Did that startle you?

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.800
Of course. I guess anyone who 
suddenly saw that would be.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.260
Around February of this year,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.810
someone shot an arrow through my chest.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.980
No, that might have been a dream.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:53.430
When I woke up, my wound was healed, 
and I was able to do that...

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.820
Keicho Nijimura!

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.290
D-Do you know anyone else who 
can do anything like that?

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.470
No.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.080
She hasn't realized that I'm a Stand user!

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.750
Now, have a seat. You're a growing boy.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.580
If you don't get proper nourishment,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.090
you can't become a fine man for me.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.300
I-I just need to play along with her for now.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.010
Wow, this looks delicious! I'm digging in!

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.340
You're not eating just yet, Koichi.

Koichi Hirose

You got a 16 on your English exam.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.980
Even if a man is more than just 
his brains, this is just awful.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.150
I've decided to have you study while you eat.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.140
Understand?

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.470
I'm going to give you some questions.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.420
You'll choose the correct 
answer from boxes A, B, and C,

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.760
and you'll eat what's inside your chosen box.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.870
W-Wait a sec...

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.280
You're going to do this!

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.380
While you live in this house, everything 
we do must be for your betterment!

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.490
Right?

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.850
Here's your question.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:04.380
Prince often sings the lyric "funky music." 
What does that mean in Japanese?

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.700
Wild Music

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.730
A: Wild music.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.950
B: Primitive music.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.590
Primitive Music

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.520
C: Fantasy music.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.510
Fantasy Music

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.630
I-If I disobey, I'll be in trouble...

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.190
B-But I have no idea what the answer is.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:23.200
I have a feeling it's A,
but B and C also sound right.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.200
Whatever, I'll just pick one.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.980
I think it's B...

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.210
Squee! You're right!

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.000
I'm so happy! This box contains boiled eggs!

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.940
I'll peel them for you. 
You want some salt, right?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.310
By the way, if you had chosen box A, 
I would have had you eat this eraser.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.930
Wild Music

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.220
Huh?!

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.390
Box C contained soap.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.820
Wh-What?!

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.480
Next, you'll be able to eat 
bacon and eggs. Do your best.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.180
Question:  How is "contrast" (<i>taisho</i>) 
written in Japanese?

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:07.870
Is it <i>taisho</i> A, <i>taisho</i> B, or <i>taisho</i> C?

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.260
Taisho

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.890
Taisho

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.860
Taisho

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.430
Sh-She's serious...

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.870
If I choose the wrong box, she'll definitely 
make me eat what's in there...

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.090
Come on, hurry up and answer!

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.750
The food will get cold.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.510
U-Um, uh...

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.010
What am I going to do? This is ridiculous...

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.890
I-I think it's C...

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:41.520
Koichi, you just chose your answer by
watching the look on my face, didn't you?

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.400
Huh?!

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.280
So the rumors about you being someone

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.380
who's sneaky and shoplifts and 
cheats on his tests is true!

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.390
As punishment, I'll have 
you eat both A and B.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.710
A is English vocabulary corn flakes.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.480
B is asparagus wrapped in pages 
from an English dictionary.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.580
I'm going to make sure 
you learn while you eat!

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.550
Here!

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.180
Open your mouth! I'll feed it to you.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.820
What's the matter? Eat!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.690
No way! You expect me to put up 
with this?! I can't take it anymore!

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.440
I'm outta here!

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.410
I-I'm being pulled! By my scalp!

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.320
Th-There's moving hair mixed in!

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:34.610
That's right. I had planted a few hundred 
strands of my hair in your scalp.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.400
Koichi,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.030
you may come to hate me.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.720
But once you leave this house,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.580
you'll see a much better man in the mirror,

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.970
and I know you'll thank me.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.170
You'll realize that you need 
a woman like me in your life.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.480
You won't be able to live 
without Yukako Yamagishi.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.650
And just so you know, until you 
finish eating plates A and B,

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.860
you won't be getting the next dish.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.490
This is some company president's holiday villa.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.720
No one will come here until summer.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.080
S-Summer?!

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.000
Even then,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.630
it doesn't matter if anyone comes...

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.610
Because love is invincible.
