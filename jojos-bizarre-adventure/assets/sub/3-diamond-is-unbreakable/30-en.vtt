00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.990
All of Kosaku Kawajiri's shoes 
are a bit big for my own feet.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.950
I need to switch them with

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.870
shoes that fit me, before they 
start to suspect something.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.520
Hayato.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.800
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.820
Have a good day.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.510
Darling!

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.520
Something terrifying 
happened in the basement!

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.530
It was so scary! I thought I was going to die!

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.300
It might have been scary,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.520
but it gave me an excuse 
to dive into the arms

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130
of the one I love so much.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.530
Like that, and that, and that!

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.170
You see... There's a cat I've never
seen before in the basement!

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.310
A cat?

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.680
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.680
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.830
Episode 30     Cats Love Yoshikage Kira

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.490
So the reason it was really scary...

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.350
I went down to the basement

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.180
because I ran out of mineral water.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.300
And you know how much I love cats, right?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.180
So I was like, "Oh, it's a British Blue."

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.140
It had perfect proportions,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.270
and golden eyes contrasting with 
its velvet-like, blue-gray fur.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.290
Where did you come in from?

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.780
You cute little kitty...

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.430
Oh, dear. It's being defensive.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.080
It must have come in from there.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.790
But I can't let it stay down here forever.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.550
It might pee on the potato 
sack it's sitting on,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.890
and it might even have fleas.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.440
It's okay to get closer if you 
don't make eye contact, right?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.600
Oh, right. I just need to let it 
know that I'm not its enemy.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.610
See? My belly's up, which 
means I'm being submissive.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.240
Let's be friends.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.900
Why am I trying to humor a cat?

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.640
If you don't get out of here, 
I'll hit you with this!

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.500
You hear? I'll throw it!

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.420
Darn it!

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.930
Why, you!

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.310
It was clinging to the ceiling 
like some kind of bug!

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.260
A-And what really creeped me out was

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.020
that the cat had a hole in its throat.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.740
A hole about as big as a one-yen coin!

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.970
And then, from the hole, I heard...

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.690
Mreow

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.720
A hole?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.750
Could it be a hole from the arrow?

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.960
I just frantically waved 
the broom around and ran.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.560
Please, could you go check it out? 
It was really creepy.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.360
It had a hole... right?

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.350
Hey... Is it gone? Did it run away?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.300
No... It's dead.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.270
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.850
W-Wait...

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.520
One of the shards went right into its throat.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.280
Wait a minute! I was just—

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.750
It was an accident.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.660
It's no one's fault. It was just bad luck.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.420
It's not your fault.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.640
It's no one's fault.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.420
Apparently it had a hole in its throat, but...

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.020
Now there's no way to tell if 
it was a Stand user or not.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.510
No, I'm sure it wasn't...

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.380
Good morning, Morioh.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.380
Isn't it a refreshing morning, 
now that the rain's stopped?

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.090
I just saw a rainbow in the sky

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.390
before I came into the studio.
Is it still out there?

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.130
"Where am I, mrowr?

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.940
What am I doing here? 
Meow, meow," he thought.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.000
"Two days go, someone 
attacked me with an arrow,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.130
and I survived that, but..."

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.410
"M-My body's different from usual!

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.970
It's shaped funny! It's all wrong!

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.720
Why can't I move from here?" 
he thought, bewildered.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.480
Where did he bury it?

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.460
I'm so sorry, kitty. Please rest in peace.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.180
"Who's this human lady?

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.720
I get a bad feeling from her," he thought.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.190
"The broom! That's it! Now I remember!

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.690
This woman...

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.570
That's right! A whole bunch of glass 
stabbed me, and I couldn't move!

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.800
The reason I'm like this now

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.070
is because of this woman!" 
he thought angrily.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.110
He was perplexed.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.410
"What? Something came out.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.010
When I got angry at that woman, 
something just came out."

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.840
My toenail? Wh-Why?!

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.600
Is it a curse? C-Could it be that cat?!

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.640
He lived by his desire and instinct,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.330
so he understood this power, 
as well as how to use it.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.150
That's... a Stand user!

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.110
Why is this thing growing from 
where I buried the cat yesterday?

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.420
Just what is this thing?

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.870
What did it do to that sparrow?

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.050
I couldn't see an actual Stand.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.840
The most important thing is whether
that thing is an enemy or not.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.060
Is it an enemy who wishes 
to harm me, or is it...

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.820
I should probably kill it, just in case.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.990
It fell asleep after eating.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.740
Is it a plant or an animal?

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.780
It'd be easy to kill it,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.710
but it might be worth 
watching for a while.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.830
The way it turned around because 
it thought it was being called

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.890
is almost like a cat, as well...

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.400
The fact that it can't resist trying 
to smell me is also like a cat.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.270
It looks like it might be okay to pet it.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.400
The way it's purring creepily

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.380
as it's about to fall asleep 
is also, indeed, like a cat.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:24.410
But I'm still not sure if it has 
any hostility toward me or not.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.160
Let's find out.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.850
Hmm... It's angry,

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.620
but this confirms that it doesn't 
have any hostility toward me.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.160
This is definitely the cat that 
I buried here yesterday.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.190
So it really did have a hole
in its throat from the arrow!

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.230
D-Darling?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.100
The woman!

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.720
That place scares me.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.360
That's where my toenail came off...

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.690
This cat attacked her because 
it had a grudge against her!

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.580
If she found out about this thing...

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.650
That rumor might eventually reach 
Jotaro Kujo and the others!

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.510
That would definitely be bad news!

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.110
That's where you buried the cat, right?

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.850
It seems like it's cursed, 
so I'm really scared...

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.690
I didn't bury it here. 
Go back into the house.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.970
You're lying!

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.650
You're lying out of consideration 
for me, aren't you?

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.010
Crap! This cat means me harm, after all!

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.760
I still don't know what kind 
of Stand ability it has,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.120
but I'm going to get rid of it.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.500
Deadly Queen!

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.840
I feel bad for you, but I'm going 
to blow you up with this.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.380
First bomb, switch on!

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.070
What?!

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.560
Impossible! There's no way it can be a dud!

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.880
Is it because of this thing?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.550
Is this thing's ability 
keeping it from exploding?

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.030
Huh? Is that a plant?

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.860
Th-That plant is moving!

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.730
I told you to go back into the house!

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.030
Huh?

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.200
Shinobu!

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.550
The moment Deadly Queen's bomb moved 
away from that thing, it went off!

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.710
Could this thing's ability be...

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.010
The plant that was a cat 
until yesterday thought,

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.800
"I'm going to kill that woman!"

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.770
I can't allow you to attack her anymore.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.810
I'm going to have to make you disappear.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.310
"Then I'll just have to kill this man 
who's getting in my way, too!"

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.950
The only time the bomb doesn't explode 
is when there's no air around it.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:07.700
This plant instinctively knew 
just how it should kill him.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.330
Could its Stand ability be the 
ability to control air freely?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.900
It's coming!

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.800
I can't see it, but it released something again.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.550
Deadly Queen!

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.180
It is releasing something. It's air!

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.220
It's releasing bubbles of air!

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.540
You damn cat! I'll crush you!

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.220
I can't touch it!

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.940
It's like I'm stepping on an invisible balloon!

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.240
It really is controlling the air.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.610
What?

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.580
Th-That thing...

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:57.210
I can't see it, but I'm sure it 
released an air bubble again.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.920
This isn't good... Something isn't right!

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.710
What?

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.550
The cactus!

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.470
Sh-Shinobu!

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.930
What is this? Was I, 
Yoshikage Kira, just relieved

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.340
at the fact that the cactus 
needles didn't pierce her eyes?

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.470
What is this feeling?

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.570
Am I actually worried about someone else?

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.150
No!

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.460
I'm just worried that if this 
woman dies, Jotaro Kujo

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.470
will find out about this house!

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.420
That's the only reason I was 
relieved that she was okay.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.870
That's all it is...

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.460
That attack won't work anymore.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.480
Even though I may not be able to see it,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.300
now that I know the mystery behind it...

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.890
It's just an ability that allows you 
to blow and spread air bubbles.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.460
You are no longer a match for Deadly Queen.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.660
What?!

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:14.540
Th-This thing just... 
put an air bubble into my veins!

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.450
It's rising higher and higher into my body!

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.210
I'm not that knowledgeable 
in medicine, but I've heard

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.020
that if you inject more than 10cc 
of air into a human being's veins,

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.260
it can block the vein and lead to death.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.890
This is definitely more than 10cc!

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:32.930
Shit!

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.350
It's no use! This is bad...

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.480
I have no choice... I have to do it.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.110
Deadly Queen!

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.850
I underestimated that thing.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.250
Its ability to freely control the air...

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.790
It's a terrifying ability. 
Wh-What should I do?

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.040
It's coming! It's going to attack again!

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.050
What should I do?

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.790
That was close...

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.630
For now, I guess I'll let this go.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.920
I'll let this go.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.370
S

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:36.490
St

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:36.580
Str

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:36.660
Stra

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:36.790
Stray

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.870
Stray C

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.080
Stray Ca

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.000
Stray Cat

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:37.660
A

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:37.700
A Plant

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:37.790
A Plant That

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.870
A Plant That
Was

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.910
A Plant That
Was Once

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.990
A Plant That
Was Once a

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.000
A Plant That
Was Once a Cat

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.960
He told me yesterday that he buried 
that cat's corpse far away.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.000
The cat's curse, as he said,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.700
was just an illusion my mind 
came up with out of fear.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:58.200
I suddenly fainted in front of him...
It was so embarrassing.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.220
But...

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.500
He took care of me, even though 
it made him late to work.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.300
I was so happy.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.970
It felt like our hearts were connected.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.200
That was the happiest morning of my life.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.400
Well? Is it good?

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.980
That Hayato...

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.920
He left without saying goodbye again.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.450
Was that brat observing me?

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.350
Oh, darling!

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.910
That's my plate.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.800
You don't like shiitake mushrooms, 
so I took them out of yours...

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.980
When did you start liking them?

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.270
You've already eaten more than half of it.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.370
But I'm happy to see you 
gobbling down my cooking.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.370
I guess you realized that you only 
thought you didn't like them, huh?

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.010
Yes.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.870
All right, I'm going.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.210
Have a good day, darling.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.730
Jeez... I wanted him to 
give me a goodbye kiss.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.340
But we're understanding 
each other's feelings.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.820
I'll seduce him soon enough.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.510
He was using a shoehorn 
to put on his shoes.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.370
I'm sure he put on the 25.5cm sized shoes.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.880
Having two different sizes of shoes is weird.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.650
It's also weird that Mom and 
Dad are getting along lately.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.950
He was even gobbling up the shiitake
mushrooms that he hates.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.760
This is weird, too.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.430
Why was he writing his own name over and over?

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.850
And last night...

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.940
No matter how many times 
I see it, that's potting soil.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.200
And I think the other thing 
he has is a bag of cat food.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.700
And then he goes inside his closet...

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.020
They're all wearing hats.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.110
Do they have to wear those for school?

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.000
Something doesn't feel right...

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.220
The attic?

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:20.820
Wh-What is that bizarrely shaped thing?

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.390
It's too dark for me to see it clearly.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.650
There it is. It's that bag.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:40.900
Huh?

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.400
Wha—

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.210
I-It's moving!

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.830
It's not a plant... Those are eyes!

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.380
It has eyeballs, and it's looking this way!

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.800
Could that cat food be for this thing?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.050
Oh, darling.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.470
What's the matter?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.560
Did you forget something? 
Oh, is the thing you forgot

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.840
my goodbye kiss?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.750
No...

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.280
Aww...

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.390
Then what is it? Shall I get it for you?

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:14.900
No, I'll get it.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.030
Why is he back?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.400
Crap!

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.740
Huh?!

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.300
What?! Th-This thing...

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.550
Something I can't see that's inflated,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:35.420
like some kind of air bubble, 
has my arms and neck pinned down!

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.970
He's coming up! C-Crap!

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.470
The attic! I knew it! That brat...

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.520
I-It attacked me when I 
tried to shut the window?

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.940
Does this thing need sunlight to move?

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.640
I-I know! If they're air bubbles...

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.830
Yes! So it was the sunlight.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.790
That noise...

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.320
Did Stray Cat wear itself out trying to

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.500
get the cat food from the shelf using air?

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.010
I thought it would stay calm if 
there was no sunlight hitting it,

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.660
but I guess a tiny bit of light was coming in.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.910
Still...

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.280
I thought that maybe Hayato 
had gotten in here,

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.200
but it appears that it was, thankfully, 
just my imagination.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.880
If that brat knew the truth about me,

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.130
I would have had to kill him.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:19.460
He has Dad's face, 
but that's not my dad. Who...

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.670
Wh-Who the hell is he?!
