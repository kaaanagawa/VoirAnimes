WEBVTT

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.250
Josuke, how long are you 
going to be playing that?

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.400
If you don't turn off that video game now,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.890
I'm gonna shut it off myself.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.230
Just five more minutes! Please!

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.400
Just let me play for five more minutes!

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.490
This is the most exciting part!

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.080
If I stop right now,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.940
I'll be a man who couldn't accomplish 
the one thing he set out to do,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.160
Come on! If you don't quit,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.160
and I'll regret it the rest of my life!

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.870
Do you really want your son 
to end up like that, Mom?!

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.870
the kicks are just going to get harder!

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.790
How long can you put up with this?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.050
I-It's over...

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.060
D'oh.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.250
Now, put that away and do your homework.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.050
And take off your damn 
uniform when you're at home.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.220
It's nighttime!

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.320
I won't be able to see you anymore.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.180
Why, Sachiko? Don't you love me?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.390
Weird. I thought I turned it off.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.330
That's not it. I'm thinking about leaving town.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.200
And you want to forget about me?

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.860
Huh? It won't turn off.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.040
Looks like Jotaro Kujo's not leaving town...

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.030
Even though I warned him all those times.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.630
Well, what's the deal, Josuke Higashikata?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.330
You're...

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.700
Chili Pepper?!

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.410
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.410
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.250
Episode 11  Chili Pepper, Part 1

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.260
Why'd you come here?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.520
Don't ask that now.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.560
I've been stopping by here every 
now and then for a while now.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.530
What?

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.890
So this bastard's been 
watching me for a long time?

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.350
I've been frequently going to visit Okuyasu,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.840
the younger brother of Keicho,
whom I got rid of,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.240
and I'm very familiar with Koichi Hirose's 
Reverb and Yukako Yamagishi, as well.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.010
And I know that Toshikazu Hazamada

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.160
and Tamami Kobayashi are 
both in the hospital.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.720
What I'm asking you is what are you 
actually doing in front of me,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.630
when all this time you've been 
sneaking around like a gutless coward?

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.430
I doubt this is it,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.510
but you're not dumb enough to actually 
think you're going to kick my ass, are you?

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.140
Kick your ass?

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.100
I'd never do anything that awful to you.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.600
I'm here to kill you painlessly.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.610
I just can't laugh at your 
sad excuse for a joke,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.260
good sir.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.870
I told Jotaro this before, but Jotaro's 
Star Platinum is a menace to me.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.070
It's the fact that Jotaro is too attentive

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.750
and the fact that Star Platinum 
has the power to stop time.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.000
So I just wanted to see just how much 
stronger my Stand has gotten over time.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.150
Before I fight Jotaro,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.640
I thought I'd test myself 
against you, Josuke Higashikata.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.850
Come a bit closer.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.180
Closer! Until you can attack as quickly 
and precisely as Star Platinum, Josuke!

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.990
Come on! If you're that far away, 
your punches will be too weak.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.730
Are you mocking me?

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.470
Of course not.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.390
I've just seen through your abilities.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.830
Come closer and give me a super sharp one.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.960
Here. Hit me right here. 
Come on. Come closer!

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.370
Crack!

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.210
Huh? H-He's fast...

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.650
Quit your daydreaming!

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.970
Much faster than I thought!

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.970
If you want to keep daydreaming,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.070
maybe I'll just help you sleep!

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.270
Listen up! Jotaro's Star 
Platinum is nothing like this!

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.810
I regret my actions.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.650
I got a little cocky and underestimated him.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.530
What?!

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.670
Josuke! What the hell is all that noise?

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.650
What was that Stand power?
It felt like a jet engine going off...

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.800
He might just be stronger than Jotaro...

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.100
You, too, Josuke.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.600
Your Shining Diamond surprised me.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.730
Looks like I'm not the only one that's grown.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.410
I'll wait a little longer.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.990
Until my Chili Pepper grows stronger, 
I won't be able to defeat Jotaro.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.570
He can show up anywhere there's electricity.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.710
Not only does he have tremendous power, 
but he can control his Stand remotely.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.300
Josuke, I just asked you 
what all that noise was!

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.750
It's nothing.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.430
Man, a bug totally just bit me.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.160
Damn it! Bugs only come to me.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.980
Ah, Josuke!

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.060
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.620
What did you want to talk about, Josuke?

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.050
Why call us out to a 
lonely-looking place like this?

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.070
Couldn't we go to Tonio's or the usual café?

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.710
I'm not the one who called you 
guys out here. It was Jotaro.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.080
Jotaro did? I wonder what he wants.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.300
It's probably about Chili Pepper.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.270
What?! Chili Pepper?

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.050
You mean the Stand, Chili Pepper?!

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.790
So he appeared?

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.510
Yeah, he did. At my place last night.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.680
You bastard! Why didn't you 
let me know right away?!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.800
Okuyasu... He acts completely different 
when it comes to Chili Pepper.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.320
I can't blame him, since that
Stand killed his brother, but...

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.610
I told Josuke to keep quiet.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.670
Talking about him in the city, where 
there's electricity running, is dangerous.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.380
Jotaro!

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.960
I had you all come to this field 
so he wouldn't hear us talking.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.340
Okuyasu, Chili Pepper 
totally pisses me off, too.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.050
He got into my house without me knowing.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.740
He's free to listen to us talking 
and take whatever he wants.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.330
Come to think of it, the homework I finished

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.930
the other day disappeared from my desk!

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.830
And I thought my mom mistook it for trash—

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.070
That's not a big deal, Koichi!

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.240
What I'm trying to say is that the only reason

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.230
Chili Pepper hasn't caused more 
trouble is that we're around,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.330
and he drags people who piss 
him off into the phone lines

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.600
with about as much effort as 
someone making a pervy phone call.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.780
Of course, he can use the bow and arrow,

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.540
and he may have already used it on someone.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.130
I saw first-hand that he's gotten stronger.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.270
We have to hurry up and 
find out who his user is.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.050
B-But how?

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.870
We all gathered here to figure 
that out, right, Jotaro?

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.640
No, not quite.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.810
We'll be able to find him.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.390
Because the person who's capable

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.660
of finding him is arriving 
at Morioh Port at noon.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.490
Huh?

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.860
Someone who can find him?

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.860
Is he a Stand user?!

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.860
That's right.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.560
His Stand's name is Hermit Purple.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.870
Only he's gotten way too old, so he 
doesn't have the strength to fight.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.770
Too old? How old is this guy?

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.750
Do you know him, Jotaro?

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.530
Yeah. I know him very well.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.300
He used to be pretty ripped,

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.270
though you wouldn't guess that now.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.760
He's 80... No, maybe he's 79...

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.900
79?! He's super old!

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.270
Well, his legs are weak, 
so he's using a cane.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.160
He had surgery to remove 
gallstones two years ago,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.800
and suffers from cataracts.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.140
He wears full dentures

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.900
and complains that he can't eat T-bone steaks.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.160
He's also starting to forget things.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.570
Hey, come on, now.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.180
You're not gonna tell me his hobby 
is talking to mailboxes, are you?

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.660
Give me a break!

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.790
I had you guys gather here in 
order to protect that old man.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.940
If Chili Pepper finds out about him,
he's probably going to kill him.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.390
Because the thing Chili Pepper fears 
most is us finding out who his user is.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.850
Yeah, but is a geezer like that 
really going to be useful to us?

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.680
I tried to stop him,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.930
but when he heard about the bow and 
arrow, he came to Japan on his own.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.860
Came to Japan? Is he a foreigner, Jotaro?

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.450
Yeah.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.160
Josuke, th-this is serious!

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.240
Huh? What is?

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.660
Josuke! If he's 79, a foreigner, 
and a Stand user...

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.400
Y-You can't mean...

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.260
I heard you loud and clear.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.880
Chili Pepper!

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.340
Impossible! How'd he get to this field?

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.020
Morioh Landmark #4
<font size="20">Morioh Grand Hotel
</c><font size="15">How to get there: From bus stop #1,
take the bus for "Morioh Grand
Swimming Area" and get off at the
"Morioh Grand Hotel" stop.
From there, it's a 0-minute walk.
Located in the same area as many
expensive villas, it's an elegant hotel 
full of history. It has housed various 
travelers to Morioh and has been 
beloved for years. The beef tongue 
served at the hotel restaurant is 
considered superb and is 
the talk of the town.</c>

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.440
Rumble

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.450
Why?! There aren't any 
electrical lines here, so how?!

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.850
The bike's battery.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.420
Shit! He must have hidden in the 
bike's battery and followed us here.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.830
In my bike?

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.250
He heard us!

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.400
The port at noon?

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.540
An old geezer Stand user who can find me?

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.790
Rumble

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.800
I'll be sure to kill that geezer the 
moment he arrives at the port!

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.020
Now he knows about the old man...

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.050
In other words, Josuke's father.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.890
Rumble

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.150
This isn't good.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.720
If we let him go, he's gonna get 
to the old man before we do.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.410
Josuke! We need to throw a rock 
at that bike and destroy it!

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.030
No, hold up.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.360
For the sake of revenge, I, Okuyasu Nijimura,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.870
will kill that bastard!

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.200
He cut through space-time!

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.000
Ack! Keicho's younger brother!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.090
I'm the one who's going to deal with you.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.920
I'll scrape you away!

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.800
Okuyasu, I compliment you,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.810
at least in regards to you 
instantly transferring over here.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.080
But the scratching motion 
you do with your The Hand

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.690
seems to stand no chance 
against Chili Pepper's swiftness.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.820
You're too slow!

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.940
Take a better look, you dumbass.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.200
When I said I'll scrape you away,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.330
I meant the bike.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.040
The bike's front wheel!

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.180
Now you won't be able to run away.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.550
You actually used your head,
Okuyasu. Good job!

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:31.550
Chili Pepper can't go far 
from the bike's battery.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.810
Which means... Look!

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.790
The nearest electrical line is 
at least a hundred meters away,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.320
so you're as good as caught!

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.650
That was close!

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.650
No, we haven't actually caught him yet.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.270
The bike battery is still there.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.270
I'm sure he plans to do whatever 
he can to kill Okuyasu and run.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.150
We're going, too!

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.250
Right!

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.250
Right!

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.130
Do you really think you've trapped me?

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.790
Are you trying to get revenge for Keicho?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.490
No.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.380
My Big Bro

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.220
deserved to die.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.430
I knew that someone would kill him someday.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.770
The thing about crimes...

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.480
When you keep doing stuff like that,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.920
somewhere, somehow, it's going 
to come back and get you.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.570
Even I can figure that out.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.590
If you tell me

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.160
your user's name and address,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.330
I'll spare your life.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.780
If I tell you, you'll spare my life?

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.130
You're calmer than I thought.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.130
I thought your insides were boiling 
from wanting revenge so badly.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.390
Deep down inside, I hope you don't tell me!

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.020
I'm dying to scrape you away 
so bad, you dumbass!

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.690
I knew it.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.620
But you want to scrape me away?

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.150
With that pathetically slow right hand?

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.840
Should I laugh, or should I yawn?

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.530
It's a tough choice!

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.280
You bastard!

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.410
I'll kill you!

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.010
I'll make sure you know well

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.410
just how slow your Stand is!

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.170
Do you see now? It's this slow!

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.180
Okuyasu!

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.430
Okuyasu!

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.430
Shit!

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.920
Here comes Jotaro...

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.890
I can't stick around here for long.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.900
What?! He's behind me?!

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.490
I may have missed, but I still 
scraped through space-time,

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.880
so I could instantly transfer.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.820
Did you forget?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.950
I've got you now!

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.700
You little shit!

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.960
Looks like you're getting quite a bit slower.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.180
Are you going to be able 
to escape the next attack?

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.720
Look! Chili Pepper's electrical 
sparkle is fading!

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.970
He's getting weaker!

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.560
His Stand's power must be running out!

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.060
Does this mean Okuyasu wins?

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.970
Okuyasu! Don't finish him off yet!

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.610
Wait until we get there.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.060
You've won!

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.170
We have to ask him where the 
bow and arrow are right now.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.990
You're right... I'm weakening.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:41.440
Your Stand's right hand is slow as hell,
but it's still a terrifying Stand.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.250
But...

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.870
Are you sure you don't want to finish me off?

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:54.060
Maybe I'm just acting like 
I've grown weak, Okuyasu.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.850
What?!

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.310
Maybe I'm waiting for Jotaro to get 
closer so I can chop his head off.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.110
What the hell are you talking about?

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.440
Oh, nothing.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.760
What will you do? Finish me off now,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.260
or wait for Jotaro to get here?

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.030
You bastard...

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.910
But wait. Why would you tell me that?

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.620
If he hadn't told me he was acting weaker,

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.440
he could have tricked me, and beaten
me and Josuke by playing dirty...

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.720
Which means, uh, since he told me he's fine,

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:35.180
my chance of getting attacked is zero, right?

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.160
You're telling me to finish you off?!
Do you want to die?

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.930
I'll leave that up to you.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.990
Is he really weaker?

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.320
Or is he lying about being weaker,
and he's actually fine?

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.230
Which is the truth?

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.610
Are you coming or aren't you?

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:59.420
If he's fine, I need to go in to finish him.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.710
It's possible he's got 
something up his sleeve, too.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.000
Should I?

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.990
Okuyasu... Something's wrong.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.550
Hurry up and make up your mind, Okuyasu.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.070
Damn it!

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:29.570
I can't be bothered to think about
which is right anymore, damn it!

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.820
Okuyasu!

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.570
Don't try and stop me, Jotaro!

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.610
He killed my big bro!
I'm going to finish this!

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:43.780
That's the only truth inside my heart!

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.870
Die, you little shit!

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.670
Gaon

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.260
Just great. Now finding the bow
and arrow is going to be a real pain.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.070
Though it looks like things were settled.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.490
No, something is wrong.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.260
It looks like Chili Pepper 
really was plotting something.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.600
Huh?!

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.870
There were electrical cables underground?

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.670
That bastard! He </i>wanted<i> me to dig this up!

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.790
I really was weakened.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.180
The bike's battery is only a 12-volt.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.920
That was close!

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.170
Why, you...

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.740
Thanks to you, I feel alive again!

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.720
Okuyasu!

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.580
If you had only been a good little boy

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.680
and held back like Jotaro told you,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.720
the battery would have died, 
and I would've been eliminated.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.390
Wha...

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:50.560
I know where all of the 
electrical lines in this city are.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.800
I thought about running 
away using those cables,

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.400
but they were far from the bike.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.150
I didn't have the power to dig up the cables.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.280
You bastard!

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.740
He's even more...

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.110
Which means the electricity from 
earlier, the electrical power,

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.000
is on my side.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.710
Bogo

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.060
Okuyasu!

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.820
Your big brother Keicho 
said you held him back.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.730
He was right.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.450
Your mind is underdeveloped.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.150
You never could have gotten 
revenge, you dumbass!

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.810
Bye-bye, Jotaro, Josuke!

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.930
Joseph Joestar, was it?

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:58.810
I'll have that geezer share the 
same fate as the Nijimura Brothers!

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.680
I've won!

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.960
Okuyasu!

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.270
He got dragged in there!

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.020
Okuyasu!

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.410
Okuyasu!

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.720
Good grief.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.530
I can't believe we had him 
cornered and he still got away.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.000
He's a pretty dangerous Stand.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.740
He can be controlled remotely, 
and in terms of power,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.040
What?! What are you guys talking about?!

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.040
he can take advantage of all the electrical 
companies, making his power infinite.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.460
Why are you analyzing the enemy's 
abilities when Okuyasu just died?!

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.300
Oh, right. I guess we should 
worry about Okuyasu.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.500
Right.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.670
Talk about a silver lining.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.560
Looks like Okuyasu has really good luck.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.520
Okuyasu was really lucky that
his right arm was chopped off.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.180
Huh?

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.870
Shining Diamond!

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:59.010
When I fix his arm, it means 
his body will come back.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.820
Damn it!

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:08.330
Yay! Okuyasu is back!

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.480
Damn it... I-I...

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.300
I totally lost to that bastard.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.890
Damn it! Damn it!

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.840
It's not about revenge or winning or losing.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.190
We have to think about 
protecting Joseph Joestar.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.600
That'll lead to us defeating Chili Pepper.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.960
You have to do that for everyone.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.200
For the place where we live...

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.860
Jotaro, this isn't good.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.190
I was taking this lightly.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:51.070
Yeah. We have to get to the old 
man's boat before Chili Pepper does.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.240
Let's hurry to the port.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.130
Hey, you two! Aren't you 
acting a bit too cool?

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.640
Okuyasu's in shock!

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.120
If we're going to the port, this way is closer.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.910
All right.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.880
Hey, wait!

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.660
Surpass my big bro, huh...

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.680
You taught me a lesson, Chili Pepper.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.770
Mr. Joestar.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.520
We'll be arriving at Morioh 
Port any moment now.
