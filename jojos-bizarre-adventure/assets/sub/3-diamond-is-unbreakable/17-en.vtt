00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.040
You Are Here

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.440
Koichi...

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.860
Over here, Koichi.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.420
Ah! R-Rohan Kishibe!

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.110
Come on, now. You don't have 
to put up your guard like that.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.900
It's not like I'm going to harm you.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.890
Besides, when I read you with Heaven's Door,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.660
I actually felt a lot of admiration for you.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.520
I have a feeling we have a lot in common.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.840
Don't you think so?

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.750
Uh...

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.970
You see, there's something 
that I wanted to ask you.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.510
I lived around here from when I was 
a baby up until I was about four.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.950
I wanted to find the place where
I lived then, for nostalgia's sake.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.220
It's also a manga artist's job 
to remember their childhood.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.300
But the memories would be from 
when I was three or four,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.850
so I don't remember much.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.530
Oh...

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.640
What I wanted to ask you 
about is this town map.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.300
It's quite bizarre.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.310
Look.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.540
Convenience Store
<font size="24">Owson</c>

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.540
Kisara
<font size="24">Drugstore</c>

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.540
Soba Shop
Arisugawa

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.540
Tailor
Tanaka

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.540
You Are Here

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.540
Soba Shop Arisugawa, Kisara Drugstore,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.290
and the convenience store Owson is how 
the shops line up from the right.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.250
Huh?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.290
Now look at the actual shops.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.050
From the right, it's Soba Shop 
Arisugawa, Kisara Drugstore, and...

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.970
Owson on the left...

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.420
Huh?

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.610
The road between Owson and 
the drugstore isn't on the map.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.940
How lazy of them.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.850
Koichi, will you come with me for a bit?

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.470
I'd be very grateful if you'd 
show me around here.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.980
Huh? Well, I, uh...

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.070
Even after I, Rohan Kishibe, 
have asked so courteously?

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.940
I see.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.580
So you're not even willing 
to walk ten or so meters.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.580
You're so selfish. Jeez...

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.380
Just five minutes, okay, Sensei?

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.800
Just five minutes!

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.170
Episode 17    Rohan Kishibe's Adventure

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.760
Isn't it bizarre?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.290
This road isn't on this 1/3000 scale map

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.810
of Morioh published by 
National Map Publishers.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.010
Huh? Sometimes if you find errors in maps,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.060
they'll give you a bookstore gift certificate.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.900
Ugh...

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.080
Jeez, this map is infuriating.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.470
Look, Koichi.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.900
Yonemori

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.910
These houses that say "Yonemori," "Honma," 
and "Onodera" aren't on it, either.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.900
Honma

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.900
Numakura

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.900
Onodera

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.630
This map is filled with errors.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.890
Two or three bookstore 
gift certificates won't cover this.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.170
Rohan-sensei..

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.630
Looks like an empty house.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.170
Rocky

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.970
What a strange place.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.510
It doesn't look like anyone lives 
in these four or five houses.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.280
Even the electricity to the 
vending machine's been cut.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.100
Huh?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.740
That post box...

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.200
This is where we first turned.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.410
How strange...

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.610
How did we end up back
where we started again?

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.000
But we turned right, left, 
then right, so how...

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.250
It's possible that we're being 
attacked by someone's Stand.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.540
Huh? Stand?!

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.210
Koichi, would you have 
Reverb fly up to the sky?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.940
I see!

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.160
If it looks down from above,
we'll see which way to go.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.630
Reverb Act 1!

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.210
What's the matter?

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.850
Th-There's something there.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.810
Something touched it up in the sky.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.410
I didn't see anything.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.020
But something definitely touched it!

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.510
Are you two lost?

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.810
Want me to show you the way?

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.660
A girl!

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.030
That girl's a Stand user!

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.750
Heaven's Door!

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.820
Don't even give her a chance to speak!

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.550
Victory to the swiftest!

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.980
Boom

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.110
Now we're safe.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.670
She won't be able to harm us.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.740
That's amazing!

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.000
I-It looked like a drawing 
leaped out just now...

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.530
I guess that means I've matured a bit.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.580
Though it wouldn't work 
on lame people like Josuke,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.650
who don't like my manga.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.000
We're on the same wavelength.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.620
She's not a Stand user. 
She's just a normal girl.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.830
Huh? Sh-She's not an enemy?

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.910
Right. You can't hide 
anything from Heaven's Door.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.330
She's Reimi Sugimoto, age 16.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.760
Her address is 3-12, Kotodai, Morioh.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.040
It's right over there.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.970
She doesn't have a boyfriend. 
Her measurements are 82-57-84 centimeters.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.840
She has a mole on the 
side of her left nipple.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.550
She had her first period the 
September after she turned 11.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.760
The first time she kissed a boy, 
he forced his tongue into her mouth.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.090
Hey! Hold on a sec, Rohan Kishibe!

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.470
If that girl's not a Stand user,

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.790
then I won't allow you to 
read any more about her!

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.770
All right, all right.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.630
Don't get so angry.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.240
"She'll forget everything 
that just happened." There.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.780
Want me to show you the way?

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.630
A lot of people get lost around here,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.730
since all the alleys looks alike.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.540
We'll be fine if you could 
just tell us which way to go.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.500
No, no. You won't understand 
if I just explain it to you.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500
I'll show you the way, so follow me.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.250
Want one?

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.990
No?

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.680
Could you just grab the other end, then?

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:32.590
Snap

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.280
Aw, you're going to get dumped by some girl.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.730
What are you talking about?

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.860
It's Pocky fortune-telling. How the 
Pocky breaks tells me your fortune.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.130
You're selfish, aren't you?

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.890
And you have a tendency to mess with people.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.360
That's why you'll get dumped.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.500
Did you hear that, Koichi? 
She's completely off!

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.370
She called me selfish!

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.100
If we're going to play that game, 
I know a thing or two, as well.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.720
Light pink nail polish means you're 
a coward when it comes to love.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.020
You let true love slip away 
at the crucial moment.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.630
Huh?

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.550
No way...

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.860
This is a psychological test, 
not fortune-telling.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.410
Other than love, there's something else 
scaring you right now, isn't there?

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.360
Apparently,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.280
a murder took place at this
house about fifteen years ago.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.320
A murder?!

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.910
Murder...

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.430
No one lives there now.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.270
Do you want to hear about it?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.250
I heard this from the old 
lady who lives next door.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.600
The night of the murder,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.430
while the girl who lived here 
was asleep in her bedroom,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:57.300
she awoke to a "drip, drip" sound
coming from her parents' room.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.430
She wondered what the sound was, 
and called out to her parents,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.450
but there was no reply.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.190
But the girl wasn't that scared, because...

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.330
Her beloved dog was by her side.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.810
Beloved dog?

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.870
Yes. He was a big guard dog.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.000
Even in the dark, if she put 
her hand underneath her bed,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.980
he would whimper and lick her hand.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.330
She felt safe because Arnold was with her.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:28.840
But she heard the dripping sound 
go on for more than ten minutes...

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.100
Finally, the girl decided to 
find out what the sound was.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.690
And then...

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.700
She found her beloved dog Arnold dead,

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.810
hanging from the coat rack.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.610
His blood was the dripping 
sound that she heard.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.500
Suddenly, she heard a voice 
from under the bed say,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.740
"Your hand is so soft and cute, 
Miss. Whimper, whimper..."

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.620
"I already killed your parents." And then...

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.190
The girl was killed, too!

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.790
I-Is that a true story?!

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.800
Did it sound like one? It was just 
payback for trashing my nail polish.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.400
Whew...

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.070
Th-That stuff is bad for my heart... Jeez...

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.600
Drip

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.690
Wha—

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.860
That's...

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.080
Yes... That girl was me.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.830
Both Arnold and I are ghosts.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.030
G-Ghosts?

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.030
What my Stand, Heaven's Door, read

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.510
were memories from when she 
was alive, so I couldn't tell.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.850
You two walked into the place 
where I died fifteen years ago.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.800
I guess we're on the same wavelength.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.330
This is the border between 
the living world and the next.

I-It's no use!

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.020
Use Reverb, Koichi!

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.150
Have it fly into the air and find the way!

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.260
She must have been what 
touched it in the sky earlier.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.100
Just have it fly up already, Koichi!

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:44.890

What?! There's suddenly a wall in the sky!

K-Koichi, Reverb is touching the ground.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.990
Huh?! Ah, what?!

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.400
Y-You're the one who went 
flying up into the air.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.280
There's only one way out of this place.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.680
And I know where it is.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.930
H-How are we supposed to fight a ghost?

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.790
Please don't possess us!

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.100
Hey, hold on. Stop treating 
me like a vengeful spirit.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.020
What did I do to you?

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.680
You're the ones getting all scared on your own!

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.620
I'm not the one who trapped you in here.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.790
This is the border between 
this world and the next.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.320
You two have strange powers.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.370
They're called Stands?

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.400
I wonder if that's how you ended up here.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.270
You're not our enemy?

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.740
You really don't trust people, do you?

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.140
I think I'm what they call a bound spirit?

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.730
I became a ghost that can't leave here.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.120
For fifteen years, I tried to speak to 
various people who ended up here,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.800
because I needed to tell someone.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:53.210
But you're the first ones that 
I've been able to talk to this much.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.250
I told you I'd tell you how to get out of 
here, and that's what I'm going to do.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.220
After I finish the story, that is.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.550
Story?

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.550
The rest of my story from earlier.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.360
Before I could see the murderer's face,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.620
I was stabbed in the back with a knife.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.610
It was late at night and dark,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.480
and I was desperately running away.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.370
The murderer hasn't been caught yet.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.650
He's somewhere in Morioh.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.160
That's what I wanted to tell someone.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160
He's blended into this town.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.930
Wait. Are you telling us because...

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.960
I'm not asking you to catch him.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.380
But I want you to tell someone...

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.060
Someone who can catch him, like the police...

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.130
Whoa, whoa. Why should we have 
to do something like that?

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.660
Rohan-sensei!

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.890
It's fine. I just want to say the rational thing.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.220
I do feel bad that you were killed...

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.490
But why should we have to find 
the murderer just because of

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.690
your personal grudge and suffering?

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.990
I think, as a ghost, you'd be better off

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.240
cutting your ties to this world 
and passing on into the next.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.500
Do you even know how many boys and 
girls have disappeared from this town?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.950
Huh? No.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.500
It's eight times the national average.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.880
I'm not saying it's all of them, but at least
some of them are being killed in secret.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.610
By him.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.520
W-Wait a second!

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.040
Are you saying these murders 
are still happening?

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.410
Hey! Don't make baseless claims like that!

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.930
You just said you didn't 
see the murderer's face!

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.270
So how would you know that?

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.480
The souls of the murdered 
fly above here all the time!

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.940
And they all have a wound just like this.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.200
H-How cruel... It's so long and deep...

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.100
I can't talk to those souls
going to the next world,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.640
but I've seen them many times.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.540
I know what he's into! I know!

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.870
These murders have been going on for

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.790
fifteen years here in Morioh, 
where I was born and raised.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.670
It's frightening, and it wounds my pride.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.880
When they catch the murderer, 
my beloved Morioh

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.140
will be known nationwide as a 
town where a murderer lived.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.770
But we have to stop the 
murderer as soon as possible!

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.320
Even now, he's targeting someone, 
and I can't do a thing.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.200
Who's going to be killed next?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.910
If you, the living, don't take 
back this town's pride and peace,

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.290
who else is going to do it?!

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.420
I don't know if you understand 
what I'm saying, but...

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.290
I'm done talking now.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.470
A-All right. I'm very shocked.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.600
But... Still, we have to do something.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.660
Hmph. Stop being such a 
goody-two-shoes, Koichi.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.740
It's just going to be trouble.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.880
But it might be good to go after 
the murderer and interview him.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.910
I might be able to draw a 
really interesting manga!

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.410
Is the exit this way?

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.530
If you think he's a good person
deep down... well, you shouldn't.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.560
He's pretty gray when it
comes to being trustworthy.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.870
Hey, are you listening?

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.430
All right. I'll lead you to the exit.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.100
Huh? The exit? Where? Where is it?

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.810
If you turn left past the 
post box, it's right there.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.160
Yay!

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.150
Don't rush!

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.160
There's a certain rule you have 
to follow to get past there.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.730
A rule?

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.210
Once you pass the post box and turn,

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.890
you'll be able to see the 
exit about 20 meters away.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.930
No matter what happens,

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.540
until you get there, promise 
me that you won't turn around.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.080
What? Why?

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.770
It's the rule for passing
from this world to the next.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.040
Even Arnold understands that.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.760
Well, I guess we can promise to do 
something even a dog can handle.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.300
What happens if we turn around?

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:17.310
Our souls will be pulled into the 
next world, which means you'll die.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.190
Don't be frightened!

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.220
Just don't turn around. Simple, right?

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.580
R-Right when we passed the post box...

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.710
Something shot between our 
legs and went behind us!

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.580
Don't turn around!

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.710
Just keep walking slowly and calmly.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:54.370
R-Rohan-sensei, something is following us.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.470
I know.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.300
Something's there...

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.840
Something is right behind my head!

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.630
Don't worry about it!

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.570
There's always something trying 
to make you turn around.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.770
But as long as you don't 
turn and look at it,

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.070
it can't touch you, so just 
keep your wits about you.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:20.580
N-Now a warm liquid is dripping down my neck...

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.750
You're almost there! That light is the exit.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.580
What?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.580
Huh?

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.230
Th-The exit...

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.210
But I can't take it any longer!

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.740
Rohan-sensei, let's run!

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.880
Don't panic!

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.550
It's going to try to trip you.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.140
You're safe now.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.840
You got through it.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.140
You can turn around from there.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.900
That was so scary! I'm so relieved!

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.430
That was a lie, Koichi!

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.860
That wasn't really me just now!

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.950
Huh?

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:53.780
Impossible...

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.430
Not yet. Don't look back yet.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.240
This didn't happen when I was by myself.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.740
They didn't try to trick me!

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.130
Koichi!

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.380
Hmph. I don't really get it, 
but we just can't look, right?

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.380
You're lucky you're with me, Koichi.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.720
Heaven's Door!

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.550
You won't be able to see,
and you'll be blown away.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.250
Crash

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.630
Boom

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.890
Calm down, Koichi.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.150
I'll write that you can see again now.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.740
The road between the convenience 
store and drugstore is gone.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.120
W-We made it back...

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.420
We'll always be here.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.540
Until the murderer's caught.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.310
The day that Arnold and I turn around to go

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.310
where my mom and dad are will be

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.420
when the pride and peace 
of this town are restored.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.580
Until then, I can't leave here.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.980
If you ever need to ask me anything,

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.440
come by any time.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.440
We can see each other any time,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.690
Rohannie and Koichi...

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.630
I thank you from the bottom of my heart

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.650
for listening to what I had to say.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.460
That girl had some nerve, calling me "Rohannie."

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.800
She was getting too friendly.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.870
But... Reimi Sugimoto, huh...

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.710
There's something admirable 
about how that ghost lives.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:42.030
She's been fighting for fifteen years, 
alone, for the sake of the living.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.520
Zero Clues Found in Family Massacre

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.020

Sugimoto
Reimi

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.260
There it is! Sugimoto Reimi, age 16.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.030
Not that I doubted her, 
but now I've got some clues.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.530
Ah, could you be...

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.660
Rohan Kishibe, who became a manga artist?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.330
You know me?

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.370
Rohan, you were only four,

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.380
so it's no surprise that you 
don't remember that incident.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.710
Your house at the time was very near theirs.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.370
The night of that incident, 
your parents had urgent business

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.760
they had to attend to and 
were forced to leave...

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.100
So they left you overnight 
at the Sugimoto household

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.110
because you were all very close.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.360
That night, Rohan, you were staying 
overnight at the Sugimoto household.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.870
And you were the only one to survive.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.580
I was... there?

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:56.000
Sugimoto

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.530
When the police found you,

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.000
you kept crying and repeating 
the same thing over and over.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.260
"Reimi snuck me out the window."

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:06.080
Reimi saved you before you 
could be found by the murderer.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.350
That little girl... No wonder 
she acted all friendly with me.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:21.020
I can't read my distant memories nor 
my fate with my Stand, Heaven's Door.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.810
If you happen to wander down this path,

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.120
do not turn around, no matter what.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.040

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.920
I really met a ghost!

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.090
The girl in that picture is Reimi!

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.090
Okay, we get it.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.820
So, I researched her,

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.970
I said I believe you, didn't I? Right, Okuyasu?

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.580
and she was also a student 
at Budogaoka High School.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.120
She's cute... She's my type.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.220
I wish I'd been born fifteen years sooner.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.260
We should eventually go meet this ghost, too.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.420
But, Koichi, if we tell Jotaro 
or Old Man Joseph about this,

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.230
they're probably going to ask one thing.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.570
"Is the murderer a Stand user?"

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.240
W-Well... I don't know...

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.490
Then we'll just have to let the 
police and the courts deal with it.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.870
B-But there's a murderer in Morioh!

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:17.250
I know. And that's why I'm saying that 
Jotaro and the Speedwagon Foundation

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.590
won't just go after a normal murderer.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.510
Calm down.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.220
He's managed to escape from the 
almighty police for the past fifteen years.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.680
It's not like we'd run into him right away, 
like we'd hailed a taxi cab.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.480
Let's stay calm and look into this carefully.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.300
So what did Rohan have to say?

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.980
The same thing as you, Josuke.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.040
Hey, look out, Koichi.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.260
Don't cross the road when 
you're all spaced out.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.740
S-Sorry...

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.550
Originally, Morioh was a resort filled 
with villas that belonged to samurai.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.780
My ancestors were among them.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.210
But we were ruined during 
my grandfather's time.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.980
All that's left is the house that I live in now.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.560
And I'm stuck working a trivial office job.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.270
Hey, what did you do with the 
imported wristwatch I bought you?

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.930
Ah, it's in your bag. That's right.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.740
It was a little too big for you.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.280
Let's get it fixed tomorrow.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.420
What's wrong? Why are you acting so shy?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.040
Now... Watch your step.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.570
Let's enjoy this weekend to the fullest.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.640
Just the two of us.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.280
You just dripped something...

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.600
How rude you are.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.360
You need to clean that up yourself.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.750
I can't remember what your name was,
but that's all right.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.000
Well done. You cleaned it all off.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.910
Now, then...

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.050
Let's make dinner together.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.570
What's the dish that you're best at?

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.850
Kira

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.020
Kira

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.460
