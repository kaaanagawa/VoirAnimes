WEBVTT

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.450
Deadly Queen... is what I've named it.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.140
I'm going to eliminate you now,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.910
so I can sleep soundly again tonight.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.820
I warned you not to move!

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670
Don't underestimate Harvest!

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.420
There are this many?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.970
Not only that, but crushing three 
or four did no damage, either.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.710
If you move any more,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.760
I'll cut that something-or-other 
artery in your neck!

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.300
Oh, yeah! It's the one called the "carotid"!

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.230
I'm gonna cut it! My Harvest is invincible!

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.550
And it looks like your Stand

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.280
is the type that has power, 
but can't go very far.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.490
Looks like its range is about 
one to two meters, right?

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.860
If you want to die, go ahead and try to move.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.010
I see... So individual users have 
their own unique powers?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.630
Stand? Hmm... Stand, eh?

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.470
By the way, my Deadly Queen 
also has a special power...

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.720
He has something... Grab it!

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.750
What? It's just a 100-yen coin.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.730
What were you planning to do with this?

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.240
Well, I thought I'd show you my 
Deadly Queen's special power,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.050
seeing as how you're already 
as good as done for.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.670
Deadly Queen's special power

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.330
is that it can turn anything 
it touches into a bomb.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.950
Anything...

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.650
Even a 100-yen coin.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.100
Throw away that 100-yen coin, Harvest!

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.290
Now I can relax and sleep well tonight.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.670
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.670

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.430
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.430

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.890
Episode 22     Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 2

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.660
Did you know there's a salon 
that'll grant you love?

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.550
Huh? Seriously? That's hilarious.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.990
It's true! I hear it worked for 
someone in the high school!

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.440
Looks like one blast didn't kill him...

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.570
Wh-What happened to me? What...

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.000
What the...

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.510
What the heck happened?!

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.210
I told you.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.470
My Deadly Queen can turn 
anything it touches into a bomb.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.630
I turned this 100-yen coin into a bomb.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.360
I can push the switch whenever I want,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.400
and my opponent is blown 
to bits from the inside out.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.670
Though in your case, Shigechi,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.180
half of your face blew into your head,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.150
and about a third of your brain got 
mixed in with the flesh of your face.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.560
Before I deal one more blow 
to you, I just remembered

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.280
there's something that I 
want to confirm with you.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.100
You called this power a "Stand."

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.420
That Josuke and Okuyasu also 
have Stand powers, don't they?

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.000
H-Help me...

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.270
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.690
You must die.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.480
I can't leave witnesses alive.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.690
No one is allowed to know the true 
identity of one Yoshikage Kira.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.220
But you see, I'd like to 
know about Stand users.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.660
I'm sure I'd be able to find out

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.570
with some research, but I'd 
like to ask you personally.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.080
Josuke, Okuyasu...

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.270
Who are the others?

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.080
How many more are in this town?

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.290
What are their powers?

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.170
I-I don't know...

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.860
I'm certain you must know.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.800
Listen, if you don't tell me...

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.660
I will eliminate your parents, too.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.640
Wha...

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.680
What?

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.650
M-My mama and papa?

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.550
Hurry up and tell me.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.050
If you do, nothing will happen to them.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.530
If you take too long, 
someone might show up here.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.900
Just names will do. Come on, hurry it up.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.740
E-Everyone was saying they were 
looking for a murderer in this town!

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.780
A murderer... They meant you!

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.050
You killed Reimi Sugimoto, too!

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.340
What? Reimi Sugimoto?!

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.020
You're still able to use your Stand?

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.960
Deadly Queen!

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.310
That brat...

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.510
He was so torn-up, too.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.950
I-I'm... gonna go to Josuke...

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.170
Josuke's Shining Diamond...

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.840
can fix me...

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.070
I'm... going to protect Mama and Papa...

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.730
I'm gonna protect Mama and Papa from him!

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.480
That nasty, filthy guy

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.200
can't live in the same town as Mama and Papa!

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.030
High School Ahead
No middle school students beyond this point
—Middle School Principal

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.710
I have to go...

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.960
to Josuke...

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.850
Oh, sorry.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.340
Are you okay?

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.530
I have to go...

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.690
You don't look so good.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.850
He's from the middle school.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.190
Th-There's something wrong with him.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.110
We should get a teacher...

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.440
No, just leave him alone. He's creepy.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.440
Let's go.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.420
J-Josuke!

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.960
J-Josuke!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.020
You said everyone was looking for me?

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.140
Do you mean there's someone in this town

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.350
who knows about Reimi Sugimoto's murder?

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.890
But no one will be able to pursue me...

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.460
No one knows the identity of Yoshikage Kira.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.610
As long as you are out of the picture...

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.620
I'm gonna protect my Mama and Papa...

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.110
Deadly Queen has already 
touched the doorknob.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.610
Josuke!

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.020
This is Deadly Queen's power.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.310
He's been eliminated without a trace.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.350
Did someone call my name just now?

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.200
Yeah, I heard it, too.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.020
H-Hey, Josuke, look!

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.340
I... found... you!

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.330
Sh-Shigechi?!

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.700
Shigechi!

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.390
S-Something's not right, Josuke!

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.050
Harvest was gushing blood 
when it disappeared.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.350
That's not a normal way 
for a Stand to disappear!

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.990
Why did just one of them 
show up in front of us?

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.580
Let's go to the middle school.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.360
We have to find Shigechi!

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.160
Oh, dear. Where did that fall off?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.620
Well, I guess I can't help it now.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.250
I hope my usual tailor 
has the same button...

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.770
How horrible...

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.560
It happened again. It's him again...

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.300
Another soul killed by him is flying away...

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.280
He must have encountered him.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.300
Shigechi...

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.000
There's no doubt about it.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.730
This boy is dead.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.910
Shigekiyo encountered him, 
and was killed by him.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.980
I can tell.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.810
Though I don't know why he encountered him,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.150
or how he was killed.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.660
But it was definitely him.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.820
I can tell it was him because he killed me.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.090
I looked for Shigechi everywhere, 
but couldn't find him.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.700
He disappeared within just five minutes

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.920
after Okuyasu and I separated from him.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.850
Shigechi's books and school 
supplies were all left behind,

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.250
and his parents have 
requested a police search.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.180
That probably means...

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.390
Y-You're saying... The culprit is a Stand user?

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.070
You guys probably don't 
know much about Shigechi,

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.230
but I can't imagine there's anyone 
who can beat Shigechi's Harvest.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.780
This guy killed Shigechi within five minutes,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.820
and managed to hide his body 
somewhere within the school.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:09.290
Jotaro, now that it's clear 
we're dealing with a Stand user,

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.980
we'll have to help out, as well.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.420
Josuke.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.470
I heard you picked up a button.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.420
Yeah... One of the Harvests brought it to me.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.780
This is it.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.520
This is Shigechi's final message.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.930
It could be that Harvest ripped it off of 
the murderer's clothes and brought it to you.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.910
Let me hold on to this button.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.450
I'll do some research.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.770
Y-You can locate the guy with the kind 
of button you could find anywhere?

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.040
It's possible.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.110
We might be able to figure out the brand 
of the clothes and where it came from.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.570
I see...

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.370
I-If we're done talking, I'm gonna go home.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.400
I-I'm kind of in a weird mood.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.410
I-I'm really annoyed...

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.770
Let's go home, Dad.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.920
There's something wrong with Okuyasu.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.860
Yeah... Shigechi was a greedy, 
irritating little punk,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.990
but he was the type you 
just couldn't leave alone.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.060
We can't believe he's gone.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.750
Not to mention, he must feel 
annoyed because he can't tell

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.670
if he should be angry or sad right now.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.220
We both feel that way.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.360
I'm sure Okuyasu feels it far more.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.280
Damn it...

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.290
It appears something awful has 
happened outside my notice.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.280
I'm going to warn all the customers 
who come to my restaurant.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.050
Phew... I don't think he'll come 
to my place, but just in case...

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.700
Stand users eventually attract 
other Stand users...

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.610
Though I never want to meet that guy.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.500
So now everyone's going to take action, huh?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.830
Oh?

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.610
That was Josuke just now...

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.440
And Okuyasu was there, too.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.200
Hey, listen to this.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.880
Last Friday was my birthday, right?

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.480
The guy I'm seeing gave me this 
super lame ring as a present.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.150
Look at it! Why would I want this thing?

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.320
Though I still put on an act like, 
"Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy!"

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.910
I was dating him because 
his dad owns some land,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.490
but he's a total bumpkin.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.510
This really is a kiddie ring. How much was it?

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.700
Probably around 150,000 yen.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.110
I'm gonna go pawn it off for some money.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.480
It doesn't compliment my 
beautiful fingers at all.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.710
That woman's heart is ugly,

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.750
but her hands and face are beautiful...

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.210
If she comes to me, she can 
date me with a cleansed soul.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.890
Oh, I have to go. See you later.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.500
Okay, bye-bye!

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.680
I'm afraid we'll have to part ways now.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.700
Let's keep this farewell clean.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.990
Shigekiyo Yangu: Deceased 
Stand: Harvest

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.290
De

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:38.330
Dead

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:38.410
Deadly

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:38.490
Deadly Qu

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:38.540
Deadly Que

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:38.620
Deadly Quee

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.940
Deadly Queen

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:39.700
Yoshi

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:39.790
Yoshikage

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.910
Yoshikage Ki

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:40.940
Yoshikage Kira

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.970
Good morning. This is Morioh Radio,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.400
brought to you again today 
by your neighbor, Kai Harada.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.920
How is the beginning of the 
new week treating you so far?

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.860
Already, there are only three days left in June.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.760
Now, let's eat.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.630
And once it's July... 
That's right, it's vacation season.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.630
Oh, yes.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.530
I've got several errands to run today,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.120
What plans do you all have?

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.540
so I'd like you to stay home.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.490
I can't wait.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.740
And now, the perfect song for this sunny day

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.260
Let's eat dinner together when I get back.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.850
in the middle of the rainy season. Here you go.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.220
Thank goodness they still 
had the Parisian special.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.300
Talk about lucky!

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.990
Let's hurry up and go to Yohee Lake.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.250
Wait, Asuka's not here yet.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.840
What? What's taking her so long?

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.960
It's been four days since Shigechi's incident...

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.000
Nothing has really happened since, but...

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.460
There's no doubt that there's a 
killer somewhere in this town.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.280
Honestly, anyone can look suspicious,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.820
yet anyone can also look 
completely innocent.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.810
Ah... H-Hello, Jotaro.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.390
Um, did you find anything out since last time?

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.720
Like, about the murderer's button, or...

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.970
No, not really.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.350
There's nothing yet.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.780
I-I see...

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.820
Um, where are you going?

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.020
Nowhere, really.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.500
Just over there.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.320
Ah...

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.750
Oh, man... He doesn't really talk, so it's 
hard to have a conversation with him.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:51.390
Rohan-sensei is scary because he's so 
overbearing, but Jotaro's silence is scary, too.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.010
Isn't there something 
we can talk about? Um...

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.260
That's a very lovely coat!

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:09.020
Centipede Shoes

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.530
This store appears to be a shoe store.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.030
Huh? Oh! Yes, it's a shoe store.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.020
Is there something wrong?

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.020
We also do simple tailoring

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.220
It's a shoe store, but they also do things

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:19.410
on the side, like fixing waist measurements 
on skirts and hemming pants.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.900
There's also an electronics 
shop that sells flowers.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.610
Is there something wrong?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.290
I heard about all of the 
tailors around Morioh,

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.540
but I didn't think to ask about places like this.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.180
Something wrong with this button?

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.460
No, if you haven't seen it 
before, don't worry about it.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.700
I just couldn't remember what 
it was originally attached to.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.190
Little boy, would you 
like an animal cracker?

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.190
Animal Crackers

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:58.210
I always eat the camel last, 
so you can have any of the others.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.180
No, thank you.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.500
Oh, okay.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.250
But not only have I seen that button before,

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:10.240
but look, I just finished repairing 
the suit it came off of.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.330
A customer came in yesterday,

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.460
asking me to put on the exact same button.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.970
See? It's the exact same button.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.320
Jotaro!

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.220
Good grief. We found it, Koichi.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.700
Found it?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.150
Oh, n-nothing...

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.740
M-More importantly, what did 
the customer look like?

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.230
Do you know his name?

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.570
His name?

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.010
Well, of course I do. What do you take me for?

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.980
I remember all of my customers' names.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.630
That's how you're supposed 
to treat customers,

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.450
even if you have hundreds or thousands!

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.410
Really?

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.400
Yes! That's amazing! 
Could you tell us his name?

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.460
Anyway, the jacket has an order tag on it.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.970
Of course I remember it... 
Even out of hundreds.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.470
But I figure it might be faster to look.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.150
Let's see...

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.150
Kira

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.840
The last name is... How do you read this?

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.890
I think it's...

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.200
Wh-What is it? M-May I see it?

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.540
Um... Um...

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.640
Look over here.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.220
Wh-What the?! My hand!

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.600
Look over here.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.140
J-Jotaro! L-Look!

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.860
Watch out, Koichi! Don't go any closer!

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.360
Hey, I told you to look over here.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.460
Is that his Stand?!

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.960
J-Jotaro!

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.920
H-He's here! He's taking the jacket!

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:32.960
To think someone would actually investigate 
the button that fell off my jacket...

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.860
Did they see my name?

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.940
Why do things like this keep 
happening to me lately?

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.490
Good grief.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.750
Who would've thought he'd 
come to get his suit now?

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.540
But I will make them disappear

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.010
with Deadly Queen's second bomb.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.140
Just like that brat Shigechi...

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.580
It's still moving!

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.930
The jacket is evidence!

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:00.580
Wait!

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.280
Don't run after it without thinking.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.410
The way that jacket is being 
pulled is suspicious.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.690
Something about that Stand...

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.980
is dangerous!
