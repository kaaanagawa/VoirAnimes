00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.370
I met that boring man

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.170
when I was going to community college.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.780
He went to a pretty upper-rank 
college in the area,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.580
and my friends were envious 
because he was quiet and cool,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.200
so I went out with him to feel superior.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.590
We had a child.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.790
I see. Because it's three times the 
speed, the picture quality's...

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.310
Hey, Hayato. No "hello" for your mother?

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.760
Hi.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.000
My husband's not a bad man.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.490
It's not as if he drinks a lot,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.210
and even though he doesn't earn much,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.520
he always goes to work.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.580
Kosaku Kawajiri
Shinobu
Hayato

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.870
But...

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.250
I'm a woman who married 
without ever knowing love.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.610
Hmph. He's home.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.710
He only knows the words 
"food," "bath," and "sleep."

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.450
That boring man...

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.250
I'm home.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.550
Where's dinner?

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.800
Oh, you're home? I didn't even notice.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.240
I was really busy today, 
so that's all there is.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240
But it's your favorite, isn't it?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.990
Ramen
<c.colore0e9e3>Land</c>

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.660
Is he mad?

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.540
If you have the guts to 
get mad, then get mad.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.250
I'm sure you're just going to eat your 
dinner silently as usual, though.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.640
Good evening! This is Morioh Radio,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.770
brought to you again today by
your neighbor, Kai Harada.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.810
What are you doing?

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.810
How's your evening going so far?

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.980
Here's a perfect song to end the day...

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.140
Episode 25     Heart Father

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.470
Fifteen minutes by car from Morioh Station...

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.030
His house was in the villa and resort area.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.030
Morioh Station

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.030
Yoshikage Kira's House

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.440
Rather, it was Yoshikage Kira's house 
when that was still who he was.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.450
Kira

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.160
He has now gained a new face, 
family registry, job,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.230
and a different place to call home.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.400
I'm sure he'll never try 
to come near here again.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.750
There aren't any corpses 
in the fridge, are there?

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.750
But we had to search the place.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.590
Because now that he's someone else,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.010
the only clues we could possibly 
find on him would be in this house.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.420
Is that his album?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.960
That totally looks like him.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.570
Third Grade Summer
Summer Camp
7-25-1974

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.570
Yoshikage Kira...

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.760
Born in Morioh Town on January 30th, 1966.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.530
His height is 175 centimeters, 
weight is 65 kilograms,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.330
and his blood type is A.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.580
He was born to parents of advanced age.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.310
His father, Yoshihiro, died of
illness when Yoshikage was 21,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.050
and his mother died of old age not long after.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.330
In 1988, he graduated from 
D Academy's Department of Literature.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.100
That same year, he started working for 
S City's Kame Yu department store.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.680
He transferred to the Morioh branch in 1993.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.610
No previous criminal record. No record 
of getting married. No close friends.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.310
No girlfriend. No surgeries.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.240
It's impossible to find him using 
fingerprints, teeth, or surgery scars.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.310
That's all rather vague information.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.990
Look. These trophies and awards...

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.410
High School Music Recital
Violin
3rd Place
Yoshikage Kira

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.270
They're all third place.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.120
Middle School Track Meet
200 Meter Hurdles
3rd Place
Yoshikage Kira

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.620
He definitely wasn't the school hero.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.620
Award
Grade School
Writing Contest
Overall 3rd Place

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.720
And it's hard to tell what he was good at.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.130
Sports? Music? Writing?

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.570
Even in this photo, he's positioned 
so he doesn't stand out.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.380
No one envied him or ridiculed him...

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.140
He's a man who doesn't show his 
strengths or weaknesses to anyone.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.180
Which means...

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.810
Of course, all this was deliberate.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.350
He was hiding his high intellect and abilities.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.460
He knew that was the best 
way to stay out of trouble.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.070
I came here hoping we could possibly 
find one of his hobbies, but...

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.960
Hobbies? Come to think of it,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.730
he seems to have kept several jars in a drawer.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.620
See?

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.170
It looks like some sort of scrapings in them.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.880
And what are these numbers?

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.880
"1983"... Maybe it's the year.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.350
They have a faint smell. 
What do you think they are?

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.100
They appear to be nail clippings.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.090
Huh?

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.320
Wh-Whose nails are they?!

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.810
Th-They couldn't be...

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.040
No, they're his own nails. 
They're not from his victims.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.150
He's kept very meticulous data in his notebook.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.820
Data? You mean the numbers on the jars?

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.370
Does that mean he's been 
collecting them since 1983?

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.200
For the last fifteen years?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.750
Thumb | Index Finger | Middle Finger | Ring Finger | Pinky

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.300
Gah! He recorded every 
finger! He's so detailed!

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:21.130
[Years that my nails grew more than 30cm]
Right Hand Measurements

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.100
Does this mean that in 1983, his thumbnail on

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.130
his right hand grew 31.5 centimeters?

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.980
1983 was the year Reimi Sugimoto was killed.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.340
The records begin in that year.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.980
He probably reached the point

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.850
where he couldn't contain his 
murderous instincts any longer.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.930
Whoa! He's got his toenail 
lengths on the next page!

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.580
I guess we've discovered the odd hobby

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.190
of a man who tried to convince 
others that he was boring.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.010
Look.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.610
Years that my nails grow more than 30 cm
I'm on a roll!!
No one can stop me.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.030
This data is fortune-telling.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.610
Jewish merchants observe 
the movement of sunspots

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.270
to determine how well 
their businesses would do.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.150
It appears Yoshikage Kira 
used the length of his nails

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.400
to determine the condition he was in...

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.570
Whether he was in condition to kill, of course.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.620
1999!

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.890
As of June, they've already grown 
more than 20 centimeters this year!

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.140
He's insane, that sick bastard!

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.210
But this isn't a clue we can use to track him.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.970
There might be something else.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.900
Does this mean someone 
else is in this house?

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.530
It would appear so. 
Josuke, stay on your toes.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.240
Does that mean he's working 
with someone else?

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.390
No... That's not possible.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.090
Crimes can be traced from 
interactions with others.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.960
A partner could possibly rat him out.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.590
He's not the type to trust anyone.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.420
This is...

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.510
Jotaro, look at that camera.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.300
I-It's his father... Kira's father!

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.810
He's in the picture, right behind us!

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.810
But...

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.400
This is not good. This is so not good.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.690
Does that mean he's a ghost?

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.910
Yeah. Considering the case of Reimi Sugimoto,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.960
it's possible that his father 
also couldn't pass on

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.360
to the next world and is stuck 
here as a soul's energy.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.910
Look at his expression.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.250
He looks like he wants us to get the hell out.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.910
Number Withheld   Public

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.470
Are you trying to scare us 
with your ghost energy?

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.440
But this is all the more reason we can't leave.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.010
Hurry up and answer the phone, you slowpoke!

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.390
I'm making it ring!

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.110
You think I look like I want you to leave?

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.850
It's the opposite, you moron!

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:52.330
My face is saying that I'm never 
letting you leave this house!

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.620
Anyone who goes after my son must die.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.160
You bastard! You know 
about your son's crimes?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.660
Hey, is something wrong? 
What's all the racket?

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.230
Where are you hiding?

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.450
Get out here, you geezer ghost!

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.840
Ghost?!

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.210
Josuke, he's not hiding.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.010
Huh?

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.440
It appears Kira's father has 
been present from the start.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.510
Look.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.100
Boom

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.270
Wha... When did he...

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.600
He's moving around in the picture.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.440
He's calling us from inside the picture.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.590
He probably threw the receiver 
from within this picture, too.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.410
I'll kill you...

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:42.800
I'll kill anyone who goes 
after my precious son!

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.060
Josuke!

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.150
We can attack ghosts with our Stands!

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.800
Rohan-sensei used his Heaven's Door 
to read Reimi's memories!

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.430
Bastard!

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.760
Take this!

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.930
What?!

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.060
D-Damn!

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.060
Any damage to the photograph 
will come back to us!

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.400
Hurry up and fix it, Josuke!

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.190
We're going to blow to pieces!

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.010
Josuke! Jotaro!

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.060
That power... I see!

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.870
You two have

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.790
the same kind of power that my son has!

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.270
Okuyasu, you're up!

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.920
Use The Hand to cut just 
the old man out of the picture!

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.020
Gotcha! Leave it to me, Josuke!

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.680
Huh?

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.190
O-Okuyasu?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.660
Wh-What the?!

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.610
Why did I run straight into the window?

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.490
M-My hands are coming out 
all the way over there!

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.410
I can't come past this point!

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.710
That's...

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.720
A-A wall!

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.730
There's a wall here that we can't see!

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.210
It won't break! I-It can't be!

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.640
You finally figured it out?

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.430
That's the frame of the photo!

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.220
It may look like you're in the 
room, but you're actually not.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.730
I'm a ghost that lives within a photograph...

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.790
I can control the dimension of 
any photograph that I appear in.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.310
Because I can trap the energy of others' 
souls in photos, using the camera!

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.440
That is my power!

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.480
That room is inside the picture!

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.210
If you damage the photo, 
your soul's energy will be hurt,

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.790
and the damage will come 
back to you, as well!

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.340
Inside the picture? 
But it's right in front of me!

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.050
If you're as dumb as you look, 
you don't need to think about it too hard.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:03.520
After I kill these two, I'll trap 
the two of you and slice you up!

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.910
J-Josuke! Jotaro!

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.310
I'll kill you...

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.000
You bastard! Stop, damn it!

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.940
Jotaro, what are you doing?

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.770
Do something with your 
invincible Star Platinum!

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.080
Josuke... I'm giving up.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.830
Huh?

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.300
It appears impossible to stop 
the old geezer's attacks.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.800
If all the damage is just 
going to come back to us,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.220
then even if I stop time with Star Platinum, 
we won't be able to do anything.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.220
When something's useless, I give up.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.430
What did you say, Jotaro?

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.010
What the hell are you talking about?!

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.710
I'll kill you!

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.870
Your heads went flying!

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.160
A-A knife...

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.120
What?!

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.120
I can't touch it! J-Jotaro!

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.180
I've given up on stopping the geezer,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.680
but...

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:18.960
Wha?

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.490
If he controls any photograph he's in,

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:32.640
then maybe all we have to do is take a 
picture of him by himself, so he's alone.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.230
What?!

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.970
To think you've evaded my attack... Damn it!

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.190
Josuke, say something to him.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.220
Something cool. Let him have it!

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.390
Y-You didn't scare me at all, you idiot!

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.630
The

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:57.830
The Ha

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:58.000
The Han

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.960
The Hand

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:58.670
Oku

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.790
Okuyasu

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.920
Okuyasu Niji

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.960
Okuyasu Nijimura

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.380
Damn you!

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.950
You guys are clearly used to fighting.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.760
You must have fought against 
people with the same kind

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.460
of power as my son many, many times!

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.310
He can get out, since he's a ghost.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.350
We need to make sure you 
stay in there and keep quiet.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.340
There's something in this house that will 
cause him a lot of trouble if we find it.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.630
That's why you attacked us.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.350
I get it.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.690
So if you fold him in half, there's no exit.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.640
He can't run away.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.900
Okuyasu, Koichi, you two search this room.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.680
We'll search the right side.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.950
I can't protect my son now! Damn it!

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.320
If that falls into their hands...

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.950
Still, what thing that might cause 
trouble for him should we look for?

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.960
I'm not thinking too much about it.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.570
If Kira's old man there turns pale, 
it's a good sign.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.000
I-I can't breathe...

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.590
I-It's too cramped... 
Please, just a little is fine.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.200
Just open the tiniest of holes 
in the tape and let me breathe...

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.930
Y-You really can't breathe?

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.040
Hey, Koichi, he's just acting.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.310
He's trying to get you to 
open a hole so he can escape.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:43.660
Y-You may not believe me, 
b-but I really can't breathe!

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.900
I'm claustrophobic, so I 
understand how that feels...

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.780
Oh, quit whining. You want us 
to open up a hole that bad?

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.290
Fine, then. I'll open up plenty for you...

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.870
With tacks, that is.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.540
Wh-What are you doing?!

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.650
Damn it! Let me out of here, 
you stupid little brat!

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.310
Now you've shown your true colors.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.800
I won't be removing those tacks.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.970
Tacks? I can't see, but I appear 
to be on the post right now.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.760
I've got a great idea!

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.150
Your tacks helped me come up with
a trump card to get out of here!

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.280
It's easy! It's all thanks to you!

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.830
Well, see ya!

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.200
Wha...

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.240
Hey, you bastard...

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.680
What was that sound? What did you do?

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.500
Say something, damn it!

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.250
O-Okuyasu, this isn't good! 
I think he might have run away!

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.150
Jotaro! H-He got away!

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:58.340
I-It's my fault. H-He used 
the tacks and did something!

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.980
You've been fooled, you moron!

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.150
Looks like I've won the battle of wits.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.860
What?!

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.420
Th-This is...

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.340
What's this doing here?

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.550
It can't be!

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.120
It's the bow and arrow... 
But we retrieved them...

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.240
The bow and arrow should be in safekeeping 
at the Speedwagon Foundation...

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.840
Is there another set?

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.100
Josuke, be careful! Kira's father escaped!

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.390
What?!

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.620
This arrow drew Deadly Queen out of Yoshikage!

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.010
The arrow is the important part!

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.230
I'll never let you have it!

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.120
R-Reverb, Koichi! Use Act 1 to go after it!

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.450
I-It's too far away!

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.050
Seriously?

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:09.460
The thing that Kira's father didn't want 
us to find was the bow and arrow!

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.910
D-Damn it! It's all my fault!

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.170
No, Okuyasu. He was just a stronger opponent.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.970
You can tell that Kira is definitely his son.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.550
We've lost to that family's determination

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.530
to never give up, and to survive, no matter what.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.470
As long as they don't get 
this arrow, that's good enough.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.990
I'm going to use this to 
make more enemies for you!

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.280
The bow and arrow, huh... I see.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.990
I thought there might be more than one set.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.570
Now I know exactly how DIO and the others

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.570
were able to gather so many Stand 
users in such a short amount of time.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.400
They created more of them around the world

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.760
with a number of those bows and arrows.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.130
I'm assuming Kira's father got this set 
from an old woman named Enyaba,

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.470
and eventually, Okuyasu's brother, Keicho,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.360
also got hold of one, and came to this town.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.740
Because Stand users attract 
other Stand users, apparently.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.740
Yoshikage, where are you right now?

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.780
You never could help but kill women, 
even when you were a boy.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.120
But if that's what brings you 
happiness, I'll protect you.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.370
Because...

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.620
You're my one and only son.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.090
Kosaku Kawajiri
Shinobu
Hayato

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.600
What's gotten into you? 
You're actually cooking?

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.740
I-I mean, I didn't know you even knew how.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.850
Two plates? This one's for me?

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.110
You're telling me to eat your cooking?

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.710
How stupid are you?

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.780
Hey! Cut your nails later!

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.620
And didn't you cut them last night?

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.540
They must grow fast...

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.260
Oh... Th-This is actually really good...

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:25.350
H

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.430
He

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.560
Hea

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:25.640

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:25.680

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:25.850

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.930

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:25.970

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:26.060
Heart Fath

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:26.140

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.020
Heart Father

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:26.760
Yoshi

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:26.850
Yoshihiro

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:26.970
Yoshihiro Ki

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.020
Yoshihiro Kira

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.260
Kitty!

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.710
Why?

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.280
Were you crying all night at the top of 
that tree because you couldn't get in?

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.490
Hey! What gives you the right to 
shut the window near the tree?!

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.500
I've told you day after day not to shut it!

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.380
What's wrong, kitty? 
Why are you so worked up?

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.140
Cats hate water.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.730
I'm sorry about that. 
I shut the window without thinking.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.720
I won't do it again.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.430
Something's wrong. He's changed somehow.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.090
He started cooking out 
of the blue last night,

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.110
and he's using an actual blade rather 
than an electric razor to shave.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.240
Blades always give him razor burn...

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.910
Hey, you haven't paid your 
rent from last month.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.280
It's now 260,000 yen including this month's.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.750
Pay up right now!

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:41.970
Rent?

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.990
You heard him. Hurry up and 
bring it from the safe.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.790
Safe?

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.350
Hurry! You're the only one who 
knows the combination to the safe!

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.360
Hey, what are you...

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.520
Thank you for coming so 
early in the morning, sir.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.490
But I seem to be a bit 
short on cash right now.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:09.990
Huh?

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.850
Quit screwing around!

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.610
You got in over your head when

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:19.090
you tried to rent my wonderful house 
with your lousy income, you peon!

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.510
You need to learn to live within your means!

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.880
Um, we'll get it right away—

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.280
No. Please don't get the wrong idea.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.890
When I said I was a bit short, look.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.390
I meant that I only had a 
little over 500,000 yen.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.380
I'll only be able to pay for this month,

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.490
last month, and the next 
two months in advance.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.230
Will that suffice?

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.740
Y-Yes, that's plenty.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.050
Thank you very much.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.640
Pleasure doing business with you!

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.740
Y-You...

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.550
You must have stolen that 
money from the landlord.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.910
I don't know how you did it,
