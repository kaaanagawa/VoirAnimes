You've come just before the expiration date,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.750
but you've indeed won the 
third place prize, five million yen.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.460
Now, then... Here you go.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.620
This is the promissory note 
for five million yen.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.550

Please pay the amount stated above

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.270
One, ten, hundred, thousand...

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.480

Episode 19    Shigechi's Harvest, Part 2

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.980
Now, I do have one question...

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.980
Reception Office

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.700
From which vendor did you 
gentlemen purchase this ticket?

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.940
Sniff, sniff.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.420
Wh-Which?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.480
Wh-Why do you want to know that?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.240
Oh, it's just a formality.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.430
You stupid little brats.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.850
You won five million yen? That's too fishy.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.470
I'm a very capable bank associate, 
and I smell something rotten here.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.470
Or perhaps

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.350
there's a reason you'd rather 
not answer that question?

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.470
W-Well, of course we bought it in Morioh.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.990
Oh? Well, that's bizarre...

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.110
There isn't a single lottery vendor in Morioh.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.450
O-Oh, right...

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.220
It must have been when we went to S City.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.070
We bought all kinds of things, 
so I don't remember that well...

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.030
I-I-I-I-I-It was a while back, too...

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.570
I just realized something bizarre...

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.200
On the other side of the lottery ticket,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.880
there's a place to write your name 
and telephone number, and...

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.100
Ichiro Morishita

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.230
Ichiro Morishita...

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.700
The name written here doesn't 
match any of your names.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.770
N-Name?!

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.270
Phone number?!

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.000
That was written on the back?!

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.390
E-Er...

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.210
Well, well, well, well, this is truly bizarre.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.970
This is your lottery ticket, isn't it?

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.280
Oh, yeah! Now I remember!

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.720
I wrote down my friend's number 
on that instead of a memo pad!

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.310
Oh! Is that so?

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.810
Then how about we give 
Mr. Ichiro Morishita a call?

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.570
We can also tell where

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.230
lottery tickets are purchased 
with the serial number here.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.330
If Mr. Ichiro Morishita was the 
one who purchased this ticket

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.910
and remembers exactly where he bought it,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.090
we'll then have to check this signature, too...

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.920
To see who this ticket belongs to.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.430
Depending on the situation, we may 
have to turn it over to the police.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.640
The police?!

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.140
Hello? This is Morishita.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.320
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Budogaoka Bank.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.480
I wanted to inquire if Mr. Ichiro Morishita

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.160
had purchased the Great 
Year-End Lottery ticket.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.330
Oh, I'm Ichiro Morishita, 
and yes, I bought one.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.040
Yeah, I'm sure I bought one.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.690
Yes! You stupid little brats!

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.170
My sense of smell was correct!

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:28.410
There's no way God would grant 
brats like you the winning ticket!

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.020
Morishita

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.500
So you did! You bought a lottery ticket.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.420
Yeah, I did.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.050
Morishita Ichiro

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.530
But I bought like, ten, and 
none of them were winners.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.480
I'm going to change just part of the signature...

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.270
Kinoshita Ichiro

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.540
You see, Mr. Kinoshita, your lottery ticket...

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.520
Kinoshita? My name's Morishita.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.370
Huh? But it said "Mori"! 
What? How strange...

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.900
Your phone number is 1771-1281, 
correct, Mr. Kinoshita?

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.460
I told you my name's not 
Kinoshita, you dumbass!

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.810
It's Morishita!

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.650
Why are you wasting my time with this?

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.270
I threw them all away.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.350
Why don't you sell some 
winning tickets sometime?

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.810
P-Pardon me...

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.610
J-Just wait, you!

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.120
The number you are trying to 
reach is currently not in use.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.730
Please confirm the number and try again...

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.220
A-Are you satisfied?

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.470
I-I-I'm terribly sorry for my rudeness.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.550
Yay! It's my money!

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.630
I won this five million yen!

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.670
Hey, you promised that half 
of it would be ours, Shigechi!

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.900
Did I say that?

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.620
You're doing that again?!

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.400
Hey, Josuke! Why are you stopping me?!

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.710
You're not gonna let him get 
away with it again, are you?

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.830
No... This time, I'm not backing down, either!

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.490
There's no way you're getting away with this!

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.410
Well said, Josuke!

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.550
Of course you wouldn't back down!

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.840
It's only logical!

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.110
So now you don't want to 
split the money, Shigechi?

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.550
You realize this amount is way too 
much for that to fly, don't you?

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.520
Here.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.020
This should be enough for you guys.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.000
You didn't really do anything, after all.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.570
I'll take pity on you 
because you're my friends.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.930
Crush

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.110
Why, you—

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.330
Hey, Okuyasu!

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.610
Give us the money, you dumbass!

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.790
You promised us half, 
so you're going to give us half!

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.700
Stop being greedy, you idiot!

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.270
You're always so quick to hit. Don't be rash.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.230
When dumbasses don't get what you're saying, 
this is how you make them understand!

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.300
Are you hurt?

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.920
I'm sorry Okuyasu suddenly hit you.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.160
But, Shigechi, let's not cause any trouble.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.810
We're gonna hold onto the promissory 
note for the five million.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.810
In three days, when it becomes cash,

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.070
let's split it evenly in half, like we discussed.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.410
But, man, he's ridiculous.

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.650
I'm done hanging out with him.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.950
But you know,

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.010
I think we should reflect on the fact
that we thought about using him

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.500
to get some pocket money, too.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.580
You dummy.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.420
Huh?

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.580
I'm not gonna think of it like that.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.680
The only reason he was able to get 
the five million was because of us.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.850
If it was him alone, he could only 
get maybe tens of thousands.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.330
But he's getting 2.5 million on his own.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.190
2.5 million!

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.780
yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.950
Like I'll give it to you.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.310
Like I'll give it to you!

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.100
I heard everything, damn it!

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.540
I won't give you guys even one yen!

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.010
We got that five million 
because of my Harvest!

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.210
You're no match for my Harvest!

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.670
You wanna see proof?

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.650
You want to see some solid proof?

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.640
I'll show you!

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.460
Ow!

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.050
Bastard!

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.610
No! The promissory note for the five million!

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.360
You're underestimating us, you little punk!

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.200
If you keep chasing me,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.200
I'll kill you.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.510
Shigechi...

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.710
You're gonna kill us, you backstabbing bastard?

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:15.810
You'd better be prepared to die if you're 
gonna bring out your Stand against us!

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.530
W-Wait, Josuke...

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.550
What's wrong?

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.730
What's this sensation?

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.360
M-My legs...

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.600
are itching really bad.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.350
Itching? At a time like this?

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.070
They itch really bad!

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.060
My whole body itches!

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.540
Wh-What is this?!

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.730
Lift up your pants, Okuyasu! Hurry!

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.200
What?!

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.410
They're inside my pants!

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.480
I-It's no use!

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.200
Knocking off two or three of 
them won't damage him at all!

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.470
Damn it!

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.020
He's running away!

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.510
I-I'm starting to get really pissed off.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.600
I've already been super pissed off!

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.450
We're not letting you get away, five million!

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.910
Now he's totally made enemies
of the Okuyasu-Josuke duo!

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:23.320
Shi

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:23.410

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.990
Josuke Higashikata

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.290
Damn it! How dare he make a 
fool of the great Okuyasu?!

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.810
I'm gonna beat him to death!

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.050
He must be really dumb to be greedy enough

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.630
to take the whole five million.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.340
You stupid fatty!

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.430
You think you can run with a body like that?!

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.850
See? That's what you get, moron!

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.690
H-He keeps summoning Harvests under 
him like a caterpillar track,

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.690
or like a bucket relay!

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.370
What the hell? He's ridiculously fast!

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.140
He may be a simpleton, but he's pretty clever.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.220
Are they like his natural instincts?

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.870
Crap! We're gonna lose him!

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.330
Calm down.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.800
We just need to

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:34.310
have our Stands lift our bodies in 
the same way he is, and climb up!

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.970
I get it!

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.110
My five million...

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.910
You actually think you can 
get away from us, Shigechi?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.530
Bring it on!

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:57.790
I'll carefully pop your Harvests, one by one!

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.240
My Harvest is amazing.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.590
It'll gather anything!

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.390
Even screws holding pipes together.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.900
Even bolts!

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.230
If you want to talk about amazing, 
there's also my Shining Diamond!

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.270
Heya.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.040
I'm still super pissed off, but right now, 
I'm still willing to forgive you.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.290
I'll just hit you two or three times!

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.740
Come on, give us the promissory note 
for the five million, Shigechi.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.370
I told you...

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.080
If you came after me,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.560
I'd kill you.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.810
Wh-What?

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.140
My hands...

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.150
That hurt...

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.240
I can't stand! Okuyasu, be careful!

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.240
He did something to me!

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.890
O-Okuyasu, you too?

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.360
You still haven't figured it out?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.590
You guys are drunk!

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.380
A-Alcohol?!

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.500
Liquor

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.660
My harvest gathers anything!

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.550
It brought some alcohol 
from the liquor store earlier,

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.810
then injected it into your bodies!

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.530
Right into your veins!

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.960
Wh-What?!

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.990
You bastard!

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.720
When you inject alcohol into your veins,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.780
even a tiny amount will get you really drunk!

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.420
C-Come to think of it,

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.830
I've heard that alcohol is in the 
same group as anesthetics...

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.780
Th-That bastard... m-might be pretty smart...

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.990
Or it might be his natural instincts.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.550
I-I'm gonna murder him!

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.340
There's no way we're gonna lose 
just because we're drunk!

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.640
M-My eye!

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.430
Josuke, hurry and fix it!

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.570
W-Wait, Okuyasu!

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.180
You guys had the nerve to

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.070
call me unreasonable and other 
things earlier, didn't you?

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.600
I'll show you what happens 
when you underestimate me!

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.450
D-Damn it!

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:43.370
You have the nerve to get cocky after 
you're the one who broke your promise?

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.480
I'm seriously going to get pissed off!

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.960
There's no telling what I'll do then!

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.300
Shut your stupid mouth, Josuke!

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.260
Your Stands' powers are nothing!

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.300
You guys are useless!

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.060
Make demands once you have 
even half of Harvest's power!

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.900
Josuke, close your eyes!

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.040
Josuke!

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.740
Damn, so close!

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.720
But it's no use closing your eyes.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.530
Harvest can get anything!

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:20.800
It can rip off your eyelids 
and pry out your eyeballs!

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.990
All right, Shigechi, stop!

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.440
Forgive us already! It was all our fault.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.420
Oh? You're apologizing?

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.610
Damn it, you little punk!

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.770
Oh? Okuyasu, it doesn't seem 
like Josuke feels that way.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.960
I-I'll give him a talking-to!

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.640
Just let us off the hook with this!

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.040
This is the 10,000 yen you gave 
me and the rest of my money.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.890
Let us off the hook with this.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.870
Who's going to fix my eye if Josuke gets killed?

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.370
O-Okuyasu...

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.890
Oh, yeah! I just remembered!

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:08.500
I felt really bad for you guys, 
and gave you more than 10,000 yen!

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.030
Here, take this, and please forgive us.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.140
I get it, Okuyasu!

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.470
Just like baiting a tanuki 
with food and catching it,

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.500
you're trying to lure him 
over with cash to defeat him!

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.820
I totally got what you're thinking!

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:37.110
Okuyasu, being honest like that 
is very favorable with me.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.410
There, there.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.870
Hey, wait a sec.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.380
Okuyasu, you aren't trying 
to trick me by luring me

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.550
closer with money so you can attack 
me with your Stand, are you?

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.930
Ah! So you are!

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.680
Did you really think I'd fall for that?

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.270
You really thought I was that stupid?

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.690
I won't forgive you anymore!

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.190
That's fine, if you don't forgive us.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.730
But it's too late.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:18.910
Don't you realize that you're 
already in The Hand's range?

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.370
I'm going to scrape away space

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.270
and make it

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.510
teleport!

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.210
We got it back.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.910
Got it back?

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.990
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.920
I'll just easily take it back...

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.670
You don't seem to realize, Shigechi,

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.230
that you have no chance of winning now.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.430
The five million!

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.450
What are you doing?!

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.090
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.770
Stop!

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.940
Why would you do that?!

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.190
Inconceivable! Inconceivable! 
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.570
That's five million yen!

00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:00.010
Basically, just try and injure or kill us.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.310
The only one that can fix this 
note is my Shining Diamond...

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.080
So there's no way you can win.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.080
Oh... I-I see! Conceivable!

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.090
And what happens next certifies your loss.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.390
H-Huh? Again, inconceivable! Inconceivable! 
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.430
What are you doing?!

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.930
Pick them all up, Harvest!

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.590
Looks like you don't realize that

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.090
the fact that you're having 
Harvest go pick them up

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.210
means that you've lost.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:41.740
So now who's going to protect you 
from these two drunks right here?

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.120
Oh, conceivable...

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.570
Smash

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.630
We did it.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.420
Now, Shigechi...

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.570
Why don't we review something very simple?

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.330
The one that collects all 
the pieces is your Harvest,

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.430
and whose Stand is the one that
will put them back together?

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.640
Hm?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.300
Who is it?

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.490
Who's going to fix it with 
their Shining Diamond?

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.020
J-Josuke...

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.000
Whack
Whack

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.020
Josuke? Did you just address me so casually?

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.870
M-Mr. Josuke!

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.030
That's right, it's Mr. Josuke.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.320
But who was the one who just took 
back the promissory note from you?

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.480
Say his name.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.840
O-Okuyasu...

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.410
Mr. Okuyasu!

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.290
Well done. That's a good boy.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.770
All right, next, let's do a little calculation.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.860
How should we split the five million?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.090
How would we split it so 
that no one feels slighted?

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.840
H-Half is fine...

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.200
In half?

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.340
You realize now that there are 
three of us here, don't you?

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.180
So isn't half a bit off?

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.600
That doesn't really add up at all.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.850
Hello?

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.060
I-It'd be a third...

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.940
Th-That's right...

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.000
If it was just me, I'd only be able to gather.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.410
I-I was wrong.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.950
We all found this lottery ticket.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.150
We wouldn't have gotten it 
without the three of us.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.170
I...

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:24.030
I realize that now. I was blinded by greed.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.420
Let's split it up evenly, 
so no one is slighted.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.510
Bam

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.960
Yes!

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.440
B-Bills!

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.190
I-It's five million yen!

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:40.520
Please consider depositing it into our 
Budogaoka Bank for peace of mind.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.920
Of course!

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.230
We finally did it! It's like a dream!

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:50.280
Wait... Splitting it up evenly 
so no one is slighted, huh?

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.710
Huh? This is weird.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.060
If we're going to split it up evenly,

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.290
isn't it unfair if we don't include 
the number of Stands we have?

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.620
If we consider that my Stand, 
Harvest, is about 500,

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.550
then we should split it 500 to 1 and 1.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.470
Don't you think so?

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.910
You little bastard!

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.520
You're seriously going to 
argue about this again?

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.870
It's never going to end, you dumbass!

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.680
O-One third is fine!

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:24.510

in high school to have this much, but...
