WEBVTT

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.620
There it is... The old man's ship.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.360
Right on time.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.000
It's about twenty minutes away.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.390
I-Is Mr. Joseph Joestar the only passenger?

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.490
Yeah.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.250
The entire crew is from 
the Speedwagon Foundation.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.470
The Stand Chili Pepper can only 
move where there's electricity,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.120
but I'm sure he'll do everything possible to get

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.250
over the water and onto the old man's ship.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.420
If he gets there before we do, we lose.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.780
The old man will be killed.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.380
Jotaro!

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.700
We've finished checking the boat.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.260
He's not in the battery.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680
All clear. We can take off.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.830
Josuke, the only ones going to the 
old man's boat are me and Okuyasu.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.520
Huh?

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.870
You and Koichi will stay behind at the harbor.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.540
Stay behind?! Josuke and me?

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.740
Why?

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.690
Josuke, Chili Pepper's user is hiding 
somewhere in this harbor, watching us.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.150
He's waiting for us to make our move,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.240
so he can confirm the boat's position.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.670
But my guess is that he won't be using a boat.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.510
All he needs is something with a battery 
that's faster than a motorboat.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.420
Morioh Harbor
Lighthouse

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.010
Just like he did with the bike,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.430
he'll have Chili Pepper fly over 
in something that has a battery.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.500
Fly? You mean it's actually 
going to fly through the air?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.350
Yeah.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.300
I'm guessing Chili Pepper is

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.690
stealing a remote control model plane
from the model shop right now.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.240
A remote control model plane?!

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.640
That could work!

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.040
Even model planes can travel over 100 kph!

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.240
That's faster than this motorboat.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.760
And because Chili Pepper is controlling it,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.340
he can keep going as long as 
the battery and fuel last!

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.900
The controller signal's range won't matter!

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.180
So Josuke, if you spot something flying, 
look for his user here at this harbor.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.350
Koichi's Reverb has a range of 50 meters.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.950
He can help find him.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.900
If he makes his move before we do,
the old man is finished.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.370
You need to protect your father 
from on-shore. Got it, Josuke?

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.240
Yeah, I get it. We don't have 
even a second to spare.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.460
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.460
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.260
Episode 12  Chili Pepper, Part 2

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.010
Do your best, Okuyasu.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.780
Thanks, Koichi.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.420
We'll arrive at Morioh Port in about 
twenty minutes, Mr. Joestar.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.520
I see. Um...

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.540
Do you know where my cane is?

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.860
Huh? It's right in front of you.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.280
Ahh...

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.040
My father, huh...

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.020
Josuke? Is something the matter?

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.250
Being told that some guy I've never 
met is my father is just kinda...

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.400
You know...

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.430
Well, it's different if his life's in danger.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.770
I won't be able to sleep well unless 
I do my best to protect him.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.310
Besides, I'm sure my mom 
will bawl her eyes out if he dies.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.520
Damn it! It must have been Jotaro.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.370
If he had you two stay behind to find my user...

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.750
Then he completely saw through my 
plan to use a remote control plane!

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.670
Chili Pepper!

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.130
Yeah!

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.350
Jotaro Kujo is a smart man.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.810
Yeah, he's the one person 
I don't want finding me.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.040
This Spitfire remote control plane

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.450
can get to Joseph Joestar 
in a mere five minutes.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.860
On the other hand, a motorboat will 
take about eight to ten minutes.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.490
Which means if I take care of 
you two in about three minutes,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.870
I'll have plenty of time to get past them.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.710
Y-You're Chili Pepper's user?

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.170
The name's Akira Otoishi, nineteen years old.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.040
Oh, and don't mind the guitar.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.060
My dream is to one day 
be an ultra super guitarist,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.240
like Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck,
who lives hard and passionately!

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.650
So I keep it with me all the time.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.950
In the near future,
I'm going to take my guitar

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.190
and knock out people around the world!

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.800
Oh, yeah.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.780
I never even thought that the user 
would show himself on his own.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.250
That must mean he's confident that
he can kill both me and Josuke!

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.460
Yeeees

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.010
I'll only use my pinky finger
against your Shining Diamond,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.560
just like I did with Okuyasu earlier.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.300
Stay back, Koichi.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.770
Here we go, Josuke Higashikata!

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.830
One sec.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.520
Huh?

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.670
If you're going to use only your pinky,

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.570
then I'm gonna make some rules, too.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.240
Rules? Don't get cocky!

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.170
Someone like you doesn't need any rules!

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.870
How dare you do that, you bastard?!

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.460
Well, you said I didn't need any rules.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.050
Didn't you say something about taking 
care of me with just your pinky?

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.710
So what are you going to do,

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.520
Otoishi, my senpai?

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.970
I'm going to kill you.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.670
You already said that earlier!

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.030
Stop saying the same thing 
over and over, you dumbass!

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.710
This agony and pain...

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.210
What am I supposed to take it out on?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.540
This rage...

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.300
Who do I proclaim it to?!

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.920
He's amazing...

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.060
Right-Hand Tapping

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.930
I'm going to kill

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.360
your mommas, too!

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.870
I was able to fully express my heart!

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.070
I was able to express the ultimate rage.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.010
Just try it, Otoishi!

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.330
Wh-What? The user just...

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.040
I can understand his Stand 
moving at amazing speeds,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.060
but the user himself was actually 
able to move behind me?

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.300
Th-That's not it, Josuke!

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.780
I saw what happened from here.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.160
It wasn't Otoishi that moved...

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.430
It was you!

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.820
You were moved!

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.770
What?

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.350
Chili Pepper came out and 
turned Shining Diamond

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.570
180 degrees at incredible speed!

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.020
You're facing the ocean, aren't you?

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.610
Chili Pepper came out?

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.160
Koichi! I haven't seen Chili Pepper at all!

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.720
He's underneath the ground!

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.790
See all the drainage grates around you?

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.970
His upper body came up from there just now!

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.800
There must be electrical wires 
running all over under there!

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.220
I'm strong when I reflect on my actions.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.970
Behind you to your right! There it is!

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.980
Now it's behind you!

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.460
It keeps running back into 
the electrical wires!

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.350
And at light speed!

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.440
Jotaro's the only one who 
can keep up, after all!

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.820
You don't have time to dig up the asphalt

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.630
and cut all the wires underground, 
Josuke Higashikata.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.880
And the more big holes
you make in the ground...

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.630
The more places I can pop up from!

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:18.880
Josuke! To your right!

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.870
In front of you!

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.500
Behind you!

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.880
No, wait! Um...

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.080
It's like insanely hard whack-a-mole!

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.940
He's moving too fast for me 
to tell where he'll come from!

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.780
You should really stop relying on guesswork!

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.280
Josuke...

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.210
And I still have two minutes left...

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.660
That's plenty of time to finish you.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.980
Koichi, watch where Chili Pepper 
comes from and tell me.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.510
I can't tell because I'm too close!

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.900
I-I can't tell, either!

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.940
Every time I think he's out, he goes back in!

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.970
Watch carefully, Koichi.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.120
You should be able to tell 
what I'm thinking by now.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.500
Huh? What you're thinking?

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.660
I-It's all squishy!

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.930
The asphalt's been turned into coal tar...

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.040
And the grates are covered by 
the oil film from the coal tar!

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.490
I got it!

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.310
When he hit the ground earlier,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.370
he turned the asphalt's base into
something else when he fixed it!

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.500
Which means...

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.630
Behind you, to your left!

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.080
Gurb

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.630
Yeah! Bull's eye!

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.590
Bull's eye? That's great.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.260
Do I get a prize

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.680
if I keep hitting him?

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.770
Chi

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:52.890
Chili

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:52.980
Chili Pe

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.020
Chili Pep

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.980
Chili Pepper

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:53.730
Akira

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:53.900
Akira Oto

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.980
Akira Otoishi

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.320
It's the boat! I can see the <i>Traffic</i>!

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.180
W-We're almost there!

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.530
Don't let your guard down yet.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.070
Huh?

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.900
Wh-What the hell is that?

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.870
Josuke! Koichi!

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.500
I-It's so bright!

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:21.720
It seems that I wasn't taking you 
seriously enough, Josuke Higashikata.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.170
I have to give up these foolish thoughts,

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.610
don't you think?

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.600
I'm concentrating all of Morioh's 
electricity on my Chili Pepper.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.350
The reason I didn't do so before

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:40.520
is because the electricity of this whole 
area, which is my power source,

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.700
would be drained to zero for a while!

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.960
But I don't care anymore!

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.500
After I defeat you two, I just need to 
fly over there using the RC plane's battery

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.540
and kill Joseph!

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.880
I-I can't see!

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.320
You bastard...

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.140
J-Josuke actually got overpowered!

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.400
Josuke!

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.030
Do you see?

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.260
All of this town's electricity is on my side!

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.590
I'll be sure to tack the 
cost of all the electricity

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.440
I just used onto your meter.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.110
This is the end, Josuke!

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.340
A t-tire?!

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.430
By the time you realize it, 
it's probably too late.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.130
You blew up that tire on purpose, didn't you?

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.340
So you could fix it and trap my 
Stand inside the tire's rubber!

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.280
That's right! Tire rubber is an insulator, 
so it doesn't conduct electricity!

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.530
Chili Pepper won't be 
able to use electricity!

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.320
Damn it!

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.830
Yes! Now we just have to wait for Jotaro...

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.080
Just kidding.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.200
Huh?

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.000
You were going to insulate
me with tire rubber?

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.910
It might have worked if it 
were about a meter thick!

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.190
Don't make me laugh!

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.380
As if this flimsy rubber 
could have done anything!

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.100
You dumbass!

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.370
Bomu

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.750
You've lost, Josuke!

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.900
Great. You would have been much better off

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.320
if you didn't have the power 
to break through that tire.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.700
Th-The air from inside the tire!

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.300
It was completely full?!

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.620
N-Not the ocean! The ocean is very bad!

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.630
O-Oh, yeah...

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.780
Salt water conducts electricity.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.590
Since the ocean's so vast, the electricity 
will spread out in every direction!

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.930
I'm sorry! Please!

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.640
Pull me out of here!

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.850
You said something about reflecting 
on your foolish thoughts,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.330
but it seems that it's your 
entire character that's foolish.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.010
I-I'm dispersing...

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.370
His Stand's been split up! Which means...

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.190
H-He's dead?

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.550
Jotaro!

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.780
We defeated the user!

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.480
We defeated Chili Pepper's user!

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.970
Well done. That's a relief.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.850
So this guy is Josuke's dad...

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.910
His body's huge, but he's 
a rickety-looking geezer.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.280
You there,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.860
what's your name?

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.500
I-It's Okuyasu.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.860
Okuyasu?

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.090
I'm Josuke's neighbor,
and I'm also a Stand user.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.010
Huh?

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.670
A Stand user.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.870
Huh?

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.170
A S-t-a-n-d u-s-e-r!

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.170
Ah, you can't stand losers?

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.600
I'm a Stand user!

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.340
Oh, I see! So you're a Stand user.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.030
Must be rough.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.800
By the way, Osomatsu,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.850
I can't seem to find my cane.
Do you know where it is?

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.440
Ah!

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.140
Sorry about that. It's right in my hand.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.320
Is this geezer okay?

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.780
Mr. Joestar.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.740
I've come to carry your luggage.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.970
By the way, Osomatsu, I have a question.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.790
Has Josuke...

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.460
Since I didn't even know he was born and

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.100
left him alone these past sixteen years, 
has he said anything about me?

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.470
I can't say that he's said much about that.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:22.140
I see. So he hasn't...

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.080
Yay! It's finally here!

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.970
Look, Josuke!

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.470
Yeah, that's good, I guess.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.860
To be honest,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.100
I'm sort of hoping he just goes back home.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.900
Josuke...

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.250
Well, I mean, I'm glad 
he wasn't killed by Otoishi,

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.230
and things ended happily ever after.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.250
But you know...

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.450
I've never even met this guy before.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.760
I can't really see him as my parent.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.840
I'm sure it's just going to be 
awkward for the both of us.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.160
Not that I have a grudge 
against him or anything.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.070
But I have to think about 
what my mom'll think, too.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.790
Don't you think so, Koichi?

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.700
O-Oh, no...

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.240
Josuke, there's trouble!

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.530
Th-The body!

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.670
Jotaro, there's trouble!

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.920
Akira Otoishi's body disappeared!

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.160
He's still

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.670
alive!

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.710
There's trouble! The enemy 
has boarded the boat!

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.430
It appears that Akira Otoishi was not dead!

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.650
Seriously?

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.110
Take Mr. Joestar...

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.300
Who are you?

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.370
Huh? Did you say something?

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.220
No, he...

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.860
I'm the one who said it!

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.130
He's not a part of the Speedwagon Foundation!

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.620
Wha...

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.060
What?!

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.060
He's the enemy!

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.950
Seriously? You bastard!

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.420
Please wait!

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.320
I'm the one who told you about the enemy!

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.620
Would any enemy actually do that?!

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.800
He's the real enemy!

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.340
You've got a point.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.020
I'm the one who pointed out the enemy first!

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.860
He came to tell you that so 
you'd let down your guard!

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.580
Th-That's also a good point...

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.750
Wh-Which one's the enemy?

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.000
He is!

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.190
D'oh!

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.490
I have to choose again?

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.540
Damn it.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.510
This is what I get for relying 
on my Big Bro so much...

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.320
Okuyasu's easy to deal with.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.310
Jotaro hasn't seen my face yet.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.580
If I can just kill Joseph...

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.130
I'm gonna escape!

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.810
I'm gonna get the hell out of here!

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.900
Chili Pepper!

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.280
Huh? What's that about a chilly pigeon?

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.030
Rumble

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.370
I'll kill you!

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.980
I figured out

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.920
who it is!

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.800
It's you!

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.770
Don't think you can fool 
Okuyasu Nijimura twice!

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.740
H-How did you figure it out?

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.490
You wanna know?

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.970
How...

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:27.370
I was gonna punch both of you!
I'm not very smart, you know.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.540
Watch...

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.580
your step. You're gonna fall into the ocean.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.950
S-Sorry.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.230
If only I had my cane,
I'd be able to get down myself,

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.420
but it broke a moment ago...

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.240
G-Guess I don't have a choice.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.380
Hold on to my hand.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.630
I just had a great idea!

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.160
Why not have Shining Diamond fix the cane?

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.670
Y-You idiot! What are you saying?

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.080
You're so stupid, Okuyasu.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.540
Huh? Why?

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:59.980
Things are better if he 
doesn't fix it this time.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.920
Huh? Why?

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.270
Why is that?

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.010
Now if we just

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.320
retrieve the bow and arrow, it'll all be over,

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.370
including the threat to this town.
