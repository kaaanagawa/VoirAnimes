00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.430
July 15th (Thurs)  8:30 PM

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.380
This isn't good... This isn't good at all!

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.710
I need to let Yoshikage know!

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.550
Reimi!

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.110
You took this picture, Rohan?

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.810
Yes, why?

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.200
This one is marked. Is there 
something wrong with it?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.080
The one you have circled looks a little boy.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.070
Hayato Kawajiri

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.710
Oh, him...

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.730
It's nothing, really.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.210
He seemed to be snooping around, 
so he caught my attention.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.470
But this boy, Hayato Kawajiri, has the 
same last name as this man here.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.570
Huh? Really?

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.470
Look!

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.260
Kosaku Kawajiri

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.180
It's the same.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.980
You're the one who 
researched this, aren't you?

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.290
They do have the same last name.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.270
At this rate, Rohan Kishibe will 
find his way to Yoshikage!

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.940
July 15th (Thurs)  8:48 PM

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.740
Hayato? Hayato!

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.400
Ugh...

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.440
Hayato, I've been calling you!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.180
You can at least answer me!

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.130
D-Darling...

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.470
I thought it was Hayato in the bath.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.170
I mean, look at this!

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.910
Hayato left his clothes in the hallway 
as if they exploded off of him.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.350
Unlike you, no matter how many 
times I warn him, he's such a slob.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.860
And he's not answering me again.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.980
I'm sure he's probably got his 
headphones on, reading manga again.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.200
Oh! Darling, your fingers are bleeding.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660
What happened?

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.720
We need to put a bandage on it.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.620
I-I'll do it myself.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.880
I can apply a bandage myself.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880
Okay...

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.380
I just got my fingers caught 
in the door, that's all.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.650
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.650
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.130
July 15th (Thurs)  8:50 PM

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.230
Hayato Kawajiri?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.790
Are you saying this grade-schooler has 
something to do with Yoshikage Kira?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.010
Episode 35    Bites the Dust, Part 1

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.330
We're not 100% sure yet,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.280
but Rohan-sensei said 
something bugs him about it.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.620
True, there's something wrong if he's 
secretly taking videos of his dad.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.810
So, tomorrow morning, 
we're thinking of meeting up

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.030
and going to visit Hayato Kawajiri's house.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.900
Apparently, Rohan-sensei's 
already found the address.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.590
That bastard Rohan sure works fast.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.480
All right. I just have 
to invite Okuyasu, right?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.640
And of course, there's Jotaro, too.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.570
I'll talk to Jotaro.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.780
All right. See you tomorrow at 8:30 AM

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.900
at the intersection with the Pepsi sign.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.930
Got it.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.290
8:30, huh? I'm gonna be late for school.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.000
But if we talk to this kid, 
we might find something out.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.590
Are you okay?

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.730
You're acting a bit strange, darling...

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.420
And you look pale.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.830
I told you, it's nothing.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.680
I caught my fingers in the door.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.380
Can you blame me for being pale?

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.510
More importantly, can you make me some tea?

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.550
I'll be down soon.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.360
Of course.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.810
This just came to me out of the blue,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.150
but lately, I can't help but 
think that you're immortal.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.320
I'll go make you that tea now.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.650
If something happens to me, 
your secret's going to be found out!

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.380
Don't you lay a finger on me or my mom!

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.450
This isn't a deal!

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.630
You have to listen to me! Got it?!

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.580
You're too naïve!

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.880
Do you really think I would allow that?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.070
I can't believe you actually 
got rid of Hayato.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.210
What a stupid thing to do.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.700
I'm trying to think of what to do right now.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.200
It's no use thinking about it.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.110
I see you made it look like
he fell and hit his head,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.860
but the timing was unfortunate.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.350
That Rohan Kishibe has started 
investigating Hayato Kawajiri.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.930
They're still not positive 
that Kosaku Kawajiri is you,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.550
but they're coming to 
check this house tomorrow.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.450
It's a bad idea to stay in this house any longer.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.790
Shut up. I'm thinking right now.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.850
Ever since you were a child, 
when things didn't go your way

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.490
and there was nothing you could do, 
you would always bite your nails.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.970
You poor thing.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.370
You must be in so much despair right now.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.030
There's no other way around it.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.130
You're going to have to 
leave this town, Yoshikage.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.290
If you go now, you can escape to someplace 
they can't follow you, before they find out.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.970
Are you telling me to flee Morioh?

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.890
You know very well that I'm done 
with living my life in fear,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.860
having to worry about 
someone coming after me!

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.070
I will never leave this town.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.690
What?!

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.490
The arrow acted on its own! 
I didn't do anything!

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.000
I didn't even touch the arrow!

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.590
Th-The arrow...

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.760
Y-Yoshikage!

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.570
Hayato! Hayato?!

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.560
July 16th (Fri)  7:30 AM

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.070
Are you planning to sleep all day, Hayato?

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.390
Hurry up and wake—

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.580
What, you're already 
awake? That's a surprise.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.550
Hayato, breakfast is ready.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.770
Honestly, why don't you ever answer me?

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.550
I couldn't sleep very well last night.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.780
He... He found out that 
I saw him kill someone.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.080
Anyway, I made sure that he 
wouldn't be able to lay a finger

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.720
on me or Mom, but...

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.270
What should I do now?

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.790
I-I don't understand... 
What happened, Yoshikage?

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.510
You've been acting strange since last night.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.060
Listen to me, Yoshikage!

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.990
That Rohan Kishibe has started investigating 
Hayato Kawajiri for some reason!

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.580
They're going to come 
check this house tomorrow.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.400
There's no need to worry.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.230
B-But, Yoshikage!

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.830
Deadly Queen has gained a third ability.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.250
I... I don't understand.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.420
What could have happened 
to make you so carefree?

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.950
-Morioh's Very Own-

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.950
Miso-stewed Cow Tongue

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.360
Miso-stewed cow tongue.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.770
What? No way! We're on the air already?

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.720
Er, um... It's now 7:55, so here's 
the weather today for the prefecture.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.940
Today should be sunny.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.060
Hayato! Hey, Hayato! Answer the phone.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.090
After that bath last night, he changed.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.480
Wh-What could have happened?

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.910
Hayato! I asked you to answer the phone!

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.860
Crash

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.380
My precious tea set!

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.080
This is all your fault!

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.260
Why do you always ignore me?!

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.720
Fine! You think your mother's 
just a bother, right?!

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.590
Do whatever you want, then!

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.390
Now, now. Let's not fight 
first thing in the morning.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.520
If it broke, I'll just buy you another one.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.650
Hello, Kawajiri residence.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.790
No, it's not.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.660
They had the wrong number.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.670
Hayato's just at an age where 
he doesn't want to talk much.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.320
We're family, so we all need to get along.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.640
You know, get along.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.500
Well, I'll head off to work now.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.270
Do you mind if I give you a goodbye kiss?

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.260
Huh?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.050
I'll be off now.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.890
H-He left...

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.820
No, I'm right here.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.400
Why don't we walk together part of the way?

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.090
Going from feeling refreshed 
to falling into despair...

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.050
So much has happened lately. 
I've been on an emotional roller coaster.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.500
But now I'll be able to feel at ease.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.010
Since you cornered me last 
night, I was able to mature.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.800
Really, your will last night was so strong.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.230
To think that you would actually turn 
around and threaten me, Yoshikage Kira...

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.620
Y-Yoshikage Kira?

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.620
Did I just say my real name?

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.180
A-Are you planning to kill me after all?

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.380
Kill you?

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.800
Because you found out my secret?

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.630
There's no need for that. 
Because I've matured.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.660
No matter where you go and 
what you do with anyone,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.930
it doesn't matter, because 
now, none can rival me.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.310
I have no interest in you anymore. 
If I wanted to kill you...

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.770
I would have gotten rid of you last night.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.770
From now on, we're all going to get 
along and live happily together.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.970
So just relax... Like we're family.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.490
Well, I have to head to the station.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.490
Make sure you study hard, Hayato.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.890
Rival... He just said none can rival him...

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.010
Which means there must be others

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.590
that have the same kind of abilities as him.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.750
But what's with that creepy confidence?

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.490
If he's unrivaled now, does that mean 
he's gained some other abilities?

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.730
What should I do?

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.210
What am I supposed to do?

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.440
You're...

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.230
Hayato Kawajiri-kun,

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.820
aren't you?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.270
De

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:30.310
Dead

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.410
Deadly

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.490
Deadly Qu

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:30.530
Deadly Que

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:30.620
Deadly Quee

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.950
Deadly Queen

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:31.700
Ko

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:31.790
Kosaku

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.910
Kosaku Kawa

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.950
Kosaku Kawajiri

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.240
July 16th (Fri)  8:24 AM

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.300
I've been waiting for you.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.580
My name is Rohan Kishibe.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.800
There's something that I wanted 
to ask you out of curiosity.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.440
It's about this picture.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.130
This is you, right?

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.760
Were you taking video of your 
dad in the corner there?

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.270
Wait.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.230
What... is this?

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.190
Well, I know that was sudden...

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.380
But it's much faster to just read

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.870
about Hayato Kawajiri than 
to ask bothersome questions,

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.160
and I can get honest answers this way, too.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.270
[Warning]

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.270
You mustn't
read any further.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.240
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.820
What Heaven's Door turns into a book

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.070
should just be the memories of this boy's 
life experiences, without any falsehoods.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.800
And yet... a warning?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.160
[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.170
What in the world is this?

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.180
Is this "warning" what he experienced?

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.280
I thought I'd just casually 
look into this child,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.930
but now this has definitely 
caught my interest.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.430
[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.440
"You mustn't read any further"?

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.190
Who in the world could this warning be for?

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.490
An old guy walked by with his fly down.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.400
He sneezed and said, "Damn it."

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.810
Some women laughed at him.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.080
Wh-What is this?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.130
This is getting even more confusing.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.070
What does it mean?

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.270
Damn it.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.470
J-Just who is this boy?

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.750
It rained.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.050
Ugh, the forecast didn't 
say it was going to rain!

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.350
At 8:27 AM, lightning struck 
above the Pepsi sign.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.190
8:27...

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.200
Wh-Who in the world is this Hayato Kawajiri?

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.370
Why is he experiencing things in the future?

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.580
Could he be a Stand user?

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.580
No... This is too odd to be a Stand ability.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.500
All I can read with Heaven's Door

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.760
is what he has personally seen or heard.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.880
The answer to this should 
be written somewhere...

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.290
My dad isn't my dad

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.010
<font size="18">He made a man and a woman disappear at an apartment in Jozenji by making them explode.</c>

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.510
<font size="20">He's a murderer. I found out who 
he was. He has inhuman abilities.</c>

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.010
My dad's name is Yoshikage Kira

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.030
Yoshikage Kira

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.690
Kira...

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.410
I-I did it!

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.590
This kid was the jackpot!

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.080
I finally found him!

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.030
Yoshikage Kira is Kosaku Kawajiri!

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.880
He's disguised himself as this kid's father!

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:32.630
Ro

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:32.960
ha

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.010
"Rohan Kishibe was also killed"?

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.020
"He was killed by Kira,

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.010
<font size="20">He was killed by Kira,
who had matured.</c>

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.370
who had matured..."

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.400
Deadly Queen's third bomb, Bites the Dust.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.030
Heaven's Door!

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:04.210
Rohan Kishibe, Deadly Queen 
is already inside your eye!

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.080
That is what you are seeing!

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.460
The switch for Deadly Queen's third bomb

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.220
has already been activated!

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.600
Deadly Queen's third ability...

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.440
It is a bomb to blow away anyone 
who tries to come after me!

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.110
It will activate in anyone who tries to get 
close to Hayato in order to learn about me.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:40.120
He was killed by Kira,
who had matured.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:40.120
Rohan Kishibe was also killed.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.660
It'll also activate if Hayato happens 
to verbally reveal my identity,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.110
and if he writes it down, 
it'll activate immediately.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:44.020
Which means it's a bomb 
I implanted in Hayato!

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.120
C-Come to think of it,

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.710
I was supposed to meet Koichi 
and the others here at 8:30...

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.720
I finally... found out Yoshikage Kira's identity...

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.840
Koichi is coming. I have to tell him...

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.870
I... I finally... found him...

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.820
Yoshikage Kira is Kosaku Kawajiri.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.120
I found him with my Heaven's Door.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.650
I have to tell...

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.920
Koichi...

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.630
And now,

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.710
this is the real third 
ability of Deadly Queen!

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.690
K-Koichi!

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.690
I-It was a dream?

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.200
I couldn't sleep very well last night.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.880
I kept having these weird dreams...

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.420
Hayato!

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.630
Are you planning to sleep all day, Hayato?

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.280
Hurry up and wake—

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.440
What, you're already awake?

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.720
That's a surprise.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.680
Hayato, breakfast is ready.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.970
Honestly, why don't you ever answer me?

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.350
D-Didn't this...

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.300
What? No way! We're on the air already?

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.400
Th-This morning TV program...

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.690
Hayato! Hey, Hayato! Answer the phone.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.570
Th-This isn't a dream...

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.830
What I just saw wasn't a dream.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.490
Th-This is the same morning.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.520
It's repeating...

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.340
Today's morning is repeating again!

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.590
Yoshikage Kira... His name is Yoshikage Kira!

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.890
He's doing this!

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.840
This is the unrivaled ability 
he was talking about,

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.500
and he planted that inside me!

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.550
Hayato! I asked you to answer the phone!

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.400
Oh, yeah!

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.530
Look out—

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.000
Ow...

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.690
That was a nice catch. It was almost 
as if you knew it was going to fall.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.290
But if you can hear me, 
you could at least answer!

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.270
Hello, Kawajiri residence.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.560
Huh? No, it's not.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.560
It appears I'm the only one 
in the world who's aware

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.680
that this morning is repeating.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.340
It's almost as if you knew, huh?

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.130
Apparently you blew someone 
up and came back, Hayato.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.700
No, really. I don't know 
exactly what you've done.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.190
This is called Deadly Queen Bites the Dust,

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.360
and it automatically protects me...

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.930
from inside you, Hayato.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:14.250
Did you know that I already 
killed you once last night?

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.730
As though as it was trying to remedy

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.530
the despair I was feeling 
from the situation I was in,

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.800
I gained a brand new ability.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:29.020
By using that ability on you, 
time went back an hour,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.050
and the fact that I killed you disappeared.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.920
At the same time, 
you became a bomb to protect me.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.860
You told someone about me and the 
bomb activated, and then you came back.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.320
Who did you blow away, hm? Come on, tell me.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.210
Who did you kill?

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.080
I-I didn't tell anyone...

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.970
I see! Then someone must have 
been asking you questions.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.870
It must be that Rohan Kishibe.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.030
Even if you have no intention 
of telling anyone,

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:07.220
as soon as someone asks you about me, 
Bites the Dust will activate.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.970
And then you will blow him up and come back.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.930
The very fact that Rohan Kishibe 
encountered you has disappeared!

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.890
That is Deadly Queen Bites the Dust.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.430
You won't be able to tell anyone.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.590
There will be no one who 
can ask you anything!
