00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.490
This is Morioh Radio.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.950
Your host, once again, is me, 
your neighbor, Kai Harada.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.870
Now, then...

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.200
Look at those smooth spokes
shining as they spin!

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.790
Last week's topic was, "The King of Terror is 
supposed to come from the sky this July.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.480
This mountain bike was a gift to 
celebrate me getting into high school.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.390
What are the citizens of 
Morioh going to do?"

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.960
Getting new stuff is always exciting.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.270
All right, let's get to the replies.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.380
This one's from "RIP Big Bro."

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.670
I'm not gonna be able to take 
the bus to school for a while!

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.670
I wonder what happened to his big bro?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.790
O-Ow...

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.050
Wh-What the heck?

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.190
There's a bag in the middle of the road.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.910
I-It can't be! The thing in that bag was...

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.460
Wh-What am I gonna do?! I ran it over!

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.270
I-I couldn't help it!

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.910
It was in the middle of the road!

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.650
There was nothing I could've done!

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.920
Precisely.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.050
You're not the one at fault here.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.140
That was just an unfortunate accident.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.730
The guy who put the kitten in a bag 
and left it in the road is at fault.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.180
Talk about a terrible thing to do.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.930
W-We have to treat its injuries!

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.320
It's no use.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.600
You don't hear it crying, do you?

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.450
It's dead.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.960
What's your name?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.580
My name's Tamami Kobayashi, 
and I graduated from

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.680
your school two years ago.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.870
That's a nice bike.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.370
You a first-year?

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.470
Y-Yes. My name's Koichi Hirose.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.090
Ah, high school, eh? Takes me back.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.010
Things were good back then.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.370
Well, have a seat, Hirose.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.850
Huh? B-But...

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.530
Just shut up and sit down.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.360
So... I've got an idea.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.660
I'll bury that cat for you,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.280
so give me a little money. Okay?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.660
Hey! Are you listening?!

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.500
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.010
Hey, now. Quit messing around.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.500
It's true that this wasn't your fault,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.530
but are you planning to do
nothing about killing my cat?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Did you say it was your cat?

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.870
That's right.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.700
Y-You put the kitten o-over there?

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.260
That's not the problem anymore.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.640
I'm asking you if you're really 
gonna do nothing about it and go.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.120
You're the one that killed it, bro.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.440
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.440
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.720
Episode 6  Koichi Hirose (Reverb)

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.520
Hey, you're feeling guilty, right?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.390
If your heart could be freed

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.310
from the shackles of guilt by paying some cash...

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.070
Wouldn't it be better to just pay up?

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.020
Right?

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.240
Money

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.820
Wh-What's this lock-looking thing?!

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.750
It's heavy!

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.460
Huh? You can see that?

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.880
Then this should go even faster, Hirose.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.260
Th-This is a Stand!

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.320
A Stand's inside my body!

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.760
Hey, Josuke.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.250
Isn't that Koichi standing over there?

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.540
Yeah, that's definitely Koichi.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.610
That kid hangs out with shady-looking 
characters all the time.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.830
But he looks like he's having fun.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.040
I met a guy named Keicho Nijimura 
about four months ago,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.500
and obtained this ability.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.970
I had no idea what was going on,
but man, I was happy.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.500
I figured that if I could 
use this ability properly,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.510
it could support me for the rest of my life.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.300
Now...

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.160
Come on, cough it up.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.190
These shackles won't come 
off if you don't pay up.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.930
I-I don't...

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.310
have any money.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.850
Huh... You looked away just now, didn't you?

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.140
W-Well...

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.780
I-It's heavy!

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.110
I can't even stand anymore!

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.280
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.030
It's not nice to lie, you know.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.400
You felt bad about lying, didn't you?

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.870
The more guilt you feel,
the bigger the lock becomes.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.930
These shackles are the weight of your sins.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.740
It's automatic.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.800
Even if I'm sleeping, or if you try to 
run far away, it's never coming off.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.010
All right? If you get it, 
then show me your wallet.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.800
Come on.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.830
What the heck? You should have just 
given me this in the first place.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.320
You have 7,000 yen!

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.990
Th-That's for buying sneakers 
for gym class today.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.700
Sneakers?

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.360
Go barefoot!

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.590
What are you doing over there?

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.950
J-Josuke and Okuyasu!

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.720
A grown man trying to threaten 
a high school kid for money?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.830
Try getting a job to earn your money.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.550
Now, look! You little boys stay out of this!

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.860
Oh, we can't do that.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.470
Not when there's some smelly trash 
around, using some petty Stand.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.570
We've got to take out that trash properly.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.260
Hey...

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.540
This seriously isn't coming off.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.330
Whoa, wait... You guys can see it, too?

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.230
Just how many of you can see that?

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.790
That's what I want to know.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.570
But right now, that doesn't matter.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.910
Would you kindly take that lock off of him?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.450
Hey, you little brats! 
Don't underestimate me!

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.420
I'm not playing games here!

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.630
Sinners must pay for their sins. 
That's the rule of society.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.080
Or what? You're going to 
pay me instead of Koichi?

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.830
Then I'll let you off the hook.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.080
Money's money to me.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.910
Oh? You're gonna try to get money from me?

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.020
Just try it, damn it!

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.700
Wait! You just took 7,000 yen for me!

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.470
That was the fee for lying to me!

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.070
Huh?!

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:52.210
You're trying to pay for that poor 
kitten's life with just 7,000 yen?

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.810
That just won't do.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.950
I'll take about five hundred grand for that.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.870
Five hundred grand?!

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.350
Come on, five hun—

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.830
Shut up, you little shit!

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.840
O-Okuyasu!

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.420
Hey, don't push it.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.080
Shut yer trap, you dumbass.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.880
We told you to give his 7,000 yen 
back, so give it back, you dipshit!

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.210
Slip

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.980
O-Ow! My front tooth!

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.740
Wh-Why the hell did you wobble around 
and fall over on your own?

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.850
On my own? That's so cruel!

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.790
How dare you say that after hitting me?!

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.900
My front tooth's gone. You're so cruel!

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.490
H-Hey, wait a sec... Are you okay?

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.710
Wait, Okuyasu...

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.220
Don't feel any guilt toward him!

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.760
H-He did it on purpose!

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.190
Front teeth are pretty expensive, you know...

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.260
Since I don't have insurance.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.020
Wh-Why, you...

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.530
Whoa, now! Don't try anything funny with me.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.390
If anyone who's got my lock on them 
tries to damage me in any way,

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.530
it goes right back to that lock.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.970
Y-You bastard...

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.210
Hey. Is the kitten that 
you said Koichi ran over

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.990
this thing?

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.890
A s-stuffed animal?

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.640
Here, let me see. I picked 
up your front tooth for you.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.940
It's all better.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.530
It's gone!

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.520
Yay! My heart feels so much lighter now!

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.100
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.150
Hey, aren't you forgetting the 7,000 yen?

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.870
All right! I'll give it back.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.590
Once the money's down, hurry up 
and get out of here, dumbass!

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.760
I-I'm saved... Ah!

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.380
Th-The bills... H-He took them!

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.420
He took the big parts that
the bank would exchange!

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.190
Th-That bastard...

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.510
Unforgivable! Even if it's not my money.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.390
Damn. I was only able to get 7,000 yen.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.340
Don't think you're gonna get away with that.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.800
Just you wait.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.160
Aw, man...

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.100
My day started off with something 
terrible, so I was down the whole day.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.230
I'm home, Police.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.550
Hey, you alive? Woof, woof.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.520
I'm home.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.220
I've heard all about you around town, ma'am.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.970
They say you're beautiful, kind, and so refined.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.490
You can't be serious.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.380
I wouldn't lie!

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.550
Really?

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.190
Of course!

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.240
Wh-Why is he in my house 
rubbing my mom's shoulders?!

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:22.700
The

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.950
The Lock

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.660
Tama

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:23.780
Tamami

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.910
Tamami Koba

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.950
Tamami Kobayashi

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.200
Y-You!

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.520
What are you doing here?!

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.440
Oh, Ko, you're back. Hi!

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.380
I-I asked you wh-what you were doing here!

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.020
This gentleman delivered 
the money you dropped.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:41.720
Huh?!

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.050
Seven thousand yen.
You must've been in a hurry.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.130
Th-This money... You told her you found it?

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:53.640
That's right. You ran into Mr. Kobayashi 
on your bike today, didn't you?

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.630
Wha...

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.320
I made sure you got your money back, Koichi.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.260
A-And you should have!

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.950
Ko, why are you so worked up?

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.760
Ma'am, this is hard for me to say,

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.830
but it appears that I dropped my wallet 
when we ran into each other, too.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.880
It looks just like this one.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.320
Which means our wallets got swapped.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.510
Do you understand what I'm saying, ma'am?

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.950
Y-Yes, though that seems very unusual.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.530
But I guess it's possible.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.970
So I'd like you to tell Koichi 
to return my wallet to me.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.130
It had about five hundred thousand yen in it.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.530
Please tell him to give it back to me.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.150
What?!

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.410
F-Five hundred thousand?!

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.110
So that's it!

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.260
I see your scheme now!

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.000
K-Ko...

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.910
Don't panic! He's a con artist!

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.280
They're all lies!

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.880
Oh, that's right.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.710
I can prove that our wallets got switched.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.860
Last night, I had a 
hamburger combo at Jonny's.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.560
And... Oh, yes. I added an 
order of onion gratin soup...

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.060
So I believe the total on
the receipt was 1,833 yen.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.020
It should be tucked away 
in the wallet Koichi has.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.980
K-Ko!

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.290
N-No! Mom, please believe me!

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.880
This is a trick!

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.160
You did this earlier, didn't you?!

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.600
And then you went out of your 
way to buy a similar wallet!

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.380
I hate to say this, but your son, though
I'm sure it's just a phase, is pretty rotten.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.310
Don't you feel guilty as his mother

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.720
for raising a son like that?

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.770
Stop!

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.520
M-Mom!

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.440
I finally did it!

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:06.130
Now the weight of her guilt 
won't allow her heart to be free.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.230
I'm gonna take you for everything you've got.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.160
First, I'll take this house's land, title, and seal.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.420
What a great house this is.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.940
Koichi,

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.500
is something wrong?

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.760
Sis!

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.050
Wh-What?!

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.320
Earlier, when she brought me tea,
I made her spill some on my hand,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.290
and then acted like it really burned.
She kept apologizing so much.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.810
She was so cute and sexy.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.210
So she's a third-year at a girls' school?

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.490
R-Ripe for the picking.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.080
A-A-Awesome!

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.160
How dare you?

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.790
You won't get away with this! I won't let you!

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.050
What the hell?

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.220
What's up with that puny egg thing?

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.690
What the hell is that?!

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.910
Mom, Sis, please leave the room for a while.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.340
Ko, what's happening?

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.400
Please, don't ask any questions now.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.410
Hey! K-Keep that thing away from me!

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.500
Your mom and sister leaving the room

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.290
doesn't change the fact that 
th-they're my hostages!

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.380
I won't let you harm my mom or sister.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.520
J-Just try it, Koichi! Just try!

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.740
Take the locks off of them!

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.640
If your mom sees you beating 
the crap out of me,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.930
her guilt is just gonna grow more and more!

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.190
I told you to take them off!

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.900
Don't underestimate Tamami 
Kobayashi, you pissy little shit!

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.440
L-Like hell I'll take them off!

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.070
Crack!

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.440
Huh? What?

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.080
That didn't hurt.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.950
Huh?

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.360
Smack!

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.910
Whoa! What's this?

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.580
The sound is impressive, 
but it's actually super weak!

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.700
What the hell is with your Stand?

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.760
It doesn't have any speed or power at all!

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.240
How dare you scare me 
like that, you dumbass?!

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:44.110
I'll show you that a Stand's strength 
comes from how strong you are mentally!

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.770
Crack!

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.770
Which means your mental strength is zero!

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.900
I'm gonna make sure you pay dearly for this!

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.030
S-Something strange is 
going on with his cheek!

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.860
"Cr-ack"?

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.950
It looks like a manga sound effect.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.700
Crack!

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.250
<font size="26">Crack!
Crack!
Crack!</c>

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.580
Wh-What the heck? I hear a 
weird ringing in my ears!

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.780
Like the sound I heard when I got hit...

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.210
Smack

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.640
What the hell is this writing on my arm?!

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.220
I-It won't come off!

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.800
<font size="26">Smack!
Smack!
Smack!</c>

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.470
<font size="26">Crack!
Crack!
Crack!</c>

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.600
Smack!
Smack!
Smack!

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.600
Crack!
Crack!
Crack!

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:26.480
W-Wait... Th-These sounds that
I hear coming from inside me...

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.250
Your Stand did that?!

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.280
Damn it! Get rid of this sound!

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.280
Smack

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.020
Boom!

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:43.000
Boom!

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:43.000
Smack!

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:43.000
Crack!

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.200
It's the sound.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.770
My Stand makes the sound 
resonate from inside his body.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.010
C-Come to think of it, there was that famous 
Basho Matsuo poem I learned at school...

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:58.680
So quiet and still
The shrill of the cicadas
Seeps into the rocks

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.950
"So quiet and still,

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.090
the shrill of the cicadas

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.130
seeps into the rocks."

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:05.840
Smack!

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:05.840
Crack!

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:05.840
Boom!

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.000
Damn it! I totally fell for it!

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.850
If you take the locks off my mom 
and sister, I'll stop the sound.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.160
If you keep resisting,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.270
even I don't know what will happen to your body.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.780
Stop this sound!

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.060
Dogyaa

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.120
Stop being stubborn and take off those locks!

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.120
Damn it! How dare you do this to me?!

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.120
Smack!

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.120
Crack!

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.120
Boom!

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.120
Dogyaa!

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.030
Like I could threaten and con if I was 
afraid of a little brat like you!

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:36.260
The "Tama" in my name means "ballsy"! 
I'll show you just how ballsy I am!

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.800
I'm not scared of some knife!

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.710
Don't take me lightly!

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.390
I'll show you how terrifying I can be!

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.730
The true fear of the locks!

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.560
Ow!

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.060
What?!

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.940
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.410
Make the cut shallow, and scream like hell!

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.150
Toss!

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.030
"Toss"?

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.480
What was that scream?

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.280
What's wrong?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.810
Ko?!

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.410
I-It's not what it looks like!

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.340
C-Crap!

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.090
Yes!

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.220
K-Ko! How could you do 
something so terrifying?!

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.100
No, Mom! t's not what it looks like!

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.100
No!

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.100
Sis!

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.700
I win! You lose!

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.730
Hurry up and stop this sound, Koichi!

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.560
If you don't stop this sound,

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.480
your mom won't be able to 
bear the weight of her guilt.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.640
When humans can't bear the 
weight of their sins anymore,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.420
they think they'd be better off dead.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.120
I-I can't... anymore!

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.870
Mom!

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.040
I can't live any longer!

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.030
Stop acting tough!

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.400
Hurry and stop this sound! Are you
gonna let your mom kill herself?!

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.200
No, I won't stop the sound.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.840
I'll do the opposite, and make more sound!

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.090
Believe in me!

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.470
Believe in me!

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.530
Believe in me!

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.690
What?!

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.230
!em ni eveileB

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.560
Believe in me, Mom!

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.070
Believe in me!

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.100
Believe!

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.440
Mom!

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:20.810
Believe in me!

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:26.820
Believe in me!

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.820
This is a matter of the soul! 
Like hell she'll believe you!

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.040
Mom...

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.570
He's right... If I, his own mother,
won't believe in him,

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.500
then who will?

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.780
Koichi's always been a nice boy.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.010
He would never hurt anyone 
or take their money.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.390
Yes!

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.430
Sh-Shit!

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.810
Mom!

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.460
D-Damn it!

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.210
Usually, they'd never believe...

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.020
My parents would never believe in me!

00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.530
Gulp...

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.340
It was just a joke!

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.910
Ko, it was all just a joke!

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.420
Take the lock off my sister, too.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.620
It's already off!

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.770
We can't do anything to harm her beauty, right?

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.380
I was only kidding about taking your house!

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.180
I even gave back your 7,000 yen,
didn't I? Right? Right?

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.660
Please forgive me!
I'll do anything, Master Koichi!

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.560
What? You'll do anything?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.400
Yes, Master Koichi! Anything! 
I'll be your underling!

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.780
All right, then...

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.030
Make sure you bring me five 
hundred grand by tomorrow.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:51.100
It's a joke. It's only a little joke.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.360
Th-That didn't sound like a joke!

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.520
H-Hey, Okuyasu! What the 
hell is going on here?

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.790
Allow me to carry your bag to school!

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.220
You're seriously going to carry it?

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.140
But of course!

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.060
Master Koichi! You're a true man among men!

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.800
Oh, stop it.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.990
Hey, Okuyasu!

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.830
Don't ask me! I'm not smart, remember?
