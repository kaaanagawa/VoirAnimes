00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.400
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.400
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.760
Episode 13  We Picked Up Something Crazy!

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.310
Next on Morioh Radio, we have a 
letter from "Troubled Lonesome Boy."

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.490
"Kai, listen to this.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.160
I can't get a hold of my girlfriend 
at all and it's making me blue."

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.070
I wonder if she's mad because 
I proposed suddenly.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.320
And I spent all my pay on an engagement
ring with a ruby, her birthstone...

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.960
So you were able to successfully 
retrieve the bow and arrow.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.850
Yeah, from Akira Otoishi's place.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.960
He'd been committing burglaries with his Stand.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.130
Roughly 500 million yen worth.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.920
The police are still looking into it.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.880
Try doing something with your Stand again.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.430
I'll send you to the ends of 
the Earth and kill you there.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.180
I'll be safest in prison!

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.740
Chili Pepper's in pieces.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.380
Even if he gets out of jail, 
I'm sure he won't try anything again.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.980
Jotaro, what are you going 
to do with the bow and arrow?

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.850
The Speedwagon Foundation is going 
to hold on to it and research it.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.520
It's a crucial piece of evidence we can use 
to unravel the mystery behind Stands.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.680
That's great.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.240
Thank goodness!

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.600
That means this incident's been resolved!

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.880
It didn't end up being that big 
a deal, but yay! Hooray!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.170
I'm still questioning Otoishi about the Stand

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.380
users that were created here.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.540
Stay on your guard, just in case.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.610
Yeah.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.610
Right.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.610
Sure.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.300
Coffee in Japan is still the best.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.740
Waitress, can I get a refill?

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.300
Whoa! Jeez.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.960
Be more careful. I look away for a second and...

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.210
Josuke, don't you have to go? 
The bus will be here soon.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.960
R-Right...

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.330
Yeah. Come on, let's go. Stand up.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.840
I wonder if those two will be okay.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.500
I'm worried.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.010
Whoa, this cake is so good!

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.010
Can I get another slice, waitress?

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.990
Hello, this is the Higashikata resid—

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.040
Hey, Mom. It's me.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.650
Josuke? It's unusual for you to call me.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.470
Do you need something?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.030
Well, uh... Hey, y-you're going 
to be home all day today, right?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.860
Yeah? What about it?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.320
N-Nothing! As long as you're 
there, it's fine. Bye!

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.420
Hey!

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.210
What was that all about?

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.420
He'd better not be planning 
something weird again.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.360
Crap. I hope Mom didn't 
think that was weird.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.270
Oh, for crying out loud...

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.270
I told him to wait until I was 
done with the phone call!

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.080
Hey, wait!

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.370
Hello? Can you hear me? Hey!

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.590
Did you just call for me?

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.660
Yeah. We can't get a taxi at this hour,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.100
so we're going to take the bus to my house.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.760
And... I know I'm being pushy, but I'm 
going to confirm one more time.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.550
You can only look from a distance.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.360
Make sure you don't talk to my mom!

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.720
Promise me that.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.770
My mom won't be happy just 
because you came to visit.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.230
She's gonna be a wreck.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.230
I know that. I promise.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.700
Also, one more thing.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.870
I'm gonna be calling you Mr. Joestar.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.250
Huh?

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.680
W-Well, you know... I might 
as well lay it on the line now.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.830
I mean, it might seem cold,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:28.110
but calling someone I just met "Dad" 
or "Pops" is just not happening.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.070
So after you see my mom, I want 
you to go right back to America.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.420
Right...

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.750
You're absolutely right. I understand.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.350
Man, this is awkward.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.550
I know it's best to be honest, but still,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.080
there are some things between 
people that just aren't possible.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.210
Hey, Mr. Joestar...

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.040
Excuse me, did you see where the burly 
old man who was just here went?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.370
He got onto that long-distance bus.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.510
Bright Deer

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.510
Long Distance Bus

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.510
To Sapporo

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.910
Y-You can't be serious! Damn it!

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.830
I'm sorry about that.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.310
You said we were getting on a bus, so...

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.400
But I'm surprised you caught 
up to the bus by running.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.890
We were just about to get onto the freeway.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.070
Right now, I'm thinking it might have 
been better to just let you go...

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.120
To Hokkaido!

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.770
Ugh, my stomach hurts.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.010
Sorry about that.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.040
Josuke...

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.430
Something seems to be 
pulling on my trousers.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.050
Oh, really? Don't let them 
drag you off somewhere again.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.050
Wha...

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.850
J-Josuke! There's a Stand user nearby!

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.280
Yup, there sure is.
Two, in fact... Me and you.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.150
Anyway, is there a vending 
machine nearby? I need a drink.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.400
Wh-What is this? They're not footsteps.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.210
Hands? Hand prints?

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.140
Oh my God! Josuke, the Stand just laughed!

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.880
See? Right here! On top of the sand!

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.720
There's no way I'm letting him see my mom.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.860
Now he's seeing and hearing things.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.720
This is concrete!

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.150
Where did it go? Where is it? It's gone!

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.490
Where did you go? It's gone!

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.910
Great. This old man is seriously bad news.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.000
Hermit Purple!

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.880
Get out of here, you mutt! Shoo! Shoo!

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.360
Do you hear something crying?

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.030
It's right here, Josuke.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.770
A baby! There's a naked baby right here.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.780
I can tell when I'm touching it. It's invisible!

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.160
What?!

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.080
I-It's there!

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.660
It's really there!

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.880
It's all squishy.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.260
Well, I'll be damned.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.800
It's an invisible baby!

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.260
It feels like it's only about 
six months old or so.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.580
But how did a baby turn invisible out here?

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.050
I'm assuming it's a Stand ability, but...

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.160
There are a lot of questions, 
like, "Why did the enemy

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.200
Stand user make it invisible," 
and "Where is its mom?"

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:20.200
Josuke, I think the baby 
is actually the Stand user.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.170
It's a Stand user without realizing it.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:28.440
Because it's been separated from its 
mother, it instinctively went invisible.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.210
Huh?

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.310
Even adults can develop ulcers,
spot baldness, and gray hair

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:39.220
before they realize it for 
psychological reasons, right?

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.970
I believe that finding its mother 
will be the way to solve this.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.580
H-Hey, just hurry up and make it stop crying.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.080
I-I'm not really sure what to do, either.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.260
I did something similar to this,
but that was a very long time ago.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.610
There, there...

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.060
Th-This is...

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.520
Did you figure something out?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.370
Yes, when I just touched it now.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.970
It's a little girl.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.250
Right, the way to tell if it's a boy 
or a girl is between the legs!

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.430
Did you find out something else?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.660
Josuke,

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.010
do you have any tissues?

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.260
Th-That smell...

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.300
I-Is there one on your hand? A huge one?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.360
I-It's invisible, so I couldn't tell 
for sure until I could smell it.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.930
And I just scratched my beard with this hand!

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:48.330
Shi

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:48.410
Shini

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.500

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.830
Josuke

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:49.960
Josuke Higashi

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.000
Josuke Higashikata

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.170
I'm returning your manuscript to you.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.240
I'll be looking forward to those 
fixes for the volumes, Sensei.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.990
For the time being, we're gonna 
have to get milk and diapers.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.640
And since she's naked, 
we need to get her some clothes.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.170
I'm counting on you, Mr. Joestar.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.820
What? I-I'm buying them?

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.830
Of course. Look at me.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.920
It'd be too embarrassing 
for me to buy baby goods.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.610
There'd be rumors that

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.990
a 16-year-old delinquent like 
me got some girl pregnant.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.700
But I only have American traveler's checks.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.590
Oh, fine...

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.250
You can use my credit card.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.970
Sorry about that.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.800
Don't buy anything too expensive.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.110
I've worked hard to build up my 
savings, and I don't have much!

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.640
I got it, I got it.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.560
Welcome.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.240
Can I help you find something?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.370
Um... Do you carry disposable diapers?

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.400
Of course! Is this your first time here?

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.580
Yes, it is, but...

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.580
These diapers are easy to change, 
even if you're living on your own.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.170
Silky Smooth Underwear
For Adults

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.170
You won't have to worry overnight, either.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:19.390
Um... I'm looking for a baby, not myself.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.750
P-Pardon me! So you're 
looking for baby diapers.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.180
Were you looking for cloth diapers, 
or disposable pull-ups?

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.270
Uh... What was that?

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.130
As you can see, this one 
will need a diaper cover,

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.440
but the disposable pull-up 
is simple and economical.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.900
I-I don't really know, so could you just...

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.660
What size do you need?

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.410
Size?

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.560
How old is the baby?

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.100
Depending on the baby's size,

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:58.470
we have newborn, S-size, M-size, 
L-size, XL-size, boys' and girls'.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.920
Th-There are that many options nowadays?

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:07.340
W-Well, she's a girl, and when 
I held her, she was about this big.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.350
What do you mean by "when I held her," sir?

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.900
It'd be inconvenient for us 
if you bought diapers

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.360
that were too big, and then

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.750
tried to return them after
they've been pooped in.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.140
Oh, all right. Give me all of the sizes.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.070
I also need baby wipes, 
powdered milk, and baby bottles...

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.120
For baby bottles, we have glass or plastic.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.120
Huh?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.900
Glass ones don't scratch or 
start to smell as easily,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.380
but they are a bit heavy for a baby to hold.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.390
The plastic ones are light, 
but may have a noticeable smell.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.040
Which one would you like?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:45.300
U-U-Uh... Um...

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.890
We also have various shapes and designs.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.900
We have ones shaped like 
rocket ships and racing cars.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.100
This one, the baby can hold by itself.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.860
And this one, if you turn it 
upside-down, the doll inside moves.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.630
I-I have no idea, so if you 
could just throw in a few...

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.740
And which bottle nipples 
would you like, sir?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.300
Rubber ones are soft,
but don't last very long.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.100
Silicon ones last, but are a bit hard.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.280
This one is called a "Chupatoreni."

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.600
There's a diaphragm where 
the nipple goes in the mouth,

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.930
and the flow of milk is adjusted 
by how hard the baby sucks on it.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.950
This is a NUK from Germany.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.220
The shape is slightly flattened, and is said to

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.800
more closely resemble
a mother's natural shape.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.270
And just like when drinking breast 
milk, it will not come out

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.160
unless they use their jaws.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.980
O-Oh, all right. Whatever is fine.
Just give me all of them.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.230
As for the nipple holes, we have round,
Y-shaped, and cross-shaped varieties.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.460
J-Just give me all of them.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.080
And some baby clothes and socks, too.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.710
I'll be paying by card.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.420
Thank you very much, sir.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.270
130,000... I don't really 
understand yen that well.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.060
I wonder how much that is in dollars.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.490
If 100 yen is about 80 cents...

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.750
Well, whatever.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.550
I didn't waste any money, 
and it's just baby stuff.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.560
I'm sure it can't be that expensive.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.980
Damn it...

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.980
What's he doing? He's taking forever.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.950
By the way...

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.760
The girl who got the ring. 
I wonder what happened with that.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.080
Since he didn't get an answer, 
I wonder if that was a no.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.250
They could be super conflicted about it.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.570
I can't stay here...

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.910
If people from school find me here...

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.210
Sorry to keep you waiting, Josuke.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.210
Here's your card back.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.990
You're done? A-All right, let's go.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.300
Now we won't have to worry 
about losing sight of her, but...

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.120
If strangers see that she doesn't 
have a face, they'll be creeped out.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.850
I thought about that and...

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.730
bought some makeup, too.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:10.220
Let's try some foundation first. There we go!

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.920
Hey, I think she might actually be cute.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.910
My, what a beauty!

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.500
This face will help us find her mom.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.090
We've finally got some hope. We can do this!

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.760
That was a good idea!

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.720
Good, good! All right, 
now let's try some lipstick.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.850
And let's draw on some eyebrows 
and eyelashes... Like that.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.120
I knew he'd do that...

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.500
So this geezer's the type to get carried 
away when you compliment him.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.860
Now we can finally take you around 
without having to worry too much.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.670
We can't put makeup on your eyes, 
so we'll just have to use sunglasses.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.390
That looks great!

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.370
Here's some milk.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.330
Maybe I went too light on the foundation.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.100
It looks like it's starting to come off...

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.500
Th-That's not it!

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.100
What is this?! Sh-She's...

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.850
Sh-She disappeared! And so did my hands!

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.060
This baby's not just making herself invisible!

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.620
She's making everything 
around her invisible, too!

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.690
Mr. Joestar! Let go of the baby!

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.110
I'm telling you to hurry up 
and let go of the baby!

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.690
Th-They're still invisible, 
even though I let go of her.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.030
She's powering up!

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.050
This isn't good.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.150
It looks like everything within 
about thirty centimeters

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.010
of that baby is becoming invisible.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.850
But this doesn't make sense.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.450
If she keeps trying to protect 
herself with her Stand,

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.270
who could even feed her or take care of her?

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.900
So it must be due to feelings of anxiety.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.820
It's stress.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.990
She doesn't want to be touched 
by someone she doesn't know.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.570
If she powers up any more, 
no one will be able to get near her.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.620
We'll end up invisible, too.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.020
That's some weird junk. 
I wonder who's gonna clean it up.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.130
Well, I guess someone will do it.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.700
Not me, though.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.550
Look out!

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.650
What happened?

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.500
This lit cigarette butt was...
Oh, you can't see it.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.480
What the hell are you doing, Mr. Joestar?!

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.820
Don't space out at a time like this!

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.570
I, uh...

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.040
The stroller completely disappeared!

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.380
And the ground, too!

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.160
So it is stress!

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.520
The more scared she gets,
the wider her range gets!

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.680
That's the sound of the stroller flipping over!

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.010
The invisible baby... fell into the water?!

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.650
Wh-Where is she? Make some noise!

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.940
I can't even see any bubbles! Where is she?!

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.900
J-Josuke...

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.070
Shut up!

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.560
This all happened because he 
couldn't keep it together.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.590
That stupid old geezer!

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.280
This irresponsible guy is my father?

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.790
He's so irresponsible, he was okay with 
abandoning my mom for sixteen years.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.410
There's no way in hell I can 
respect someone like him.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.510
There's no way we can get along.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.640
You stay out of this.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.100
Where is she? She should 
be right around here.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.710
I don't care if I turn invisible, too.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.520
Just hurry up and touch me!

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.990
Come on!

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.480
She's not here... Hurry!

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.340
Damn it! How the hell am I supposed to find

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.870
an invisible baby in clear water?!

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.370
Josuke, I...

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:37.320
might die in just a moment, 
so when that happens,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.360
please give my regards to your mother.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.020
I mean...

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.450
I am quite old now.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.480
What the hell are you doing?!

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.070
I'm adding color to the water...

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.740
It's the center...

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.590
The color of the blood is turning 
more and more invisible.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.920
The child is in the center.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.430
Mr. Joestar...

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.320
No one else would think to do this.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.980
Not for someone else's child, 
who they've never seen before...

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:35.980
They wouldn't go this far.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.560
I wanted to look cool

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.320
in front of you.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:53.330
H

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.450
Her

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.540
Herm

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:53.620
Hermi

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:53.750
Hermit

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.830
Hermit P

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.950
Hermit Pur

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:54.040
Hermit Purp

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.960
Hermit Purple

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:54.540

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:55.960
Joseph Joestar

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.230
Well, a lot happened...

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.670
But it looks like everything 
worked out for now.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.460
O-One hundred and thirty thousand yen?!

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.000
The savings I worked so hard for...

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.290
That stupid geezer!

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.980
There, there.
