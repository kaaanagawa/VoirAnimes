00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.480
July 15th (Thurs)  4:43 PM

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.650
It's open. Come in.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.150
Rohan-sensei?

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.110
Where...

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.820
Over here, Koichi.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.880
Rohan-sensei!

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.320
What's wrong? You wouldn't explain 
anything over the phone...

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.130
I'd like you to help me.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.490
I'm being attacked by an enemy Stand.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.300
What?!

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.530
A S-Stand? Where is it? Where?!

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.070
It's on my back. It's possessed my back.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.420
Your back?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.420
Um... Your back is being attacked?

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.290
Yes. It's a very dangerous Stand. 
I'm not sure what I should do.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.190
Could you show it to me?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.100
I cannot.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380
But if you don't show it to me...

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.290
If I show it to you, it'll kill 
me and transfer over to you!

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.690
Hurry up and burn them, okay?

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.650
See? It's talking! It's this thing, Koichi!

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.160
Huh?

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.160
Why are you hiding it?!

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.580
Did you call me over here 
just to mess with me?

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.790
What are you talking about?!

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.420
I already told you. If I 
show you my back, I'll die!

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.420
But you're always messing with me, Sensei.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.190
So that is what's going on.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.410
No! I'm being serious right now!

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.020
There's a corpse upstairs!

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.110
Huh? A c-corpse?!

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.080
Um... What are you doing, Sensei?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.560
Climb over me, and go ahead.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.980
Please, please, go ahead. Please!

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.560
Seriously, what's with you?

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.280
Well? Do you believe me now?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.510
It's gone!

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.510
That's impossible...

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.880
Right here, Koichi!

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.260
Look, Koichi! This is Masazo Kinoto!

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.800
He had the life sucked out 
of him, and he dried up!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.040
Wow, that's amazing. You did 
a great job making that.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.120
But this is no time to be 
joking around, Sensei!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.060
The Stand users made by the old man 
in the picture are really after us.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.290
So I rushed over here, thinking that 
something might've happened to you, too!

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.110
What?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.780
Then this thing...

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.930
Anyway, just be careful.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.130
Bye.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.000
W-Wait, Koichi!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.860
I asked you to come because
I knew those shitbags

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.460
Josuke and Okuyasu wouldn't believe me!

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.860
You have to believe me! 
We're friends, aren't we?!

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.400
Koichi!

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.300
Don't be down, okay? 
Even though this has gotta hurt...

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.160
I, Rohan Kishibe, have never 
faced such humiliation...

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.500
You bastard. You'll regret this...

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.690
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.690
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.350
July 15th (Thurs)  5:25 PM

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.680 line:20%
Lately, my nails are growing fast again.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.940
Episode 34    July 15th (Thurs), Part 4

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.200 line:20%
Too fast.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.940
That woman running her fingers through
her prized, well-cared-for hair...

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.200
Congratulations. You get to live longer. 
I'll hold off on picking you right now.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.810
Until I can completely blend into 
Kosaku Kawajiri's lifestyle.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.330
So, every time I leave,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.290
my dad, like, totally follows me in 
secret, or comes snooping around.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.710
You're going out at night too much.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.580
And whose fault is that?

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.020
I got super pissed off, so I totally stole 
something in front of him on purpose.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.160
And then I went straight to your place.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.110
Seriously? They've probably got 
the cops looking for you now.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.100
Hey... What are you touching my bag for?

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.700
What's wrong?

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.890
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.790
What are you, a pickpocket? 
A groper? What a joke.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.000
Morioh. Morioh.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.020
Oh, crap! This is Morioh.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.170
Come on, we're getting off.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.970
Ow...

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.480
What the hell?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.740
Watch where you're going 
when you get off the train!

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.050
Hey, did you see that? He had 
a bowling pin nail clipper.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.440
A bowling pin nail clipper, in this 
day and age... What a geek.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.400
July 15th (Thurs)  5:07 PM

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.360
Do you have the pictures?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.070
Hey, where are you going with the pictures?

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.400
Morioh Grand Hotel. 
That's the only place I can go now.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.620
To where Jotaro is? It doesn't 
matter where you go, okay?

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.300
Just give up and burn the pictures.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.380
Well done...

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.130
Even though you don't know who could 
be watching from which window.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.650
This is dangerous.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.410
There, you see? Every street has an intersection.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.960
See? There's no way you can cross.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.780
Someone will see your back for sure.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.410
The road's just going to get wider, 
and there will be even more people.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.590
So let's just not go! Okay?

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.120
There's no way you can cross.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.530
You think so?

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.600
Masazo Kinoto came all the way to my house.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.310
He must have crossed an intersection, as well.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.340
I just have to figure out how he crossed it.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.950
And he did it... like this!

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.960
Stick

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.170
This is ridiculously embarrassing, 
but I can make it to the station this way.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.620
Yeah, not bad, Rohan Kishibe.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.570
But you've forgotten something.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.650
When Masazo Kinoto was crossing, 
I didn't interfere with him!

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.580
Hey, jackass! Why are you walking so slow?

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.020
The hell did you say?!

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.900
See?

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.520
Er, hey! Turn around!

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.910
What?!

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.240
You're the one forgetting 
something, Cheap Trap.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.450
Masazo Kinoto didn't have this...

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.460
He didn't have Heaven's Door!

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.980
Cannot turn around 
for one minute.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.640
What?!

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.560
All right. Now I should have no problem 
walking so that no one sees my back.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.140
You'd better be prepared, you bastard.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.180
Wh-What?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.970
There's no way you're going to make it.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.240
You're the one who's going to die 
with your dick all shriveled up.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.150
Just keep running your mouth.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.950
Your only ability is to talk. 
And that's been sealed.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.490
Wh-Wh-Who the hell do you 
think you're talking to?!

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.200
July 15th (Thurs)  5:32 PM

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.150
Looks like there aren't any 
big intersections for a while.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.700
Hey, can you use your Heaven's 
Door ability on animals, too?

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.210
Yeah, if the animal has any intelligence.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.650
So that means if an animal sees your 
back, I can transfer over to them, too!

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.860
Even easier than humans, huh?

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.850
True. I have to be careful of these guys, too.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.810
I hate cats.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.910
They glare at you.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.570
Hey, move!

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.150
What?! It can't be...

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.750
So one of these guys just has 
to glance at your back, right?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.970
My ability is only to speak.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.500
But, you see, humans aren't the 
only ones that I can talk to.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.880
I'm the one who called them here.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.600
They hate you.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.620
I just told them that you 
love killing cats and dogs!

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.060
Get him!

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.030
Heaven's Door!

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.480
I-It's no use! There are too many!

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.550
I won!

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.980
3 Freeze!

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.130
These animals didn't do anything wrong.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.580
So scram, all of you. Shoo.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.550
Th-That Stand is...

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.430
Koichi!

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.690
What?!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.400
I thought that you might 
just be messing with me,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.830
but I was still a bit worried, so I went back,

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.330
and you were still acting 
weird, Rohan-sensei.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.720
Even outside your house, you were 
walking with your back to walls,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.600
and crossing the street with your 
back to someone else's, all by yourself.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.460
So you really do have an 
enemy Stand on your back.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.350
That's exactly what I admire 
so much about you...

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.810
You truly are my friend.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.580
It's on your back, right?

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.830
I just have to remove the 
enemy from your back, right?

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.910
Reverb, 3 Freeze!

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.560
Heavy...

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.370
Y-You did it!

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.020
Aren't you a bit naïve?

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.450
I'm not sticking to your back with 
strength, but with my ability.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.530
Trying to forcibly remove me from your back

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.240
means that you'll destroy your back.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.810
Thud

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.320
Huh?!

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.330
Go ahead and tell Koichi, okay? 
Hurry up and tell him!

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.320
R-Rohan-sensei?!

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.980
K-Koichi...

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.820
I'm very moved that you came 
here, and very grateful...

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.410
But I'd appreciate it if you'd withdraw Act 3.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.950
You can't see it, but my back is 
starting to rip ever so slightly...

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.870
Act 3! Undo the 3 Freeze!

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.510
S-h-i-t. Understood.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.590
R-Rohan-sensei! A-Are...

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.500
Of course I'm not okay, Koichi Hirose!

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.350
This damage is your fault, isn't it?

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.120
Do you get it now? 
There's no way to get rid of me.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.670
Peeling me off your back, Rohan,

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.200
means that you'll be peeling 
away your own back!

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.970
Hey...

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.740
You're just going to wear yourself out.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.460
Either you'll pass out from 
exhaustion and damage first,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.970
or you'll go crazy and kill yourself...

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.540
No matter how great the Stand,

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.410
they can't defeat me 
if my only ability is to talk!

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.470
Okay?

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.720
The Stand on your back... Just what kind of...

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.480
Large Vehicles
Cannot Pass
Through

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.920
What kind? Do you want to see?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.610
You want to see what kind of Stand it is?

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.210
Fine...

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.480
I'll show it to you.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.510
R-Rohan-sensei...

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.050
Looks like you've finally lost it!

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.380
I guess you finally realized it's 
no use going to Jotaro, either!

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.230
Jotaro?

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.580
I wasn't heading there in the first place.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.570
I was heading here.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.530
I was so happy to finally make it here

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.380
that I couldn't help but laugh.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.040
What are you yammering about?

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.650
You finally showed your back to someone!

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.530
I'm now going to possess Koichi Hirose!

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.910
Th-This place... That post box...

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.820
Cheap Trap, you turned around here.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.590
Even if you didn't turn around because 
you knew what this place was,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:56.090
because of your ability, you had no 
choice but to look Koichi's way.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.490
Wh-What?!

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.490
The alley where Reimi is, where you 
can't turn around, no matter what!

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.330
It's true that if any Stand tried to get
rid of you, no matter what it was,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.560
you'd return the damage to me.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.710
But there was something that 
could grasp only you...

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.870
Something that'll only take 
those who look back.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.900
Something that'll only take your soul!

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.910
Let go! Okay? Let go!

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.860
Where do you think you're taking me?! Hey!

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.540
The afterlife.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.050
I don't know if Heaven or Hell actually exist,

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.070
but just in case, I'll write it in for you.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.300
Going to Hell

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.730
It wouldn't do anything except talk, 
but that was one intense Stand.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.980
Koichi, if you hadn't come,

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.810
I wouldn't have made it here,
and it would have killed me.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.010
But since I was so focused on that thing,

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.710
I had no idea we'd end up here.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.780
Reimi!

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.960
Did you take these pictures, Rohan?

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.350
I did.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.840
Something bothers me about them...

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.920
Hayato Kawajiri

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.920

Ch

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:20.480
Che

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:20.570
Chea

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:20.660

Cheap Tra

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.920
Cheap Trap

Masa

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.880

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.920
Masazo Kinoto

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.090
July 15th (Thurs)  6:04 PM

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.800
So, like, Mika

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.700
got her boyfriend to buy her 
some expensive brand earrings.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.670
Buy some for me, too!

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.160
Next time.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.750
What do you think you're 
doing in my apartment?!

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.110
Hey, get the hell out!

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.130
Hm... A one-room apartment...

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.710
I am Yoshikage Kira. Would you be 
kind enough to tell me your name?

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.710
My nails are quite long, aren't they?

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.230
Look how long they are.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.270
Is there anyone who can actually 
stop their nails from growing?

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.700
There isn't.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.990
Just as no one can stop 
their nails from growing,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.270
you cannot stop the destiny 
you were born with.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.630
I believe I asked for your name...

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.570
M-My boyfriend... What did you do to my—

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.930
Don't answer a question with a question!

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.800
Didn't they teach you in school not to 
answer a question with a question?!

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.010
I'm asking you what your name is!

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.630
M-Minako! M-M-Minako!

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.710
Minako...

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.420
Your parents gave you a beautiful name.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.630
I like it.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.380
Minako, I have a request.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.520
It would make me happy 
if you would hold these.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:04.020
I want you to cut my nails with 
these geeky nail clippers.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.400
You've never cut someone else's nails?

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.790
There's a first time for everything.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.750
Be careful not to cut them too short.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.630
Help... Please...

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.290
Help... Forgive me...

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.280
Forgive you?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.190
Now, wait a minute.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.080
I'm not angry or anything.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.050
This is something I enjoy.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.900
I chose you because you 
suited my taste, as well.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.580
I was born with these tastes, so I'm just 
trying to act positively about it.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.190
Positively...

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.670
It sounded like you were asking 
your boyfriend for some earrings.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.950
Here, he left these for you.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.710
It's a present.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:54.120
You're very good at cutting nails. 
I like that about you, too.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.210
And you are truly adorable 
when you don't talk.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.330
What to do, Minako...

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.630
I want to take you home with me,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.120
but bringing you into the 
Kawajiri home would be risky.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:15.080
Still, this is refreshing... 
This is truly refreshing!

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.890
Th-The man and woman he 
followed from the station...

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.320
He killed them and made them disappear!

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.460
That's... Hayato.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.370
What is he doing in a place like this?

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.040
This is the opposite direction 
from the house and his school...

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:47.970
What's that?

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.140
I didn't lock the door...

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.430
Hayato... He...

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.290
It couldn't be.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.700
He's not human... What is that 
thing that's disguised as my dad?

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.880
There's evidence that they've been back here.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.060
And there are blood stains on the floor.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.790
Did he finally make his move?

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.650
July 15th (Thurs)  8:36 PM

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.480
The thing in Hayato's hand 
was definitely a handy cam.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.740
It doesn't seem to be in 
this room right now...

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.740
Hayato...

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.480
He's been acting weird 
ever since the other day.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.870
I have to find out what Hayato was doing.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.390
I have to find out for sure.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.510
C-Calm down...

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.770
I have to calm down and gather my thoughts.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.610
First, this videotape...

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.770
Should I show it to someone?

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.760
I can't show it to Mom!

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.280
Mom totally trusts him.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.450
Should I show it to the police?

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.010
Would they believe that a person got 
blown up and then disappeared?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.630
More importantly, he's not human...

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.040
Could the police even 
catch someone like him?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.580
No... Does anyone even exist in 
this world who could catch him?

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.680
What should I do?

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.470
Mom and I are going to be killed eventually.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.010
What am I supposed to do?!

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.520
Do you mind if I join you...

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.850
in the bath, Hayato?

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.140
It's been a while.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.650
I-I'm gonna head out now.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.180
Oh, come on.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.660
We're family, after all...

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.950
Wh-What does he want?

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.250
I'll be in trouble if he finds this tape.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.140
I'm sorry, Hayato, but could 
you let go of the bucket?

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.590
I want to draw some water and wash my body.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.210
I-I'll wash your back for you, Dad!

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.910
That's a great idea.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.230
But I'll wash your back first.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:01.000
You're the one who got in first. 
I'll wash yours first, then we can switch.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.560
Now, sit down.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.110
What's the matter? 
You seem to be sweating quite a bit.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.120
Did you get get too hot?

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:17.930
Y-Yeah...

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.180
Then why are you shivering?

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.250
Isn't it strange to shiver if you're overheated?

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.940
You're tickling me, Dad!

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.160
You should know that I've 
always been ticklish!

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.960
You're... right.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.930
You've always been ticklish, Hayato.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.590
I-I'll wash my front...

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.700
I see. So you'll do it yourself.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.160
By the way, I just remembered...

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.450
This evening,

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:58.000
I was around the Jozenji area that's 
in the opposite direction from home,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.520
and I saw you.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.390
Huh?!

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.890
With a video camera!

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.040
What were you doing?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.390
Now I know for sure!

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.140
This little brat was watching!

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:16.680
This is awful... I thought I'd 
peacefully fit into this household...

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.900
I've had nothing but misfortune this year.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.760
What an awful year.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.280
Killing this brat will draw attention 
to myself, and that would be very bad.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.820
But since he saw that, I have no choice!

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.870
I just turned one of the strands 
of this brat's hair into a bomb.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.790
If I just cause a slight explosion on his head,

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.090
it'll just look like he slipped 
and hit his head on the bath.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.090
That's a common accident in our society.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.300
You're going to die.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.840
Die, brat!

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.710
Are you going to kill me, too?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.420
Even though I've got video of you...

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.880
I'm even videotaping you right now!

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.690
What?

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.480
I've been suspicious of you this whole time.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.520
Your different shoe size

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.230
and the fact that you were practicing 
your signature are all on tape!

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.100
I've got other tapes, too!

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.620
I even took a video of the cat-like 
plant you've got in the attic!

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.080
I'm the only one who knows 
where the tapes are!

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.580
But if something were to happen to me, 
I'm sure someone would find that place.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.210
What?

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.080
Don't you dare lay a finger on me! Got it?

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:25.210
You little shit! You dare threaten me?

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.680
I won't let you touch my mom, either!

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.310
