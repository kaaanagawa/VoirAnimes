Episode 3  The Nijimura Brothers, Part 1

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.190
Yeah. The issue with Angelo's been resolved.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.770
But I won't be coming back for a while.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.870
That other photo we've been investigating...

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.460
Send it over, too.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.450
Yeah, the one that the Speedwagon 
Foundation found in Egypt ten years ago.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.820
I think I might finally know what it means.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.520
Please.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.460
Yeah, thanks to him.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.420
Josuke! I killed your grandpa,
but you have no right to kill me!

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.590
If you kill me, you'll end up 
a cursed soul, just like me!

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.100
Don't go telling people what 
they can and can't do.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.110
M-M-My right hand! My hand!

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.040
No one's going to execute you.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.360
Not me, and not Jotaro, either.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.410
You're not going to be executed,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.530
and you're not going back to jail.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.770
Josuke, I'll leave the rest to you.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.370
Wh-What do you plan to do 
with me, you bastards?!

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.100
Repent for eternity, Angelo!

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.080
For all of those you killed, 
including my Gramps!

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.560
Damn it...

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.810
Don't you dare get cocky!

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.070
I'm sure he'll kill you both for me.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.780
What? "He"?

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.140
That's right. The one wearing a school uniform,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.610
who gave me this power.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.040
What?

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.240
It can't be...

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.050
Are you saying someone can
willingly give another a Stand?

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.180
Are you scared?

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.290
Huh? How is that supposed to scare us?

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.090
No... Angelo's not a Stand user by birth.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.340
It was a mystery how he 
obtained his Stand powers.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.850
But if there is actually a person 
who can give others Stands...

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.850
Terrifying, isn't it?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.600
Want me to tell you?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.520
It was last year, so 1998,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.860
on a night about a month 
before my execution.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.820
I couldn't sleep that night...

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.870
I was just staring blankly 
up at the ceiling of my cell.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.960
It was a completely silent night.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.750
But then...

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.370
I should've been the only one in that dark cell,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.010
but he was there.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.810
The guy in the school uniform.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.560
H-Hey! How long have you been there?!

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.810
Where'd you come from?!

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.070
Wha...

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.410
It was a very old bow and arrow.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.070
It looked like it was centuries old.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.090
Wh-What are you doing?

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.000
I was so scared, I could almost 
feel my balls shriveling up.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.870
But before I even had a chance to scream...

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.070
You're alive. Congratulations.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.070
That means you've got the aptitude. 
If you didn't, you'd be dead.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.380
You've just obtained a talent.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.830
No... It's more accurate to say 
it was pulled from your mind.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.250
The worse the villain, the more they have...

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.460
This talent that the man 
named DIO called a "Stand."

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.810
DIO?

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.070
Did you say DIO?

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.470
Jotaro? Is something...

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.210
What?!

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.840
You fools!

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.610
It looks like you were so busy

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.390
listening to my story that you 
forgot about my Aqua Necklace!

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.450
Angelo, you bastard!

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.270
Josuke! Hurry up and get me out of this rock!

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.790
It would appear that...

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.790
I didn't have enough rage in my heart for you.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.890
What are you doing? Stop messing 
with your stupid hair!

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.090
I'm gonna kill this brat! 
Let me out right now!

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.680
What did you say...

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.220
Don't be rash, Josuke!

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.470
...about my hair?

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.940
Y-You know... If you kill me,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.370
the guy in the school uniform won't let it slide!

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.650
He lives in this town, too!

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.530
What? Josuke, wait!

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.770
Ker-Blam

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.570
Yeah... I just didn't have enough rage earlier.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.600
I needed to do a great job of burying
that asshole into the rock, like this.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.430
Good grief.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.580
I wanted to get a bit more out of him.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.690
Huh? You actually believe 
the crap he was saying?

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.820
It wasn't crap. He said DIO's name.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.150
Who is that, anyway?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.230
He's a man that the Joestar family has 
been fighting for over a hundred years.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.290
My friends and I fought DIO and defeated him.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.970
But there was one thing 
that I didn't understand.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.970
Back in 1987, why did the man 
called DIO suddenly acquire a Stand?

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.970
Could the same person 
have made him a Stand user?

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.470
Yeah... The guy in the school 
uniform might be our new enemy.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.820
Or perhaps it's the bow and arrow he had.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.100
If that's somewhere in this city...

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:52.070
Then it's hard to believe that 
Angelo's the only danger here.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.850
Good grief...

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.020
Morioh Town Report

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.000
Morioh Town Report

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.750
It's just like Jotaro said.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.920
There's no doubt that the worst thing 
imaginable is hiding in this city.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.140
An extremely terrible danger 
is coming to this city...

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.760
No, it's already begun.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:24.190
Since the beginning of this year, 1999,
81 people have disappeared in Morioh.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:34.570
Abductions &amp; Kidnapping Cases

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.410
Of that number, 45 of them
were young boys and girls.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.080
Even if some were runaways,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:34.570
Have You Seen This Person?

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.690
that's still seven to eight times greater
than Japan's national average per city.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.570
That number is extreme.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.070
Not to mention...

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.600
Ryohei Higashikata Dead 
<font size="18">(Morioh Police Officer)</c>

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.210
Josuke's grandfather...

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.000
Koichi, you're even studying after school?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.290
Let's go home.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.170
Oh, right.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.450
Thank goodness. Josuke 
seems to be feeling better.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.430
Yo, Angelo.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.270
Uh... Huh? Hey, was this rock always here?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.300
Yeah, but it didn't look like this at first.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.470
At first?

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.680
Well, whatever. Yo, Angelo...

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.740
By the way, what happened to Jotaro?

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.130
Oh, he said he had something 
he wanted to look into.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.750
He's staying at the Grand Hotel.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.870
Does it have to do with this city?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.400
I'm sure it does.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.490
I see.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.780
The danger this city faces...

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.020
Huh? Josuke?

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.850
No one's lived in this house for 
about three or four years, right?

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.950
Yeah. It's so run-down that 
there's no way it'd sell.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.200
It should be torn down and rebuilt.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.100
No, someone's living here. 
Maybe someone moved in?

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.330
There was someone in the window just now.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.340
Huh? Nah, that can't be. 
My house is over there, right?

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.890
I'd know right away if someone moved in.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.880
Besides, realtors are always checking

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.280
to make sure homeless people don't crash there.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.810
Now that you mention it, that's true.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:28.310
How strange. I wonder if I actually saw a ghost...

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.400
H-Hey, don't say stuff like that.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.480
Ghosts are scary! And we're 
right in front of my house.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.790
Stop gawking at my house, little brat.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.490
Billion

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.330
Billion

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.580
Say something!

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.820
Koichi!

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.000
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.420
What? That's my line.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.430
You two are in front of my house...

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.930
Morioh Landmark 1
<font size="23">The Angelo Stone
</c><font size="15">How to get there: A minute's 
walk from Morioh 
Johzenji Street Bus Stop #3.
The Angelo Stone
is known as a landmark,
and a place where lovers meet.
It's admired by
the people of the city,
despite its creepy appearance.</c>

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.580
Give it a rest.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.190
If you're the newspaper guy,
I already told you we don't want it.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.950
Who is it?!

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.850
My father just died of a stroke,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.190
and we're still busy with 
everything that follows.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.830
Could you come back another time?

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.840
Y-You're...

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.930
Jo...

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.970
Joseph!

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.200
You finally came back, Joseph!

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.220
I was waiting for you this whole time!

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.290
I've been so sad and lonely since my dad died.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.570
I can't believe you showed up 
at a time like this, Joseph!

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.570
I love you, I love you, I love you, 
I love you, I love you, I love you,

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.650
I love you, I love you, I love you, 
I love you, I love you, I love you!

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.950
I hate to disappoint you, 
but I'm not Joseph Joestar.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.320
Huh?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.420
Take a good look. No wrinkles.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.430
Oh... Now that you mention it...

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.830
You're pretty young!

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.650
Good grief...

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.360
I'm Joseph's grandson. My name's Jotaro Kujo.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.840
O-Oh, really?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.420
Ask Josuke for the rest of the details.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.720
I hate annoying conversations.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.400
I'm here to see Josuke. Is he here?

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.510
I'm asking you where Josuke is.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.820
Huh? Oh! Josuke hasn't come 
home from school... yet.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.820
I see... Then I'll be back tonight.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.820
Huh?

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.700
You're leaving already?

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.580
Oh, yeah...

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.460
About your father...

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.260
Huh?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.340
It's a shame.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.790
If Joseph Joestar had come to this city,

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.010
he would have protected you as best
he could from the dangers to come.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.660
But he's old now.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.010
I can't let him come here.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.680
I'm here in his place.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.260
I just can't feel at ease.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.650
The bow and arrow that 
Angelo was talking about...

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.010
In documents the Speedwagon Foundation
obtained regarding the witch, Enyaba...

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.160
She's holding the bow and arrow.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.140
They give ordinary people the power of a Stand.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.800
Damn, that's unbelievable...

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.290
No Trespassing

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.470
Are you insane?

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.950
Let him go.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:55.380
No Trespassing

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.200
My father bought this house.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.920
Don't go digging around here.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.390
Never do it again!

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.700
I'm not talking about that.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.980
I'm telling you to let go of him, bastard.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.030
If you don't let him go now,
I'm gonna get pissed off.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.050
Come on, now. "Bastard" is a bit much, ain't it?

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:11.260
Calling someone you just met a bastard 
right in front of their house...

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.620
Do you even know how to talk to people?

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.000
Well, I know how to shut that mouth of yours.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:20.410
Stab

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.880
What?!

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.920
Bro?!

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.560
Do you wanna know why
I shot him with the arrow?

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.780
Because that guy is Josuke Higashikata.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.390
Oh, really? He is?

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.430
Since he defeated Angelo,

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.650
that means he's a Stand user
who'll be trouble for us, too.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.860
A Stand user?! You two are Stand users?!

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.870
Okuyasu! Make Josuke Higashikata disappear!

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.520
Koichi...

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.350
Hmph! I was hoping I could
make him into a Stand user

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.430
that I could use like the others,

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:04.750
but I guess that's not happening.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.510
He's gonna die.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.100
M-Move!

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.510
I can still heal his wounds 
with my Shining Diamond!

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.600
No!

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.280
Josuke Higashikata! I, Okuyasu
Nijimura, will make you disappear

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.530
with my The Hand!

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.580
Here we go!

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.630
If you don't move, I'm seriously 
going to mess up your face.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.070
You're pretty fast.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.640
Hey, Okuyasu.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.990
Using a Stand is the same as 
driving a car or riding a bike.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.860
Dipshits with no skill or guts

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.220
will get scared and maneuver like crap,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.720
no matter what kind of 
monster machine they ride.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.320
Bro...

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.470
Please don't say things 
that'll piss me off too much.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.660
This bastard's much faster than I thought.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.580
We're not messing around here, Okuyasu!

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:26.980
The Stand that you acquired, The Hand, 
gives me chills just thinking about it.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.940
You'd better be serious when you use it.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.090
Make sure you kill Josuke Higashikata,
who defeated Angelo, no matter what!

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.650
He's bound to get in our way.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.720
I know—

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.760
Ah! I was talking!

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.480
Th-That's not fair!

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.160
You're pretty stupid, aren't you?

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.880
What? Why?!

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.990
Why do you think tha—

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.900
I told you to move.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.590
Koichi!

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.490
Thank goodness. You're still alive.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.160
Then I can still save...

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.670
That's it! You're gonna pay for that!

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.630
I told you to move!

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.460
Get any closer and you'll really piss me off!

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.570
Take your best shot, if you can!

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.020
He's got way too much
confidence in his right hand.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:24.740
This isn't good.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.960
I've got a really bad feeling 
about that right hand of his...

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.470
Let go of my right hand, you little shit!

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.860
Yeah, it's his right hand!

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:40.400
Swoop

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.870
Why, you...

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.570
Don't you dare run away, Josuke!

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.090
Don't abandon your friend like that!

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.070
There's something up with 
that right hand of yours.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.130
Something's telling me it's not safe.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.680
Think about that after you're dead!

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.600
Here I go!

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.600
Koichi... Just hang on a little longer...

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.940
No  passing

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.940
What's with that gate? 
Something's wrong with it...

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.690
No... passing?

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.370
Stop walking backwards, you dumbass.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.650
You're getting farther away from your buddy.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.210
Come a bit closer!

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.260
That's it... The "tres" is missing.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.430
I bet your Stand's right hand

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.130
scraped it off, right?

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.640
It has the power to scrape 
away its surroundings.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.500
No  passing

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.970
That's right, Josuke Higashikata!

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.750
Whatever this right hand 
grabs gets scraped away.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.940
And the parts that don't get scraped away...

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.660
close together, so it looks like nothing changed.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.880
As for the part that gets scraped away...

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.410
Even I don't know where it ends up!

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.380
I can do this to guys who try to run away, too.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.390
I scrape away the space between us! And then...

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.480
See? You came right to me.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.730
You could call it teleporting!

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.440
This is the power of the Stand 
even my bro fears, The Hand!

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.950
You can't run away anymore,

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.870
Josuke!

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.290
No matter where you go, you're...

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.790
always...

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.790
within my reach!

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.010
So weak!

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.260
You really beat Angelo like this?

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.870
I guess you just don't get that it's no use.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.480
You're the one who's stupid!

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.680
Now die, Josuke!

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.450
You really are stupid, aren't you?

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.120
Why?!

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:36.740
Smack

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.080
Crash

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:38.330
Kaboom

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.220
That was close. Okuyasu Nijimura, huh?

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.930
That's a pretty great and terrifying Stand.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.360
I'll be in trouble if he wakes 
up and tries to attack.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.230
I guess I should strangle him a bit, 
just to make sure he stays knocked out.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.460
It'll put the feeling of defeat in his soul, too.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.850
One, and...

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.450
K-Koichi's...

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.790
That's enough, you bastard!

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.480
This arrow is very precious. 
It's the only one there is.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.600
It's my precious objective.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.650
I just <i>have</i> to retrieve it.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.320
According to Angelo's story,

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.470
it's this bow and arrow that 
unleashed DIO's Stand powers.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.450
There's no doubt about it.
That unleashed The World...

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.300
And after Enyaba died,
someone obtained the bow and arrow,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.340
and is creating more Stand users in Morioh.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.470
I've got to hurry and destroy
that bow and arrow...

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.180
To make sure a villain more evil than DIO

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:16.690
doesn't appear with a Stand 
more powerful than The World.
