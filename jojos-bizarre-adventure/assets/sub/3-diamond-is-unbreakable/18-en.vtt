00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.570
Just like a sickness that continues to 
progress without any visible symptoms,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.740
there was someone hiding 
in our town of Morioh,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.160
committing murders somewhere in the town.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.770
And it seems like no one's even realized 
that these murders are taking place.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.830
It's such shocking and chilling information.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.760
But there is currently no 
way of finding that murderer.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.300
We don't even know how many Stand 
users currently live in Morioh.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.150
And rather than worry about a huge problem 
that presents no visible symptoms,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.940
people are worried about what 
they should have for dinner,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.610
because that's what's right in front of us.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.360
Kame Yu

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.690
Transaction No.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.690
Bank No.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.690
Branch No.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.690
Window No.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.690
Deposit Amount

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.690
Balance

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.070
I only have 285 yen left in my savings!

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.940
But I had 20,000 yen in there!

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.420
Twelve yen?!

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.530
I was weak!

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.940
My 20,000 yen that I was saving up to 
buy those kewl brand-name shoes...

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.890
I can't even remember what I used the money on.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.450
This is all that damn old man's fault!

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.530
Because he used my card to buy 
130,000 yen worth of baby crap!

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530
I made the old man pay me 
back the 130,000 later,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.410
but then I felt like spending a little

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.650
here and there wouldn't hurt,
and totally lost track of my spending.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.410
I wonder if I tucked away a thousand yen 
somewhere and just forgot about it.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.170
A cockroach!

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.050
I guess banks could have them, too.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.270
A S-Stand?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.620
I found one yen.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.110
Y-You bastard!

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.160
I-It's a Stand!

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.140
A new Stand has appeared!

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.680
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.680

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.350
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.350

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.850
Episode 18    Shigechi's Harvest, Part 1

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.730
Where the hell is it heading?

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.020
There's another one!

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.290
Damn it! Who the hell are you?!

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.210
I'll kill you!

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.460
Okuyasu!

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.050
Oh, Josuke!

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.600
Look! It's an enemy Stand. I'm gonna kill it!

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.970
There're two of them!

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.200
Yeah. There was one at the 
bank, so I followed it here.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.480
How did it attack you?

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.440
Actually, it didn't attack me.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.180
I was buying Calpis Water,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.350
and it suddenly came out from 
under the vending machine.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.150
What? It didn't attack you?

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.780
But you just said you were going to kill it.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.030
It scared the crap out of me,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.700
and I spilled the Calpis Water 
all over my uniform.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.920
Damn it! Give me back my money!

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.630
Found it!

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.710
Hey, another one just joined in...

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.080
Found it!

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.290
Found it. Found it.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.600
What the... What the hell are these guys?

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.850
There's a ton of them gathering up!

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.250
Okuyasu, they're just like 
your brother Keicho's Stand.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.350
But...

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.240
Since they're ignoring us, they're 
a totally different kind of creepy.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.610
Yeah...

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.080
Be careful! The user's probably nearby.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.860
Boom

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.810
It's...

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.490
It's money!

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.850
Come to think of it, it picked up a 1 yen coin

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.600
underneath a machine at the bank.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.800
They're only 1 yen and 10 yen 
coins, but they're all real!

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.690
Well done, you guys.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.790
Many a little makes a mickle.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.530
I think that's about five thousand yen.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.440
As long as I have you guys, Harvest,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.580
I'll never have to worry about money.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.240
Hey, that's the user?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.730
He's talking to his Stand...

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.100
Yeah... He seems to have 
become a Stand user because

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.970
of the bow and arrow, but it doesn't 
look like he's trying to attack us.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.730
Grin!

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.110
You guys...

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.940
You can see my Harvest?

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.780
Hey, you can see them, right?!

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.960
Yeah, it's called a Stand.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.480
I'm Josuke Higashikata.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.530
This is Okuyasu Nijimura.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.020
Friends! I've never had any before!

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.780
My name is Shigekiyo Yangu.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.380
I'm a second-year at Budogaoka Middle School.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.180
I weigh 110 kilograms,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.440
and my Papa and Mama call me "Shigechi."

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.280
"Shige-chan" turned into "Shigechi."

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.190
My turtle I have at home is named Gonta.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.090
The other day, I was wondering 
if the 41 yen, 62 yen,

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.420
and 150 yen stamps all tasted different,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.580
so I was licking them all, 
and Mama yelled at me.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.410
This is a picture of my Mama, 
who yelled at me.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.800
A picture...

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.950
Wow, your mom's actually kinda hot.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:24.960
How strange.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.500
U-Um...

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.480
So, you call these things "Harvest"?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.120
Did they really gather up all this?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.070
Yup. From ditches and underneath 
vending machines and things...

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.180
But I'm not a thief.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.930
The officer at the police box said that

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.150
I didn't have to turn in any 
change under a hundred yen.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.690
I hate bad things!

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.070
That's not a bad thing at all!

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.090
Actually, I think you're doing 
something great for society.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.600
Though it's not much,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.370
you're putting all of the forgotten 
change back into the Japanese economy.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.210
That's a great thing.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.770
Really? I'm great?

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.510
Hey, do you think I'm a great person?

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.480
It's what you'd call a blind spot for ideas.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.930
No one would do all this to get money.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.520
I'm jealous... You're smart.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.240
D-Did you just call me smart?

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.140
N-No one's ever told me that before.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.730
I've picked up about 120,000 yen, but...

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.860
120,000?!

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.860
B-But that makes me even happier!

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.940
A t-total of 120,000?!

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.210
Aren't I a good boy?

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.740
J-Just here in Morioh?

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.910
Ayup! I don't go outside of Morioh.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.190
I might get lost and someone might kidnap me.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.120
120,000... And I only have 12 yen.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.780
Okuyasu...

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.010
Is something wrong with your left foot?

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.530
Whoa, what?!

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.800
There are three 50 yen coins on the ground!

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.760
Do they belong to you, Shigekiyo?

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.510
I didn't even notice...

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.110
Talk about stingy...

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.820
Hey, I'll give you guys half of this.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.700
Huh?!

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.830
You're my friends, right?
We have the same kind of power.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.680
R-Really?!

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.150
Lucky us!

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.610
N-No... Wait a sec.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.880
Look, you shouldn't give other 
people money or things so easily.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.400
Then I'll give it to you in a hard way.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.230
I'll give it all to you. We're friends, right?

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.900
Hey, why are you just 
hardening your expression?

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.260
H-Hey...

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.460
Let me talk to him alone for a sec, Shigechi.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.180
Hey, Josuke! Stop acting 
like a goody-two-shoes.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.630
If he says he's going to give it to us, 
we should just take it, dumbass!

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.950
My pride won't let me do that. Not Josuke.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.570
I'll take anything anyone wants to 
give me other than a virus! Got it?!

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.360
Calm down! I totally understand 
what you're saying!

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.250
Stop crying!

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.980
But...

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.730
I'm actually really broke right now, too.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.430
And so I just thought of a nice idea 
that can make everyone happy.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.350
Huh? An idea to make everyone happy?

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.150
Leave it to me.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:31.440
Ha

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:31.610
Har

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.730
Harv

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.900
Harve

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.060
Harves

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.980
Harvest

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.690
Shige

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.770
Shigekiyo

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:32.860
Shigekiyo Ya

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:32.940
Shigekiyo Yan

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.980
Shigekiyo Yangu

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.670
To All the Good Kids
Let's All Play Nice
Morioh Town

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.590
Hey, Shigekiyo. Can I call you "Shigechi"?

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.820
Sure.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.380
Shigechi, we can't take this.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.420
What you tried to do just now

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.550
is the same as trying to 
buy friendship with money.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.270
Huh? B-But that's not what I meant!

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.830
I believe that friendship is

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.820
something that grows between 
people through a common bond.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.300
I was just...

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.520
I know. I totally get how you feel.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.510
We're all Stand user buddies.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.890
And so...

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.600
Why don't we do a little business 
and strike up a friendship?

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.450
Business?

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.660
Yeah. A business using all three of our powers.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.560
Right here?

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.240
That's your elbow. No, <i>business</i>.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.200
Basically, I think you're at your 
limit for picking up lost change.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.080
So I have an idea for how 
we can use your Harvest

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.440
to make even more money.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.210
Huh?

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.940
An idea that'll make us more money 
than Harvest picking up change?

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.490
It's not a bad thing, and it 
won't cause anyone trouble.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.920
S-So what's the idea?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.550
That's where the business comes in!

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.210
Give Okuyasu and me half of 
what we make for the idea fee.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.230
You'll take the other half, Shigechi.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.560
The three of us are going to work 
together to pull off a huge project,

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.910
and we can all become happy.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:02.070
O-Okay! That's fine, but wh-what should I do?

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.250
You know what this is, right?

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.350
Kame Yu

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.370
A b-blue stamp!

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.130
Yeah! When you shop at one of Eastern 
Japan's biggest department store chains,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.820
Kame Yu, you get one sticker 
for every 100 yen you spend.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.040
I think there are a lot of people who

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.080
don't collect these and just throw them away.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.380
There are these, too.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.450
Product Voucher

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.450
yen

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.450
Meiwado Stationery Shop

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.110
A voucher from a stationery shop,
Meiwado, worth 20 yen.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.950
Oscar

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.050
A coupon from CD Shop Oscar,

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.990
where you can trade in ten for 
2,000 yen worth of merchandise.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.040
The cleaners, the toy shop Märchen Kids...

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.390
Nagasaki
Cleaners

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.390
Yotsuba Electronics

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.390
Service Card

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.400
And this is a card from 
Yotsuba Electronics.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.190
Now, this is the important part.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:43.280
At Kame Yu, for example, 
you can get cash back for these.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.350
Ah, a-are you... I got it, Josuke!

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.080
I know what you're thinking!

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.540
Let's go, you guys!

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.920
Rumble

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.380
With only one or two, 
they'd just be scraps of paper...

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.590
But if Harvest happened to pick up

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.100
the thousands and ten thousands 
that are thrown away around town...

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.900
Found it.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.620
Inside this trash can!

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.640
Inside that trash can!

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.260
Found it. Found it.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.650
Found it.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.130
Found it. Found it. Found it.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.860
Found it. Found it. Found it.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.870
Th-They just keep piling up one after another!

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.040
Wh-What an amazing Stand! 
That's awesome, Shigechi!

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.120
I got complimented again.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.290
We'll fix the ripped pieces of 
paper with Shining Diamond.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.590
Yes! Do we have tens of thousands now?

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.720
No, it's definitely over 100,000 by now.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.030
Yes!

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:51.380
Grab

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.600
We're an invincible trio!

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.060
Let's go get our money!

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.190
But, Josuke, you sure are something.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.890
After you went on about pride and junk...

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.400
Well, in this case, 
everyone's happy, so it's fine.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.080
F-Friendship is great...

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:15.810
O-Okuyasu, J-Josuke, I wonder if it'll be okay.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.480
Will it turn into money that easily?

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.040
Calm down, Shigechi. Believe in Josuke.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.880
That's Okuyasu and...

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.970
I wonder who that is.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.350
Okuyasu—

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.480
Josuke! H-How did it go?

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.190
Were you able to get the money?

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.460
Did they tell you to piss off?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.450
I wasn't able to get cash back 
at the CD shop or the toy store.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:09.690
But I can exchange the coupons for about 
40,000 yen worth of CDs or video games.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.610
I'm not asking about that!

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.160
What about Kame Yu?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.810
Were you able to get cash 
back for the Kame Yu stickers?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.560
Actually, something kind of 
unexpected happened.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.000
S-Something unexpected?

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.070
It unexpectedly turned into 61,500 yen!

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.330
Here you go! It's real, Shigechi!

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.690
I-It's real!

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.870
It's right in front of my eyes! It's like a dream!

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.170
That's awesome, Shigechi!

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:48.510
Your Stand, Harvest, is really amazing!

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.850
Y-You really think it's amazing?

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.980
Hey... P-People don't really 
compliment me much...

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.020
Do you really think I'm amazing?

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.780
Hey, have a little more confidence, Shigechi.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.880
This is something that only you can do.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.780
Okuyasu... Josuke...

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.190
Straighten.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.500
Hey, girl. I got a fat stack! 
Wanna go have some fun?

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.990
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:28.210
Oh, yeah. Here, Josuke, Okuyasu. 
Here's your share, 10,000 yen.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.800
Shigechi, what is this?

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.640
We've got friendship, right? 
We're friends, right?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.310
Yeah, we are.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.380
So that's a token of our friendship.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.330
Hey, wait...

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.970
This isn't what we promised, is it?

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.870
You said okay to us getting half,
and you getting the other.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:04.410
Half of 61,500 yen is 30,750 exactly.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.090
R-Really? Did I say that?

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.670
What?

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.700
N-N-Not to mention...

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.460
It w-was my H-Harvest's job 
to collect all of those.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.960
I did it all!

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.850
Y-You two were just talking and did nothing.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.260
<i>And</i>, if Josuke hadn't come up with the idea,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.570
you never would have thought 
of gathering up all those!

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.030
I would have eventually thought of it!

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.990
I'm an awesome guy!

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.410
Er... No, no... You never would have 
thought of it with that pea brain of yours!

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.290
Hey, stop, Okuyasu.
Come here, fall back a sec.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.370
This is just great.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.580
Apparently he was fine with a few thousand,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.270
but once it went over ten thousand, 
he's much more hesitant to pay up.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.750
I don't think he means anything bad by it,
but since he's got the mind of a kid,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.190
no matter what we say,
he's gonna feel like we tricked him.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.270
We should be the adults here and let it be.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.070
We got 10,000 yen out of it, 
so let's call that good.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.430
I guess if you're okay with it, I won't argue...

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.440
But this just pisses me off so much!

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.610
Are you sure he's not taking advantage of us?

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.990
No, Okuyasu, there's no point 
in fighting right now.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:27.570
We just need to teach Shigechi how 
adults actually make agreements.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.580
Oh, so you can make more money?

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.710
You smug bastard...

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.340
But that's what I love about you.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.080
All right, thanks. We'll gladly take this.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.850
Okuyasu.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.600
Are you thirsty?

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.490
Is there anything you want to drink? I'll buy.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.450
You're going to buy it for me?

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.360
Then... I want some Calpis Water.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.850
Then drink some.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.020
Ah! Hey! Why are you throwing those away?

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.660
They're just worthless junk tickets, 
like for the year-end lottery.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.290
I told Shigechi to pick them up along 
with everything else earlier.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.220
You mean the losing New Year's Lottery tickets?

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.380
How do you know it's a losing ticket?

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.380
No one would throw away a 
winning ticket, dumbass.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.380
There are lots of people who forget

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.010
to confirm the numbers and 
never get their prizes!

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.930
If this wins, I'm gonna take half of it.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.960
Promise me, damn it.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.510
Sure. Half is fine.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.480

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.510
I wonder if we're allowed

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.360
to claim prizes from the 
lottery if we're in high school.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.860

Do I have to take it to the police?

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.110
You idiot. There's no reason to take it there.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.410
Harvest just picked them up 
after people threw them away.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:35.250
And you should only worry about that 
when you're bragging after you win.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.460
Good luck with that.

It's too good to be true, but it's true!

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.810
And it's a lottery ticket 
that was thrown away,

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.140
so it would've just gone 
into the incinerator.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.070
There's still a few days before it expires.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.590
Even if they ask us annoying questions 
when we go to cash it at the bank,

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.930
we can just proudly say that we bought it!

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.720

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.450
Heck yeah, I do!

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.660
Which means it's our 5,000,000 yen!

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.220
I wonder what I should buy.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.570
First, I gotta get some kewl Italian shoes!

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.330
Then I'll buy a high-end 
suit with a sexy silhouette,

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.640
and go all-out at Tonio's shop 
and eat the most expensive food!

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.300
I also want to go overseas somewhere!

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.720
I'm gonna put it in savings!

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.230
Man, talk about a boring life!

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:19.100
M-My Harvest is the one that picked that up...

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.880
Five million... Th-There's no 
way I'm giving up half of it.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.460
