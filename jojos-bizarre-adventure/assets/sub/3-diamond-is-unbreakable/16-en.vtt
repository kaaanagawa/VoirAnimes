WEBVTT

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.480
Josuke, I'm about to go hunting.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.810
Huh?

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.270
Come with me.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.930
Huh?

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.130
W-Wait a sec, Jotaro.
Did you just say "hunting"?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.020
Does that mean...

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.610
We're gonna be hunting down 
some chicks with nice bodies?

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm a guy who's more into pure love,
so I've never done that.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.970
I wonder if I can do it...

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.110
Akira Otoishi confessed yesterday.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.670
Otoishi did?!

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.440
Before his identity was revealed, 
he was using the bow and arrow.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.930
He happened to shoot a rat with the arrow.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.180
A rat?!

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.920
The rat didn't die after it was shot.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.660
It writhed in pain and
freed itself from the arrow,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.940
then ran away.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.930
So even though it's a rat, this means that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.510
it has definitely obtained Stand abilities.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.190
I'm not sure what kind of Stand it is,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.030
but we have to hunt it down
before something happens.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.640
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.640
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.310
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.310
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.760
Episode 16    Let's Go Hunting!

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.960
Wow, kewl!

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.640
Getting a small, quick rat into your 
Stand's range will be difficult,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.500
but by using the bearings, your range 
will increase to about 20 meters.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.890
This should be obvious, but it 
won't work against a Stand.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.910
You'll only be able to use it to defeat the user.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.140
Try it.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.950
What? I have to do it, too?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.650
I don't know... My mind tends to wander 
when ball-shaped things are involved.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.370
The second one was so close!

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.820
Not bad. I'd give it 85 points.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.000
But before our pursuit, 
I'll give you a warning.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.000
When dealing with living creatures,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.940
you need to put composure ahead of speed.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.720
If the rat enters your range and you miss,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.890
it won't ever step into your range again.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.030
So don't fire until you're positive you'll hit it.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.900
I'm not trying to put pressure
on you, but remember that.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.150
I'm feeling plenty pressured now.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.550
Apparently, Akira Otoishi shot the rat

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.770
near this irrigation canal.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.160
Given the area, it was probably a brown rat.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.170
Brown rats can swim,
live anywhere, and eat anything.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.610
The big ones reach about 
20 to 30 centimeters long,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.050
and some can weigh one kilogram.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.180
They can jump about 2 meters.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.310
Found it.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.680
Aren't those a bird's tracks?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.790
Their front paws have four digits, 
and the back ones have five.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.440
It's dragging something,
forming this S-shape.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.650
This line was made by its tail.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.430
It's a rat that's around 20 centimeters long.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.740
I'm not sure how many, 
but they're definitely here.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.690
There's a tick on this leaf.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.280
That means rats come through here often.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.750
Without a doubt, there's a nest 
deep in that drainage channel.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.860
For now, we'll set a trap 
here and video tape it.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.240
That's one of those cameras that let you 
watch while you're taping, right?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.720
You're not using cheese for the trap?

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.030
It's a crumb of tempura.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.000
Cheese is too extravagant for rats.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.040
There sure are a lot of flies...

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.860
Jotaro!

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.410
Th-This is...

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.850
Rat corpses?

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.910
It's exactly what it looks like!

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.670
It's like the jelly from stewed fish.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.250
Why the heck are you poking at it?!

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.290
It's flesh.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.760
The flesh of these rats was melted 
once, then hardened again.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.480
And they died from having the flesh 
under their skin melted.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.230
What do you even do to leave
 behind a corpse like this?

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.650
I'm not sure...

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.830
But we can probably assume it's the 
work of the rat that we're after.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.420
It used its Stand?

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.140
It killed the others and 
made their territory its own.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.990
Which means...

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.830
It's definitely making a nest at 
the end of this drainage channel.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.340
But the question is

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.400
if something capable of doing 
this will just stay quiet.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.500
Looks like the drainage 
channel leads to that farm.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.170
We might already be too late.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.720
R-Really?

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.750
They have a chicken coop,
but there aren't any chickens.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.440
There are no signs of life
at the house, either.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.720
It doesn't look like they just went out,
and the front door isn't locked.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.120
The rat is there.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.540
And just as I feared,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.710
it's likely that the people living 
there have already been killed.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.780
Let's go check out that house.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.900
The rat will let us approach
within a certain distance,

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.260
because it's confident that no 
slow human is going to catch it.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.740
It's not expecting us to blast bearings at it.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.510
That's how we'll get close 
enough to nail it in one shot.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.930
Found something.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.420
Rat droppings.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.610
Not made up of grass or grain, either.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.740
It's meat.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.160
They're heading toward this room.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.140
Let's check it out.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.860
Right.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.250
What is that?

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.250
The sound of a refrigerator's compressor?

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.390
What the heck?

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.760
Does the refrigerator in 
this house open on its own?

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.540
Has the magnet in the door weakened?

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.040
What?! There it is!

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.300
Damn it! It's right there!

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.940
That's what opened the refrigerator just now!

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.100
Can rats actually open refrigerator doors?!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.570
Nah... Someone living here must 
not have shut the door all the way.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.770
And... Am I actually naïve 
enough to believe that?

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.580
This rat is a Stand user!

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.790
Jo—

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.420
Jotaro's not here!

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.830
He went to the next room.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.220
Great. Now our eyes have met.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.680
Th-This is...

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.730
Did that rat do this?!

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.770
They're still alive...

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.000
Are you telling me that rat used 
its Stand to turn the owners

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.500
into this, then preserved them in the fridge?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.310
And it's eating them!

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.070
Damn it... Jotaro's not coming back.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.490
That means I'm gonna have to kill this thing.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.700
When dealing with living creatures,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.220
I need to put composure ahead of speed, right?

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.950
If I don't get it in one try, 
it'll figure out my range.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.700
That's what he said, right? Damn it...

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.250
Talk about pressure!

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.070
From here, the table and chair 
are slightly in the way.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.260
I'm gonna make sure I blast this 
bearing right into your forehead.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.960
Stay right there for a bit...

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.020
Shit! It stopped eating.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.170
If I move any more, it might run away!

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.640
I have no choice! It'll be an adventure,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.780
but I'm gonna have to shoot from here!

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.320
It's moving! Now!

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.150
Crush

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.580
Yes!

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.330
It wasn't a fatal blow!

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.270
There it is!

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.340
That must be its Stand!

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.300
You're gonna try to attack me?

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.370
Don't underestimate me!

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.300
I'll get you with the next shot!

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.510
Crap! It's running under the table to get away!

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.630
I'm not going to let you!

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.980
Jotaro, what are you doing?!

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.360
The rat's here!

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.030
That shape...

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.160
Shit! It's a Stand that shoots something!

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.540
What should I do? Slap it 
away with my bare hands?

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.750
But that's gross, so maybe not...

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.510
Which is it?

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.380
Did I hit it, or did I miss?

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.210
You bastard!

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.300
Yes! I nailed it!

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.030
I didn't hit it in the forehead, but I beat it.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.500
That was close...

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.400
Jotaro, over here!

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.400
I got the rat! It's over!

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.470
Jeez. What were you doing?

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.770
You went missing at the most crucial time.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.020
I felt totally stranded.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.910
But wouldn't you know it...

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.400
I just barely made the bearing shot.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.130
I wasn't trying to do a pun with "barely" there.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.260
It had a Stand that shot 
something like needles.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.330
I bet if they hit you, they melt your flesh.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.360
The people who live here got hit,
but they're still alive.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.830
I can fix them with Shining Diamond.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.370
If we don't take care of this by sundown,

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.930
we may have a problem.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:11.710
Huh?

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.770
There's one more. I was just attacked by it.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.860
Jotaro! Y-Your hand...

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.870
I was hit in the next room.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.970
I could have dodged it...

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.370
Grabbing it to figure out the effects 
of those needles was a mistake.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.550
Just by touching the needle,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.880
some kind of "Stand poison" courses 
through you, melting even Stands.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.660
Getting hit by five or six of those

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.780
would be enough to turn 
a human into mush.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.880
Thank goodness I dodged!

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.640
I'm lucky our personalities are so different.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.360
That rat ran outside afterward.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.990
It must've figured out that you 
finished off the one in the kitchen.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.870
I hate to ask, but I'm sort of waiting 
for you to fix me up quickly.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.690
O-Oh, right!

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.860
Damn it!

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.720
Why does there have to be another one?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:08.490
Jo

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:08.660
Jota

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:08.870

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.000
Jotaro Kujo

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:09.620

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:09.700

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:09.750

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Star Platinum

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.000
Hello, this is the Speedwagon 
Foundation research team.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.010
Hello, this is Jotaro Kujo.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.300
Jotaro!

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.930
We've tried to call you several times already.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.580
I was in pursuit, so my ringer was off.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.610
Does it have to do with Otoishi?

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.770
Yes. Akira Otoishi hid the fact 
that he had shot two rats.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.970
Let me confirm.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.530
It was two, and not three or four?

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.530
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.100
Good grief, Akira Otoishi...

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.780
Way to go.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.240
It kills everything in its territory,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.020
whether they are humans or its own kind.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.290
It only cares about itself.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.270
It's not a creature that should be 
allowed to live on this Earth anymore.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.420
Jotaro, wait!

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.590
How are you planning to chase 
after a tiny little rat

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.800
that's run out into this giant field?

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.240
The author of <i>Seton Animal 
Chronicles</i>, E.T. Seton, said,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.310
"There is no animal that cannot be tracked."

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.810
Rats have a habit of not wanting 
to go down an unfamiliar path.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.430
Which means, without a doubt, it went back

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.290
toward that irrigation channel.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.410
And if they don't eat constantly,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.910
they will die from starvation 
after about ten hours.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.910
There... Those bite marks are new.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.660
Yes! This is awesome!

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.100
We'll be able to corner it!

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.960
Take a look at this.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.740
It didn't even glance at the bait in the trap.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.010
It's on the video.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.750
Its ear looks like a leaf that's
been eaten on by a bug.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.480
Let's call it "Bug-Eaten" from now on.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.150
Look at how cautious it is...

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.240
Unlike earlier,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.810
we can probably bet that 
Bug-Eaten won't let us

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.970
within 20 meters of him.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.490
These are rifle rounds.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.960
Just in case, I brought four rounds.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.710
A-Actual rounds?!

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.320
Because of air resistance, 
when round bearings fly

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.320
over 20 meters, the point 
of impact goes off-course.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.470
With the head of this round,
we'll be okay up to 70 meters.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.550
Am I going to shoot that 
with my Stand's hand, too?

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.980
I'm not confident about this at all.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.230
Of course not. I guess I'll just have to do it.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.730
Hold on...

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.610
Why'd you have to say it like that?

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.490
That kind of pissed me off.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.600
I'm the one who took care of the other one!

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.380
Sure, it wasn't a perfect shot, but...

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.360
Right. So carry two rounds.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.820
Huh?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.840
S-So much pressure...

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.570
Be careful. There are leeches in this puddle.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.650
What?!

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.050
Impossible...

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:53.400
What's wrong?

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.800
Be careful, Josuke.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.730
The footprints suddenly disappear here.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.050
What is this?!

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.560
Why'd the footprints disappear?

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.680
I know! It's under the dirt.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.680
It must've dug a hole, then covered itself.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.570
No!

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.970
This is backtracking...

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.690
I didn't think that rats did it, too.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.320
Backtracking?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.610
Backtracking is a special 
instinct that wild animals have

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.800
in which they go back the way 
they came to hide from an enemy.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.180
In Japan, it's said that brown bears, 
weasels, and rabbits do this.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.840
But there's no record of 
rats backtracking, too.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.720
Does that mean, basically, 
that the rat put one over on us?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.320
Things aren't looking good.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.540
With this terrain...

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.010
We might actually be the 
ones who are being hunted.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.640
I feel like something's staring at us.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.240
We need to hide behind a rock.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.550
Move calmly...

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.420
Bug-Eaten's Stand's attack 
isn't too fast for us to see.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.540
Don't miss where it's coming from.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.350
If we can find where it's hiding,
we'll shoot it instead.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.380
What the hell is this?!

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.190
Wha?!

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.020
The rat used the trap that we set for it?

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.230
Star Platinum, The World!

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.570
Good grief.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.040
Don't panic.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.290
I took out the needle before 
the poison spread,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.720
along with the flesh that it pierced.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.270
Put a bandage on it.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.540
And I figured out where the rat's hiding.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.420
Halfway up the hill, near those three rocks.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.640
You're amazing! Both the rat and you, Jotaro!

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.770
Am I the only loser this time around?

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.770
It's 60 meters away.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.830
It doesn't look like it's going 
to shoot more needles yet.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.710
It knows that if it shoots too much,

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.780
we'll be able to pinpoint 
its location and attack.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.970
Stubborn little bastard.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.290
Why are you complimenting the rat?

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.290
We need to do something.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.620
Well said, Josuke.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.200
We need to give it everything we've got,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.330
or Bug-Eaten's gonna get us.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.800
I'll give you all four rounds.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.890
At this distance, it'll go up like a slider,

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.240
so aim one centimeter lower than the target.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.060
Jotaro? What are you going to do?

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.590
I'm going to get closer
so it'll shoot the needles.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.420
You're going to find out where it is, Josuke...

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.490
And then you're going to attack.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.990
Wh-What?!

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.950
You're the only one who can do this.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.020
Even if I get hit with one 
or two of its needles,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.740
I can have Shining Diamond fix me.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.700
But Josuke, you can't fix yourself.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.890
Give it all you've got, Josuke!

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.900
I-I need time to mentally prepare!

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.070
Star Platinum, The World!

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.910
Did you find it?

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.720
N-No... It moved right after it fired!

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.520
I'll try to get closer while 
going up the side of the hill.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.220
Look for the moment it fires.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.960
The moment it fires...

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.260
Th-The pressure!

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:08.900
There! I see it!

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.430
What?!

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.750
That bastard calculated that I'd dodge

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.190
and then fired the needles at the rocks?

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.780
It ricocheted?

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.120
Jotaro!

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.730
Don't look at me, Josuke!

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.530
Aim at the rat!

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.130
Get it right when it's about to attack!

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.510
This isn't good.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.360
I've got four rounds, but I won't 
get any more chances.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.130
If I waste any time...

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.120
Here we go, Josuke.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.800
There! It's the same spot as before.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.730
But it's hiding behind the rocks.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.730
Damn it! If only it was looking over here...

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.820
But I've got to do this!

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.870
I'm just going to have 
to hit that small target!

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.630
I'm suddenly feeling stronger.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.160
I'm going to get you, you little bastard.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.040
Josuke missed...

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.990
So you did look.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.440
I thought you'd look if I missed, 
and face your body this way.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.950
Now I can target you for sure.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.670
In the end, I wasn't a loser at all.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:08.680
Call me Josuke Higashikata, 
the man who deflects pressure!

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.650
The Stand rats that Akira Otoishi created...

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.280
Considering the destruction of 
nature that humanity brought on,

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.680
I'm not sure how to feel...

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.060
But thankfully, Josuke's pretty reliable.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.780
Good grief. We can finally relax a little.
