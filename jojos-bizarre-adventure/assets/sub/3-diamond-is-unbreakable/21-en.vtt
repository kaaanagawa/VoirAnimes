00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.830
Good morning. This is Morioh Radio,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.300
brought to you again today 
by your neighbor, Kai Harada.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.370
Our first song of the morning is this...

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.950
All right, let's eat.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.390
Oh, yes. I have a present for you.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.640
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.640

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.400

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.890
Episode 21     Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 1

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.570
Mr. Kira... Um, Mr. Kira?

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.370
Mr. Kira, if you're not busy, 
would you like to have lunch with us?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.380
Sorry, but I'll have to pass.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.230
I need to go deliver these documents.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.100
Goodbye.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.870
Give it up!

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.130
He never wants to hang out.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.400
Whenever we invite him out somewhere,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.520
I can't tell if he's really having fun or not.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.690
Yoshikage Kira, age 33, single.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.100
He's serious about his work 
and gets it done efficiently,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.360
but the guy lacks any passion.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.220
He's not a bad guy, but he just 
doesn't stand out very much.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.720
Hey, what are you so grumpy about?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.240
The new girls at work just 
invited me to lunch, that's all.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.550
I promised that I'd have lunch with you,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.630
so there's no way I'd go with them.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.600
You heard me decline immediately, didn't you?

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.080
Have I ever left you alone? Hm?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.090
Now, stop worrying about it,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.670
and let's pick out some sandwiches together.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.800
Katsu Sandwich

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.010
Come on, which one do you want?

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.240
Isn't the bread wonderfully soft?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.230
The sandwiches at this shop

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.020
use bread that's freshly baked at 
11 AM, so they're really popular.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.880
They're usually sold out by 1 PM.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.270
You can feel how warm they are, 
even through the wrapper.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.120
The katsu in the katsu sandwiches 
are freshly fried, too, and so crispy.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.750
Oh, no.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.890
You broke though the wrapper,
and now the sauce is spilling out.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.390
You naughty girl.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.540
But now this sandwich has a hole in it,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.790
so let's buy the one below it.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.290
Thank you very much.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.310
Morioh is such a beautiful town...

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.320
Could there possibly be 
another town this wonderful?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.570
It almost feels like we're on a picnic.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.470
She's getting a bit ripe.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.710
I guess it's about time to break up with her...

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.580
Time to sever ties.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.170
"Sever ties"...

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.960
Maybe I'll go find a new girl,
one who's on vacation or something.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.230
Oh, it's just a dog.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.370
Shigechi!

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.800
Oyo?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.420
Josuke, Okuyasu!

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.370
Hey, perfect timing, Shigechi.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.910
Sorry this is out of the blue, 
but please lend us some lunch money.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.100
We forgot to bring money.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.820
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.190
You guys should have your 
share from the lottery.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.070
That money's in the bank.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.510
It's a pain to have to get money 
from the bank just for some lunch.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.780
A thousand yen will cover both of us.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.290
Yeah.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.730
Come on, please?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.980
We'll go to the bank right after school.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.140
Hey, that bag... You've got a 
sandwich from St. Gentlemen!

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.590
They actually weren't sold out?

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.360
You can't have this! This is my lunch.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.590
Oh, fine. I'll lend you a thousand yen...

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.350
That's the spirit!

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.850
Thanks!

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.400
I'm gonna keep an IOU for this in my planner,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.360
so don't skip out on me.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.110
You're the one who skips out all the time!

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.840
Let's see... "June 24th."

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.820
Well, anyway, thanks again, Shigechi.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.140
"Lent 1,000 yen"... Lent?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.560
Later!

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.620
Um, how do you write the 
kanji for "lent" again?

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.170
Lent...

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.040
Lent

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.590
Well, whatever.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.500
I'll just write it in hiragana.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.790
I don't know how to write "Josuke" 
or "Okuyasu" in kanji, anyway.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.800
Huh?

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.700
M-My sandwich...

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.380
Wh-Where is it?

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.180
Oh, it's right there.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.110
I feel like it's further away than 
it was before, but whatever.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.780
Th-That's...

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.580
Hey, Josuke, Okuyasu, wait!

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.020
You need to put your 
thumbprints on this IOU!

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.540
Your thumbprints!

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.350
What? That little brat!

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.760
He mistook my bag for his and took it?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.380
Jeez, what a pain.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.330
How do we even put our thumbprints on it?

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.600
You know, you cut your thumb with a knife...

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.120
Y-You don't need to be so dramatic.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.770
Fine, I'll just take your signatures.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.710
Hey, let's hurry up and go to St. Gentlemen. 
They're gonna sell out.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.280
This isn't good. If he opens that bag...

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.630
She's wearing the ring I bought her.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.740
And my fingerprints are on her... 
With the police's investigative skills,

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.710
it'll just be a matter of time before 
they trace the ring back to me.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.470
I, Yoshikage Kira, have never left a 
single clue in the last fifteen years.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.970
And I'm not going to let 
that kid do that for me!

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.230
Josuke, let's hurry.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.720
Yeah.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.220
I'll be waiting outside.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.230
What should I do?

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.520
I'll just have to take it from him.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.230
The best thing to do is to 
swipe it without him noticing.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.740
Shigechi!

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.260
You're super lucky, damn it.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.880
The St. Gentlemen sandwiches 
are already sold out! Damn it!

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.250
Oh, I see. So they sold out.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.730
Well, that's too bad.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.510
In that case, I guess I wouldn't mind 
selling you mine for 10,000 yen.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.700
You're such a damn cheapskate.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.090
I guess we don't have a choice. 
Let's go to Hokaben, Josuke.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.710
Hokaben, huh?

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.360
The stuff we could get for 
500 yen each with a drink

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.170
wouldn't really fill us up.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.410
If we get school lunch as usual, 
it'll be plenty, though.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.220
Koichi said he was getting school lunch, too.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.860
No way! He's with Yukako Yamagishi, isn't he?

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.790
Why do I have to eat lunch 
with a happy couple?

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.940
Not to mention, with the lunches there,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.150
the meat's only about a millimeter thick,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.170
and who knows what that stuff 
in the miso soup really is?

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:16.550
Hey, there are a lot of drinks in 
the prep room in my school's gym.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.930
The gym teacher always sneaks 
coffee and tea from there.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.890
All of the teachers are in the 
faculty room during lunch,

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.720
so I sneak in through the window
sometimes and take some.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.770
Wanna just go buy lunch and come with me?

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.760
What the heck? Are you 
stealing from the school?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.620
That's pretty cheap.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.050
We can at least buy our drinks. 
I'm not that greedy.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.280
See ya!

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.040
And I was trying to be nice...

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.040
See ya. Oh, and pay me back 
my thousand yen tomorrow!

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.740
Oh, pardon me!

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.660
I wasn't watching where I was going.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.230
Sorry about that.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.700
Crap... It's good that he 
parted ways with his friends,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.230
but he's heading back to school.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.110
He's planning to eat it at school...

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.580
What should I do?

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.390
They were calling him "Shigechi," right?

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.620
There's no doubt he'll open 
that bag in a matter of minutes...

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.340
This is extremely bad.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:52.350
Now, then... I should be able 
to eat my lunch in peace here.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.680
Whoops! I almost forgot!

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.080
Before I eat my sandwiches, 
I need to brew my coffee.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.390
Since I'm here, I'm gonna have 
some coffee before I leave.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.210
You're a lucky boy, Shigechi.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.690
If you had seen what was inside, 
I would've had to get rid of you.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.180
Hey, Josuke! This is it!

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.480
It's smaller than I thought...

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.480
Wh-What?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.900
They just said they wouldn't come here!

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.740
Shigechi, you here?

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.150
Shigechi!

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.850
Oh, hey. It's Okuyasu and Josuke.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.730
We decided we'd have some coffee after all.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.830
Because we got the 500-yen Makunouchi bentos!

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.140
Hmph. After calling me greedy and a thief...

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.350
You've got some nerve!

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.070
Now, now, don't be so stubborn.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.560
People tend to change the 
way they think over time.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.540
What should I do?

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.150
Eliminating one of them would 
be easy, but not so with three.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.650
Damn it! And she's only a few 
dozen centimeters away...

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.450
Hey, Shigechi, get me a drink, too.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.710
I'd actually like Japanese tea instead of coffee.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.980
Is there any black tea? Like milk tea?

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.340
Blech. Makunouchi with milk tea? That's gross.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.550
Damn it! He's planning to 
eat his lunch up there.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.850
At this rate, he's going to 
open the bag in front of them!

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.110
Aw, it's soy sauce again.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.070
The katsu here always come with soy sauce.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.320
Huh? You're supposed to 
eat katsu with soy sauce.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.240
What?! You idiot!

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.220
You're supposed to eat 
it with tonkatsu sauce!

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.480
If you used soy sauce, the tonkatsu 
sauce would lose its namesake!

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.870
Who cares about that?

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.880
Yes!

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.220
Wh-What?

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.020
Crap!

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.370
What?

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.030

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.030
How to get there: Get off of the bus 
bound for Morioh Budogaoka High 
School and walk two minutes. It's a 
bakery on the Green Road leading 
from the station. It's popular 
because of the varieties of bread 
made there using a stone oven. 
Customers include students, 
housewives, and office ladies. 
Their most popular items are their 
sandwiches, which always sell out.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.280
Crap!

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.000
What?

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.920
Hey! What are you doing, Josuke?

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.900
Hey! You weren't trying to 
steal my sandwich, were you?

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.750
No! Don't be stupid.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.310
There was a weird sound 
that got my attention,

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.180
so I was just taking a look.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.990
Don't you dare touch it!

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.640
There's no way you would just look at it!

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.870
I know you're going to say,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:29.030
"Their teriyaki chicken sandwich is my 
favorite, Shigechi. Give me a bite!"

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.990
You sure are a greedy little guy.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.780
You got my tea yet? Where's my tea?

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.530
Don't forget, I want milk tea.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.760
I'm just about to make them.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.190
Now!

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.440
I did it.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.100
Here you go.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.480
I brought your Japanese tea and milk tea.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.550
Sweet.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.670
Thanks!

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.090
What's with you?

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.110
Wh-Where did you put m-my sandwich?

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.990
Huh? Oh...

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.770
Looks like it's gone.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.900
But we don't know what 
happened to it, right, Okuyasu?

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.820
Yeah.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.560
Stop messing around!

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.950
How could you not know? 
You're the only ones here!

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.290
No, we seriously have no idea!

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.850
Seriously, we're not messing around.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.340
No joke, we really have no idea.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.590
Y-You jerks... I-I'm really gonna get mad!

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.160
We're telling the truth!

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.650
You really need to stop.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.640
Why would we take your sandwich—

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.930
We'll find out the truth soon enough!

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.400
I just need my Harvest to check the room!

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.530
You're such a pest! Yeah, go ahead!

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.080
Do it! Look as much as you want.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.900
We wouldn't steal your stupid sandwich.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:06.330
What? I can't see what 
they're doing from in here.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.660
What is that brat trying to do?

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.840
Hey!

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.380
I know someone's in the prep room!

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.710
That's the gym teacher!

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.200
Let's get the hell out of here, Shigechi!

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.000
B-But my sandwich!

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.930
Now's not the time for that!

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.750
Hey, come back here!

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.520
Damn you, little brats.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.530
I thought it was strange 
that my tea and coffee

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.200
kept disappearing so fast. No wonder.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.560
I need to be more careful about locking the door.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.040
That was rather messy,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.890
but I got through this hard situation, 
and was able to get her back.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:11.150
I always have to wonder if 
I'm protected by luck...

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:17.050
And if I do things with careful 
consideration and in a bold manner,

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.160
I have a feeling that I can 
live a pretty happy life.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.970
That was close.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.040
I'm so glad you came back to me.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.020
Found it!

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.630
Why does someone I don't 
know have my sandwich?

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:44.640
Why is an adult that I don't know 
sneaking around my middle school?

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:50.020
Could it be that you're 
talking to me, little boy?

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.830
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.980
This is my sandwich.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.280
I just bought it at St. Gentlemen.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.250
No, that bag is mine!

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.180
There are reasons why I know!

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.000
They're reasons you 
wouldn't understand, though.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.080
Take it back, Harvest!

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.420
Wh-What? What's going on? 
The bag is being pulled...

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:27.050
Wh-Wha?! Wh-What... My sandwich...

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:32.500
Is this... a r-r-real human hand?

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.560
Oh, dear. It seems you've seen it.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:43.910
It also appears, little boy, 
that you have the same power I do.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.090
You can see my Harvest?

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.050
H-Hey, what's this hand?

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.750
Why are you walking around 
with just a hand in a bag?

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.490
Are you by yourself? Your two friends...

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.290
I believe you called them Josuke and Okuyasu?

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.180
Do they have a power similar to yours?

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.680
Hey! Don't move!

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.810
If you move even a bit, I'm gonna attack!

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.460
You're a really creepy guy! 
Don't come any closer to me!

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.820
I get a really creepy, 
unfamiliar feeling from you!

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.390
Don't move! Don't move from there!

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.120
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.830
My house is in the northeast section 
of Morioh, where all the villas are,

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.630
and I am not married.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.230
I work as an employee for the 
Kame Yu department stores,

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.890
and I get home every day 
by 8 PM at the latest.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.190
I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.620
I'm in bed by 11 PM,

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.980
and make sure I get eight hours 
of sleep, no matter what.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.990
After having a glass of warm milk

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.140
and doing about twenty minutes of 
stretches before going to bed,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.490
I usually have no problems 
sleeping until morning.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:13.330
Just like a baby, I wake up without 
any fatigue or stress in the morning.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.460
I was told there were no 
issues at my last checkup.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.920
Wh-What are you talking about?!

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:26.760
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person 
who wishes to live a very quiet life.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.830
I take care not to trouble myself

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.160
with any enemies, like winning and losing,

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.520
that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.270
That is how I deal with society,

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.500
and I know that is what brings me happiness.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:49.490
Although, if I were to fight, 
I wouldn't lose to anyone.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.740
Basically, Shigechi,

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.340
you are a troublesome thing 
that would hinder my sleep,

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.260
therefore my enemy.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.140
Th-That's...

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:15.020
Deadly Queen... is what I've named it.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.810
I'm going to eliminate you now 
before you have a chance to speak,

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.090
so I can sleep soundly again tonight.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.390
