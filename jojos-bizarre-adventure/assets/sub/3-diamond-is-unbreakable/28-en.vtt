WEBVTT

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.800
Don't touch those dice, Josuke Higashikata!

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.120
Don't move an inch.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.670
What's he going to do?

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.710
If Rohan finds out that I've been 
using that alien to cheat...

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.340
Knowing him,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.370
just apologizing is definitely 
not going to cut it.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.570
What are you checking?

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.680
I could be imagining it, but I feel 
like the dice are staring at me.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.680
Gulp.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.460
Ba-dum, ba-dum...

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.480
Hmph. Well, whatever. 
Let's continue the game.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.770
Rohan... Adds 30 New Chips

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.280
W-Well, then... I'll go easy and just bet two.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.520
You get it now, right, Alien?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.300
I need to just manage to win.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.240
I just need to be a tiny bit ahead in the end.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.430
All right, go!

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.670
H-He doesn't get it!

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.160
I guess what happens twice is 
bound to happen a third time.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.350
I suppose it's possible to
roll this more than once.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.100
An omen is worth five times the bet, yes?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.810
I'll pay up.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.730
That's what came up, so it can't be helped.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.030
Right... I guess things that happen 
twice can happen a third time.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.680
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.680
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.780
Episode 28     Highway Go Go, Part 1

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.000
Wh-Wh-Wha...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.320
What the hell are you doing?!

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.360
I'm not sure how, but I 
know that you're cheating.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.550
That's unforgivable...

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.010
It's unforgivable that I can't figure it out!

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.260
Dude, you're messed up in the head!

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.920
You're infuriating.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.650
Up until now, I've held back 
my anger toward you

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.450
for Mr. Joestar and Koichi's sakes,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.270
but you are currently trying 
to make a fool of me.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.110
Just thinking about you laughing 
deep down inside is unbearable.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.610
Let me see your hand. 
I'll have Shining Diamond fix it.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.370
Shut up!

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.910
Do you know why I did that to my pinky?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.790
So that you won't be able to forfeit 
the game, Josuke Higashikata!

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.800
I won't let a doofus like you 
underestimate the great Rohan!

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.780
We'll both just play one more time.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.880
In that time, I swear I will 
figure out how you're cheating.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.020
If I am unable to determine 
how you're cheating...

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.710
There's two million yen there.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.330
I'll use that to ask you to fix 
my pinky with Shining Diamond.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.530
However, if I figure out how you're cheating,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.160
I'm going to take your 
pinky, Josuke Higashikata.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.490
Hey, you two look like you're having fun.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.240
Hey, it's me. Been a while, Josuke!

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.190
I was stuck in the hospital for a month.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.670
I don't really remember how,

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.340
but apparently I hurt my
head on the side of the road.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.490
Tamami?

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.070
What the hell are you doing here?

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.230
I called him earlier and asked 
him to act as an official.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.560
An official?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.010
I'm Tamami Kobayashi.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.070
I will make sure the contracted promise 
is promptly and surely collected,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.910
using this lock that attaches to your heart.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.810
I will work fairly, no matter 
who wins or who is involved.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.850
I charge 20%, or 400,000 yen, 
whichever sum is larger.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.740
You will both play one more time

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.940
and see if you can figure out 
the cheat or not, correct?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.890
Yeah.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.800
What?!

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.510
However, you can also get 
out of this by not cheating,

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.050
so I will ensure that doesn't happen.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.520
Should you win without cheating,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.110
I will create a rule where Tamami's 
lock will automatically attack you.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.860
This really isn't good... But I have to do this!

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.860
I have to keep the cheat going to 
the end and break through this!

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.950
Well, then... I'll go first.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.120
How's that?!

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.170
A four!

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.380
A pair of three's and a four!

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.170
Yes! That throw ended up 
being normal "naturally."

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.760
Now he won't find out.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.020
I-It's my turn next, right?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.410
Hmph. You look rather relieved.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.220
It's as though something you 
asked someone to do went well.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.250
Don't get rattled. Rohan hasn't figured it out.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.190
I'm just going to keep playing!

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.540
H-He threw up?!

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.540
C-Crap! He's getting dizzy!

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.830
It's because Rohan shook him around so much.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.070
Josuke! Don't you dare hide 
the dice with your hand.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.800
Huh?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.610
I can't see them.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.330
You need to throw the dice so I can see them.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.180
Huh? I wonder if there's a fire somewhere.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.340
Wh-What? Sirens?!

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.520
Th-This guy's allergic to sirens.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.570
Crap! He's going to turn back!

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.820
What are you doing? You're being suspicious!

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.950
Show me what's in your hand at once!

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.620
Sorry so sudden, but that was 
a yell to get me hyped up!

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.160
I'll throw now!

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.050
Go! Do it!

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.000
It's a 666 omen!

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.350
The lock didn't move. Josuke is cheating!

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.100
Well? Did you figure it out, Rohan-sensei?

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.990
Or are you admitting defeat, Rohan-sensei?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.440
Looks like the rash isn't 
showing up on Rohan's side.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.810
Please hang in there!

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.960
Did you figure it out or not?

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.960
I'm done for...

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.960
That's... I've got it!

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.880
He knows!

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.720
I've got it! The fire's here!

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.450
Huh?!

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.470
Rohan-sensei, your house is on fire!

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.790
It's the magnifying glass!

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.980
The magnifying glass caused the fire!

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.060
We were too busy with 
the game to even notice!

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.270
Shut up! I don't care if my house is burning!

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.190
It's more important that I figure 
out how Josuke is cheating!

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.840
What are you talking about?!

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.070
You have to get out of here,  
and take your two million!

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.070
W-Well, I'll be going now...

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.620
Wait, Josuke!

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.160
But first, I'm going to fix your pinky.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.210
No one asked you to do that!

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.780
Josuke, wait! You bastard!

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.610
That was close... But I guess I have a way 
of making people resent me, huh?

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.220
I had no idea.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.450
You seem down.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.810
Was I able to be of use to you?

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.790
Sh-Shut up, jeez!

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:14.770
Rohan Kishibe's House: 7,000,000 yen in fire damage

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:14.770
Josuke:        Didn't really lose anything,
.                   but managed to make Rohan's grudge
.                   toward him even deeper

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.420
Rohan Kishibe's house: 
7,000,000 yen in fire damage.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.820
Josuke: Didn't really lose anything,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.780
but managed to make Rohan's 
grudge toward him even deeper.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.700
Kawajiri Kosaku
Shinobu
Hayato

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.590
Now, all you drivers out there, 
please be careful when driving.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.050
It seems a motorcycle crashed at the 
entrance of Futatsumori Tunnel yesterday,

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.700
and the young rider was badly injured.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.970
Police later found out...

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.880
Lately, Mom's been acting strange.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.510
She's been dressing up, she got new lipstick,

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.100
and she's in a good mood...

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.100
Did something happen?

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.030
It's been a while since Mom 
got naked in front of Dad.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.780
Am I a child that was born to
parents who loved each other?

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.130
What's he doing?

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.630
Josuke Higashikata... Jotaro Kujo...

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.640
It's their fault I'm in this mess.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.410
Oh, Josuke-san. Thank you for yesterday.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.620
Where did you sleep and eat 
after what happened yesterday?

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.780
Mikitaka! Mikitaka!

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.470
You need to stay right behind me!

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.040
We just moved here, 
so there's a lot we must do.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.900
All right, Mother. I'll be right there.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.040
H-Huh?

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.960
Don't tell me you're pulling 
jokes on people again

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.800
by telling them you're an alien.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.870
If he said that to you, 
please don't think anything of it.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.960
At his last school in Tokyo, 
people took it seriously,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.010
and there was a lot of trouble.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.060
Now, if you'll excuse us.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.560
Huh? What?!

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.690
I brainwashed her into 
thinking that I'm her son.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.570
The name "Mikitaka Hazekura" 
is the name I'm using on Earth.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.880
See ya!

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.820
Mikitaka! Come here this instant!

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.820
Mikitaka Hazekura...Alien or Stand User?!

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.100
H-Huh?

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.380
Huh?!

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.590
What was that?

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.580
What was with that brat?

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.020
Was he actually an alien?

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.370
Or was he a Stand user created 
by this arrow when it hurt him?

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:44.600
The way he pulled Josuke and Rohan 
Kishibe apart was very effective...

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.210
But!

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.370
Next time, the next Stand, Highway Go Go,

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.580
will defeat those who go after my son!

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.630
Why are you avoiding eye contact with me?

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.600
You should at least greet me.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.980
After all, I am older than 
you, Josuke Higashikata.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.100
Sorry about yesterday.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.650
Th-That fire must have been a lot of trouble.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.720
Yes. About 2,500,000 yen worth 
of furniture identical to

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.980
the furniture used in the movie 
<i>Pretty Woman</i> was burned.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.370
Not that I care in the least.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.240
What's wrong? Sit down.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:50.240
Someday, I will pay you back 
for yesterday's dice game.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.420
What?

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.000
That was...

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.770
Josuke, did you see that?

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.420
There was a door to a house in the tunnel wall.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.220
There's someone inside!

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.620
There's a window, too!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.550
There's a room in the tunnel wall.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.720
A room that someone lives in!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.000
There's a man, too!

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.560
But I can't see either of their faces!

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.270
What is he doing?!

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.230
Josuke, did you see that?!

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.040
Shut the hell up, Rohan Kishibe!

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.150
How long are you going 
to try to mess with me?!

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.610
Can no one else see it?

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.630
Is that house... a new Stand user?

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.800
The man who cut off that woman's hand...

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.170
Could he be...

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.830
Yoshikage Kira?!

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.940
Morioh Landmark 8
"Futatsumori Tunnel"

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.940
Completed in year 5 of the Kaei 
Period (1852). Fixed in year 28 of 
the Showa Period. 450 meters in 
length. Is on the road connecting 
S City and Morioh. Because it is
curved inside, the exit is not visible 
from the entrance. As there is very 
little light, there are many 
accidents, and since is it rather 
creepy, it's considered haunted 
by young people.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.700
Futatsumori
Tunnel

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.700
There was a room inside the tunnel?!

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.420
You're not fooling me!

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.990
You want to get back at me by 
telling me a stupid lie like that?

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.410
You don't believe me, Josuke Higashikata?

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.920
A liar like you who cheats with dice...

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.930
A liar like you who always does 
something different from what he says,

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.300
has the nerve to call me a liar?

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.970
It appears we truly do not get along.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.310
I guess you wouldn't understand, 
even if you went back there with me.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.480
All right, let's go.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.580
That's the exit.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.720
There was nothing there.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.800
There was nothing here but a wall.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.820
Maybe it really was an illusion.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.050
What?!

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.300
C<c.color68477e>r</c><c.color7e4c66>a</c><c.colora2574a>s</c><c.colorc25f1d>h</c>

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.810
Th-This is...

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.070
Th-The room I saw from the bus.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.430
It appeared out of nowhere!

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.290
Though the man and woman 
I saw earlier aren't here.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.590
Crap! Something's there!

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.300
So this room was a trap after all!

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.800
It's coming... Something's there!

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.850
I can't see it, but something's coming at me!

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.550
Something came toward me.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.940
I couldn't see it, but it came right toward me.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.280
It was something not human.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.150
That room was a trap.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.780
The man that resembled 
Kira was also an illusion.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.000
Now I know that room is a Stand.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.790
I can't handle it alone. 
Should I tell Mr. Joestar about it?

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.790
What? It's chasing after me!

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.590
What is that?!

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.200
These... These things that 
look like footprints...

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.550
Are they the Stand?

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.970
60km/h!

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.740
I managed to get away.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.310
Apparently if I go faster than 
60km/h, it can't keep up.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.310
Is it being remotely controlled?

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.900
What?!

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.000
Crap! It caught up to me!

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.910
I only slowed down a little bit!

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.030
Th-This thing...

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.130
I'll turn it into a book and control it!

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.660
Heaven's Door!

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.210
Crap... It's sucking out my power...

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.100
I know I just said that I never 
wanted to see Rohan again,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.250
but here I am.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.390
I'm a liar who always does something 
different from what he says.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.650
What?!

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.760
W-Wait... C-Could this be...

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.240
Rohan's motorcycle? <i>Only</i> the motorcycle?!

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.400
Smash

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.080
Th-That thing...

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.170
Give me nutrients... 
Give me your nutrients!

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.880
Heaven's Door!

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.320
The Stand's name is Highway Go Go.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.840
That room was a trap.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.650
When a curious passer-by enters that room,

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.820
it'll go any distance to chase them down,

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.790
like a hunting dog on a scent, 
then it sucks out their nutrients.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.350
Once one is touched by 
Highway Go Go, its weak spot...

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.360
Its weak spot...

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.360
d-doesn't exist?!

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.860
I-It's no use... I don't have any strength.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.590
I can't read any more.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.570
I-I'm losing more and more power...

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.370
I can't even write an order on him...

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.020
I can't...

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.680
Rohan!

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.380
Hey, are you here, Rohan?!

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.690
Josuke... I can't believe you came back...

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.350
A comrade...

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.890
Your name is Rohan?

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.850
Hey, Rohan! Answer me! Where are you?

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.110
Rohan!

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.270
Th-That's...

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.820
R-Rohan?!

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.630
Go on, Rohan... Ask him to save you.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.230
What the hell is that room?

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.580
Call out for help.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.580
Are you all right?!

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.500
I've left just a bit of your nutrients in you.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.950
If you ask him for help, 
I'll spare your life.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.220
Because I'll take his nutrients instead.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:26.360
Now... Help me lure him into this room.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:32.480
I'll spare your life. Hurry up and call him.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.400
What the hell is this room?

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.190
It almost looks as if someone lives in it!

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.230
Hurry up and say it.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.020
Look! He's suspicious, 
so he won't come any closer.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.530
It's not like you two love each other, is it?

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.340
I told you to ask him for help.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.960
Do you want to die?

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.660
I-If I lure him in here...

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.210
If I offer him up instead,

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.840
w-will you really...

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.700
spare my life?

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.800
Yeah, I promise.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.360
It'll be a give-and-take in 
exchange for his nutrients.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.700
Call him. Hurry up and call him!

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.310
I refuse.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.790
What?!

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.080
One of my absolute favorite things to do

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.660
is to tell someone who 
thinks they're tough, "no."

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.540
Run, Josuke!

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.240
If you come into this room, 
you have no chance!

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.420
You'll be killed!

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.380
You bastard!

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.970
Do you really think I'd run away

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.360
because someone told me to run away?

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.200
I'll kick his ass.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.700
Where is he?

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.930
Where's the bastard hiding?

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.440
H—

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.860
How can you do this, Josuke Higashikata?

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.200
I even told you of the danger...

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.960
You always do the opposite 
of what I think you'll do.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.870
And that's why I hate you.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.870
That's why you piss me off! 
You're going to be attacked!

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.460
Now he's got your scent!

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.160
Smash Crush Smash

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.460
Yes! I got him!

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.220
Heaven's Door!

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.590
Your body will fly 
backwards at 70km/h!

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.850
Josuke, Highway Go Go will 
follow you anywhere at 60km/h!

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.330
Look for the user!

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.730
The only way for you to survive 
is to defeat the user!

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.110
Shut up already, you idiot!

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.610
Rohan!

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.080
Rohan Kishibe...

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.830
To think that you'd actually save me...

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:04.630
It's... It's unbelievable, but I'm moved!

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.640
All right, Rohan.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.390
I just have to find that thing's user, right?

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.400
I just need to find the user and kick his ass!

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.810
Wait for me, Rohan!

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.430
