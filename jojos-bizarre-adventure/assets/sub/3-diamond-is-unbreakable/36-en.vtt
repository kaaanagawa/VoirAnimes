00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.540
Hello, Kawajiri residence.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.090
July 16th (Fri)  7:57 AM

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.610
Huh? No, it's not.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.110
I see. Well done, Hayato.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.690
You protected me from that nuisance, Rohan.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.850
I'm telling you that you 
have the wrong number.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.940
Goodbye.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.870
They had the wrong number.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.870
Now, then...

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.740
I guess I'll head to work so I can make

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.150
my precious family happy.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.910
But first, do you mind if 
I give you a goodbye kiss?

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.590
Huh?

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.280
What are you doing?! My precious teapot...

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.530
Why would you do that?!

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.570
I never know what you're thinking!

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.440
You never even answer me! Why?!

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.040
Honestly...

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.790
Mom, he's not human.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.450
If I say anything about him to anyone,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.550
they'll be blown away, 
and the morning will reset.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.530
If we just keep letting him do what he wants,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.480
it might not happen now, but he'll 
eventually kill me and my mom.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.690
R-Rohan Kishibe...

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.550
There was someone other than 
Kira who had abilities.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.970
I have to do something about Rohan Kishibe.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.880
The only one who can save me 
and my mom and defeat Kira

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.260
is someone with abilities like Rohan Kishibe!

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.430
Th-There he is. It's Rohan.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.560
If I meet Rohan, he'll be 
blown away and die...

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.640
And then I'll repeat the same morning again.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.690
I have to tell Rohan about 
him without meeting him.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.870
I'm going to change fate!

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.270
Flip

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.460
Wh-What is this?!

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.220
[Warning]

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.790
[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.790
It's Rohan's ability that he 
used one me the last morning!

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.540
Damn it.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.280
I was hiding from Rohan this time!

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.470
Rohan didn't even see me!

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.010
Once fate has happened, 
it can't be changed...

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.020
Hayato.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.930
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.930
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.580
July 16th (Fri)  8:27 AM

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.240
Ugh, the forecast didn't 
say it was going to rain!

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.380
Episode 36      Bites the Dust, Part 2

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.220
You seem to be under the impression that 
you purposely broke the teapot,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.570
but that is incorrect.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.580
Whatever broke last morning 
will break again, no matter what.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.250
It'll happen because it's meant to be.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.720
That is what fate is.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.750
If you were turned into a book last morning,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.920
you'll turn into a book, no matter what.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.930
This is why Deadly Queen 
Bites the Dust is invincible.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.990
It erases my identity and returns 
everything else to what it was.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.130
That means I get to observe Rohan
exploding before I head to work.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.350
It rained.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.350
At 8:27 AM, 
lightning struck 
above the Pepsi sign.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.360
I can't let Rohan die!

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.570
I have to save Rohan!

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.090
Ah, Rohan Kishibe.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.400
Watch carefully.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.050
He has no idea why he's dying right now.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.100
I wonder if he's thinking about how he 
won't be able to draw his manga anymore.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.920
R-Rohan...

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.930
N-No!

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.330
Hayato, the very fact that you 
met Rohan will disappear,

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.940
and the morning will continue on.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.450
If I undo Bites the Dust right now,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.770
Rohan's death will just become 
fact and not repeat again...

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.290
But for now, I won't undo it.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.450
A few of his friends should 
also be showing up, after all.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.710
You're going to automatically 
defeat them for me, as well.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.180
Just like a landmine.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.230
But Bites the Dust won't cause you any harm,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.850
so you should relax and enjoy 
your fun life as a young boy.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.970
Well, I have to head to the station.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.130
Make sure you study hard.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.770
It's all my fault. It's because he met me...

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.520
Rohan Kishibe was killed because he met me!

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.120
Can't I do anything to defeat him?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.260
Um... Can I ask you something?

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.170
Do you know what time it is?

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.420
My watch doesn't seem to be working right.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.000
Hello? Are you listening?

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.020
It's 8:33...

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.400
Huh? Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.240
Where was it?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.450
Do you know who I am?

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.870
No...

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.990
Huh... I guess I was imagining it.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.830
Sorry for saying something weird.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.210
8:33... Thanks!

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.710
Jotaro! It really is past 8:30.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.840
Strange, though... I wonder 
where Rohan-sensei went.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.320
Th-They're Rohan Kishibe's friends!

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.850
They were supposed to meet up!

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.080
He left the car door wide open 
and the key in the ignition.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.240
They probably have the same abilities...

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.860
Th-They also came to ask 
me about Yoshikage Kira.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.570
That's not like Rohan-sensei...

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.400
Crap! If they find out 
that I'm Hayato Kawajiri

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.070
That's Rohan-sensei's earring.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.070
and ask me about my dad...

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.310
Sorry about that.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.140
I overslept and was late 
meeting up with my friends.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.970
Huh? I've seen you before... Where was it?

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.140
Ah, Josuke and Okuyasu.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.050
Yo.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.100
Yo, Koichi. Good morning, Jotaro.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.200
What, so Rohan's the only 
one who's not here yet?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.960
A-And two more...

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.480
When he said his friends 
were going to show up...

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.590
We won't know where Hayato Kawajiri's 
house is if he's not here.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.390
He must have been talking about them!

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.780
I just remembered I accidentally 
grabbed onto this.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.220
Here you go. Your hat.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.040
Th-Thanks...

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.090
That angle...

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.570
It's that angle. I'm sure 
I've seen him before...

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.550
Where was it? I know I've seen him...

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.300
Koichi. Look at the name on his backpack.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.180
Huh?

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.550
Hayato Kawajiri

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.550
Hayato Kawajiri?!

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.300
What?!

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.720
I-I've been found out!

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.980
Wake up

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.980
The weather report begins

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.980
Kira leaves the house

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.980
Hayato meets Rohan

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.980
Lightning strikes the Pepsi sign

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.980
Rohan Kishibe dies from explosion

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.400
July 16th (Fri)  8:34 AM

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.760
Hayato Kawajiri...

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.190
What are you doing here?

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.770
Is it a coincidence?

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.990
D-Does this have to do with 
Rohan-sensei not being here?

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.390
If these four start asking me about my dad...

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.000
They're all going to be blown away!

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.260
N-No! Don't ask me any questions...

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.260
If you guys die, too, 
who's going to defeat him?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.010
Even if I have to deceive them...

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.480
I can't let these people die, no matter what!

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.190
I want to ask you about this photo...

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.190
I want to know why you were 
recording a video in this photo.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.700
Why were you recording your da—

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.780
M-My nose is bleeding!

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.990
I need to go to the clinic! 
My nose is gushing blood!

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.670
I-I... Bye!

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.530
Hold it.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.650
Your nose is bleeding? Let me see.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.750
Here. What happened?

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.760
I have to go. Excuse me.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.480
You don't need to go to a clinic.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.350
Your nose isn't bleeding.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.270
Huh?

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.750
Huh?!

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.150
My name is Josuke Higashikata.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.230
He's a relative of mine, Jotaro Kujo.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.070
The one with the scary face 
over there is Okuyasu Nijimura.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.990
And the friendly-looking 
guy there is Koichi Hirose.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.170
You go to Budogaoka Elementary, don't you?

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.170
Then you won't be late just yet.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.000
We just have some questions...

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
about this picture.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.040
If it's nothing, then that's fine.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.960
W-Well, it is something! 
Don't ask me any questions!

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.960
You can't ask me any questions!

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.680
Is the person in this picture

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.820
your da—

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.060
No! Don't say any more!

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.810
I-It's no use...

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.840
Now they're going to ask even more questions.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.260
What do you mean by "Don't say anymore"?

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.430
One after another...

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.130
What are we not supposed to say?

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.480
I can't stop it anymore!

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.500
Are you talking about your dad?

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.850
They're going to explode!

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.540
They're all going to explode!

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.970
You suddenly shouted, "No!"

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.770
"Don't say any more"?

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.360
But we didn't ask you anything yet.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.550
Could it be...

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.080
that even asking you a 
question is a bad idea?

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.150
They're going to explode... 
Explode... Explode...

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.430
I know...

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.310
I-If I die, no one else will have to die!

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.810
Since I'm the bomb, I just need to die!

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:43.070
If I die, I'm sure these people will be 
able to defeat him and save my mom!

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:51.120
Come on, ask him about 
Kosaku Kawajiri already.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.310
Wait, Josuke. Something's wrong.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.820
What are you crouching down for?

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.750
I-It won't go through...

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.510
For some reason, the box cutter 
won't go into my throat!

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.560
That's...

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.840
That Stand...

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.180
I'd never forget it after seeing it once!

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.520
Deadly Queen!

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.610
To be more precise,

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.380
its Deadly Queen's third bomb, Bites the Dust.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.290
It's already too late to attack.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.580
If you're seeing me, that means 
I'm already inside your eyes.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.580
It doesn't matter how many of you 
there are, because all at once...

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.590
You tried to find out my identity!

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.980
What, you're already awake?

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.490
I'm glad you replied for once when I 
called you, but there's no need to yell.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.660
Breakfast is ready, so come on.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.500
I couldn't stop it... 
Those four got attacked, too.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.890
It's no use... No matter how hard I try,

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:28.010
in an hour, fate is going to 
eliminate those four, too...

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.890
I can't even kill myself.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.020
My dying would be troublesome to him,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.100
so Bites the Dust must be 
automatically protecting me.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.380
He's too strong...

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.140
Yoshikage Kira is too much of a monster.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:48.560
Either he has to die, or he has to undo
Bites the Dust for whatever reason,

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.180
or those four are going to die for sure.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.300
Either he has to die, or he 
has to undo Bites the Dust...

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:20.310
I always thought there was no 
way I could ever kill someone.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:26.530
There was no way an 11-year-old boy 
like me could kill a monster like that.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.410
But there is one way!

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.570
A way for an 11-year-old 
like me to kill him...

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.200
Just one.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:44.290
And it's sleeping quietly in the dark 
attic like a gun resting in an armory.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.800
For the first time in my life, I was praying 
to God from the bottom of my heart.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:57.210
"Lord, please let me kill this man somehow."

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.720
I was right.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.460
This cat-like plant starts moving 
when sunlight hits it,

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.010
and then attacks by shooting air bullets.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.080
And even with just this little bit of light 
in the room, it's so destructive.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.320
This behavior...

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.810
I'll utilize this behavior

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.420
and attack him with an 
air bullet at point blank range.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.860
Point blank range...

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.300
But when and how am I supposed to do that?

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.390
I can't do it in or near the house.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.130
Mom's here.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.630
That's it... My hat!

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.320
He'll come to put the hat on my head.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.460
That'll be point blank range!

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.520
My chance will be when he 
comes into range behind me.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.530
That's when I have to do it!

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.430
What? No way! We're on the air already?

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.120
Er, um... It's now 7:55...

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.980
Dad was saying that he wanted 
another cup of coffee.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.710
Hello?

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.340
No, you've got the wrong number.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.660
This isn't the Sakurai residence.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.760
Here you go, darling. Thanks for waiting.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.940
Here's your fresh cup of coffee.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.400
Right...

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.170
It's a lovely morning.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.950
I guess it wouldn't hurt to have 
another cup before I go to work.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.960
Fate doesn't change with 
Bites the Dust, right?

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.460
Something that's been destroyed once will be 
destroyed, no matter how much I fight it.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.590
You said that, didn't you?

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.350
My precious tea set!

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.850
Serves you right!

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.020
All right, Mom, I'm heading to school!

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:16.150
I'll be there for you. 
I'll protect you forever, Mom!

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.950
I can't believe it.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.760
I really never have any idea 
what he's thinking... But...

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.760
Maybe he's not so bad after all.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.020
Oh, it's fine. I'll clean that up.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.770
There's nothing we can 
do now that it's broken.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.180
More importantly, did you get burnt?

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.300
No... I'm fine.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.650
He's not here yet...

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.990
H-He's not here... He's not here yet.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.370
S-Something's wrong. He should have 
already been here by now...

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.710
Why isn't he here?

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.460
Ugh, the forecast didn't 
say it was going to rain!

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.590
I-It's starting to rain!

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.840
Did fate change because I 
left the house before him?

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.150
No, that can't be!

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.140
If he's coming to put the hat on my head,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.640
he should definitely come up from behind me.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.150
L-Lightning struck the Pepsi sign!

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.760
Calm down. Calm down! There 
are still two minutes left!

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.640
There's more than two minutes before 
Rohan Kishibe is automatically blown away.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.910
I need to believe in fate—

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:53.130
H-He's already by that tree... 
He's already right there!

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:59.610
What a lovely morning. 
But Hayato was acting strangely...

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.880
What was that?

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.480
It's just a hunch, 
but something was strange...

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.660
It appears that we've repeated this morning

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.890
three... no, four times now.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.900
I-Is he just that intuitive?

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.400
But there's no more time!

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.280
I'll just have to attack him from here.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.780
D-Did he figure out that 
I have the cat plant,

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.580
and that's why he's not coming near me?

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.650
No... He's too close if he knows that.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.370
But I have to completely 
defeat him in one shot.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:40.840
If I miss, Rohan will explode, 
and then he'll undo Bites the Dust

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.770
after the other four are eliminated.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.640
If that happens, he's going to win!

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.900
There's no time! Damn it...

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.600
Just one more step to the left!

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.890
If he just steps out from 
behind that filthy tree,

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.900
I can attack!

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.150
What?! H-He's hidden himself even more!

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.820
The look in Hayato's eyes 
when he left the house...

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.420
He looked determined about something.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.780
It's the same look that the loathsome 
Koichi Hirose and shitbag Josuke have.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.260
My hunch is telling me to 
carefully observe him...

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.170
Though there really isn't 
much that Hayato can do...

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.530
It's too late!

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.970
Once it's a few seconds past 8:29, 
the attack on Rohan Kishibe will start!

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.180
That brat is shaking.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:37.400
Those eyes look like a despaired 
mouse drowning in a cesspool.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.900
I guess I was just imagining 
his determination.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.280
Those are definitely the eyes of a loser.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.860
He moved!

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:50.660
I came to bring the hat you forgot, Hayato.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.290
If there is a God, I thank you!

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.870
I thank the fate that got this murderer 
to move from behind that tree!

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.710
I feel a fighting spirit burning within me!

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.390
Take this, Yoshikage Kira!

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.870
What?!

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.480
Y-Yes!

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.480
I hit him dead-on! I... I did it!

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.030
Hayato Kawajiri's not coming...

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.260
I guess he must've taken 
a different route to school.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.120
This is the end, you murderer!

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.590
Wh-Wh-What?!

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.420
Lately...

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.590
Impossible!

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.300
With my nails growing so quickly...

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.850
I got to thinking about how 
unlucky I've been lately.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.830
But inside my pocket...

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.860
It seems like, since last night, 
luck is coming around to my side.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.400
Remember when Mom's precious 
tea cup broke this morning?

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.600
When the coffee spilled onto 
my wrist, I was burned,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.410
so I removed my watch and 
put it in my chest pocket.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.060
What unbelievable luck!

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.670
If that coffee hadn't spilled this morning...

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.380
How... How is that possible? I...

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.880
I... I failed!

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.560
I-It's almost time!

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.460
