WEBVTT

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.430
Man, I'm hungry.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.670
After we visit Big Bro's grave, 
let's get something to eat, Josuke.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.420
I'm not hungry.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.670
Italian Cuisine
Trendy
100 Meters to the Left

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.680
There's a new Italian restaurant. 
Apparently it's just ahead.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.840
Just ahead is the cemetery.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.040
No one would come to eat at a 
restaurant in a place like this.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.060
Josuke, I think that might actually 
be what brings people in.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.650
The flavor must be like,
"Oh, man! I can't stop drooling!"

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.570
Let's go! Let's go!

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.080
Is this it?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.480
Trendy

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.490
I thought this was an empty building...

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.960
Maybe they remodeled it. It looks nice.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.340
What? "Depends on the customer"?

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.050
Today's Course
Depends on the Customer
With Coffee &amp; Dessert
From 3,500 yen

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.360
The inside looks nice, too!

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.600
Welcome.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.290
Episode 10  Let's Go Eat Some Italian Food

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.980
Two of you?

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.450
Come, have a seat.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.800
Uh... Thanks...

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.490
Please.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.240
R-Right...

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.170
Um, are you a foreigner?

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.590
Si, Signore. I'm Italian.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.900
My name is Tonio Trendy. 
Please call me Tonio.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.260
Well, this is great! We get 
to eat authentic Italian food!

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.290
I have traveled the world.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.630
I've studied various cuisines to 
better the cuisine of my motherland.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.270
Then I came to Japan hoping to get my chance.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.480
Morioh is a wonderful place.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.840
There are plenty of farms where 
you can get fresh produce,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.150
and the seafood is wonderful, as well.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.570
I love it very much.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.010
Using the ingredients 
that Morioh has to offer,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.980
I will bring you food that 
will make you feel your best.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.910
Nice! I wonder what I should get.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.080
Could we hurry up and get the menu?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.080
Menu?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.580
We don't have a menu here.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.090
What do you mean you don't have a menu?

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.590
Because what I serve depends on the customer.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.140
So show me the menu.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.430
No, no! It means that I will determine 
the dishes by looking at the customers.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.090
What the hell?

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.420
You mean you're not going to let the 
customer eat what they want? Huh?

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.690
You had diarrhea last night, didn't you?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.830
Your intestinal walls are inflamed.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.760
And you didn't sleep enough. You only 
slept about four hours, didn't you?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.710
No wonder your eyes are so puffy.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.830
Let me see your left hand, too.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.810
Yes, yes... You have athlete's 
foot on your right foot.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.880
You have two cavities and your 
left shoulder is stiff, right?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.550
H-How do you know all that?!

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.390
That's all correct!

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.970
By looking at both of your hands, 
I know everything about your health.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.850
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.200
What about you, signore?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.420
Yeah, I'm not really hungry, 
so just coffee is fine.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.740
I'll have a cappuccino.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.740
Ho capito.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.920
Healthy food that concentrates 
too much on being healthy

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.960
usually doesn't taste good.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.750
If it tastes even a little bad,
we don't have to pay.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.240
We can complain and leave.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.350
Right.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.710
J-Josuke...

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.720
This water... No, is this mineral water?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.430
What's up?

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:14.020
I-I've never had water this delicious before!

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.860
It's like... water filled with elegance...

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.990
It's like the water a princess in the Alps 
playing a harp would drink, perhaps.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.070
It's so soothing.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.350
Like the first water you drink after 
wandering in the desert for three days.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.620
Y-You're right! This is great!

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.130
So good!

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.120
Whew

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.280
You're right. This is delicious.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.350
What brand of water is this?

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.140
Th-This water is so delicious 
that I'm about to cry.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.730
Hey, you don't have to cry just 
from drinking some water.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.890
Maybe it's because it's so pure.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.240
Do you have a handkerchief? 
The tears won't stop.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.330
The tears just keep flowing! It won't stop!

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.420
O-Okuyasu! Hey, there's 
something wrong with you.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.700
Are you okay?

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.180
Gush

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.580
O-Okuyasu!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.710
Gush

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.220
Wh-What the hell's with these tears?!

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.250
They just keep flowing!

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.840
Okuyasu, y-your eyes, your 
eyeballs, the white part...

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.350
It's all shriveled up and squishy!

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.100
Momento! Please do not panic.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.190
Y-You bastard! What did 
you make Okuyasu drink?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.690
Please, calm down! His eyeballs will 
only be shriveled up momentarily.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.590
That mineral water is from 
snow on Kilimanjaro in Africa

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.060
that melted 50,000 years ago.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.130
It's water that flushes out 
the inside of the eyeball,

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.450
along with any dirt,
and helps relieve insomnia.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.840
The reason you didn't start 
crying when you drank it

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.450
is because you got plenty of sleep last night.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.050
Josuke!

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.320
I'm not sleepy at all now!

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.800
I feel refreshed! Like I slept a full ten hours!

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.000
Seriously? O-Okuyasu, are you sure 
there's nothing wrong with your eyes?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.040
Josuke, when you drink water 
this good for the first time,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.120
trust me, you're bound to cry.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.200
I cried even more when I watched 
the movie <i>Champ</i> on video.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.850
Really?

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.240
Yeah!

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.250
Here's your cappuccino.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.670
R-Right...

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.250
Now, shall we continue with the meal?

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.750
Hey, that looks really good.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.500
Ingredients</u>
<font size="12">• Mozzarella cheese (4 thin slices)
• Tomatoes (5 thin slices)
Tonio's Special Dressing</u>
</c><font size="12">• 1 Anchovy • Seaweed • Olive oil
• White wine vinegar • Lemon juice • Salt • Pepper • Etc.
• Balsamic vinegar (just a splash) • Toast • Lettuce (for garnish)
(Best eaten within 15 minutes of preparation)</c>

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.510
For the antipasto, we have a salad 
with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.880
M-M-Mozzaza?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.740
Mozzarella cheese is a soft, fresh cheese 
whose fat has been taken out.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.390
Everyone in Italy loves to eat it.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.680
The first people to use tomatoes 
in cooking were the Italians.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.160
Nothing can compare to the way 
an Italian prepares tomatoes.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.090
This is not bragging. It's merely pride.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.380
Please, help yourselves.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.990
Heck, yeah!

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.120
Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.260
It's good. Pretty good.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.490
But... I'm not sure what it is, but this 
cheese doesn't have much flavor.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.560
No! No!

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.320
You need to put it in your 
mouth with the tomato.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.350
What? <i>With</i> the tomato?

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:56.330
Well, most foreign dishes don't 
suit Japanese tastes.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.370
So good!

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.370
Huh?!

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.920
The juicy part of the tomatoes
wraps around the mild cheese!

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.760
The cheese brings out the tomato,
and the tomato brings out the cheese!

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.060
It's like harmony, or like a harmony of tastes!

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.020
It's kind of like a Simon and Garfunkel duet!

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.970
Ucchan with Nanchan!

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.930
The <i>Ashita no Joe</i> that
Tetsuya Chiba drew

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.690
with Asao Takamori's original story.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.690
Grazie! I couldn't be 
happier that you enjoyed it.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.360
H-Hey, Okuyasu. Let me try a little.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.570
No way.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.610
You should just order some yourself!

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.580
There's no way you're getting mine.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.870
I wouldn't give you any even if 
you were about to die of hunger.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:58.090
It's so good! I'm so glad I was born, Mom!

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.850
Damn it! I knew you were cheap, 
but I didn't know it was this bad!

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.460
Fine. I'll order a plate myself.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.810
Ho capito.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.720
However, the only one who will have 
his stiff shoulder cured is the

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.260
customer right there,
who has the stiff shoulder.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.200
Huh? Stiff shoulder?

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.040
C-Come to think of it, my neck feels a bit hot.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.420
It's oddly sweaty.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.340
Sir, I recommend that you take off your jacket.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.290
S-Suddenly...

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.130
I-I-I'm getting really itchy!

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.780
S-Something slimy is stuck to my fingers!

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.150
That would be dead skin.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.480
Dead skin?!

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.470
It's proof that your metabolism has 
improved and blood is circulating well.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:10:00.240
The calcium, vitamins, and minerals 
in the antipasto that you just ate

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.370
have stimulated the thyroid gland in 
your throat that controls your metabolism.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.610
All of your bad cells are 
coming out as dead skin.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.800
Keep scratching, and get 
all of the dead skin off!

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.270
Okuyasu, stop scratching! 
It's as big as a softball now!

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.770
You're starting to dig at 
the muscle in your shoulder!

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.720
N-No! You're wrong, Josuke!

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.270
It's light!

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.050
My shoulder feels so stupidly light!

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.910
I feel like there's a balloon on 
my shoulder now, it's so light!

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.180
Look! My shoulder's so much more flexible!

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.660
I've never been able to do this before!

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.420
My shoulder isn't stiff anymore!

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.690
Now, if you'll excuse me for a bit.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.400
I have to make sure the pasta boils properly.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.890
Holy crap! That Chef Tonio guy is a genius!

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.980
N-No...

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.410
Something's definitely wrong here!

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.030
There's definitely something
strange about his cooking!

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.990

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.850
Apparently the name of this dish came from

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.550
hard-working ladies of the night 
making something random

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.310
that happened to be good.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.020
Usually, you don't put cheese 
on pasta with garlic,

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.380
but this pasta is an exception.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.980
Are there red peppers in this spaghetti?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.560
Yes, there are.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.380
Rome

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.380
Naples

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:02.120
The harlot's spaghetti uses a pasta sauce 
that is one of the oldest in Italian cuisine.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.770
Spaghetti

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:58.730
Tagliatelle

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.860
Linguine

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.780
Fusilli

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.950
Penne

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.160
Farfalle

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.350
It was born in my hometown of Naples.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.570
Lasagna

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.870
Conchiglie

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.480
Tubetti

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.160
That is why I recommend this dish.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.510
Oh, well... I can't eat spicy things.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.780
I can't even eat curry rice unless it's

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.720
Vermont Curry's mild flavor 
with the apples and honey.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.300
I can't eat sushi with wasabi in it, either.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.040
I can't! It's super spicy!

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.310
This is way too spicy!

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.560
If you can't eat spicy food, Okuyasu,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.230
then don't eat it.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.800
If you can't eat it, don't worry.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.000
I'm perfectly fine with not 
charging for that pasta.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.670
I will go make the secondo 
piatto, the main dish.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.330
However, my spaghetti is made 
such that even people who

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.960
do not like spicy things can eat it.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.700
Even if I don't like spicy things?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.760
Hot!

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.400
I totally admit that you're 
a talented chef, Tonio!

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.210
That guy's definitely a genius!

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.270
But this was a miss.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.360
No, maybe you were lucky 
that you couldn't eat it.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.440
Don't you think this food and 
that water are way too weird?

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.520
It's too suspicious!

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.460
Suspicious? What is?

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.190
So hot!

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:29.370
You lost a softball's worth of dead skin, 
and you cried your eyes out!

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.010
You think so?

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.850
When I went to Shirabu 
Hot Springs in Yamagata,

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.470
I lost even more dead skin, 
and my back pain went away!

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.610
That much is totally normal.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.420
Hot!

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.170
Listen! I just remembered what 
that Toshikazu Hazamada said.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.680
Stand users, for some reason, 
seem to be unknowingly...

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.950
Stand users are drawn to each other!

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:52.890
Josuke!

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.700
Are you saying that Tonio 
is a Stand user, too?

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.810
Shh! We don't know yet!
That's why I'm saying he's suspicious!

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.800
Suspicious, eh?

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.820
Hot! I can't eat this!

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.000
If you can't eat spicy food, stop licking it!

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.920
Th-That's right. I can't eat 
spicy food, but you know...

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.460
I just want to keep licking 
this spaghetti sauce.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.210
Why are you eating it?!

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.340
I-I know! I shouldn't be able 
to eat something this spicy...

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.490
But...

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.100
I can't help myself. Once I tasted it,
I was sucked in by the spiciness.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.250
It's like when you eat your age 
in beans at the Setsubun Festival,

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.240
and you don't even really like them, 
but before you know it,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.900
you've eaten a whole bag!

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.490
Hey, I told you to stop eating that!

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:59.030
M-My stomach's opening up!

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.000
The more I eat, the more I want to eat!

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.500
It's so good!

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.260
Okuyasu, you idiot!

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.800
Your tooth! Your tooth just flew out!

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.380
That's my cavity! My rotten tooth fell out!

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.690
C-Come to think of it, I had a 
cavity on my lower jaw, too...

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.160
That's a cavity, too!

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.000
Your tooth! A molar is 
growing in at that speed?!

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.800
This settles it. I don't know 
what he's plotting, but...

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.890
Shining Diamond!

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.610
But I wanted to eat more...

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.030
I'm going to revert that spaghetti 
back to its original ingredients!

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.130
What were those little things just now?

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.210
A Stand!

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.690
Tonio Trendy was a Stand user after all!

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.060
Are you all right, Okuyasu?

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.610
My sleepiness is gone.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.600
My shoulder stiffness disappeared, and 
new teeth replaced my cavities, but...

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:49.110
M-My stomach hurts!
My stomach's hurting so bad!

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.860
Wait there!

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.360
Tonio! Just what are you plotting?!

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.380
Where is he?

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.630
So the main course is finished...

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.700
Good, good... You're eating that right up.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.900
Looks like the main dish,
lamb in apple sauce, is a success.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.120
What?!

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.340
What are you doing there?

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.540
You saw, didn't you?!

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:56.250
So you came in here to spy on me?!

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.100
You will pay for this! Prepare yourself!

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.920
Why do I have to listen to you
threatening to make <i>me</i> pay?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.040
That's my line!

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.480
What the hell are you trying 
to do with your cooking?!

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.930
Okuyasu!

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.990
Why are you eating?!

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.240
I can't help it! My stomach hurts, 
but I can't help eating it!

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.090
Every time the tanginess of the apple sauce

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:30.000
and the juice from the lamb goes 
down my throat, I feel happiness!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.500
To think a flavor like this 
existed in this world!

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.630
Don't eat that meat, Okuyasu!

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:41.010
I'm so happy! It's like happiness over and over!

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.690
It's so good!

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.990
M-My innards...

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.830
My stomach!

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.740
Okuyasu!

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.170
You'll pay for this!

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.370
You bastard!

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.630
Wash your hands with soap right now!

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.620
Medicinal

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.880
Medicinal

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.760
Huh?!

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.880
It's unforgivable!

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.110
Entering the kitchen without 
permission is unforgivable!

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.300
You! The kitchen must stay clean!

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.440
S-Soap? Are you telling me to wash my hands?

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.180
Hey, Josuke!

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.720
My guts suddenly feel way better!
I feel really full, too.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.940
I feel totally satisfied.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.940
Huh?!

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.910
My diarrhea tummy's all better!

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.420
What?!

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.550
Good for you.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:46.420
Nothing brings me more joy and 
happiness than a customer who

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.790
enjoys my cooking and becomes healthy.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.750
The puppy...

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.860
This dish was a little iffy,
so I was having him taste it first.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.090
His tummy was a little upset, too.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:05.930
Y-You... seriously only wanted 
to feed Okuyasu good food?

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.460
What else could a chef ask for?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.400
That is what I live for. That is all I hope for.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.400
You're a Stand user, aren't you?

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.550
We are, too.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.400
Oh, I cannot believe it!

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.120
When... When I went around the world

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.040
looking for what my ideal cooking would be,
that's when I realized my powers.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.380
This is the first time I've met 
anyone else with similar powers.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.100
But you! You lack common sense!

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:41.860
Huh?

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.340
You touched things without 
washing your hands, didn't you?!

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.960
The number one enemy in a kitchen is germs!

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.900
That's why I got angry!

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.600
H-Huh? I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.260
You'd better prepare yourself!

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.950
Now, let us continue with the cooking.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.990
Dessert is... flan?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.770
But I'm a street punk!

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.630
Hmph! Me eating flan is laughable.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.730
So good!

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.990
You really are a genius!

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:19.380
I'm so proud to live in Morioh, 
where a chef like you lives!

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.060
Damn you, Okuyasu!

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.740
It appears that he's pleased.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.320
You! Your hands aren't moving!

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.230
This is so pathetic...

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.640
Hey, my athlete's foot is all better!

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.770
Please come again. Grazie!

I'm with the Speedwagon Foundation.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.590
Apparently, anywhere near 
electrical wires is dangerous,

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.670
including phone lines and power lines,

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.550
so I came to deliver this message myself.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:15.290
"I should be arriving at
