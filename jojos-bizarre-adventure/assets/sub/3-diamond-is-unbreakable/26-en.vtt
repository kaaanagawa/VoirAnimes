00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.110
The old woman in Egypt, Enyaba, told me

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.450
to shoot the arrow at those it desires.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.360
They will become allies.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.180
Those shot with the arrow

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.450
will be able to bring out just one
special power hidden in their hearts.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.000
I believe she called them Stands.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.800
Jotaro Kujo and the others...

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.720
If there are others in Morioh 
who are after my Yoshikage,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.140
then I need to make more 
Stand users, more allies.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.110
Now, arrow! Who do you want?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.900
Choose! Choose them!

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.900
Pull

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.110
A telephone pole?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.360
How is the telephone pole relev—

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.950
Could it be... you want that child?

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.350
Are you saying that child will be my ally?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.190
V-Very well.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.340
I just have to shoot that child, right?

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.680
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.680
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.440
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.440
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.610
Episode 26      Janken Boy Is Coming!

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.840
Well, if it isn't the manga artist, Rohan Kishibe.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.060
Good morning, Mr. Joestar.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.210
What are you shooting here?

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.450
I was sneaking some photos of 
businessmen heading to work.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.480
If Yoshikage Kira switched places 
with someone at Salon Cinderella,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.280
he should be going to work every 
day, just like that person did.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.820
Going to work...

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.710
Knowing he's a man between 
the ages of 25 and 35

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.600
who's around 175 centimeters 
tall and an office worker

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.250
narrows it down quite a bit.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.580
I see...

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.000
But you can't be sure that he uses the station.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.430
He might drive to work in a car.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.920
That is possible.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.730
But he only changed his face.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.930
I don't think it's possible to change 
completely into someone else.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.680
I'm pretty sure that the family of 
one of these men is already

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.030
starting to think he's acting bizarre.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.430
What worries me is that, 
if the family finds Kira out,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.530
there's a possibility Kira will 
get rid of that family.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.430
I'm not trying to preach justice or anything,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.450
but I just want to find 
Kira before that happens.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.440
Hey!

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.710
Mister, would you play janken with me?

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.840
Janken...

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.830
Hey, come on. It wouldn't 
hurt to play, would it?

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.220
What's with this kid?

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.780
Janken...

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.550
There's always at least one 
weirdo at any station.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.390
Anyway, if you find any clues, 
please let me know, Mr. Joestar.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.590
And you make sure you don't meddle 
in anything dangerous alone.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.820
Hey, Mister. You're the 
manga artist guy, right?

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.730
Didn't your series take a break not long ago?

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.730
I read <i>Shonen Jump</i> weekly.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.080
So come on. It wouldn't 
hurt to play janken with me.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.250
What's with you? Beat it!

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.130
I wanna play janken. Come on, please?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.100
What's with this kid? He has a hole in his cheek!

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.000
I-It's deep.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.780
Hey, come on! Hey, hey!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.780
Does it go all the way into his mouth?

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.850
No hard feelings if you lose.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.360
If we tie, we play again. 
If you shoot too late, you lose.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.460
Got it? Ready, and...

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.610
Janken...

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.860
This brat is being oddly persistent.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.370
Is he a Stand user?

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.000
Ready, and... Janken...

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.500
Heaven's Door!

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.180
Hmph.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.960
Let's see...

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.070
His name is Ken Oyanagi, and he's eleven.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.490
There's nothing about a Stand written here...

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.660
And it says the hole in his cheek was 
from falling off a telephone pole.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.490
Loves "janken."
Really wants to play "janken."
Plays "scissors" first.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.590
It looks like this kid really wants to play janken.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.540
It's stupid, but...

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.040
Hey, guys. Are you getting in or not?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.950
Would you mind waiting about 30 seconds?

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.870
Here we go.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.250
Yeah, all right. You just 
want me to play, right?

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.520
Janken... hoi!

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.490
Well, see ya.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.010
I... I lost...

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.850
I guess that's enough work for today.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.010
Yo, Rohan-sensei.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.010
Are you done with work already?

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.810
Why don't you sit down and chat for a bit?

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.820
It's the shitbag Josuke, the idiot Okuyasu...

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.030
And the moody Yukako.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.000
All people with whom I have 
nothing to talk about.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.330
Sorry, but I'm still working. Some other time.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.590
I see...

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.470
Hey, what are you doing? That's my seat.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.530
You haven't sat down yet, have you?

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.540
This seat was empty, so I sat down.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.200
Whoops.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.650
What's with you? Why do you keep bugging me?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.440
Let's use janken to decide
who gets the seat. Okay?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.530
Again?!

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.200
No! I sat here first!

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.970
This seat belongs to me!

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.970
Sir...

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.000
Hang on...

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.360
Rohan-sensei, just let him have it.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.380
He's just a kid.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.490
Don't make him cry. 
That's pretty immature of you.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.010
Why don't you sit next to him?

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.130
Shut up! All of you, shut your mouths!

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.260
Fine! I'll play janken!

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.560
Janken's what you want, right?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.330
That's the spirit! H-Here we go!

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.690
Janken... hoi!

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.730
Oh? Y-Yes, I won!

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.350
Take that!

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.370
I've never been so happy to 
win at janken in my life.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.610
So immature...

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.530
No, winning against a brat 
is the best feeling there is.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.880
D-Damn it!

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.670
I can use this as reference material.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.020
Who knew a book on such a minor 
subject was being sold in Morioh?

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.100
7,500 yen, huh...

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.800
Do I have that much on me?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.460
Excuse me, can I get this book?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.590
Why, you little...

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.740
Wanna decide with janken?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.490
Fine!

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.870
Here we go! Janken...

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.210
Rock!

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.480
Stop messing around!

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.990
I won. See?

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.010
I finally won!

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.980
One win, two losses!

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.100
What the hell is this?!

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.390
Wh—

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.690
What?!

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.690
I-Impossible! Th-The hole...

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.470
Could he be a Stand user?!

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.990
What?!

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.230
S-So cool!

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.830
I didn't know something 
so cool would come out!

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.300
Beautiful and magnificent 
energy is flowing into me!

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.460
I'm feeling better!

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.400
H-Heaven's Door!

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.820
Make this kid into a book!

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.200
Open

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.300
Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.470
This kid...

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.810
seemed to be bringing out his 
own Stand for the first time.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.090
Could he be on his way to becoming a Stand user?

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.320
Hmph. "I want to beat the crap 
out of Rohan with janken," huh?

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.500
"Janken is not about probability.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.950
It's all mental, dependent on 
how much you want to win.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.910
Beating Rohan at janken means 
you've beaten him mentally.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.920
Rohan Kishibe is only 20 years old, 
and he's already facing the world alone.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.090
Not to mention, he's awed 
many people with his works.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:17.340
If I beat the crap out of someone so widely 
admired, it means I'd surpass them.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.010
I want to grow up to be someone 
people admire, just like Rohan."

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.850
So this kid really is on his way 
to becoming a Stand user!

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.990
He must have only just been hit by the arrow.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:36.140
"Ability... When I beat my opponent 
in janken, their energy becomes mine.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.740
However, we have to play five times.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.620
If I don't win three times, I can't take all of it."

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.320
Play five times?

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.660
Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.240
attack Rohan Kishibe.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.540
attack Rohan Kishibe.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.330
Can attack Rohan Kishibe.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.910
Wh-What?

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.170
That's so cool. So this 
ability is called a "Stand"?

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.610
You may have thought you got away,

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.140
but I've already absorbed 
one third of your Stand.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.850
I-Its right arm is missing!

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.290
I can move one third of Heaven's Door!

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.510
I won't let you read my mind anymore.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.840
You brat...

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.600
If I win two more times, 
all of your ability will be mine!

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.490
You brat! Who do you think you are?!

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.850
You had some nerve to hit 
me with your fist earlier.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.260
That's payback, you moron!

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.960
It appears that in order to get 
Heaven's Door's right arm back,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.090
I'll have to win at janken...

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.580
Very well.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.540
Good!

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.010
5 Matches

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.010
Match 1

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.010

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.020
Rohan Kishibe

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.120
Do you understand the situation you're in?

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.650
You can't lose again.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.280
Do you understand that you're cornered?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.840
Now that I know you're a Stand user, 
I won't hold back anymore!

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.760
As soon as I get back my right arm,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.450
I'm going to knock you out.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:08.740
You know that, don't you?

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.790
Are you trying to pressure me?

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.310
All right, let's do this.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.620
No, we're not doing that yet.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.110
Since I just won using paper,

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.710
I would usually go with rock or scissors next,

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.800
but I think that might be childish.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.240
But you don't seem that 
simple-minded, Rohan-sensei,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.680
so I was thinking about turning that
around and going with paper.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.770
All right, I've got it.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.570
Here we go!

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.660
Janken... hoi!

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.500
What?!

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.280
I did it! I forced my hand against 
Rohan mentally, and won with paper!

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.740
Rohan

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.740
Ken

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.740
5 Matches

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.740
Now I've got two wins and two losses.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.620
Now, then...

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.380
I took your lower half.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.240
If you're tired, should we 
head over to the bench?

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.650
No, there's no need.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.210
When you win, it's best to be

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.260
looking down on your opponent just like this.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.090
I've got two wins and two losses,

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.610
which means we're both on the edge.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.660
But you know, I really don't feel 
like I'm going to lose now.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.670
After I lost twice at first, 
I won twice in a row.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.250
You're the opposite, Rohan-sensei. 
You've lost twice in a row.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.690
You're currently on the 
downhill slope in this match!

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.020
This is amazing!

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.720
No wonder the arrow picked this kid!

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.850
If this kid is able to obtain 
Rohan Kishibe's ability

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.300
to read minds, we'll be invincible!

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.330
It'll help out my Yoshikage.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.370
You brat...

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.290
It seems you've gotten better 
at pressuring your opponent.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.700
It's the truth that you've lost twice in a row.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.750
The truth, huh... Indeed.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:21.020
In that case, let me give 
you a dose of truth, as well.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.710
In our next match, you will 
definitely not use paper.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.510
I'm not so sure about that.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.930
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold it.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.020
I used rock twice in a row and lost.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.050
Which means that rock is the 
unluckiest choice for me.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.520
Am I wrong?

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.250
It's only natural that I wouldn't be able 
to use the unlucky rock a third time.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.630
Since you said I was on a downhill slope,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.650
you won't be able to use paper.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.810
If you use paper, it's like admitting 
that I am actually not going downhill.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.210
I'll force my hand and beat you!

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.370
Let's go, Rohan Kishibe!

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.090
It's on!

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:01.830
Jan...

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:02.630
...ken...

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.670
...hoi!

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.080
After all that pressure, he still used paper.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.580
His mental strength is remarkable.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.560
There's no way I'll lose!

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.010
I definitely still have the 
upper hand in this match!

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.270
I'll use paper four times in a row!
I'm gonna force my hand!

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.950
All right! Rock! I'll get the 
unlucky rock on my side!

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.950
One more...

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.860
Th-The strength in my knees...

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.820
What? He's using a different 
form than before!

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.900
The only one Rohan hasn't 
used yet is scissors...

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.370
Crap... Going with paper again is dangerous!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.880
Crap!

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.090
I guess rock wasn't unlucky after all!

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.180
Damn that Rohan!

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.970
Th-That's...

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.810
Hey, Mister!

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.880
Hey, Rohan-sensei. Those two are 
probably Stand users, too, right?

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.200
They are, right? I can feel it.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.720
Let's test my luck.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.160
If I'm out of luck, 
those two will come over here.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.420
If I'm protected by strong luck, 
they definitely won't come over here.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.330
Hey, that's Rohan.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.450
Hey! Hey!

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.450
I really hate that guy.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.700
Let's just smile and walk away.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.180
Hmm... Well, hmm...

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.710
Menacing

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.510
That child...

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:34.510
Menacing

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.030
I do believe he's...

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.760
a fan of his.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.850
See you later.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.220
See ya.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:48.090
It looks like strong luck is
on my side, Rohan-sensei.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.750
I feel like there's no way I can lose right now,

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.780
because I'm protected by strong luck!

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.210
Right now, I feel like I could 
survive Russian roulette

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.450
with five out of six bullets in the chamber!

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.400
Crash

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.090
It's a shower of glass!

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.900
Now, let's have our final match 
to see who'll win, Rohan-sensei!

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.040
What are you doing?

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.820
Hurry up and get into your janken pose.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.040
You're the one who needs to 
hurry up and get started.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.610
I'm going to go with this.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.900
Stop messing around.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.660
No, I'm dead serious.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.230
You said you were going to surpass me,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.920
but since I've lived nine years longer 
than you, I'll let you in on something...

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.670
It's not very hard to make others lose.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.360
The most difficult thing is... 
Listen carefully, now...

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.350
The most difficult thing is

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.160
to surpass yourself!

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.060
I'm now going to surpass my own luck!

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.110
Let's go, Rohan!

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.360
It's on!

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.570
Janken hoi!

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.730
Yes! How's that, Rohan Kishibe?!

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.420
Wh-What?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.080
What?!

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.080
Huh?

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.190
Wh-What the?

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.710
Why is my hand shaped as rock?!

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.630
Now I have three wins and two losses.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.680
You have the unlucky rock.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:44.090
Strong luck came to me a moment ago, 
along with Joseph Joestar.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.000
The Invisible Baby.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.020
Huh?!

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.400
Will save Rohan when he's in danger. 
Will become invisible and make the kid's hand into "rock."

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.970
You only relied on your strong 
luck, and I changed my luck.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.320
That's what it means to surpass yourself.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.060
Boom

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.770
Now, then. I'm going to knock 
you out now, as I promised.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.420
I'll write,

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.250
"You'll never be able to win at janken again.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.760
Your Stand will be destroyed."

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.340
Sh-Shut up!

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.200
Stay away from me, Rohan!

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.140
O-Otherwise, this baby's gonna...

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.480
Do you understand what you're doing?

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.410
Hmph! Right now, our match 
is a verbal argument!

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.470
You haven't really won against me!

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.040
You won because you cheated, you coward!

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.570
Let the baby go.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.330
Fight me one more time!

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.780
Then I won't do anything to this baby.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.200
And I'm telling you to let the baby go.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.720
I'll fight you.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:05.300
I'll make you lose! Janken, hoi! Hoi! Hoi!

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.720
I-I-I can't win!

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:18.280
D-Damn it! I made you into a 
Stand user and you still lost!

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.280
See ya!

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.930
You won't die.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.650
I'm just going to destroy your Stand.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:25.700
If...

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.880
If I have to obey what you write...

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.790
If I'm going to be mentally controlled by you...

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.300
I'd rather die like this!

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.670
Take that, Rohan Kishibe!

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.970
Pfft

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.850
Nice. I like you, kid.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.270
I feel moved when I see people who are...

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.250
Dash

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.880
dramatic like you!

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.670
Wha?!

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.610
Y-You'll be run over, too!

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:03.450
You think so?

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.760
What the? Th-The wind!

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.240
Whoa, what the hell is this picture?!

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.620
I-I can't see in front of me!

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.160
I-It avoided us and drove by?

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.510
Y-You could have died, too, 
but you did that for me...

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.600
Was it strong luck?

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.660
You've become quite impressive 
in such a short time.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.730
I won't knock you out.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.410
However, don't use that 
Stand for evil anymore.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.160
I carelessly bumped into it, damn it!

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.790
I lost. I've completely lost.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.120
Hey, Rohan!

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.040
D-Did you see the baby?

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.130
She's missing, Sensei!

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.920
N-No, it might be that we just can't see her.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.290
C-Crap...

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.220
She's gone.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.140
Hey, where are you?

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.310
I'll just pretend I don't know 
and look with them...

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.590
Wh-Where did you go? Where are you?

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.820
Janken Kid. Real name: Ken Oyanagi.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.600
Hey!

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.100
Stand name: Boys Man Man.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.590
Unable to fight.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.160
For some reason, the hole 
in his cheek is still there.
