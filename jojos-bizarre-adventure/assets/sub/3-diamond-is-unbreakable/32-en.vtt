July 15th (Thurs)  10:43 AM

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.880
Who is that? I've never seen him before.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.240
Hello. My name is Kinoto. 
I'm the architect you called.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.970
I came to estimate repairs from the fire 
and any renovations we might do.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.700
Oh, right. We made plans for you to come by.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.330
Heaven's Door!

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.340
Sorry that was so sudden, 
but I've been quite cautious lately.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.220
Yay! I got work!
Gonna make some money!
Rohan Kishibe seems like he
has a lot of money,
so I'm gonna make a fortune.
Hopefully I can
overcharge a little bit.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.690
He was born in 1970 and 
is a first-class architect.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.160
His name is Masazo Kinoto.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.220
I see.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.960
Looks like he is indeed the one I called.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.140
He's not a Stand user or an enemy.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.810
Hm?

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.040
I don't like anyone looking at my back.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.180
I don't want anyone to see my back.
It's not like I have acne, scars, or a tattoo,
but I never want anyone to look at my back, ever!
I can't seem to get a girlfriend. What should I do?!

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.190
I have no idea what that's about,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.700
but I guess everyone has 
strange concerns and fears.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.800
But it seems like he's safe 
to allow into the house.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.410
Though there was that incident 
with the Janken kid, too...

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.410
Just in case, I'll write in 
that he can't attack me.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.390
Huh? Did I do something just now?

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.420
No. Please, come in. Let's discuss the job.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.950
Is something the matter?

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.410
The room that caught fire 
is the one facing the yard.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.280
If you don't come in, we can't 
discuss what to do about it.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.560
Oh, please, go ahead. I'll follow you.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.730
Huh?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.570
Now, please, go ahead.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.450
July 15th (Thurs)  9:06 AM

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.410
Episode 32    July 15th (Thurs), Part 2

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.800
Of course I can escape, and rather easily.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.920
You guys haven't even been able 
to find Yoshikage Kira, have you?

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.970
You guys haven't seen my face.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.080
Doesn't my name seem fake, too?

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.180
I mean, it's Toyohiro Kanedaichi.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.080
Wh-What the hell?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.430
Are you wearing something over your face?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.130
The fact that I thought about leaving here

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.000
means I also planned on getting away.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.980
Well, I'll be leaving now.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.780
Y-You bastard!

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.820
Please don't come in, Josuke.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.950
I'll remain with this pylon.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.370
What?! What the hell are you talking about?

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.740
This all started because I found it,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.070
and this happened because 
I turned into a wire

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.130
and climbed all the way up here.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.670
I can be useful, too.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.490
I wanted you guys to be proud 
of me, and that's why I did it.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.260
Even though Okuyasu told 
me to stay out of it.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
I got what I deserved.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.490
Please don't worry about me.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.170
If I think of it as if it were 
the inside of a spaceship,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.770
it seems quite spacious.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.770
You're pretty weird, but also brave.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.470
Though it really doesn't 
matter to me who stays here.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.680
As long as I get to leave, 
that's all that matters.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.780
You guys can decide the rest for yoursel—

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.620
No, you're the one who'll be staying.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.740
The only time you'll ever get 
to hear the word "goodbye"

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.130
is when you hear us say it!

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.710
J-Josuke!

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.290
Y-You bastard!

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.220
Since you cut this, I was able 
to fix it and climb back up here.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.980
Impossible...

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.440
Mikitaka, could you hold on 
for another ten seconds or so?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.560
After I beat the crap out of this guy

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.820
and drag him back into the 
pylon, I'll fix you right up.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.610
Don't fall, Josuke!

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.240
Of course I won't fall.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.330
I just said "impossible," but that was wrong.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.240
Let me rephrase that and say, "you fool."

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.630
All I wanted to do was leave this pylon.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.270
I wasn't planning on killing anyone...

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.470
But now I'm going to have 
to knock you off of here

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.710
just so I can get away, you fool!

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.840
Shut up!

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.060
Shining Diamond...

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.620
It looks like a very powerful 
Stand when you see it up close.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.660
But do you really think you can

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.790
lay a finger on me when I can walk around

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.630
the top of this pylon with my eyes closed?

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.630
I'm guessing its range is about two meters.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.180
Watch it!

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.890
Hey, you dumbass! Quit fooling around!

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.400
Josuke, move away from there!

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.650
It's already been cut with the knife!

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.150
He's already cut up the pylon!

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.800
That was a dirty trick!

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.870
But it's not a speed that my 
Shining Diamond can't dodge.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.050
What are you smirking for, you bastard?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.170
Are you that happy about 
me kicking your ass?!

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.460
I know every nook and cranny of this pylon.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.680
I know exactly which angles to cut

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.020
to make the energy come 
flying from any direction.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.460
Just like one who's played 
billiards way too much,

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.150
I know it all too well!

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.520
Billiards?

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.150
Jo...

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.440
Josuke!

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.490
You said it wasn't a speed that 
Shining Diamond can't dodge, right?

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.700
But do you know which direction 
it's going to come from?

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.890
I wonder how many more shots it just fired.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.290
They're reflecting off of the beams now.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.050
Here they come!

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.300
Josuke!

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.050
It's coming from behind, too!

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.930
Josuke!

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.520
This is exactly why I said, "you fool."

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.640
That alien or whatever over there

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.140
bravely said he'd stay behind with the pylon.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.170
You should have just listened to him.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.250
Then you wouldn't have to die.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.880
B-Both of his arms?

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.450
He won't be able to dodge 
the next attack like that.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.260
Here comes the energy to finish you off!

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.910
It's going right for...

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.010
By the way, Okuyasu,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.570
did you happen to see from there how many

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.010
of this guy's attacks I smacked 
away with Shining Diamond?

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.430
Huh? Yeah, I saw.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.800
I'm pretty sure I saw you smack four of them.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.430
What? Did you just say, "by the way"?

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.880
Four of them, huh? 
Well, that should be enough.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.940
Four shots should be plenty.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.940
What are you two talking about?!

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.160
You said they were reflecting.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.700
You said the Stand's energy was reflecting 
like billiard balls to attack me.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.450
What about it, Josuke?!

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.240
My Stand is Shining Diamond.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.450
I'm sure the old man in 
the photograph told you,

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.790
but its power is to fix things and 
energies that have been destroyed.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.240
Fix... Did you say "fix"?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.300
What are you saying you fixed?!

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.340
Are you saying that you actually had 
the chance to fix something just now?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.340
You idiot!

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.810
You fixed the energies that were reflecting

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.890
and returned them to where they originated.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.760
Josuke, I thought you were defeated,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.650
but I guess you had already won.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.650
I-Impossible...

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.820
It looks like the line you were supposed 
to say was "impossible," after all.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.330
I'm really sorry.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.090
I started living on this pylon 
because I disliked other people.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.250
But the old guy in the photograph

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.020
said that if I could trap 
even one Stand user here,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.000
he would look after me so I 
could live in the outside world,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.600
and I ended up going along with it...

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.960
Please! Will you let me 
go back to this pylon?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.090
I never want to leave here again.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.900
I want to stay in here forever.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.110
I'll never think about leaving 
the pylon ever again.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.390
New Morioh landmark: 
the guy who lives on a pylon.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:46.870
Morioh Landmark No. 9: 
The Guy Who Lives on a Pylon

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.960
He lives completely self-sufficiently,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.880
but if you bring him salt or snacks,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.020
he'll be happy and let you 
take pictures with him.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.640
He's a bit shy, so he wears a mask

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.880
and won't tell you his real name.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.820
More importantly, about the 
old guy in the photograph...

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.660
Did he say anything?

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.340
Like where his son, Yoshikage Kira,
might be, or anything else?

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:02.220
Is there a Stand user named 
Koichi here in Morioh?

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.970
What about Koichi?!

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.170
Listen, the old guy in the photograph 
just happened to randomly

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.270
mention it when he was talking.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.950
I didn't ask too much about it, 
and he didn't go into detail.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.740
Well, what did he say about Koichi?!

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.700
He said that he's been eliminated.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.710
What?!

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.260
It seems the old guy in the photograph

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.400
had already found his son 
Yoshikage Kira's whereabouts.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.110
He said it wasn't just about 
protecting his son anymore,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.740
and that he was going to 
start attacking, as well.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.690
And this morning, a brand new Stand user 
eliminated a Stand user named Koichi...

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.700
That's all he said.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.130
July 15th (Thurs)  10:58 AM

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.150
Hmm... This is rather...

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.590
Whoa! Th-This door will be about 800,000 yen!

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.950
And the design is from the 
Victorian and Edwardian eras!

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.910
It uses materials made in England, too...

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.250
This is going to cost quite a bit.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.160
He said he didn't want 
anyone to see his back...

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.920
Was he acting like that on his 
way to my house, as well?

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.660
Here you go.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.080
Oh, thank you.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.460
Please, before it gets cold.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.590
Oh, don't mind me.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.060
July 15th (Thurs)  11:16 AM

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.320
I need to control myself...

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.680
Not yet...

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:46.330
Sh

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:46.410
Shi

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.500
Shini

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:46.580
Shinin

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:46.700
Shining

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:46.790
Shining D

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.870
Shining Di

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.950
Shining Dia

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:47.040
Shining Diamo

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.120
Shining Diamon

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.000
Shining Diamond

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:47.700
Jo

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:47.830
Josuke

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:47.950
Josuke Higashi

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.000
Josuke Higashikata

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.500
July 15th (Thurs)  10:20 AM

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.680
I hope they're able to find Koichi safely...

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.470
July 15th (Thurs)  11:37 AM

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.900
Damn it! He's nowhere! Not at home, school,

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.530
or anywhere!

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.810
Koichi! Koichi!

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.030
Where are you, Koichi?!

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.240
I'm not giving up!

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.200
I'll find you, whatever it takes, Koichi!

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.170
That's what's going on.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.960
So I was wondering if you would 
use your sense of smell

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.670
and tracking abilities to help me find Koichi,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.290
Yuya Fungami.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.430
I'll fix your injuries. This is a trade-off.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.800
A trade-off?

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.360
You can't be serious, Josuke! 
Don't underestimate me!

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.560
You're the one who put me in this 
condition, and I'll never forgive you!

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.740
Do you think that my pride would 
actually allow me to help you?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.420
I guess it's a no, after all.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.070
I thought it was useless to begin with.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.200
Well, see you around. 
I don't have time to waste.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.570
Wait, huh?! You're gonna 
back off that easily?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.410
W-Wait a second, hey!

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.710
Come on, haggle with me a little more.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:17.000
Okay, fine! I'll help you out!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.460
Come on, now, jeez...

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.480
If I keep acting tough,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.640
I'll just be in the hospital longer. 
The only one losing out is me.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.840
I can't be nice to my girls 
with my body in this condition,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.170
so I'm getting worried and lonely lately,

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.140
thinking that they might leave me.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.120
This all happened because I got 
into an accident to begin with,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.040
so I've got nothing against you.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.950
So hurry up and fix me up, will ya?

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.650
These injuries are killing me!

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.490
I already fixed you up using Shining Diamond.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.680
Huh?

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.730
You know...

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.570
I really am a hot, beautiful guy.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.510
Saying that I resemble a Michelangelo 
sculpture would be putting it lightly.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:10.090
But you know, I think my eyes are 
a bit droopier than before...

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.020
Can your Stand actually fix me up 100%?

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.720
Stop complaining!

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.690
More importantly, just how well 
does your sense of smell work?

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.180
Let's see... I mean,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.900
I don't want you to think of me 
like some hunting dog, but...

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.400
Sniff

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:24.650
Sniff

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.900
Sniff

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.120
For example, I can tell that three girls 
are walking up the hall right now.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.070
This smell is Reiko, Akemi, and Yoshie.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.800
They're my groupies.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.020
And I can also tell they're coming 
here from the pachinko parlor.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.440
Yu! How are you feeling?

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.290
Ah, Yu! Yu is out of bed!

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.300
Yo.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.100
Are you all better, Yu?

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.440
Yu!

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.590
There, there, my cute little kittens.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.390
You're Josuke!

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.840
What the hell are you doing here?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.870
Looking for an ass whooping?

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.740
Hey, stop. I have nothing 
against Josuke anymore.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.400
More importantly, you guys were 
just playing pachinko, right?

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.260
Huh?

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.990
How did you know?

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.080
Your skirts reek of sweat around the ass.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.510
The only reason you guys 
would sit on a vinyl chair

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.560
for a long time would be pachinko.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.000
Akemi, you have chocolate?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.590
You won at pachinko, didn't you?

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.650
You're right! You're amazing, Yu.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.470
Here, these are for you.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.650
As you can see,

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.220
I'm the man I am because of these girls.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.060
You fixed my injuries, so I'll help you out.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.660
You said you're not like a hunting dog?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.270
You're more than that, Yuya Fungami!

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.650
July 15th (Thurs)  12:05 PM

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.380
What's the matter?

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.830
The floor upstairs is also burnt, right?

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.280
I'll give you an estimate, 
so please, go ahead.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.290
What's with him?

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.080
Why does he go to such 
lengths to hide his back?

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.090
What's going to happen if I see it?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.840
I-I want to see it!

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.360
At this point, I can't help wanting to look!

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.840
Even if it means tricking him...

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.300
Oh, it itches... It itches...

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.850
But I can't quite reach it.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:23.520
Would it be rude if I asked someone 
I just met to scratch my back?

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.350
That's fine...

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.720
July 15th (Thurs)  12:38 PM

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.840
This is it.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.340
This is where we found just 
Koichi's bag lying on the ground.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.210
Koichi's house is less than two minutes away.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.580
How did this new Stand user attack

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.690
Koichi and take him away 
on his way to school?

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.500
No one saw him.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.350
Josuke...

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.350
Our deal doesn't include me fighting, right?

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.270
You just want me to track, right?

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:12.100
I don't have to fight the enemy, right, Josuke?

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.120
Why are you asking that now?

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.620
You were already being followed.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.370
It's that man.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.740
I smell the same scent 
as Koichi from that man.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.130
He has something of Koichi's on him!

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.300
What? That bastard over there?

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.890
Wait! Come back here!

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.770
You bastard! What did you do to Koichi?!

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.820
M-Mom?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.640
Mom!

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.610
This is definitely my mom.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.120
She's unconscious, but she's alive.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.690
I was watching from here, 
but I couldn't tell...

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.660
When did he change into Josuke's mom?

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.960
I heard that Jotaro can 
stop time for two seconds,

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.130
but this is nothing like that!

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.220
Jotaro wouldn't be able to bring in 
a random person from nowhere!

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.100
If he had come after me directly,

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.180
I wouldn't have minded 
just knocking him out...

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.770
But that bastard went after my mom...

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.030
Guys like that are unforgivable!

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.650
Guys who play dirty tricks like this!

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.190
Yuya! Where is he?

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.970
Where'd the bastard disappear to?!

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.950
If you were touching him and don't know,

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.570
then how would I know?

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.970
B-But he's still here, Josuke...

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.950
He's nearby. His scent hasn't cleared yet!

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.760
Hmm... Yuya Fungami, huh?

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.420
It's a bit surprising that 
his nose works that well.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.300
Though I was fine with getting caught 
when I started following him, anyway.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.050
I was planning on bringing out 
Josuke's mother, either way...

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.180
In order to observe Josuke.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.770
Observe...

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.630
My Stand, Misterioso, observes.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:12.440
Misterioso carefully observes 
Koichi Hirose and your mother, as well.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.590
July 15th (Thurs)  7:37 AM

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.740
That kid seriously pisses me off.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.910
I'll just eat his pudding, then!

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.460
Josuke! So you were still home.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.210
You're here, right?

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.680
These are
your panties

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.510
Everyone feels fear.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.410
It's no use trying to hide your 
feelings or expressions of fear.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.510
The fear that lies deep within one's heart

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.480
can never be erased...

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.820
No matter who you are.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.920
Wh-Who are you? How did you get in here?

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.670
I just figured it out now by watching you,

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.610
but you seem to have a habit of

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.340
swallowing your saliva when 
you're scared, don't you?

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.510
Everyone shows some kind of subconscious 
sign when they're scared.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.560
A habit displayed when they're truly scared...

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.180
Have you never realized it?

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.720
I'm asking you who you are!

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.350
I'm not giving you any money!

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.700
Get the hell out of here!

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.570
Do I look like a burglar to you?

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.060
I don't want your money. 
Actually, I'd prefer to pay you.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.040
After all, I'm having so much fun right now.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.780
I'm having such fun with 
the attention you're giving me.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.160
The fact that you're giving me 
attention out of fear, that is.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.300
Gulp

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.550
Oh? You swallowed again, didn't you?

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.120
See? You just swallowed again!

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.070
That's definitely the sign that you're scared!

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.820
And once the sign of your fear is discovered,

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:25.070
my Misterioso completes 
its invincible attack!

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.270
I was able to turn Tomoko Higashikata,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:47.470
Tomoko
Higashikata

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.610
as well as Koichi Hirose, into paper with ease!

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:47.470
Koichi
Hirose

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.850
When I slightly startled 
Koichi on his way to school,

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.530
his sign of fear was blinking twice.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.290
I could tell immediately.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.200
Yuya, I'm asking you where 
the scent is coming from!

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.760
No matter how tough Josuke 
is, I thought that he'd

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.740
be scared if I brought out 
his mom all of a sudden, but...

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.750
Sure enough, I saw Josuke's sign.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.250
Josuke definitely bites his 
lower lip when he's scared!

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:20.000
Ba-dump

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.350
The next time Josuke gets 
scared and shows that sign,

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.000
Misterioso will eliminate 
Josuke from this world!

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.310
Yuya, you keep looking at my mom.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.470
Could it be...

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.470
Is it this jacket? Is there 
something inside the pockets?

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.350
I don't know what kind of Stand 
it is, but is it in this pocket?

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.820
Oh? Is he going to bite his lower lip?!

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.060
Come on, bite it!

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.540
Yuya, answer me! Is he in here?!

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.900
Damn! Looks like he's not scared yet.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.640
Josuke, I didn't promise to help you fight.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.660
I only promised I would track.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.760
Going any further is way too dangerous.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.270
I accepted this deal because 
you fixed my injuries,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.210
but only a fool would put 
himself in danger after that.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.340
I'm sorry, but that guy is too creepy!

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.220
Then I'll have to see for myself.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.450
There's nothing in there. 
Both pockets are empty.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.530
Other than this piece of paper...

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.030
The scent is no longer in the pocket...

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.030
Could it be...

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.750
Don't! If I were you, I wouldn't 
unfold that piece of paper!

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.430
