WEBVTT

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.480
Jeez...

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.940
Damn it, this pisses me off.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.860
Now, where did I put it?

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.870
Anjuro Katagiri, a.k.a. Angelo.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.010
He's become the most awful and 
disgusting criminal in Japan's history.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.340
He's repeatedly committed murders
ever since he was 12.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.380
His last murder...

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.880
Milkman! Watch your step over there!

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.700
...was lower than dog shit.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.990
In March of 1994,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.600
he happened to meet three 14-year-olds.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.070
He raped and murdered two of them.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.480
Did you step in it?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.530
Yes, it appears so.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.800
Seriously, it pisses me off.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.350
Letting their dog shit in front
of someone else's house...

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.050
I'm really thinking of keeping it

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.120
and putting it in the owner's 
pocket tomorrow morning.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.310
Um... I left your milk over there.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.540
I'll be off now.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.880
You...

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.110
You're not the usual milkman.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.680
Yes, I'm just covering this morning.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.760
Huh...

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.030
Because the third boy was from a rich family,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.350
he demanded a ransom.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.990
That's what led to his arrest.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.620
I might just be picky, but the 
seal on this milk's lid is broken.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.190
Huh?

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.650
Is it?

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.970
Yeah, right here!

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.430
Oh, yeah...

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.690
See? It's broken, right?

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.530
Yeah. Sorry about that.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.820
I'll be going now.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.270
Thanks.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.250
Good day.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.670
Damn that bitch!

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.250
Glob

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.670
That woman's pretty watchful.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.180
If that woman or her brat, 
Josuke, drank this milk,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.470
my Stand, Aqua Necklace, 
could have possessed them!

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.870
Another one? You just keep going, don't you?

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.220
When the police infiltrated the area 
where the boy was being held,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.970
they found a truly horrific sight.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.470
The boy was dead, and his privates

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.900
had been chopped off and 
nailed to a pillar near the corpse.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.880
Why the hell didn't you 
clean up your dog's shit?

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.010
On top of that, you just threw your 
cigarette on the ground, didn't you?

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.100
Don't get cocky!

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.230
Because those who get cocky...

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.380
can just swallow my Stand and die.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.470
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.470
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.830
Episode 2  Josuke Higashikata! Meets Angelo

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.610
So it seemed like that Stand 
had possessed the robber...

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.880
Or rather, it was just in his body.
It didn't attack me.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.170
Was Angelo nearby? The guy in the picture.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.560
No, I didn't see him.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.470
Damn it, my hair's not setting right.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.510
Listen up. That Stand's power is weak, 
but it can be controlled remotely.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.230
It's the type that can somehow enter people.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.270
I'm heading to your house now.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.000
Huh? Right now?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.460
Don't eat or drink anything until I get there.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.930
That includes tap water.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.870
Don't shower or use the bathroom, either. Got it?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.490
Hold on a second. I haven't 
told my mom about you yet.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.310
My mom's pretty tough, but it seems 
that she still loves Joseph Joestar,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.140
and cries when she thinks about him.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.770
She'll know who you are with one look.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.720
Josuke, where did this picture come from?

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.930
This is the milkman from earlier...

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.430
Do you know him?

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.020
Hey, Josuke. What's wrong?

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.040
Crap! I was too late.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.790
I just saw that thing go into 
my mom's mouth from the coffee!

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.440
Hello? Josuke? Hey! Josuke!

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.400
Josuke, you want some coffee, too?

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.290
Yeah, sure. Could you put in 
some milk and sugar for me?

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.160
Milk and sugar, right?

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.790
Do-

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.790
Boom

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.060
Josuke? Was it milk and sugar?

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.060
Yeah.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.000
Hello? Jotaro?

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.670
I caught that Stand, but...

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.330
What?

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.820
What should I do with it?

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.360
How in the hell...

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.070
Be careful. Angelo should be watching 
over your house from somewhere.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.480
Don't take your eyes off that Stand.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.460
I'll be right there.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.170
Angelo,
Criminal
Condemned
to Death,
Escapes

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.270
There's no doubt that Angelo was 
able to escape prison and death row

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.170
because he used his Stand.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.830
But I still don't know the specifics 
of that Stand's power.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.740
Dead ball!

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.820
And that's the game!

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.600
The game ends with a dead ball!

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.110
There, there.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.320
You little shit!

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.360
Josuke! You need to get going,
or you'll be late!

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.630
I'll kill them both!
That little brat and his hot mom!

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.760
Yup!

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.780
I need to either get the cap off

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.780
or break open this bottle, somehow...

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.970
He's...

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.180
I'm home. You really feel it when 
you work the night shift at my age.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.180
Higashikata...

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.330
Come to think of it, it's the same name.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.480
So this is Officer Higashikata's house.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.270
I haven't seen him since I was 12.
Talk about memories.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.090
I know everything about you!

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.940
Freeze.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.390
Josuke, why aren't you at school?

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.220
Are you allowed to take 
your gun home, Gramps?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.790
Oh, shush! Answer me.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.030
I-I'm going! I'm just waiting for someone.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.260
You fool. This is just a model gun.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.110
You scaredy-cat.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.840
I guess I win the first round in our 
weekly contest to scare each other.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.040
Yeah, yeah. I lose.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.330
Hm? What's wrong? You're not 
even trying to argue this time.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.720
Nothing. Mom already left.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.200
You should go to bed. 
You're tired, aren't you?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.320
Now, our next story.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:35.700
News Bureau

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:35.700
7 Bodies Found In Park

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.800
The number of strange deaths occurring

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.670
due to the center of the eye or ear

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.700
being destroyed has risen to 
seven as of this morning.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.030
The police are trying to get to the 
bottom of these bizarre deaths,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.040
which have only occurred in Morioh.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.790
They're trying to determine if they
were caused by illness or accident.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.410
I've heard about this.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.660
It definitely reeks of foul play to me.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.470
I can't help but feel like someone really 
dangerous is hiding in this city.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.250
Gramps...

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.370
Morioh's masterpiece, beef tongue in miso.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.270
He's here...

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.130
I know you well, Higashikata.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:17.180
After you finish your night shift, 
you always enjoy a shot of brandy.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.990
Josuke, grab the bottle and get in the car.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.070
Let's take it somewhere isolated.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.050
Right.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.950
G-Gramps...

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.260
Josuke Higashikata, this is all your fault!

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.790
It's all your fault for not 
keeping your eyes on me.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.840
You got too cocky!

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.070
It cheers me up

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:09.920
when I see cocky guys step 
into the depths of despair!

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.900
That was close! That power is incredible...

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.000
You're still being cocky!

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.760
I'll kill you, whatever it takes!

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.440
You hear? Whatever it takes!

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.310
Gramps opened the cap on the bottle.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.440
But there's nothing to worry about.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.450
It's just a minor wound. My Stand can easily...

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.960
All fixed.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.430
It can't be...

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.700
He should wake up.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.940
My Stand can heal wounds.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.240
I've done it lots of times since I was a kid.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.440
I even fixed my friend's broken bone...

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.210
Hey, Gramps! I'm gonna be mad
if you're messing around.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.670
Did you really fall asleep because 
you had the night shift?

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.490
You don't need to try to scare me anymore!

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.460
Gramps! Gramps!

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.710
Josuke...

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.800
The wound's been completely...

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.210
It can be said that humans live by destroying.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.260
In the midst of all that, your power 
is kinder than anything else.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.600
But once a life is taken,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.020
it doesn't come back.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.850
No matter the Stand, it can't bring it back.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.410
For 35 years, he protected this 
city as a police officer.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.400
He sensed the danger here,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.160
and when he heard news about

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.630
murders that sounded like Angelo's work,

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.880
he had the eyes of a man who 
was protecting his city.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.540
Angelo has killed many.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.590
There must be several bodies 
of people from this city

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.140
that haven't been found yet.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.970
There's no reason for his murders.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.300
It's a hobby to him.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.920
And he'll keep killing, I'm sure.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.040
He's probably going to start 
by killing you and your mom.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.290
I'll...

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.560
I'll protect this city and
my mom in his place.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.670
No matter what happens.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.420
The funeral has ended,
and his uniform hangs in the closet.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:24.130
And behind it, the shoes, socks, shirts, 
and pants of a middle-aged man,

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.670
who would say, "What? This is what I like,"
are neatly folded and lined up.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.120
But eventually, they will 
probably be disposed of.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.810
Because, despite his daughter

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.300
not wanting to throw them away 
since they hold such dear memories,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.440
no one will ever wear them again.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.050
Josuke probably doesn't 
want to see anyone right now.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.220
Everything but canned drinks
and foods is dangerous,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.740
so don't consume anything else.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.240
How's your mom?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.440
I had her go to a relative's 
house after the funeral.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.710
Good idea. She can come back 
after we kick Angelo's ass.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.360
I'm not pissed off or anything.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.300
I just got a little worked up for a moment.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.230
I'm calm. Completely calm.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.300
Calm, huh?

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.370
Well, this is your furniture,

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.080
so it's up to you if you want
to take out your anger on it.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.560
By the way, that scar on your lip...

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.980
That's from when I punched you.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.700
Can't your Stand heal your wounds?

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.730
My Stand can't heal my own wounds.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.440
What if his Stand enters your body and 
starts tearing things up from the inside?

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.620
I'd probably die.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.500
If it invades me, I lose.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.090
You're gonna try to trap my 
Stand in a bottle again?

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:17.550
That ain't happening again, Josuke. 
I know your powers very well now.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.980
Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow...

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.280
I'll wait patiently for my chance.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.450
— 3 Days Later —

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.460
He's come this close to see what's going on...

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.250
But these past three days,
he hasn't made a single move.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.000
What's he waiting for?

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.030
It's raining...

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.170
Rain?

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.410
What the hell?

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.260
I thought something seemed odd about you.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.890
So you're a Stand user, too?

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.580
Well, whatever. I've been 
waiting for this moment.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.430
This house is now mine!

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.450
You guys can't leave while it's raining!

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.800
Josuke!

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.570
He was just here all of a sudden, 
boiling the water.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.640
He's twisted the faucet, too.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.270
Angelo's Stand has entered the house.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.460
He wasn't waiting for you to drink the water.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.810
He was waiting for it to rain!

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.400
His Stand can move in the rain... No.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.690
It can move freely in liquids.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.870
Josuke! Stay away from that kettle!

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.620
The steam is him!

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.940
This is just great.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.130
We can't capture him in the bottle.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.880
Stay away from the steam.
If you inhale that, you're in trouble.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.390
Get out of the kitchen.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:22.310
About that... It seems like it won't even 
do any good to get out of here.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.030
Angelo has already made 
several holes in the roof.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.400
So it's dangerous to go upstairs,
obviously, or outside.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.480
This is just great...

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.030
I never would have thought a power

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.970
that uses water could be this terrifying.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.230
He's pretty smart.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.350
What's so funny? We're trapped.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.180
Hey!

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.850
I mean, Jotaro...

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.850
The guy who killed my Gramps is this close.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.110
This is just great!

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.620
Now, then. Let's finish this.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.140
Now, Josuke...

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.950
How would you

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.610
slip out of this situation?

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.270
Slip out?

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.610
I wouldn't quite word it like that.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.190
I would break out!

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.700
Hurry, this way!

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.760
The wall's going to go back to normal.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.450
Good grief.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.250
Well, we've blocked the steam...

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.920
The humidifier!

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.420
Josuke!

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.230
I've won! Just as I thought, Josuke!

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.360
I knew you'd break through the 
wall and come into this room!

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.160
Shit!

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:30.050
When horse races or test answers 
end up exactly as I expect,

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:35.880
I can't help but feel lucky from the 
bottom of my heart and laugh.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.650
It just bubbles out!

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.160
Josuke!

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.910
What Angelo just said is wrong, Jotaro.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.150
Josuke?

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:55.600
Even when things end up exactly as I expect,
I don't feel like laughing...

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.090
Not when it comes to Angelo.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.400
That's...

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.140
Got it. Sorry, it's a bit gross.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.560
I shredded up a rubber glove
and swallowed it beforehand.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.920
I see. It appears the user's body is over there.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.830
Sh-Shit!

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.050
So you're...

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.500
...Angelo.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.080
Damn it!

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.970
Y-You guys aren't going to kill me, are you?!

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.010
Sure, I'm an escaped death row inmate.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.480
But just because I was found
guilty by Japanese law

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.150
doesn't mean you guys have 
the right to judge me!

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:03.400
Josuke! I killed your grandpa,
but you have no right to kill me!

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.140
If you kill me, you'll end up 
a cursed soul, just like me!

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.580
Don't go telling people what 
they can and can't do.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.590
M-M-My right hand! My hand!

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.860
No one's going to execute you.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.090
Not me, and not Jotaro, either.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.220
You're not going to be executed,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.470
and you're not going back to jail.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.600
Josuke, I'll leave the rest to you.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.100
Wh-What do you plan to do 
with me, you bastards?!

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.870
Repent for eternity, Angelo!

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.960
For all of those you killed, 
including my Gramps!

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:59.250
You're gonna live forever in the 
city my Gramps protected.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.660
The Angelo Stone.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:14.130
Morioh Landmark 1
The Angelo Stone
 Directions  One minute's walk from Morioh Johzenji Street Bus Stop #3

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.140
The Angelo Stone is known as a landmark,

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.260
and a place where lovers meet.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.270
It's admired by the people of the city,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.220
despite its creepy appearance.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.060
He really is pretty crazy.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.980
Good grief...
