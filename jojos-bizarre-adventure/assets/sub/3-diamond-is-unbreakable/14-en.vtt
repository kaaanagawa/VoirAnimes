00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.170
Today was another exhausting day.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.730
I just want to hurry home so I can relax.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.760
K-Koichi...

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.830
Hazamada...

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.080
Hey, how are you doing?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.850
Th-Thanks for everything the other day.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.870
Um, are you all healed up now?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.790
Kinda. I was released from 
the hospital two days ago.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.860
Where's that bastard—
I mean, where's Josuke?

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.730
He already went home.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.020
Apparently, he found an 
invisible baby yesterday,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.810
and there was a big fuss 
over finding her mother.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.870
Is she a Stand user?

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.190
Apparently.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.780
The baby has only warmed up to 
Josuke's father, Mr. Joestar,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.780
and if he's not around, she turns 
everything around her invisible.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.860
So is Mr. Joestar going to be 
in town for a while, then?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.400
Probably.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.710
I see. By the way, Koichi, 
do you like to read manga?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.590
Manga? Oh, I guess about as much as anyone.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.390
Have you heard of Rohan Kishibe,
who draws <i>Pink Dark Boy</i>?

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.910
<i>Pink Dark Boy</i>? Of course!

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.300
I'm a huge fan!

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.960
Yeah? You like it?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.890
I guess you'd call it "horror suspense."

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.330
There are some pretty gross scenes,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.310
but the thrills that seem to close in on you

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.080
and the realistic characters 
are great, aren't they?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.400
Right, right!

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.320
Did you know that Rohan Kishibe 
actually lives in Morioh?

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.070
Huh?!

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.820
What?! He lives in Morioh?!

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.220
No way! You can't be serious! Really?!

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.240
I couldn't believe it, either!

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.500
But I happened to overhear 
some realtors talking.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.700
I know it seems unbelievable, but it's true!

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.620
Hey, want to go see if we 
can get some autographs?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.130
Morioh Station

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.550
Yes! Of course I'll go!

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.550
Rohan Kishibe's House

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.170
Looks like we think alike!

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.550
Really?

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.060
Kishibe

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.380
Over there!

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.580
I think that might be his studio.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.920
The light's on!

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.480
You're right...

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.100
I wonder if he has any other family.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.230
I heard he lives alone.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.030
He debuted at sixteen, and now he's twenty.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.760
Twenty?! He's so young!

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.080
So he became a pro at my age.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.310
There's no point in snooping around, Koichi.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.840
Try ringing the doorbell.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.580
M-Me?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.860
Oh, come on! I'm ordering
you, as an older student.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.840
I tend to get pretty nervous.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.780
What? That's not fair...

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.770
Episode 14  Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 1

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.950
That face!

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.370
Rohan Kishibe!

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.970
He looks just like his picture 
in the New Year's deluxe edition!

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.140
Uh, I mean... Rohan-sensei!

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.620
H-Huh?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.210
Who are you two?

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.360
What are you doing? Playing a prank?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.250
N-No! We would never!

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.100
Um, we're students at Budogaoka High School.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.370
W-We're fans of yours, Sensei.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.430
Fans? Of mine? You're readers?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.270
So my address has gotten out.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.940
N-No, um... I just happened to overhear it.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.140
So, I know this is sudden,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.320
but it would make us really happy 
if we could get your autograph.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.170
Fans of mine, eh?

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.830
That's good.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.910
We might be on the same wavelength, then.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.720
Huh?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.330
Nothing, never mind. Pardon.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.260
An autograph or two is no problem at all.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.540
Yes! I guess it's a good thing we came.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.050
I know.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.960
Since you're here, would you 
like a tour of my studio?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.690
Huh?

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.090
You'll let us go into your studio?!

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.970
I'm already done with my work for 
the day, so if you two would like...

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.810
Of course!

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.800
Then...

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.390
Pardon the intrusion!

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.450
Come in.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.410
Wow!

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.980
Wow! Raw 4-color manuscript!

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.000
This is amazing! It has so much more impact!

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.670
I-I'm so moved! I-I-I'm so glad that we came!

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.780
How long have you been working in Morioh?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.100
I moved here three months ago.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.900
My family home is in S City,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.020
but I lived here for a time when I was a child.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.300
Tokyo is very convenient, 
but it's pretty chaotic.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.000
The environment is nowhere near

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.860
as calm as it is in Morioh, 
and I can't work there.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.780
Not to mention,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.400
with the fax machines and
copiers we have these days,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.720
I have a system where, given four hours,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.330
I can send in a complete manuscript.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.620
You could say there's no point in living in

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.040
the city now, other than for pointless status.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.210
Um... So what do you do 
for assistants or staff?

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.290
I don't have any. I draw it all by myself.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.510
Huh? All by yourself?!

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.220
You draw 19 pages of such 
elaborate art in just one week?!

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.170
I can draw them in four days.
Five if there are color pages.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.620
What?!

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.040
On the remaining days, I have 
fun going on trips and such.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.930
I don't really like dealing with people,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.230
and that's why I chose to be a manga artist.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.100
If I had an assistant,
it'd be harder for me to work.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.140
That's so amazing... Wow.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.890
You're a genius!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.470
Pardon me for a moment.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.780
Whoa, a s-spider!

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.560
We really are out in the burbs.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.530
There are a lot of bugs and spiders.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.410
Um... Sensei?

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.920
I see... So this spider is 
an <i>Araneus ventricosus</i>...

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.330
It can be found in houses and 
mountainous regions all across Japan.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.200
Though it is an orb-weaver,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.550
there are some that make webs day and night.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.610
By the way,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.250
do you two know what it takes 
to draw an interesting manga?

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.870
Reality!

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.400
Reality is the energy that breathes 
life into a piece of work,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.340
and reality itself is entertainment.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.880
People often think that manga are 
drawn from imagination and fantasy,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.240
but that's not actually true!

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.110
For me, drawing something 
that I've experienced,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.070
or something that has moved me,
is what makes it interesting!

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.160
For example, in the city, people would just 
be grossed out by this spider and kill it.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.160
As a manga artist, you need to 
know how its legs are connected,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.130
where the eyes are, and how to tell 
the difference between a male

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.590
and a female in order to be able to draw it.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.220
Apparently a spider's webbing hardens 
when it's exposed to the air,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.180
but you have to know what 
hole it comes from,

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.440
and what its innards look like.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.920
When a spider's belly is cut upon, 
how does it suffer before it dies?

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.990
You have to know these things 
for the sake of reality.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.820
That's so cruel!

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.010
Cruel?!

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.120
An amateur brat like you is 
criticizing me, Rohan Kishibe?!

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.210
N-No! I wasn't criticizing at all! I'm sorry!

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.080
I should have a taste, too.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.590
Manga artists are really strange people, 
just as the world perceives them!

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.760
Very nice! That agonized expression...

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.600
Perfect example of how one looks when puking!

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.430
I should sketch it.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.140
R-Really?

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.390
Now it looks fake.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.310
Forget it. I won't sketch it.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.870
It won't be of any use.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.660
I-I'm sorry.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.990
Autographs, wasn't it?

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.520
I'll go get a signing pen from the kitchen,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.610
and bring out some tea, as well.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.360
Oh, you don't have to...

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.590
But that's amazing! I had no idea...

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.180
<i>Pink Dark Boy</i> must be so amazing

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.740
because of how far he goes to 
figure out all kinds of things...

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.530
Um, Hazamada...

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.800
I know we just got here, but, um...

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.300
Maybe we should go home.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.320
Huh? Go home? You want to go home? Why?

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.230
This is a lot of fun!

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.530
I don't really have a reason, but...

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.790
I guess you could call it a hunch.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.490
Though I'm not usually that perceptive...

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.580
I just suddenly got the feeling that 
Rohan-sensei is a bit dangerous.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.870
Dangerous?

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.330
Do you mean that he might be a Stand user?

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.170
No! Nothing like that. Just, um...

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.330
Just because Rohan-sensei's a bit unusual,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.870
I don't think you should just 
assume that he's a Stand user.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.140
I'm not assuming that he is...

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.060
I just said I have a bad feeling.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.190
Besides, if Rohan-sensei 
actually is a Stand user,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.060
wouldn't that be great for us?

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.410
That means I have something in common 
with a famous manga artist.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.450
But, all right.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.540
If you have a bad feeling, 
we can go home for today.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.120
We can always come again.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.740
But!

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.660
Only after I've looked at this
thing that caught my eye.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.360
Thing? What thing?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.080
Jeez, you're dense, Koichi!

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.950
On top of the desk, next to the phone.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.670
Look carefully.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.650
Oh! C-Could this be...

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.340
Yup! He said he just finished working, right?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.290
I've been eyeing that carefully.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.770
A manuscript for <i>Pink Dark Boy</i>
that's just been finished?!

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.690
Does that mean no one else 
has even seen it yet?!

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.200
Once I get a glimpse of this, we can go home.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.570
We should get permission first.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.260
Koichi, you don't know manga artists at all.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.630
These manuscripts, before 
they've gone to the printers,

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.960
are a closely-guarded trade secret!

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.360
There's no way he'd let us outsiders read a

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.510
manuscript that hasn't even 
been checked by the editor yet!

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.400
I'll have a look, then put it right back.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.270
That's an even worse idea!

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.250
It's fine! It's not like it can hurt anything.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.480
Huh?

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.100
What is this feeling?

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.840
It's always a thrilling manga, but is 
this the impact of a raw manuscript?

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.700
I'm getting goosebumps!

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.900
It's so good!

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.570
Hurry up and turn the page, Hazamada.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.580
I'm so moved!

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.080
It appears

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:55.970
that my manuscript was compatible 
with you two after all.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.090
I thought you would read it.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.800
And only those who are the first to read 
my manuscript, and are compatible...

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.540
H-Hazamada...

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.680
K-Koichi...

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.120
...will have their hearts opened 
by my ability, Heaven's Door!

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.020
A-Ability?!

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.780
My hand!

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.080
K-Koichi! What's going on?!

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.090
Morioh Landmark 5
Manga Artist Rohan Kishibe's House
<font size="16">Get off at the Morioh Kotodai 2-chome 
bus stop and walk 1 minute.
Area: A mansion situated on 103 tsubo of land.
7LDK plus an attic.
If you actually go, he'll pretend to be out.</c>

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.840
There are a lot of things 
recorded in the human body.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.340
Everything from the moment you were born.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.930
In order to read that, I will 
turn you both into books.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.220
Books that have your lives written in them.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.010
Help!

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.610
You read the manga too, didn't you?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.150
It's happening to me, too!

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.150
Hazamada!

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.660
This will cause you no actual 
harm, so don't worry.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.490
Wh-What are you trying to do?!

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:12.000
I told you earlier that for manga, the author's
sense of reality is important, right?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.860
Which means reading about your lives and

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.380
experiences will offer me realistic ideas.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.850
You can't get this from interviews!

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:28.220
You're going to tell me 100% realistically,
as if I had experienced it myself.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:37.150
Koichi Hirose. Born March 28th, 1984, 
at 6:27 AM at Red Cross Hospital in S City.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.530
You were born premature at 2325 grams, 
and spent a week in an incubator.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.660
You're from a family of four, 
and your older sister's name is Ayana...

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.070
I see...

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.240
It appears that your grade school and 
middle school days were pretty ordinary,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.960
and your personality is very honest.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.480
That's very commendable.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.500
You...

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.260
What is this ability that you have?! Reverb?

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.510
Someone other than me has an ability like this?!

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.030
You, too?

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.850
"Stand users!" This is...

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.920
Everything from April of 1999 on is amazing!

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.660
You've only had amazing 
experiences ever since!

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.470
Josuke Higashikata, Jotaro Kujo,

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.420
Yukako Yamagishi, Okuyasu 
Nijimura, Tamami Kobayashi...

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.390
I can't believe it...

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.440
This is amazing! It's so entertaining!

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.370
I just discovered the best material a manga 
artist could hope for, Koichi Hirose!

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.090
Shining Diamond,

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.770
Star Platinum,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:48.550
The Hand, Love Deluxe, et cetera, et cetera!

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.220
Wh-What do you plan on doing with us?!

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.390
I'm going to take your memories

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.020
so I can use them as material for my manga!

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.810
Reverb!

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.210
Please stop attacking us 
with your Stand immediately!

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.570
Otherwise...

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.760
Are you going to have Reverb 
Act 2 attack me with sound?

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.470
Yes! Please release me from your Stand!

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.280
I won't hold back!

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.670
I know. It's written on your 11th page.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:29.470
You're far more timid than most people 
and taken rather lightly by others,

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.410
but when it's necessary, you have 
courage that can overpower your fear.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.910
Truly magnificent!

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.430
I'm very impressed with you!

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.100
I'm sure my readers will 
like your personality, too.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.700
I'm not bluffing! I'm really 
going to attack you!

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.900
Oh, shut up...

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.360
And just try it!

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.070
Reverb Act 2!

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.760
Crash

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.060
Crash

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.460
Huh? I-I missed?!

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.870
Did you accidentally miss 
or did you miss on purpose?

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.600
Your control is way off!

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.380
Then how about this?!

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.530
Crash

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.390
Where are you attacking?!

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:17.840
Koichi, sadly for you, I have 
put a safety lock on Reverb.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.520
Huh?

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.270
You are now unable to attack me.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.270
Safety lock?

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:36.910
Look... I've already written it into 
your 11th page, right here.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.580
I can not attack the manga 
artist, Rohan Kishibe

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.290
<font size="24">I can not

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.420
can not

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.550
This is Heaven's Door's ability.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.980
It lets me read people's experiences 
via words and pictures,

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.150
and it also allows me to 
write into your memories.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:16:01.140
You will now never be able to harm 
me in any way, shape, or form.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.150
Wh-What?!

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.980
But that's all I'm going to mess with.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.710
If I write in any more,
it'll make your life fake,

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.240
so it wouldn't benefit my work at all.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.470
Let's see... I guess I'll 
have a look at Hazamada, too.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.540
Sensei! You are a genius! I admire you!

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.300
Huh... I see.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.660
Let's see...

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.960
You sometimes feel relief after you've

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.550
picked on things weaker than yourself, 
like kittens and small birds.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.040
You want to force yourself on Junko from 3-E,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.060
but you're too cowardly, so you can't.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.760
Your balls often get sweaty,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.840
and when you're adjusting them during class,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.160
nothing gives you a greater thrill than 
the thought that someone might see you.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.650
You're an awful man.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.130
There's no way my readers would like 
you if I wrote you into my manga.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.970
You're useless.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.530
No fair! There's no hope for me!

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.530
Why?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.520
Why are you doing this?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.860
Even without reading about my experiences, 
you're an amazing manga artist!

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.890
The world knows that!

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.620
You're living in this amazing 
house at the age of twenty!

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.180
You're doing much better 
than most people your age!

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.520
And yet, why do you need my memories?!

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.910
Do you think that I, 
Rohan Kishibe, draw manga

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.690
for the sake of money and attention?!

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.240
I'm drawing manga so people will read it!

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.830
So someone will read it! 
That's the only reason!

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:44.120
It's a very simple reason, but I 
don't care about anything else!

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.290
So that people will read it,
I look for realistic material every day!

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.630
Listen well. Whenever I finish 
a manuscript, I feel amazing.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.970
Everyone feels great after
 finishing work, don't they?

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.940
But that feeling only lasts for an instant.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.310
It's only a little while,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.340
because I start thinking that no one's 
going to read my completed manga,

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.350
and my insecurities start to grow.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.940
Then I get even more insecure 
because, maybe next week,

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.610
no one's going to read it, and 
then I might not know what

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.430
to draw anymore, and I might not 
feel like doing anything anymore.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:25.730
These feelings have been reoccurring 
over and over since I was sixteen.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.730
Until three months ago,
when someone shot me with an arrow,

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.590
and I gained the ability of Heaven's Door.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.660
Keicho Nijimura...

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.090
Yes, that was also written in you.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.340
I'm sure you two don't understand 
the feeling of having found

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.760
the best material to use
for drawing a masterpiece!

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.520
But this is it, right now!

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.060
It's the best!

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:51.230
Koichi, I'm going to make your reality mine!

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.170
See, Koichi? Wasn't Rohan-sensei a great guy?

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.780
Aren't you glad we went?

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.040
Yeah! It was so much fun!

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.550
To Hirose
<font size="30">Rohan Kishibe</c>

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.640
Not only did he give us 
these great autographs,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.120
he even served us tea and cookies.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.080
I'd love to go again.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.330
Yeah. Let's definitely go again.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.560
Well, I'm heading this way, so...

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.810
He really was a great guy.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.780
You'll never speak of this, Koichi.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.780
Huh?!

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.530
Wh-Why?!

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.410
How did I lose 20 kilograms?

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.960
But I don't look any different!

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.500
It reads five kilograms...

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.340
The scale's not broken.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.600
Th-This is impossible!

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.850
Th-This has to be the work 
of an enemy Stand user!

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.210
Otherwise, there's no way 
I'd lose 20 kilograms!

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.940
But who...

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.530
I need to talk to Josuke about this.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.660
What's the matter, Ko?

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.580
Huh?

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.880
Me? U-Uh...

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.080
Wait... What was it?

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.340
What are you talking about? Weirdo.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.570
What's wrong?

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:35.620
Oh, nothing. My little brother's 
wandering around in his underwear.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.120
What was it?

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.390
I could have sworn I thought about 
something really important just now.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.040
Well, if I forgot about it,
it can't be that important.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.730
Man, my shoes and bag sure feel heavy today.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.610
Huh?

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.360
Th-This house...

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.890
Why?

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:09.140
I somehow ended up walking to
Rohan-sensei's house without realizing it.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.330
The door's open...

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.500
I'd like to stop by and thank him for yesterday,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.140
but then I'd be late for school.
It's probably a bad idea.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.620
He might actually still be asleep 
since he's a manga artist.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.080
I really shouldn't just barge into his house.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.630
It's really not a good idea...

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.560
Hey, did you see that, Okuyasu?

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.820
Yeah...

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.900
We followed Koichi because 
he was heading in the

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.520
opposite direction of the school, 
but what the heck is he doing?

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.050
Whose house is that?

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.870
I have my doubts, but it's 
not some chick, is it?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.170
Rohan-sensei...

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.130
He's working so frantically.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.580
But I wonder what it is...

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.350
I can't shake the feeling that
being here is actually terrifying.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.070
What is it?

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.030
I'm glad you came.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.760
I've been waiting for you. 
You're right on time.
