00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.980
This arrow is very precious. 
It's the only one there is.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.790
It's my precious objective.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.490
I just <i>have</i> to retrieve it.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.950
Don't you dare pull out that arrow! 
It'll make him bleed even more!

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.340
Because my little brother's an idiot,
I have to kill you now.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.650
Which means it won't be good 
if something happens to this arrow.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.640
If the lady next door happens to see it,
or if it snaps in half, that'd be bad news.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.660
I'm a very methodical type, you see,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.890
so I want to make sure I put 
the arrow away properly.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.320
When you're listening to CDs, you properly 
put the first one away in its case

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.400
before listening to the second one, right?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.560
Everyone's like that.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.530
I'm like that, too.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
Oh? You're gonna come into this house?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.260
Think before you speak!

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.370
If I don't come in, I can't kick 
your ass and treat Koichi's wounds!

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.720
Bro! I haven't lost yet!

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.010
Hold off on attacking him!

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.800
Attack?

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.970
We ain't finished yet!

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.180
Something's coming from...

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.060
the darkness of the ceiling!

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.460
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.460
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.720
Episode 4  The Nijimura Brothers, Part 2

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.690
Okuyasu...

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.610
How stupid you are never ceases to amaze me.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.380
If you hadn't come staggering in here,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.530
my Worse Company would have 
attacked Josuke for sure.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.500
And you actually walked into 
its attack trajectory.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.290
Bro...

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.880
Your Stand, The Hand, is terrifying, 
but you're completely incompetent.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.240
I told you over and over,
ever since we were kids,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.180
that incompetent people drag down 
everyone around them, didn't I?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.180
I told you over and over that people 
only have the right to live

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.450
if they keep growing, didn't I?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.720
What's with his injuries?

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.060
What kind of attack makes you
end up with wounds like that?

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.120
Anyway, it seems that something's up there.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.290
Little brother,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.290
I think it's only natural that 
morons like you should die!

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.290
It left a ton of holes again!

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.720
What kind of attack is that?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.320
Shining Diamond!

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.890
Are you trying to attack your brother, too?!

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.810
Josuke Higashikata...

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.730
I'm sure he won't abandon 
this brat he called Koichi.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.480
He'll most likely come in here again.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.620
I'll kill him, no matter what...

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.530
I'll kill anyone who gets in the way 
of this bow and arrow's objective,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.210
no matter who they may be!

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.340
Now, then... How about you tell me
about your brother's Stand?

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.570
Tell me what his Stand really is!

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.020
If you tell me, I'll treat your wounds.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.150
Like hell... I'm gonna tell you...

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.040
Dumbass...

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.060
As I thought.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.700
Well, then... I guess I have no choice!

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.340
I'm gonna go in there again,
so just don't get in my way, Okuyasu.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.810
Koichi doesn't have much time!

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.020
His Stand attacks from somewhere 
within this darkness.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.080
Going in here is pretty dangerous.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.780
I've got no choice but to
use all of my senses fully...

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.130
Hey, wait a minute!

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.030
Huh?

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.810
Why, Josuke? Why did you treat my wounds?

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.660
Shut up. I'll tell you later.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.610
I might attack you! I'm your enemy!

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.790
You want a piece of me?

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.050
After I hear your answer!
Why did you treat my wounds?

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.340
I'm not very smart, 
so you're gonna have to tell me!

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.490
And that wound on your hand!

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.680
You got that when you were 
pulling me outside, didn't you?

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.690
I wanna know why you went 
through all that to save me.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.620
There's no deep reason.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.910
"There's no reason he has to die."

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.600
That's what I thought back there.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.340
Koichi...

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.370
The trail leads upstairs.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.120
I still have more questions, Josuke!

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.940
What's your problem?!

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.940
I'm begging you, just let me save Koichi!

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.080
Why?!

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.190
Why don't you use your Stand's 
powers to fix your own hand?

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.090
You should just fix it up 
like you did with my face.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.590
My Shining Diamond can't
repair my own wounds.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.350
It just means life isn't that easy.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.470
And, more than anything,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.610
I have no way of saving people 
who've already died.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.730
Let me just say one thing, Okuyasu.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.950
If Koichi dies, I don't know what 
I'm gonna do to your brother.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.360
So don't hold it against me. It was your 
brother who caused all this trouble.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.030
You got that? If you do, stay outside.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.640
Koichi!

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.320
Damn it... This is definitely a trap.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.800
He plans to attack me from somewhere 
as soon as I get close to Koichi.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.060
But...

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.100
Even if I know it's a trap,
I have no choice but to go!

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.700
Koichi doesn't even have seconds left!

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.620
What?!

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.490
Okuyasu, you bastard!

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.790
Josuke!

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.000
Gyaon

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.580
Koichi just...

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.610
Because I'm stupid, I just 
act on what's in my heart.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.210
Just once, just this once, 
I'll repay my debt to you.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.840
I won't do anything else.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.910
I won't help out my Bro,
or do anything to you, either.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.790
This is it.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.110
That's just great, Okuyasu.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.950
Hey, you were in great danger, Koichi.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.950
I'm glad you came to.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.600
How many fingers am I holding up?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.250
Five...

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.070
I-I got my head trapped between the gates,

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.960
and then, uh... um...

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.260
Wh-Where are we?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.720
That dangerous situation we were 
in earlier isn't over yet, Koichi.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.520
I want to go down those 
stairs and go outside,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.460
but I wonder if Okuyasu's brother 
will let us do that safely...

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.850
There's definitely something up there.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.280
Something's lurking in the 
shadows of the ceiling.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.210
What's that?

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.590
Something really fast just went by.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.730
Josuke, what's going on?

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.220
Koichi, I'm sure you have no 
idea what's going on right now.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.180
For now, don't ask any questions,
and get closer to me.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.650
Earlier, it was creepy 
because I couldn't see it,

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.250
but I feel a bit more at ease 
now that I've seen it.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.060
It just looks like a shrimp 
with very little power.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.980
This battle's gonna end with 
me sending Shining Diamond

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.750
after that shrimp the next time it pops up.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.490
There you are!

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.580
What the heck? There's a ton of them!

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.200
And that uniform...

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.740
Burn

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.420
Wh-What's...

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.130
A bunch of guys that look like 
toy soldiers are falling...

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.090
Are these Okuyasu's brother's Stand?

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.890
Ow!

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.810
You bastard!

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.940
I guess attacking two or three 
won't do enough damage.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.530
And the wounds are small, but their 
destructive power is the real thing.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.670
We're sure to get seriously
hurt if we fight these things.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:28.190
Since Okuyasu decided to meddle 
and save that brat,

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.170
my plan's been derailed.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.690
But they won't be leaving this house...

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:39.530
Nor will they leave my Stand,
Worse Company's, battlefield.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:43.430
Wo

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.550
Wor

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.720
Worse

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:43.840
Worse Co

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:43.930
Worse Com

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.050
Worse Compa

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.060
Worse Company

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:44.760
Kei

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:44.890
Keicho

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.010
Keicho Niji

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.060
Keicho Nijimura

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.560
Worse Company?

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.430
Josuke, wh-what's...

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.480
Don't ask questions.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.070
I'm sure you don't get it, 
but just shut up and stay back!

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.290
We're in real trouble right now!

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.550
All units, halt!

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.740
Ready, aim...

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.710
Fire!

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.900
Left face!

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.730
Fire!

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.610
As I thought, that's enough 
destructive power to blow off

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.080
our limbs if they hit us head-on!

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.640
Lucky! There are some windows.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.800
Koichi, this is the second floor,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.020
but we're gonna bust out 
those windows and dive out.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.420
I guess I was a bit naïve...

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.540
Just great... They have helicopters, too?

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.430
Those look like the American
army's Apache helicopters.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.450
Look out! There's a tank!

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.760
You're right. They have tanks, too.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.050
Koichi, be caref—

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.100
What?

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.520
Wh-What did you just say, 
Koichi? Can you see them?

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.150
These soldiers, tanks, and helicopters...

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.330
You can see them clearly?

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.650
Yeah. I'm not sure what's 
going on, but I can see them.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.060
Could it be that since you were shot by 
that arrow, you became a Stand user?

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.370
Oh? So the little shrimp

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:37.790
has the power to use a Stand now?

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.780
There you are, Okuyasu's big bro.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.130
You've got some guts,
showing yourself like that!

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.280
My Stand, Worse Company, 
has unbreakable defense.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.810
It's an army that won't let 
any invader leave alive.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.550
I'm sure you want to beat me...

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:07.250
But I can tell you right now that 
your Shining Diamond's attacks

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.350
will never reach me.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:17.740
Look! Do you see my army's 
beautiful formation?

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.540
All units, maintain battle 
formation! At ease!

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.920
It feels so good when they're
so beautifully together.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.370
Though I'm a bit pissed off 
that their formation is

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.350
a little off, since you
killed two or three of them.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.350
You sure are methodical.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.860
You came out here just to explain that?

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.440
No, the reason I came out here

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.830
is to watch you, brat.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.070
M-Me?

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.270
That's right.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.500
Koichi, was it?

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.770
It seems, despite my expectations,
you had the aptitude to be a Stand user.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.900
Make your Stand appear right now, 
and show me what it can do.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:06.550
You might have the ability 
that I've been looking for.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.680
If you have that ability, I'll let you live.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.660
B-But...

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.610
The ability you're looking for?

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.060
What the hell are you after?

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.560
You're in no position to be 
asking questions, Josuke!

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.170
My decision to kill you hasn't changed!

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.880
Be thankful that you get to live a bit longer.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.070
That's just great.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.070
Hey, what're you doing?

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.860
Make your Stand appear, brat!

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.410
S-Stand? I have no idea what's going on...

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.000
Oh? It's your first time? I see!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.850
Fine! Josuke, show him how 
to make a Stand appear!

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:44.630
Huh?

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.150
Your Shining Diamond's range 
is less than one meter.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:54.260
If that shrimp's Stand's ability 
is able to compensate for yours,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.550
you might be able to escape my Company.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.690
True... It'd be great if it's a 
Stand that can kick your ass.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.810
Okay, getting your Stand to 
come out is easy, Koichi.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.870
You just need to feel like

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.950
you want to protect yourself, 
or you want to kick his ass.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:14.570
Huh?

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.060
The rest is just instinct.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.910
A Stand that's unique to your 
mentality should come out.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:26.290
W-Wait! I can't understand 
all this out of nowhere!

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.260
You don't understand?

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.550
Then I guess we'll just have to put 
you in a situation that makes you!

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.330
Do it, Green Beret!

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.340
Boom

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.280
What?!

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.230
That's...

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.540
Hey, Koichi, try moving it.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.900
M-Move what?

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.860
That Stand!

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.160
Stand?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.700
I-I made this appear?!

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.650
What happens after this?

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.430
What kind of abilities does 
this egg-shaped thing have?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:22.840
Abilities? I'm sorry to disappoint you, 
but this is all I can do!

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.240
This is it!

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.230
What? That's it?!

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.350
This Stand...

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.320
That's enough! That's all I need to know!

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.200
All units, battle positions!

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.170
Koichi, withdraw your Stand.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.730
If they attack that thing, you'll die, too!

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.750
Withdraw? How do I make it withdraw?!

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.090
Commence attack!

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.210
Kablow

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.960
J-Josuke!

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.310
Good. Now Koichi and Josuke 
have been separated.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.440
The crack in that egg...

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.200
The brat hasn't realized it yet,
but it might be something worthwhile.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.230
The only one who's going 
to die right now is Josuke.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.100
Ow...

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.410
Hey, Okuyasu's big bro,

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:24.480
if you're going to use an attack 
flashy enough to destroy this house,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.540
I'm gonna do the same.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.760
Let's make this <i>just great</i>.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.610
Josuke Higashikata...

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:53.620
Is it true that you hate it when anyone 
says anything insulting about your hair?

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.320
Why don't you try insulting it?
Just to test that out.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.290
No, there's no need.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.290
Because I'm going to declare that I'll

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.790
blow off the head that your hair sits on.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.840
First, my Worse Company is 
going to shoot your legs.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.700
You won't be able to run away then.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.200
Next, we'll damage your arm.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.430
Then you won't be able to guard yourself.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:23.020
And then, I declare that I'm gonna blow 
your brains out, along with your hair.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.910
I see. That's a flawless plan...

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.150
If you ignore the fact that it's impossible!

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.100
I'm very methodical, you see.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.360
If I say I'll do something 
in a certain order, I will.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.090
That's what a declaration is.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.940
He's wide open...

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.530
I just need to make that 
Stand thing appear again.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:49.270
It's only an egg-looking thing, 
but if I can make it ram into him,

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.580
I might be able to beat him!

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.940
I-I'm going to do it! Be confident!

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.700
I'm going to beat him!

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.020
I'm very interested in your Stand,

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.880
so I won't kill you just yet.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.600
You bastard!

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.220
All units, charge!

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.080
Just like Moses, who parted the 
Red Sea and walked across its floor,

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.080
I'm gonna make my way through
this army and beat you down!

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.090
You fool! My plan is going 
exactly as I have declared,

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.350
Josuke Higashikata!

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.760
A l-landmine?!

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.770
First, damage to your legs!

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.800
And now, Apaches, fire your missiles!

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.790
My arm...

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.630
First your legs, then your arm.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.070
It feels so good when 
things go as I've declared.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.870
Let's see if you can stay in 
one piece as my Worse Company

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:13.330
fires all its missiles, shells, and rounds 
into that damaged arm of yours!

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.460
You've lost, Josuke Higashikata!

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.280
All units!

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.510
Get ready to fire at once!

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:32.100
What do you think you're 
doing, Josuke Higashikata?

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.020
Are you surrendering?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.560
Are you asking me to let you go?

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.300
That's not happening.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.100
All units, fire!

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.960
My plan is already finished.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.250
What?!

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:04.670
My missiles that just attacked Josuke's arm...

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.760
Did you forget?

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.170
My Shining Diamond can repair 
what's been destroyed.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:24.680
If you forgot, then write it down.
You know, methodically.
