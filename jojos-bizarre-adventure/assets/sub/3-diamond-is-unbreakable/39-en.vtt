WEBVTT

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.360
...is nothing compared to the heart 
of justice that's here right now!

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.860
It's definitely here! 
It's right here for sure!

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.860
Compared to that heart, you're nothing!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.660
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.660
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.580
Th-This is a dream...

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.290
This... is a dream.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.890
The idea that I'm being cornered like this...

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.420
This has to be a dream.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.430
You don't have...

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.180
...anywhere left to run.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.970
You're finished.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.510
J-Josuke's badly hurt...

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.610
The battle had already begun 
while we were waiting.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.960
Which means...

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.820
That's Yoshikage Kira.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740
Someone's hurt over there!

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.360
Get back! There's a chance of 
an explosion from a gas leak!

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.360
Bring the ambulance over here!

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.950
Bring the stretcher!

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.580
It's dangerous, so please get back!

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.370
Are you all right?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.570
Just get back!

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.020
Can you hear me?
An ambulance is on its way.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.120
You're going to be all right.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.370
Don't let that lady near Kira!

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.170
We'll get you treated at 
the hospital right away.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.640
Please, hang in there.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.260
It'll be okay. Hang in there.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.800
O-Oh, no!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.560
That lady's been turned into a bomb!

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.310
Can you see how many fingers I'm holding up?

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.400
Jotaro, we need your Star Platinum.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.630
I know.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.900
But it's no use unless I can get closer.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.660
Even if I stop time, we're too far away,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.780
and I can't do anything to him.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.910
I have to get at least five meters closer.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.120
You turned someone into a 
bomb and took them hostage?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.350
Just try it! I'll fix her right up in a heartbeat!

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.010
No! It's not as simple as taking a hostage!

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.970
He's got a hidden ability!

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.350
It's an ability called Bites the Dust,
and it can blow away time!

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.840
Episode 39    Goodbye, Morioh – The Heart of Gold

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.730
It must only work on people who aren't 
Stand users, like me or that lady,

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.740
and occurs coincidentally 
whenever Kira is in trouble.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.840
Which means, when he's in despair 
like this, this ability activates

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.770
and becomes a bomb that can 
turn back time one hour!

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.620
What the hell?

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.370
The knuckles and skin on 
your hand are so soft...

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.260
You have such cute, white fingers...

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.920
Will you rub my cheek?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.760
Huh?

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.010
Rubbing my cheek calms me down so much...

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.620
When I was a child...

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.390
You've heard of Leonardo da 
Vinci's Mona Lisa, right?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.660
When I saw that painting in an art book...

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.930
When I first saw that,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.440
I don't know how to put it...

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.060
Um, this is a bit dirty, but...

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.040
Everything About
Leonardo da Vinci's
World

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.660
I got an erection.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.520
I just cut out the part with her hands

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.820
and hung it in my room for a while.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.330
I want to cut off yours, too.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.260
What are you doing?!

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.370
My name is Yoshikage Kira!

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.020
I've killed 48 women with 
beautiful hands up to now.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.620
You're the only one!

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.270
You're the only one who 
will know my identity!

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.150
O-Oh, no! Bites the Dust is about to start!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.140
If we don't defeat him now,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.000
everyone here but that 
lady will be blown away!

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.750
Jotaro!

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.830
Are you coming for me, Jotaro?

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.460
Bites the Dust was created because 
I didn't want to run into you!

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.780
Come closer! Just try and stop time!

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.370
How long will you be able to stop it?

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.720
Just try to corner me more!

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.690
Pushing me to the limit again will 
make Bites the Dust appear!

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.330
Jotaro, stop time!

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.070
Don't let him push Killer Queen's switch!

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.740
Wh-What?

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.510
No, this is the limit! I'm pushing it...

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.430
Now!

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.070
I-I did it! It activated!

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.330
I was able to return!

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.210
It went into effect.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.710
I was able to have Bites 
the Dust take effect again!

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.980
I beat them!

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.150
Now I can be free!

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.950
What was that just now?

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.120
The birds came from behind me and...

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.380
What just happened?

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.330
Come to think of it, this isn't 
the way I usually take to work...

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.980
But if Bites the Dust did 
turn back time one hour,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.990
I should be on my way to work now...

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.530
What time is it right now?

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.080
That's right. I had put my 
watch in my chest pocket.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.790
This is...

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.790
Why is it broken?!

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.550
It's 8:29! Bites the Dust 
did go into effect again!

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.180
The watch that Hayato broke with Stray Cat 
should have returned to normal, too!

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.850
Haven't you realized it?

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.440
So the Kosaku Kawajiri that Rohan took 
a picture of was Yoshikage Kira...

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.220
And it's finally over, isn't it?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.080
They finally cornered you, Yoshikage Kira.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.300
Who are you?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.330
You don't remember me?

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.900
Well, I guess that's no surprise.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.130
It happened fifteen years ago.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.220
Something very traumatic must have happened.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.510
Something so traumatic that you don't 
even realize what happened to you.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.880
Are you a new Stand user?!

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.310
I'll make you realize 
that you're already dead!

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.980
What?

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.310
This isn't any Stand ability!

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.780
This is proof that all that's here is the 
completely black soul of a dead killer!

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.770
Well? Do you remember how you died now?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.130
Even if I stop time right now, 
I'm too far away from him.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.880
Don't let him push the switch!

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.070
No, this is the limit! I'm pushing it...

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.880
Now!

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.350
Act Three! 3 Freeze! 
He's now within five meters!

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.780
S-h-i-t!

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.160
You rotten pieces of shit!

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.410
Star Platinum! The World!

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.880
Koichi, you truly are a reliable guy.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.380
I'm truly thankful that I came 
to this town and met you.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.720
And...

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.700
Good grief.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.530
I made it in time.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.750
Time has begun to move again.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.740
Crush

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.960
H-He did it!

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.550
He made it in time!

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.630
I'll push it... I'm gonna push it...

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.820
Bites the Dust will go into effect again...

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.690
H-How? He just suddenly went flying back!

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.410
I'm gonna push it... I-I'm gonna push it...

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.790
I'm gonna push the switch right now...

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.370
I know he's our enemy, 
but he really is something.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.300
Hey, stop!

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.610
Stop!

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.910
Morioh Fire Department

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.620
Someone's on the ground back here!

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:35.880
What?!

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.940
O-Oh, no! A guy's been 
run over by an ambulance!

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.610
I didn't realize he was there!

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.710
Drive back forward! Forward!

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.520
You there! Get outside of the tape!

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.610
Get back! Please hurry and get back!

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.410
Are you one of the injured, too?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.040
It's no use. He's dead. He died instantly.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.750
He's dead?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.650
It was like he dove under there himself.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.470
This is my responsibility.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.760
I'm not trying to make excuses, but I 
didn't have a chance to restrain him.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.760
This is unbelievable.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.410
His head was caught between 
the tire and the road...

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.660
The skin on his face has been ripped off.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.270
Pardon me.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.020
Do you happen to know the 
identity of the deceased?

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.780
He said that his name was Yoshikage Kira.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.210
Kira...

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.420
There's a family by the name of Kira 
in Kotodai that goes back generations.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.580
I heard its only current member lives alone, 
so he might not have any family...

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.580
An accident... His demise was 
due to an accidental death.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.590
But this is how it should be.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.780
There would be no way to punish him in court.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.340
This was the best outcome.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.100
I... didn't actually get along 
with my dad that well...

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.300
But my dad was murdered by him.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.100
I wanted him punished.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.340
I wanted someone to punish him.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.970
It looks like you remember, Yoshikage Kira...

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.000
The exact way you died.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.330
It looks like you remember now!

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.830
Just what are you?! Who the hell are you?!

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.000
Fifteen years ago, you didn't 
have a Stand ability,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.820
so you couldn't make corpses disappear.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.590
That's why, when I died, 
it was in all the papers.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.360
Do you remember this wound on my back?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.350
Or, since it was your first murder, 
you forgot to take my hand,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.230
so perhaps I wasn't as memorable?!

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.980
It's you...

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.240
I believe your name was Reimi Sugimoto...

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.570
What the hell have you been 
doing here for fifteen years?!

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.400
Wait...

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.430
Why would you go to the 
trouble of showing me

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.240
the wound on your back and 
telling me who you are?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.530
This wouldn't be the place where you're 
not supposed to turn around, is it?

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:27.750
My father told me that there was a road in 
this town where spirits of the dead walk,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.590
and if you were to find yourself there, 
you must not turn around.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.550
If you were to turn around, 
an uncontrollable power

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.300
would drag you off somewhere.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.680
You weren't showing me

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.670
the wound on your back so 
I'd end up in front of you,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.530
forcing me to turn around, were you?

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.910
You weren't trying to trick me, were you?

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.310
Let's have you turn around.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.970
I'd like to see what would happen.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.010
Come on! Turn around!

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.260
<i>You</i> will turn around!

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.820
Did you really think

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.850
that I didn't expect you to try to do this to me?

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.750
We've been waiting fifteen 
years for you to come here...

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.350
"We"?

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.060
Arnold!

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.200
What?!

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.780
Now, let's have you punished, Yoshikage Kira.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.330
What? What are these things?!

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.830
Deadly Queen!

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.160
Make these things explode!

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.130
I-I...

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.930
Wh-Where are they going to take me?

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.260
Who knows?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.390
But...

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.540
I'm sure it's somewhere you 
won't be able to rest in peace.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.710
Now,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.460
we can finally...

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.810
We can finally go...

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.020
Help Wanted

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.020
Reimi! Are you really leaving?

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.020
It wouldn't hurt if you stayed 
a little longer, would it?

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.860
It feels like this town's 
losing its guardian angel...

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.610
It makes me uneasy, 
knowing that you're leaving.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:51.910
Thanks... But there's nothing 
left for us to do in this town.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.590
The time has come for us to leave this town.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.270
We have to go.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.080
Or what? Are you going to cry when I leave

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.050
because you'll miss me, Rohan?

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.540
Don't be stupid.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:13.550
Kisara
Drugs

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.930
Why would I miss you?

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.340
You already died fifteen years ago.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.320
I said this before, but I still 
believe that ghosts should give up

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:20.020
whatever attachments they have left 
here, and just hurry up and pass on.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.880
Oh, fine! Since this is the 
last time, I'll be honest!

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.820
I will miss you!

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.440
Of course I don't want you to go!

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.790
Hey.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.290
Josuke! Everyone!

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.710
So it's finally over, Reimi.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.730
Yukako! Hazamada, and everyone else!

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.470
We came to see you off.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:57.050
Everyone...

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.710
I know it's strange to say this 
to a dead person, but take care.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.810
I'm going to miss you, too.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.480
You're a wonderful young lady.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.880
Reimi! Thank you for everything!

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.820
Because of you, this town was saved!

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.650
Thanks, Koichi.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.250
But I believe we all saved Morioh together.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:32.130
I'm sure that no one here 
will ever forget you.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.290
Thank you, everyone.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.640
Goodbye, everyone.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.930
Goodbye, Reimi.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.430
Goodbye...

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.660
He's awfully late tonight...

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.960
I wonder if he had to work overtime.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.160
He could call, at least...

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:08.420
Oh, Hayato.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.740
You go on and eat before it gets cold.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.300
I'll eat when your father gets home.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.360
Hayato?

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.310
I'll wait, too...

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.920
I'll eat with you

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.350
when Dad gets home, too...

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.690
You sure?

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.770
By the way, have you gotten 
a little taller lately?

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.420
Our town, Morioh, was deeply hurt.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.290
The town was hurt by the 
monster named Yoshikage Kira

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.420
that this town itself had created.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.800
I'm sure that Hayato's mom

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.010
will forever be waiting 
for her husband to return.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.390
Shigechi's parents will forever 
be waiting for him to return.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.450
The families of the daughters and 
sisters killed by Yoshikage Kira

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.140
will forever be waiting for their return.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.880
The pain of their wounds 
will now only get deeper.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.610
How can we try to ease this pain?

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:21.150
Will it be life-threatening for this town's 
future, or will it eventually disappear?

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.050
I have no idea.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.230
Are you worried, Jotaro?

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.220
About leaving this town?

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.050
Yeah, a little.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.780
After watching Josuke and the others 
get involved in this incident in Morioh,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.800
there's one thing that I can say...

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:47.430
That the young people in 
this town have hearts of gold.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.430
The same hearts of gold shining with justice

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.460
that we saw when we headed to Egypt.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.000
I saw that within Josuke and the others...

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.700
As long as they have that, they'll be fine.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.780
We won't have to worry 
about this town any longer.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.910
Hey, Old Man!

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.540
Can't you hear me, Old Man?

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:16.510
Now, then... I guess I should say 
goodbye to the son I'm so proud of.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.880
The picture of my mom 
that I just gave you...

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.660
You still got it?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.360
Yes. I put it in my wallet, 
just as you asked.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.350
I'm leaving without seeing your mother, 
but I wish her nothing but happiness.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.200
Ah... So you put it in your wallet...

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.650
This is the edge of that picture.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.110
Shining Diamond!

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.370
I'll be taking this!

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:50.960
A dad should give his son an allowance, right?

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.540
Not to mention, if you take 
that picture back home,

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.470
your old lady's gonna get mad at you again!

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.470
Y-You little brat...

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:02.930
You gonna take back what you said about 
him having a heart of gold, old man?

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.430
Take care!

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.690
The invisible baby's 
mother was never found,

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.900
and the baby ended up being 
adopted by Joseph Joestar.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.840
Jotaro Kujo got his doctorate 
from a thesis he wrote

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.660
while he was here about a 
starfish he saw on the beach.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.950
Josuke, that jerk!

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.960
He ate the snack I was 
saving for myself again!

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.170
Ugh!

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.040
I'm gonna drink his juice.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.130
Koichi!

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.510
Sorry!

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.080
I was late because I was making us lunch.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.100
Huh? You made us lunch? Thanks!

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.040
I can't wait to eat it.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.280
So good!

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.950
Whew

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.710
Oh, here it comes! Yeah! That intensity!

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.790
You might be able to turn 
back to normal, Dad!

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.880
Well, whatever.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.950
My skin is so soft!

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.300
My eyes feel so refreshed!

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.410
The food here was amazing!

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.360
Right? Even I look so much more 
beautiful that I don't know what

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.010
I'm going to do with myself.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.940
You're shining, Yu.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.490
So shiny!

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.940
You think so?

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.320
I'm shiny, eh?

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.840
Grazie!

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.820
I look forward to your next visit.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.280
I just saw Ko holding hands 
with a really pretty girl!

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.290
Huh? What does that mean? 
He hasn't told me anything!

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.150
Did you hear about 
Mr. Kira who went missing?

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.350
I did! You mean how he turned 
up as a faceless corpse, right?

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.470
That's so scary...

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.280
What are you gonna do about it?

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.300
Wha?

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.000
I'm telling you that juice 
sprayed out from the can

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.500
you kicked and got all over my manga!

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.310
That's not my problem!

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.890
One, two, three, four, five, 
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.000
All right. Warm-up exercises done.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.270
Shonen Jump

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.270
Thanks for waiting!
Serialization Returns!

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.510
Is it really so interesting to 
look at the town all the time?

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.590
Nothing ever changes.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.400
It is.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.240
This town is very interesting.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:23:03.940
And so, for most people, the summer 
of 1999 passed like any other summer.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.320
Hey, did you hear?

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.360
Apparently, Rohan was caught 
shoplifting at Kame Yu.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.320
What?!

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.360
That's insane if it's true.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.300
Yeah, but I'm not really sure.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.460
You aren't even sure?

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.760
Jeez... Well, let's go.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.980
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.980
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.980
End
