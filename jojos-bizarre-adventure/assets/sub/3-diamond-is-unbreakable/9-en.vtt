00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.450
Hey, apparently Koichi's 
family doesn't know, either.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.360
They were talking about 
possibly calling the police.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.610
So he is missing. And since 
Yukako isn't here, either...

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.300
I sort of feel responsible.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.860
You don't think he's dead, do you?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.260
Nah, I doubt she's gone that far yet.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.440
She must be keeping him somewhere.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.840
We need to find him, and fast.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.960
This might end up being 
a life or death situation.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.620
It won't open!

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.210
This is awful!

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.710
Q.
What year did Columbus
discover the new continent?
The answer is the lock's combination.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.100
It was also a movie title, wasn't it?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.480
But it looked really long, 
so I didn't watch it.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.790
I've almost got it...

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.240
1, 4, 0, 0...

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.240
Um...

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.930

Episode 9  Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 2

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.210
I washed your underwear and 
your pajama pants for you.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.050
What's wrong?

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.490
I won't know if you don't say anything.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.080
I-I'm a first-year in high school...

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.160
This is just the worst.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.690
This goes beyond being embarrassed.
I feel like an awful human being.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.040
Please, stop this already.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.190
You hate me now, don't you?

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.010
You think I'm pathetic, don't you?

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.420
Just let me go home already.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.060
What could you possibly like 
about me, after I peed my pants?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.390
Oh, you poor thing, Koichi.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.380
I must be tormenting your heart.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.400
I'm a bad girl.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.230
Nothing I say does any good!

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.770
I-I can feel tears starting to well up...

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.890
First I wet my pants, and now 
I'm getting wet with tears?

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.810
But Koichi...

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.770
After saying that you're 
an awful human being,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.860
I can see something shining, something 
invigorating, deep in your eyes.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.590
Like you still have a trump 
card hidden up your sleeve.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.410
That's what I like about you.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.150
I would love to see what that is.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.730
And if it belongs to someone you love,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.580
there's nothing wrong with 
even poop or snot, right?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.730
It's strange that you'd even worry.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.360
I felt true bliss while I was washing your pants.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.010
Look!

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.700
I'm working on a chair that has 
electricity running through it.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.530
I'll make sure it's done by dinner study time.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.490
I'm thinking about making Italian for dinner.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.900
I should go buy some olive oil.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.120
Look forward to it.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.040
H-Help me!

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.640
She's just getting worse!

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.200
I have to hurry and escape,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.970
o-or she's seriously going to kill me!

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.310
But...

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.800
How am I going to escape?

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.490
Koichi's got Reverb, though.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.780
With that thing, he can still call for 
help even if he's being gagged, right?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.660
But Reverb's range is about 50 meters.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.470
He might've been taken to a place 
where no one else lives nearby.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.020
There are tons of places like that.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.420
Wait!

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.880
She said she was going 
to buy some olive oil.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.980
But I can't imagine her going out 
shopping in this situation.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.060
Is she going to order by phone, then?

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.010
Could it be...

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.050
There it is! A pay phone!

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.190
48 meters! Yes!

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.510
It's just within my range!

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.380
Reverb is a sound Stand!

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.910
Now I can signal Josuke for help.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.870
I don't have any 10 yen coins!

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.850
I was wearing pajamas 
when I was brought here.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.740
Should I dial 110?

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.160
But that woman might 
actually kill the police.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.720
I'm just going to have to
contact Josuke somehow!

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.760
You were wondering if there was 
a pay phone nearby, weren't you?

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.780
Y-Yukako...

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.220
I know exactly what you're thinking.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.080
You heard me say that I was 
going to get some olive oil,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.220
so there must be a pay phone nearby.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.380
But even if you were to get to it, 
you don't have any 10 yen coins.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.980
That's what you were thinking, right?

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.240
I-Is there a pay phone?

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.750
Hmph. Playing dumb, I see.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.900
You should abandon the idea 
of trying to call someone.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.250
You wont be able to set
foot outside of this house.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.760
Just in case, I'm going to go destroy 
the 110 button on the phone.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.730
Is there anything that you'd like?

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.010
N-No, not really...

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.100
Wh-What is wrong with her?!

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.080
I guess it's no use... I can't contact anyone...

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.060
Beep
Boop
Beep
Boop
Beep

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.320
What are these letters?

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.540
There's suddenly sound 
coming from my hand...

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.340
It's calling somewhere!

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.120
I haven't even dialed the phone number yet.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.220
Hello? This is Higashikata.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.840
It connected!

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.310
As long as the call sounds go through, 
calls on those phones will be connected.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.980
Hello, is this Koichi? 
Hey! It's me, Josuke!

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.900
Koichi, where are you?

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.900
What? I can hear the sound of waves...

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.800
Koichi, you...

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.160
You have a power like I do, don't you?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.500
Yes! Now Josuke will definitely come here!

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.590
It'll only take 15 to 20 minutes by car.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.520
I just have to survive until then!

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.420
N-No matter what!

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.110
The sound of waves... A pay phone...

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.370
The place Koichi is...

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.710
It's gotta be here!

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.470
Koichi.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.060
Koichi!

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.080
She's coming back!

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.060
I-I've got no choice but to fight!

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.040
Open the door, Koichi.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.190
Wh-Why don't you just break the door down?

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.090
If Josuke sees a broken door, 
he'll definitely think something's wrong.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.980
I'm very happy right now.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.320
I'm so happy that you have 
powers like I do, Koichi.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.220
Though it pisses me off that 
you were hiding that from me.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.190
But I'm still very happy.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.890
Because the most important thing for 
a man and a woman living together

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.040
is love, and having the same 
goals and values, right?

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.330
We have something in common 
that no one else has.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.850
We have the ultimate compatibility.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.890
So please, Koichi...

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.320
Open the door.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.090
I told you to open the door. 
Hurry up and open the door!

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.260
I hate you

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.310
I hate you

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.820
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.590
Th-The ultimate compatibility?!

00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:11.420
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.620
Can't you tell how much 
I don't want to be here?!

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.510
That sound won't go away until you cry, 
apologize, and give up on me.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.420
What is this? I don't hear any of this.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.300
I hate you—

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.050
Huh?!

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.450
Th-This is...

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.710
nothing like that time with Tamami.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.880
Her delusions are way too strong!

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.310
I had no idea sh-she'd be this stubborn...

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.330
I finally found out that we've 
been bound by the one

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.190
and only red thread in this world.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.510
Some people never find it at all.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.330
Don't you understand how wonderful that is?

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.350
Koichi...

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.950
I was going to try to make you into a fine man,

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.130
but now things are different.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.510
I won't let you leave this house
until you fall in love with me.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.180
I will make you love me!

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.070
Or else...

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.490
I might just kill you.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.530
I can't let her in here, no matter what...

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.030
I need to attack her with 
Reverb one more time!

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.370
If I try harder, I'll be able to 
produce a louder sound than before.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.690
Reverb!

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.020
Something's wrong with Reverb...

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.450
Reverb!

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.290
It's not moving!

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.470
D-Did it die?

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.000
Did my Stand die of utter despair?

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.170
Reverb is dead!

My Reverb isn't moving at all!

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.070
Stands use mental ability to move.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:06.380
I pushed it too far, and then it 
got too worked up and died!

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.580

Wh-What is that?

It's called a "Stand"?

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.370
What is that Stand?

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.380
This shoe cabinet is in my way!

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.260
I-I'm going to be killed!

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.760
If she comes in the door and catches me,
then sooner or later, I'll be killed!

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.770
Open up, Koichi!

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.020
Don't come through that door!

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.660
If only that door would blow her far away...

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.620
It's gone! It's just an empty shell.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.910
Where did you put it?

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.630
Huh?

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.480
I'm asking what happened 
to the thing inside that!

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.250
Huh?!

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.220
i-isn't dead!

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.000
Did it emerge from its old
shell into a new form?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.100
What is this?

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.230
The design's only changed 
a little, and it shrank.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.150
Just changing its shape 
won't make any difference!

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.150
I-It's fast!

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.160
Wh-What is

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.390
this wind?!

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.330
Bam

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.210
Sh-She got blown away!

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.460
I'm not sure how, but she just got 
blown away by something like wind!

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.210
Wh-What just...

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.330
happened to me?

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.920
Reverb's letters are on the door...

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.300
Fwoosh

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.180
Fwoosh

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.520
Because she touched the door with 
these words on it, they became real.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.020
Fwoosh

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.550
The sensation of "Fwoosh"
actually blew her away.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.540
Earlier, I wished this door would blow her away...

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.620
I guess I was unknowingly controlling it.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.260
This is the new Reverb!

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.650
Reverb Act 2!

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.330
Koichi...

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.670
Teioh

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.670
It's those two...

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.220
If it's a place near the sea with 
a lot of uninhabited houses,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.950
it has to be this area with all the villas.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.180
But there are, like, dozens of villas around here.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.890
We can't tell which one it is.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.810
We have to find the pay phone!
Koichi called us from one.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:47.300
Let's find the pay phone first and
then look at the houses near it.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.290
Yeah.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.410
Cute little Koichi belongs to me.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.970
I won't let anyone else have him.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.010
You probably shouldn't come any closer, Yukako.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.330
I can tell for myself

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.140
that you can't beat my Reverb Act 2's abilities.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.340
You won't be able to keep me here.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.590
My left eyelid is starting to twitch.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.880
Ever since I was little,
my orbicularis oculi muscle would

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.740
start twitching when I got worked up,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.120
and I'd start to feel a bit violent.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.920
Don't you get up on your high horse just because

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.200
you've obtained a slightly different ability!

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.540
I'm going to have to get violent now!

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.200
Hot!

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.880
H-How dare you?!

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.260
My hand got burnt! You little shit!

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.680
When you said you were going to get violent,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.140
did you mean how you're talking right now?

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.200
How dare you do this to me?!

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.770
You're just a baby chick!

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.250
You belong to me!

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.270
You belong to me, but you dare defy me?!

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.030
Even though you belong to me?!

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.030
Reverb Act 2!

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.400
I missed?

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.790
Hey, Josuke.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.080
I heard it.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.290
That was the sound of something breaking.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.970
Hey, I think it's that house.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.210
T-To think that her hair
would grow this much...

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.300
Her mental ability is too strong.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.300
Mental ability that's completely 
black and vindictive...

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.670
Was yours called Reverb?

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.930
Now that I know what it does,
it's not impressive at all.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.210
I just need to make sure I don't
touch those letters, right?

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.150
By the way, I'll ask you one more time...

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.400
You love me, right?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.880
Just try to say that you don't love me.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.160
I'll rip you and this house
apart right here, right now.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.280
If you die, you'll be mine forever,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.580
because you'll live on in my 
heart as a memory forever.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.090
Hurry up and answer me!

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:13.410
I'm in this mess right now because

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.720
you wouldn't understand when I told you.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.420
I've been telling you that I don't like you

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.200
all this time.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.060
I'll kill you, Koichi!

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.710
Dogon

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.000
I've also already told you

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.340
that you won't be able to catch me.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.620
You've touched the letters 
that will blow you away.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.410
Those letters are on me,
the one you called a little shit.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.590
Her hair turned white!

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.650
She's not dead, is she?

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.850
She's alive!

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.970
Even though she's crazy and downright nasty,

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.550
I suppose I should be happy about this.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.670
I wasn't able to catch you...

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.170
But I figured out that all I need 
to do is destroy your Stand!

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.030
Impudent brat!

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.500
Dumbass!

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.850
I-I can't believe you can still attack...

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.630
Your mental ability is insane!

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.010
Shut up!

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:45.140
How dare you, you little pissy-pants?!

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.840
How dare you do this to me?!

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.730
My precious hair turned white,

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.150
you limp-dicked bastard!

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.990
I loved you!

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.490
But I can't forgive you for 
doing this to my beautiful hair!

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.650
I don't care who you are! I won't 
forgive you if you harm my beauty!

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:15.350
I'm gonna rip off this pissy-pants' little dick
and pull out his organs along with it!

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.750
S-Stop...

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.960
Shut up!

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.130
You're gonna end up like 
that, too, aren't you?!

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.100
What? What was that noise just now?

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.630
Let go of my Reverb and grab hold of something.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.110
The cliff is going to crumble.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.330
When Reverb heard the sound of your heart,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.410
it also heard the sound 
of the ground cracking.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.570
Hah! Don't make up shit just 
because you think it'll save you!

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.920
I have to let go of this thing 
and grab on to something!

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.840
Damn it!

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.840
I-I don't have... time!

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.420
Boingy-Boing

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.770
Boingy-Boing

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.270
It crumbled, just like I said, right?

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:21.010
But you don't understand 
anything I say, do you?

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.420
You mean you had written it there already?

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.260
When I was trying to rip Reverb apart...

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.560
You put those letters on 
that rock beneath the cliff?

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.540
You mean that while I was 
trying to kill Koichi,

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.300
he was already trying to 
think of how to save me?

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.400
I-I've lost completely.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:56.570
No, I lost the moment I first saw Koichi.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.680
Hey, Koichi! Are you alive?

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.280
Are you all right, Koichi?!

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.030
Josuke! Okuyasu!

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.040
Took you long enough to get here! Jeez!

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:15.300
B-But I love him even more now.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.260
I don't care if he completely ignores me.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.470
I'm happy just thinking

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.310
about you, Koichi!

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:28.610
Hey, look over there! Is that Yukako?

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.560
Her hair's gone completely white!

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.060
Whoa, you're right.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:37.060
But isn't that chick smiling like 
she couldn't be any happier?

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.760
And she's looking right this way.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.480
Huh?!

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.070
You're right. That's creepy as hell.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.990
Let's get outta here!

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.800
Save me, Josuke!

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.570
Don't depend on me!

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.710
Well, I'll be damned. 
Did you see that, Masaji?

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.860
I ain't drunk, Gramps!

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:11.090

Directions: Ask one of the local fishermen, "Where's Cape Boingy-Boing?"
They will kindly take you there by boat.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.100
Boingy-Boing Cape.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.230
It seems it grew famous due to a rumor

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:06.010
that some fishermen saw a 
young girl try to kill herself,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.270
only for a rock in the cape to go
"boingy-boing" and gently fling her back.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.350
Hirose!

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.060
You worked really hard on this exam.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.280

know how I should feel about this.
