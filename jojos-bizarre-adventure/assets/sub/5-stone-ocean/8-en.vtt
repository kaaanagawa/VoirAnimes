00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.970
You three, don't take another step!

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.140
Step away from the water!

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.930
Don't try to pull anything on us.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.270
I know one of you did this!

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.980
Did what?

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.530
The one who killed the guard
and tried to drown us!

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.110
I know it's one of you!

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.410
We really need to figure out who snuck in,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.330
or we're all toast!

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.950
What are you talking about?

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.330
I said don't move.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.170
Atroe said she didn't recognize you.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.300
What about you two?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.590
Do you recall seeing her from the start?

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.140
I don't recall your faces either.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.730
Come on, you know I've been here
right from the start.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.940
I don't remember your face.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.850
Hey!

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.900
No one remembers you either, bitch.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.690
I'm the one who called help
over the radio just now.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.400
You could be trying to trick us.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.530
Wait a second.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.160
You, with the black hair.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.120
You've got a nosebleed.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.870
What the…

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.080
I couldn't see well, but…

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.580
Ermes, when I punched
the enemy Stand earlier,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340
someone almost collapsed.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.510
Step back.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.170
Stand away from the water.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.130
Hold on, you've got it all wrong!

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.510
This bitch punched my face just now!

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.970
Look at her! She's bleeding too.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.560
What the hell?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.860
Her tooth scratched my arm!

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.110
I was definitely here
right from the start.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.110
The culprit is one of these two!

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.700
Listen, I remember what happened
with that alligator warden!

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.120
You're the one who heckled the warden!

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.620
She did do that.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.120
You guys are just as suspicious…

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.790
Jolyne!

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.260
Was it this bitch that attacked us?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.390
How did you figure it out?

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.720
Well, to be honest,
I have no clue who the killer is.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.560
So I'll just beat you all up!

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.740
I was going to finish you off
one by one in the water.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.120
Who would've guessed

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.580
she had a thread ability

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.830
and would survive the attack?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.340
Just what are these people?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.510

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.170

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.050
You're wrong.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.320
One Stand User

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.490
for each Stand ability.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.030
The women who were here from the start

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.450
were the black-haired
and the shaved-head one.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.210
I finished them off
because they approached the tractor.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.670
I then took over their body and mind.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.470
This body, I created it…

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.060
using the missing inmates' flesh!

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.770

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.740
F.F. 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.160
The black sludge
is gathering from those two.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.120 line:20%
The divided parts of me
have now formed into one.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.500
For the ability and the intellect
Whitesnake's discs have enabled me,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.260
I will protect myself at any cost.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.430
It is my duty

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.140
to eliminate those
who approach the storage shed.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.390
Dammit.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.810
Where is the Stand User?

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.600
You're misunderstanding it, Ermes.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.230
He is the Stand User himself.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.310
What?

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.030
He is an organism.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.320
He is a living creature

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.700
who received life and power
through the discs.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.160
The guard of the discs wasn't human.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.990
A living creature?

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.460
<i>You mean, that conglomeration</i>
<i>of those tiny things?</i>

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.670
It must be using the water
in the bodies of its victims

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.670
to move on land and guard the shed.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.800
It stays on land
by dividing and multiplying.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.930
However, as a car needs gasoline,

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.890
it needs water to live.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.810
To acquire the discs,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.980
we need to keep this creature
out of the water and defeat it!

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.360
But Jolyne,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.740
how can a tiny water flea-like thing talk?

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.410
Foo Fighters

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.620
Call me by my name!

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.870
An astronomer named Fred Hoyle once said,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.460
<i>"It is probabilistically wrong to assume</i>
<i>that life was born spontaneously on Earth.</i>

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.010
<i>The power of intellect</i>
<i>already existed in this universe,</i>

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.550
and it created the origin of life."

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.520
Meaning intellect existed
long before the Big Bang,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.900
and all substances and organisms
already possessed intellect.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.610
What is he blabbering on about?

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.610
He's trying to say that humans
are not the only ones with intellect.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.740
Even plankton have a memory--

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.200 line:20%
I told you to call me Foo Fighters!

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.040
I am a being
of superior intellect than you!

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.040
This is bad.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.330
He's trying to hide the discs
before we can get to them.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.800
<i>If he buries them underground,</i>
<i>we'll never be able to find them!</i>

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.970
Jolyne, we're in trouble here.
Look behind you.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.810
That's the creature
that attacked us from the water.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.100
He's trying to drag the guard's body.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.060
Remember the bracelet?

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.150
We must stay within 50 meters of it.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.900
It's over, Jolyne.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.570
Let's give up on the discs.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.400
We must get the guard's body!

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.820
The bracelet will explode.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.830
I'll leave the bracelet to you, Ermes.

you protect the guard's body

I just have to carry him

Water.

You sure absorb water like a tampon.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.290 line:20%
Or should I say,
a drop of water in a desert?

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.170
Shut up! You're in the way!

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.130
Scram!

Jolyne.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.100
We need to dehydrate it.

You made it in time.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.250
Either way, I will kill you two.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.470
I was planning to ask you questions
after hiding these discs.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.090
But very well.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.010
Let me ask you this.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.930
Will you jump into the puddle?

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.890
Or will you try to run?

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.600
Which death do you prefer?

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.440
I have questions as well.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.740
Do you know the one behind all this?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.490
Is it Whitesnake?

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.660
Also,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.700
what is his aim and reason
for collecting the discs?

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.830
How interesting.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.120
I understand the logic behind an
attack made in order to protect yourself.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.460
And fighting to protect your friends,

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.090
I can't relate,
but it's also within reason.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:06.550
However, I don't understand
why you'd come here to die.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.600
Well, as for Whitesnake,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.600
I've never seen him, I don't know his face.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.780
You thought I was distracted, you fool?

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.990
These puddles are already a part of me!

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.120
Did you plan to break this bag of flour

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.330
and absorb water?

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.840
Either way,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.710
I fully understand my ability

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.720
and have created
the optimal environment for myself.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.970
It may not be so bad

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.890
to use your body as a host for a while.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.020
No.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.930
You've already lost.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:13:00.900
This environment you've created
by spilling water everywhere…

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.480
It will lead to your defeat.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:15.290
You didn't even hear me
start the tractor using my threads.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.920
The sound was drowned by the water.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.750
You got distracted with killing me.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.840
And now, you've failed to guard the discs.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.880

The dirt in the field

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.580 line:20%
Water is getting absorbed from its body.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.250
And there won't be water at the end point!

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.800
I won't let you lay
a single finger on those discs--

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.380
Jolyne won this battle of wits.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.390
The discs don't belong to you anymore.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.970
You're finished!

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.140
Dry up and become feed for the crops!

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.150
Jolyne.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.920
Jolyne, what the hell are you doing?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.330
I'll give it water.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.840
Let's just say,

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.920
I'm saving it.

Foo Fighters

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.300
He wasn't guarding the discs
out of loyalty to Whitesnake.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.850
I know that now.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.680
Though it knows its body will wither away,

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.890
it chased after the discs.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.940
It was guarding the discs
to protect its own existence.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.280
The discs gave it ability and intellect.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:14.160
It risked his life for the gratitude
it has, to be able to exist.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.120
It couldn't care less about Whitesnake.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.580
Hey, you want to save it?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.290
It killed five people!

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.380
And it's literally not human!

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.710
Even if it's not human,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.470
It's not the one at fault.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.890
Whitesnake is the evil one.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.640
Whitesnake only gave it the information
that would allow him to take advantage.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.730
What?

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.400
And I have another reason
for saving its life.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.360
I want to make a deal with you.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.780
These discs, I want you to keep them safe.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.780
But do it for us.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.870
Keep them out of Whitesnake's hands.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.500
My intention is not to take
those discs from you.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.670
I only want my father's discs back.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.630
And I want to know
what Whitesnake is scheming to do.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.470
Well? Will you help us?

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.470
But no more killing humans.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:18.890
Dammit.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.470
You really are something.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.400
I don't quite understand your feelings,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.690
but I no longer feel like fighting.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.440

So the discs really
were stored in the tire!

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.600
We finally found them!

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.470
This is Star Platinum!

Jolyne!

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.480
Are you okay? Hey!

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.690
I have no doubt about it.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.860
This is Star Platinum's disc.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.570
My father, Jotaro Kujo,
can be resuscitated with it.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.620
It's finally in my hand!

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.790
But I don't see his memory disc.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.960
Where could it be?

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:29.250
Hey.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.170
If I jump out of that window,
do you think I'll die?

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.090
Come on, it's just me.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.010
It's me!

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.810
Foo Fighters, just call me that.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.560
I recovered whatever remained of her.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.980
I wore another inmate's bracelet.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.610
I want to use this body
as a host for a while.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.570
This finger is useless, though.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.240
Take over her life?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.160
You mean,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.870
you'll live in her cell as a prisoner?

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.370
Jolyne,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.750
I want to protect you.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:18.630
According to the memory in this body,
her name is Atroe.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.140
Inmate number FE39423.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.770
Her childhood dream was to get kidnapped.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.730
But when she grew up,
she was the one that kidnapped a child.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.150
She wasn't after the ransom.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.980
She just lived out her dream
in a different way.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.980
What the…

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.150
Your arms are bleeding.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.160
Do they hurt?

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.700
But I can't heal them.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.540
-What the hell?
-Gross!

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.040
Water!

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:01.930
You might want to wait
on going inside the prison.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.010
How about practicing
drinking from a cup first?

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.390
A cup?

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.020
That's a piece of cake!

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.440
Drinking from a cup is nothing.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.810
Gross.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.440
Hey, I wanted to ask you about Whitesnake.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.940
Does he come to this shed often?

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.530
No, he barely swings by.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.410
I've never seen his user either.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.120
The discs stored here
are the ones he doesn't use.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.460
No matter how strong the Stand,

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.000
the body rejects the disc
if you're incompatible.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.010
So all the discs are
the ones he cannot use.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.970
He must have another hiding place
for the important ones.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.140
And that's why

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.970
the memory disc you're seeking
isn't in this pile.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.810
What he really wanted from your father

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.440
wasn't an invincible Stand ability

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.270
but his memory.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.530
It must be one hell of a secret.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.150
Secret…

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.820
The guards are here.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.240
What are you going to do, Jolyne?

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.540
You have the Star Platinum disc.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.960
My next step

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.840
is to deliver this to the foundation

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.170
treating my father.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.670
If I don't resuscitate him soon,

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.010
his body will begin to rot.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.180
And I'll find his memory disc

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.970
no matter what it takes.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.270
Can you deliver it outside of this prison?

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.350
It's harder to get things
out of here than in.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.400
And the guards will soon
conduct a body check.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.150
Let me see that disc for a sec.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.530
I'll just make my boobs a bit bigger.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.540
Ta-da.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.040
F.F., raise your hands or you'll get shot.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.960
Ermes, you too.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.470
The guard was attacked by a crocodile.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.800
We saved him.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.100
We don't know what happened
to the other inmates.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.560
That's the story we're sticking to, okay?

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.410
She was just bait.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.370
Jolyne was just bait to attract Jotaro.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.670
I believed she would be harmless.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.500 line:20%
Jolyne Cujoh.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.170 line:20%
Did she defeat the guard
by herself and take the discs?

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.590
Could it be that the surviving inmates

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.510
aided Jolyne?

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.600
Hey, it's already sundown.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.060
You must return to the prison soon.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.360
Are you that worried
about the missing inmates,

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.280
Father Pucci?

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.870
A moment, please.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.950
I will be staying here
until I give the sacrament on Sunday.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:33.450
Although you think I cope

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:38.450
My head is filled with hope

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:47.400
Of some place other than here

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.450
Although you think I smile

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:58.650
Inside and all the while

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:07.450
I'm wondering about my destiny

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:13.800
I'm thinking about

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.550
All the things

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.350
I'd like to do

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:28.100
In my life

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.850
I'm a dreamer

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.750
A distant dreamer

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:43.550
Dreaming far away

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.200
From today
