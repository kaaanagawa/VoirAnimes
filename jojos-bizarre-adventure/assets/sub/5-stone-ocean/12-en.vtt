00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.400
<i>Who is he?</i>

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.190
<i>She's Jolyne Cujoh!</i>

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.320
<i>Not Lang Rangler!</i>

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.120
<i>Should I assume that he failed,</i>
<i>and she's the one with the disc?</i>

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.950
<i>In a matter of minutes,</i> <i>her ally will come</i>
<i>and get the disc at the courtyard.</i>

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.040
He's the chaplain of this prison.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.170
Why is he here now?

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130
<i>She knows who I am.</i>

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.140
<i>No, she would've already attacked me</i>
<i>if she knew I was her enemy.</i>

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.140
Wait! Please, Father!

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.850
Please…

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.970
Don't sound the alarm!

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.350
I'm not here to cause any trouble!

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.020
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.190
<i>It would be easy to beat him unconscious.</i>

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.480
<i>That's nothing</i>
<i>compared to my father's life.</i>

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.320
<i>Hitting him is nothing…</i>

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.990
There is already a problem.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.500
You unlocked the door
using another inmate's work permit.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.790
Where is the owner of this permit,
the inmate, Lang Rangler?

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.630
I know I just met you,
and I don't expect you to believe me.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.590
But I'm no liar, Father.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.220
That inmate attacked me.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.100
It was self-defense.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.060
He's passed out in that basket over there.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.270
I must report this to the authorities.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.690
I understand, Father.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.650
But it has to be
after I go to the courtyard.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.240
I only need two minutes…

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.860
No, give me just a single minute, Father.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.240
I must go to the courtyard.
That's all I ask.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.620
You want me to turn a blind eye?

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.960
It's a matter of life and death.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.960
My father's life and soul depend on it.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.380
A man of God should understand.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.170
Are you here by yourself?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.090
Is there anyone else with you?

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.060
No, I'm alone.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.180
<i>I lied to a chaplain.</i>

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.270
<i>But surely, a small lie can be forgiven.</i>

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.020
<i>And I can't tell him about the disc.</i>

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.820
Please.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.650
I only need a minute.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.530
Doing something for others
is all an act of expecting a reward.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.290
To be kind to others
is to be kind to oneself.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.500
There is no such thing as
unconditional love.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.710
Because unconditional love

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.210
is a reward to go to heaven.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.460
You may go.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.760
I will pretend I didn't see you here.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.470
But only a minute as requested.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.640
You have to come back
to this gate by then.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.690
<i>I have no choice.</i>

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.820
<i>Someone is hiding behind that container.</i>

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.900
<i>If she has an ally with her,</i>

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.650
<i>I can't reveal myself.</i>

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.780
<i>I can't expose Whitesnake and kill Jolyne.</i>

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.750

There may be a way to go to heaven.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.660
<i>He was young and beautiful,</i>

<i>Studying at a religious seminary.</i>

Hey, don't make a face.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.720
I'm not talking about death.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.310
The heaven I'm talking about
pertains to our spirits.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.230
The place our spirits are headed.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.100
The power of our mind
must surely evolve there.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.650
And ultimately where our spirits end up.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.240
Surely, you understand
what I'm talking about more than anyone.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.990

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.370
can't be obtained by having
the mightiest body, the most money,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.080
or the highest status.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.000
True victory

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.420
belongs to those who have seen heaven.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.890
I will do everything to reach that end.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.560
How does one reach heaven?

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.180
I've recorded it in a notebook.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.520
Come visit Egypt sometime.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.440
I will show you then.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.480
I will need your help

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.570

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360
<i>However,</i>

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.910
<i>before I learned of his methods…</i>

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.080
<i>his notebook was burned to ashes.</i>

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.840
<i>The one who burned it</i>
<i>was Jolyne Cujoh's father,</i>

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.590
<i>Jotaro Kujo.</i>

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.840
<i>Jotaro read the contents of that notebook.</i>

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.300
<i>And he sealed its contents forever</i>

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.310
<i>along with Dio Brando</i>
<i>who aimed for heaven.</i>

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.900
<i>I laid in wait for over two decades</i>

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.900
<i>to gain access to Jotaro Kujo's memory.</i>

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.190
<i>The contents of the notebook</i>
<i>are within his memory.</i>

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.870
<i>And I finally obtained his memory</i>

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.200
<i>along with Star Platinum,</i>
<i>which surpassed Dio.</i>

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.920
<i>And now, Jotaro's body will only decay.</i>

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.710
<i>Though his daughter has acted</i>
<i>quite unpredictably at this prison,</i>

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.430
<i>my plan is back on schedule.</i>

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.180
<i>She got shot!</i>

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.810
<i>Jolyne got shot!</i>

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.230
<i>Who? Was it a guard?</i>

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.560
<i>Or did our enemy learn of our plan</i>

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.650
<i>and Whitesnake is lurking nearby?</i>

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.450
Jolyne!

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.080
<i>The guard will retrieve Star Platinum.</i>

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.620
<i>My business here is finished.</i>

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.290
<i>I shall return to the chapel.</i>

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.380
What…

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.880
What was this thing?

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.220
It's a disc.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.720
That's right,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.180
I was ordered to retrieve this disc.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.560
He also ordered me
to finish her off completely.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.810
But whose order was it?

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.440
I don't remember…

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.950
Anyway, I received an order

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.210

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.460

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.920

My ability, Weather Report,

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.160
manipulates the weather.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.910
<i>This is all I can do.</i>

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.500
<i>Jolyne,</i>

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.210
<i>I may not be able to save you,</i>

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.580
<i>but I can still protect the disc.</i>

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.550
<i>And if you still have the conviction,</i>

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.930
<i>you too may be able to make it out.</i>

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:41.270
<i>Between 1887 and 1974,</i>
<i>in Florida alone,</i>

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.610
<i>it was reported </i>

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:48.190
<i>that more than 50 cases of fish, frogs,</i>
<i>snakes and sheep fell from the sky.</i>

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.570
<i>The cause is attributed</i>
<i>to tornadoes and whirlwinds.</i>

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.280
<i>And these are poison dart frogs,</i>

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.950
<i>which live atop the trees</i>
<i>of Central and South America.</i>

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:04.380
<i>It carries subcutaneous poison so deadly,</i>
<i>even aboriginals used them for blowguns.</i>

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.390
What the hell are these frogs?!

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.690
These are…

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.810
These frogs.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.730
Aren't they poison dart frogs,
known for their toxicity?

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.990
<i>Once their poison enters the body,</i>
<i>it takes mere seconds</i>

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.570
<i>for the heart and respiratory system</i>
<i>to shut down.</i>

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.080
<i>That's what's splattering</i>
<i>along with their body fluid right now.</i>

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.660
<i>Whitesnake!</i>

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.540
<i>This ability…</i>

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.790
<i>Could it be his,</i>
<i>who manipulates the weather?</i>

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.250
<i>Weather Report.</i>

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.250
<i>He should have lost his memory.</i>

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.470
<i>Was he the one hiding behind the barrel?</i>

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.720
This is bad! Card key!

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.950
<i>These frogs are poisonous.</i>

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.080
<i>What happened to me?</i>

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.910
<i>Did I get shot?</i>

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.210
<i>Are the wounds deep?</i>

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.170
<i>The poison,</i>
<i>it's seeping through the threads!</i>

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.630
Someone, open the gate!

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.680
Please!

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.430
<i>Calm down.</i>

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.970
<i>I must keep my composure.</i>

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.600
<i>What do I do in such a situation?</i>

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.810
Two, three, five.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.770
<i>Calm down.</i>

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.690
Seven.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.150
<i>Count prime numbers and calm down.</i>

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.950
<i>Prime numbers are solitary numbers</i>
<i>that can only be divided by 1 and itself.</i>

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.410
<i>They give me strength.</i>

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.370
Twenty-three.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.780
Twenty-eight.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.870
No, 29.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.080
<i>Dammit.</i>

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.420
<i>The frogs are covering</i>
<i>my 800 dollar pants!</i>

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.170
<i>Weather Report is in the laundry room.</i>

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.090
<i>He's too far.</i>

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.090
<i>I cannot stop this downpour of frogs.</i>

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.130
<i>I must escape.</i>

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.800
Forty-one.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.550
<i>That's right.</i>

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.260
<i>The guard in the courtyard.</i>

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.930
<i>He's still under my command</i>
<i>by the disc. What happened to him?</i>

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.940
Guard, do you hear me?

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.190

Open the gate immediately!

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.830
Father?

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.790
What's going on?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.960
I don't know! A tornado, most likely.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.760
What are you doing?

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.970
There's an unconscious guard on this side.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.430
Hurry, open the door!

An unconscious guard?

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.640
Hold on, Father.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.110
I'll get help right away!

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.400
Wait! Where are you going?

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.980
Just open this door!

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.950

Let me ask my superior.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.950
Stay calm. Calm down, Father!

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.160

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.830

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.170
<i>You dare abandon me?</i>

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.420
I'll be back soon, Father!

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.800
Whitesnake!

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.510

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.500

Father!

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.740
Jotaro Kujo's disc, Star Platinum.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.660

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.830

Where is Jolyne Cujoh's corpse?

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.540
The disc must be close by.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.960
<i>That was vexing,</i>

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.920

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.010

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.850
<i>It would pose a serious problem</i>
<i>if anyone spots me here,</i>

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.310
<i>but I'm out of options.</i>

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.860
The soul of a dead criminal

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:47.200
returns to the earth in the form of a frog
in want of companions to the afterlife.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.620
I've heard of such a legend
existing in the East.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.450
Doesn't it describe
this hellish scene perfectly?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.920
And the disc must be
somewhere around here.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.960
Whitesnake.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.300
Search towards the gate from there.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.260
The guard might have taken it.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.430
It must be within that direction.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:12.510
I found it!

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.600
I've recovered the disc.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.480
Thanks.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.070
I was waiting for you to find it.

They're stuck on my face. Yuck.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.170
The frogs splatter poison
when they hit the ground and burst.

If they aren't crushed, they are harmless.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.680
I made a net with the living frogs

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.220
to lessen the impact of falling frogs.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.270

He was already here.

The envoy from
The Speedwagon Foundation, that is.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.580
He wasn't even human,

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.630
and he came exactly on time.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.670
He weaved past the rain of frogs
and reached this courtyard.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.010
Savage Garden is the name of a pigeon.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.180

will carry the disc to the right place.

<i>Shoot the pigeon down!</i>

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.360
That damn guard!

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.190
He used up all the bullets!

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.110
Dammit!

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.990
I won.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.080
Don't underestimate me!

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.040
Nothing has changed.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.880
Even with Star Platinum,
your father is still a living mummy!

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.260
He won't even recall his own daughter!

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.920
Look! A guard is down!

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.430
Don't step on the frogs!

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.220
Search the courtyard!

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.720
Someone might be there!

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.520
<i>Don't blank out yet.</i>

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.730
<i>Its Stand User must be close by.</i>

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.150
<i>I must find Whitesnake's Stand User first.</i>

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.990
<i>The User has my father's memory disc.</i>

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.450
<i>Now's my chance to find its User!</i>

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.410
Hey! Look out the window!

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.370
Oh my god!

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.790
It's a miracle! It has to be!

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.290
But who's going to clean this up?

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.460
<i>The tide hasn't changed.</i>

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.800
<i>I took Jotaro's Star Platinum</i>

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.930
<i>only out of my pledge</i>
<i>to avenge Dio, my friend.</i>

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.390
<i>The memory disc is the one that matters,</i>

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.390
<i>and it's in my hands.</i>

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.520
<i>Everything is according to plan.</i>

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.560
<i>Only Jotaro's memory</i>

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.060
<i>contains clues to attain heaven.</i>

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.580
<i>An abnormal situation where frogs</i>
<i>rain only in the prison courtyard.</i>

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:31.420
<i>Jolyne's escape attempt</i>
<i>was unquestioned in this chaos.</i>

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:41.640
<i>And The Speedwagon Foundation</i>
<i>obtained Jotaro Kujo's Star Platinum disc.</i>

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:48.020
<i>But Jotaro's soul won't return</i>
<i>without the Memory disc.</i>

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:05.020
Although you think I cope

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:10.020
My head is filled with hope

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:18.970
Of some place other than here

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:25.020
Although you think I smile

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.220
Inside and all the while

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:39.020
I'm wondering about my destiny

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:45.370
I'm thinking about

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:50.120
All the things

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.920
I'd like to do

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.670
In my life

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:04.420
I'm a dreamer

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.320
A distant dreamer

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:15.120
Dreaming far away

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.770
From today

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.030
Sports Maximum.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.410
I wanted to ask you about this bone.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.210
I want you to try something
using your ability.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.500
Is that a human bone?

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.800
Whose is it?

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.710
That doesn't concern you.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.430
Let's just say it belongs to
an old friend of mine.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.050
<i>My dear friend,</i>

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.060
<i>Dio's bone.</i>
