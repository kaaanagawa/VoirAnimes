<i>His heart…</i>

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.850
<i>Why isn't it beating?</i>

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.560
My dad's not dead.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.100
If I can get his Stand back,
he'll surely come back to life.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.110
I'll tell you one thing.
That power that awakened within you…

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.150
It's called a Stand ability.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.110
<i>I have to go see her. Jolyne…</i>

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.370
<i>Jolyne Cujoh.</i>

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.290
So Ermes has learned about Stand abilities

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.790
and about the discs too.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.180
When Ermes inserted
McQueen's memory disc back into him,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.090
<i>he came back to life.</i>

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.680
<i>He was resuscitated.</i>

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.560
We may be able to bring your father back
if we have his discs!

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.270
And what did you do
with this janitor's discs?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.150
I'm keeping them safe.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.230
I have both discs.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.820
She said the guards would find it

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.320
during body checks
if she brought them to her cell.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.740
I'll hold on to his Stand ability,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.040
but I'll insert
his memory disc back later.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.380
<i>McQueen's memory disc.</i>

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.960
<i>This disc contains memories</i>
<i>related to Whitesnake.</i>

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.260
<i>And maybe</i>

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.720
<i>memories of Dad's discs too.</i>

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.280
It's coming!

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.910
Hurry, shut the door!

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.450
I was only trying to change
the tractor's tire!

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.580
I barely touched it!

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.380
Hurry!

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.090
Hurry, get out of there!

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.970
We need to close this door!

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.220
Come on, help me!

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.340
Okay!

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.560
It's heavy!

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.180
Pull harder! It's almost closed.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.560
Now, pull!

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.650
What the hell are you doing?
I said pull harder!

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.650
Those aren't my arms…

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.660
Bro!

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
I know.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.370
I was the one…

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.910
who didn't pull hard enough--

There's Six Of Us!

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.910
Why did we call this assembly?

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.790
This afternoon,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.750
two inmates went missing
on the farm grounds.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.540
Is that so?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.920
That's not good.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.460
The prisoners could not have
escaped from the farm grounds.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.050
They must have drowned
in the surrounding wetlands

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.970
or gotten bitten by venomous snakes.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.050
I think we need
to assemble a search party.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.230
Why don't you talk about the possibility
of them being eaten by an alligator?

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.640
Maybe a female alligator.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.230
Who was that? What did you say?!

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.240
I did not eat them! I am innocent!

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.700
Anyways.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.410
I have called you here
to form a volunteer search party.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.370
You will not be compensated,
nor will your sentence get shortened.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.500
I'd like to ask for your compassion.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.630
Are there any volunteers?

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.560
Come on, Jolyne.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.730
You just got out of the Punishment Ward.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.400
Why would you choose to tire yourself more?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.990
Because you won't be there.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.900
What?

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.610
Very well.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.160
A party of five is plenty.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.160
Guard, bring the usual please.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.290
Inmates going to the farm

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.210
must wear this
on their wrists to prevent escape.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.670
"Like a Virgin."

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.340
Also known as "invisible wall."

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.930
If in trying to take the bracelet cuffs off
you give them impact,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.550
or if they break,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.890
they will explode immediately.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.970
Furthermore, if you stray
farther than 50 meters from me,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.600
it will explode.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.690
It would be difficult
to wipe your asses without your arms.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.790
Let's go, all five of you!

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.050
Fifty meters?

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.050
We're supposed to run?

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.550
Wait up! Hey!

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.480
All right, we'll split up here
and start the search.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.270
The grassy area there is a marsh.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.320
There could be crocodiles, so watch out!

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.250
They wouldn't be here.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.580
Why did you volunteer, Jolyne?

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.790
Well, it works well for me.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.050
There are plenty of things
I have to ask you.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.760
About the disc

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.510
and about the guy named Whitesnake.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.020
Did you try it out?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.480
Did you read McQueen's disc?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.020
Yes, I gave it a try,

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.690
but it made me feel terrible.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.280
It felt as if a stench
was entering my brain.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.910
Then you haven't noticed.
What?

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.700
The image within the disc

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.500
contained clues on Whitesnake's aim.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.210
<i>McQueen.</i>

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.670
<i>This disc will suit you.</i>

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.180
<i>It's yours now.</i>

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.840
<i>This is now your Stand ability.</i>

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.690
<i>They're stored in one of</i>
<i>the farm tractor tires?</i>

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.900
You saw a bunch of them there?

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.780
His aim is to collect the discs.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.450
He was collecting Stand abilities and
memories he stole from other Stand users.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.790
There are dozens of discs.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.790
He has to keep them hidden from
the prison guards and other prisoners.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.630
That's why he has them hidden in a tire.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.800
My father's Star Platinum and memory discs

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.720
might be stashed there.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.640
What? Father?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.680
So you're searching
for your father's discs?

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.060
Sorry, but I don't know
anything more about him.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.320
I'll look for the tractor from the disc.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.530
A tractor?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.660
There's a good number of them here.

Hey! You two seem

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.930
You think this is a picnic or something?

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.850
You're not searching at all!

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.310
No, we were discussing
that shed over there.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.850
We'll go search there.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.310
You made us run after you on purpose.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.320
Who's the one having fun here?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.280
Hold it! Did you mutter something?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.360
Oh, it's nothing.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.780
I swore to run around
like a dog and search.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.330
I don't like her.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.120
Crocodile feces.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.960
I said hold it! You disrespectful bitch!

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.500
I'm the guard here!

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.800
Oops. That was an accident.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.390
The stick accidentally hit it, right?

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.520
What is this sound?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.190
Why is my bracelet beeping?

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.480
That wasn't on purpose.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.360
You ran into me.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.360
It won't explode, will it?

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.110
That was a bad joke.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.530
Do something about it!

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.530
Hey now, stay away from me.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.830
What if it explodes
the moment you come near me?

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.250
Hold on.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.630
I said I'm sorry! I'm apologizing!

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.050
Watch it! I said don't come near me.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.510
I said, make it stop--

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.590
Boom!

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.640
Yes! That's what you get!

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.890
Eat crocodile shit!

Come on. Don't panic and trip, Ermes.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.910
That sound was a warning.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.370
Right, Mr. Prison Guard?

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.330
Dammit…

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.470
So that was your ability, huh?

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.010
Come on.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.230
There's only a tractor
and bags of flour in here.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.940
There's no point in looking inside.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.230
If this was an easy assignment,
then there was no need for volunteers.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.860
Seriously?

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.040
There it is, Jolyne!

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.290
It's the same tractor.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.500
That's the same tractor I saw on the disc.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.460
The number is the same too.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:43.970

Jolyne Cujoh

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.310
The same vehicle number. It says four.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.220
They're inside that tire.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.930
We can get to the discs
if we remove the tire.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.640
Listen up!

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.900
We will now sweep the wetlands!

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.530
The missing inmates
could have drowned in the waters.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.900
You will go look!

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.660
Hey, there's no way
I'm going in the water.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.950
I'm not going.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.660
Let's go!

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.700
Guess that vehicle is amphibious.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.330
Give me a break.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.500
Who knows what sort of disease
we'll catch in the wetlands!

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.290
What a pain.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.250
Now's our chance.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.920
Let's remove the tire now!

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.720
Hey, Jolyne.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.010
Doesn't something seem off?

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.100
No, something is definitely wrong.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.890
Yes, if we don't remove the tire now,

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.310
we would be separated from the guard.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.100
No, that's not what I mean.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.440
He said, "Five is plenty."

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.770
That Warden.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.860
He said five inmates are enough.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.530
but there are six of us!

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.450
Jolyne, what could this all mean?

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.370
Including you and I…

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.910
there's six of us here!

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.250
I know there were only
the five of us when we left.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.840
But I wasn't paying attention
to how they looked.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.420
Jolyne, what do you think?

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.260
I can't say.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.720
I was fixed on catching up.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.600
But then, everyone's wearing a bracelet.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.390
That's strange.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.480
Were there six of us

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.480
right from the start?

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.610
Hey, you think this is odd too?

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.240
There should've been
only five of us, right?

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.990
Can you tell who joined us and when?

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.910
No, I could be mistaken.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.740
And it doesn't matter
how many of us there are.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.120
She's been with me the entire time.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.170
I remember her.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.000
She's Atroe.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.460
She gets picked on a lot.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.090
She volunteered to escape the bullying.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.050
Right?

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.430
I don't know you.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.430
Hey!

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.010
What's going on?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.270
Why is my bracelet beeping?

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.600
Crap, mine is too!

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.270
Mine too.
What the hell? They're all beeping.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.650
We must be nearing the 50-meter limit.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.940
But he can't be that far off.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.660
The guard is gone!

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.330
Where did he go?

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.870
The ATV is covered in blood.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.460
Why is that?

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.710
The bracelet won't stop beeping

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.510
because the guard's body
is getting farther away from us.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.300
Did he fall in the water
and get washed away?

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.350
Find the guard!

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.680
He must be within 50 meters!

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.060
This is bad!

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.060
Hey.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.190
My bracelet's beeping faster!

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.570
No way.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.070
She's dead.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.030
No way.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.990
Did the additional person attack?

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.580
<i>Is it because we got close to the discs?</i>

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.710
Look 50 meters away opposite from
the girl that just exploded!

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.300
There he is!

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.720
Get near him!

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.550
The bracelet will stop beeping
and it won't explode either.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.260
Keep your guard up, Jolyne.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.850
Our enemy is among them.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.520
Someone's a real psycho.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.690
<i>She looks suspicious to me.</i>

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.940
<i>The woman with the shaved head.</i>

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.150
<i>And Atroe didn't recognize her.</i>

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.240
It must be her.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.660
Her Stand ability must have killed him.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.620
We'll kill her before she gets us!

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.990
Calm down, Ermes.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.790
Say that the shaved woman is the culprit,

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:48.080
so she was guarding the discs
in the shed since before we got here?

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.290
That's what it would mean.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.550
That's impossible.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.460
She's an inmate.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.510
An inmate can't keep watch 24/7.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.770
Jolyne, stand back!

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.640
Something's there!
What?

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.230
Just step back.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.770
Get away from the water!

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.990
Ermes.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.360
Did you see something?
No.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.330
It was nothing.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.710
But I'm not getting in the marsh anymore.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.580
And Jolyne.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.250
We can't be separated, no matter what.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.550
We don't know who the enemy is.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.550
Right. And these bracelets
complicate things.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.760
To take the discs from the shed,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.600
we must be within 50 meters of the guard
and the other three inmates.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.310
Ermes!

Doom 

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.730
You're walking on the thread?

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:19.240
Doesn't that mean
you're unraveling your own body?

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.820
Jolyne, stay away!

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.240
I'll take care of myself!

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.380
This is crazy!

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.840
It's true.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.050
Yes, it's pretty crazy.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.550
Good grief.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.390
I would've been toast
if I hadn't unraveled so much thread.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.730
So this is your power.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.190
Her body has a hole in it.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.860
<i>She let him punch her</i>
<i>so she could grab onto him.</i>

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.490 line:20%
Jolyne, get out of the water now.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.410 line:20%
Don't stand up, Ermes!

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:11.370
That thing.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.870
It's a bunch of small Stands
clustered together!

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.540 line:20%
It hid inside the tiny bit
of water in the bucket,

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.380 line:20%
and it dragged me in!

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.590 line:20%
I know that.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.970
So don't stand up.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.430
Grab it underwater.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.010
The thread that I'm releasing!

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.230
<i>It's fast.</i>

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.070
<i>It's powerful too, but its speed...</i>

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:46.740
<i>Just what is it?</i>

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.330
<i>A Stand's speed and power should weaken…</i>

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.490
<i>the farther it separates from its user.</i>

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.120
It got me!

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.540
Stay calm, Jolyne.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.750
I put my sticker on it.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.000
When I was caught in its arms earlier.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.300
This is my Stand ability.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.050
I'll peel it off now!

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.270
Run further inland!

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.370
It's not coming onto land.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.370
Seems it only attacks in the water.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:38.790
Please respond!

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.590
This is inmate FE32125.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.920
This is an emergency.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.050
The guard got in an accident.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.930
Send help immediately!

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.720
What happened to you two?

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.390
It looked like you were running on water…

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.140
You three, don't take another step!

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:59.600
Step away from the water!

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.610
Don't try to pull anything on us.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.110
I know one of you did this!

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.120
In order to obtain the discs,

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.540
it seems we have to defeat the User first.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:33.250
Although you think I cope

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:38.250
My head is filled with hope

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:47.200
Of some place other than here

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.250
Although you think I smile

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:58.450
Inside and all the while

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:07.250
I'm wondering about my destiny

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:13.600
I'm thinking about

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.350
All the things

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:23.150
I'd like to do

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.900
In my life

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.650
I'm a dreamer

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.550
A distant dreamer

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:43.350
Dreaming far away

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:47.000
From today
