And this lovely alligator here

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.530
is Charlotte, my assistant.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.900
Great to meet you!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.280
Charlotte,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.450
please explain how life is
in this institution.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.450
Okay!

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.540
Similar to the United States,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.170
this prison is based on
the concept of freedom and equality.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.920
<i>You may freely walk around the facility</i>

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.670
<i>and exercise as you please.</i>

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.090
<i>You may use the phones,</i>
<i>the shower, and the library as well.</i>

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.260
<i>If you are an exemplary inmate,</i>
<i>you may even own a TV.</i>

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.390
You could also work or study
and earn university credits.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.520
That's right.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.820
Yes! What is it, Charlotte?

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.360
But Warden, there are rules too, right?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.450
You're absolutely correct, Charlotte!

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.160
First, do not remove the wristband
with your inmate number.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.620
No lending or borrowing of items
between inmates.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.920
No possession of metal objects.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.830
How about earrings?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.340
The warden's still speaking! Shut up!

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.510
Earrings are prohibited,
FE40536, Jolyne Cujoh.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.310
Feel free to ask any questions
to the prison guards.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.310
You are now dismissed.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.770
All right! Everyone, face left!

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.650
<i>It's so spacious.</i>

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.020
<i>The entire island is the prison.</i>

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.730
<i>Oh, an alligator.</i>

FE40536.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.130
Cell 206 will be your home from now on.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.800
Today's free time is over.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.260
The cells open at 6:30 a.m.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.680
Breakfast begins at seven,
but you may choose to sleep in.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.770
Try to get along now.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.480
Nice to meet you.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.780
Nice to meet you too.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.320
I'm Jolyne.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.690
I'm Gwess.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.820

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.860
Thanks.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.160
But I don't have an appetite.
There's so much to get used to--

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.120
Ouch! What the hell--

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.580
The bottom bunk is mine!

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.790
You got a problem with that, you bitch?

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.640
I didn't mean to instigate a fight.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.270
I just misunderstood since
your things were on the top bunk.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.270
That charm!

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.360
Bitch!

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.320
Get your dirty hands off of my stuff!

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.980
Can I see that charm?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.950
There should be a small stone
and a photograph of my parents inside!

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.200
It could have belonged to me!

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.750
I bought it for two dollars
from a newcomer the other day.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.620
Because it's just so beautiful.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.250
Let me see it!

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.340
You better watch your mouth, ugly!

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.260
Okay, I'll buy it off of you.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.050
How much do you want?

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.220
Two hundred dollars.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.260
What?

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.310

I'm sorry. About last night, I mean.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.690
What?

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.030
It's morning.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.610
Here.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.780
You can look at it.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.910
But…

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.500
There was nothing inside it.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.870
No pictures, no nothing.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.870
See?

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.210
Was there anything else in it?
Like a stone?

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.880
No. Nothing.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.300
Anyway, please forgive
my behavior last night.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.720
I'm shy around new people.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.270
Oh, there's nothing to forgive.
It was my fault.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.730
I don't know the rules around here yet.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.860
Jolyne, you are a good person.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.820
Let's be friends from now on.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.950
Yes, I'd like that.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.870
Anyway, it's breakfast time.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.040
I'll see you there.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.370
Hold on, I'll go with you.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.580
What the hell?

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.210
There's water all over the place!

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.340
My pants are soaking wet. This sucks!

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.850
What do you mean it's "sold out"?

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.600
I haven't eaten yet.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.940
As you can see,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.020
you're free to sleep in.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.940
You're also free to get here late.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.020
Isn't there food for everyone?

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.070
Not even some milk or bananas?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.780
That's the strange thing about prisons.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.030
That makes no sense!

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.780
Oh, Jolyne, you took your sweet time.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.330
I'm so full.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.960
Hey, Gwess.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.960
You had two milk cartons and two bananas!

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.090
Two bananas?

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.460
No way. Are you still asleep?

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.050
Also, sorry about the water.
I accidentally spilled it.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.930
I'll clean it up later.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.550
I already cleaned it off.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.260
Oh, thank you.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.890
You're so kind, Jolyne.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.060
<i>This is…</i>

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.370
Jump for me. I believe in you.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.530
I love you,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.870
and you love me.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.830
As long as we trust each other, there should be nothing you can't do.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.830
Do it for me.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.880
Good boy!

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.600
Aren't you an adorable little birdie Pi-chan?!

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.350
Good job! Here's your reward!

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.100
Good morning!

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.850
No, Pi-chan.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.310
Not "good morning."

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.070
Say "I love you."

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.780
You're such a darling
when you say that you love me.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.200
I love you!

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.450
Good boy!

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.200
You're such a good boy, Pi-chan!

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.700
Next, perch.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.370
Jump over.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.830
Taking risks is part
of trust-building, Pi-chan.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.920
What?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.630
Come on, jump!

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.760
Whoa…

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.510
What did you just say? "Whoa"?

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.600
Say that again!

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.180
Do birds go "whoa"?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.350
I love you! I love you! I love you!

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.520
You're covering it up now, aren't you?

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.900
You think such a blatant lie works on me?

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.690
Do you?

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.110
I've had it with you.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.990
We're through.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.450
What was that?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.790
A banana?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.220

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.860
<i>it's definitely real.</i>

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.570
<i>That woman…</i>

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.320
<i>had already killed it!</i>

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.260
<i>What is she doing?</i>

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.100
<i>I knew it, she must have used that charm</i>

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.230
<i>to gain some sort of ability!</i>

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.850
<i>Where did she get that tiny human?</i>

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.240
<i>What…</i>

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.910

RANGE

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.290
This is…

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800
My body shrank!

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.970
I knew it was you.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.430
How did you snatch away my Pi-chan?

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:33.900
Jolyne!

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.360
Jolyne.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.740
I'm starting to like you, really.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.820
What happened to my body?

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:44.990
Explain!

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.160
Listen, Jolyne. Please don't talk.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.910
The person inside that Parakeet--

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.910
Hey, I said no talking!

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.330
Get in it.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.420
I removed its guts.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.800
There was a flaw to using a Parakeet.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.880
Birds can't use their arms
and they can't grab.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.850
Rats, though, have front paws.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.180
He was a prison guard
who got fired for slacking off.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.640
The warden thinks he left the facility.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.230
Also, I told you to keep quiet.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.740
But if you can mimic
a rat squeak, I'll let it pass.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.610
You can say, "I'm going, squeak!"
or "I'm hungry, squeak!"

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.450
Got it?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.580
Just as I thought, you look darling!

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.910
Now it's time for training.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.460
Go, faster. Run!

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.920
No slowing down.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.390
Lift, Chorokichi.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.970
Chorokichi?

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.680
Everything has a name.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.060
The Word was with God,

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.020
and all things were created by the Word.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.980
That's why I named this power
that shrank your size.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.900 line:20%
"Goo Goo Dolls."

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.950 line:20%
This is the name of my mental power.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.870
Let's stack another book.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.540
You…

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.580
You think you can cheat me like that?

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.460
How dare you betray my trust.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.970
I guess this means we're through!?!

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.680
Just kidding!

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.430
You passed, Chorokichi.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.180
Your shrewdness will prove useful.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.180
Very very good!

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.070
Can you see?

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.070
Down this corridor is the control room.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.950
The switch within that room

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.490
can deactivate the locks in this facility.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.490
You can pass through.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.330
You see what I'm getting at.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.960
You are I are breaking out.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.290
For some reason, I can't shrink myself.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.250
But if we cooperate, we can leave.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.000
We need to trust each other.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.300
Of course, we'll need
to concoct a more reliable plan.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.260
First, I want you to check out
everything beyond this corridor.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.520
Do you really think we can escape?

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.770
I told you to squeak like a rat!

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.020
Squeak, how do I get

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.530
to the control room, squeak?

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.110
How cute! How precious.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.820
But how should I know, dumbass?

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.700
That's why you're on this mission.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.870
Look up.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.370
That's the surveillance camera.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.580
But it can't see below this bar.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.500
Walk under the handrail.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.960
Put your hood on.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.100
Now go!

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.400
Hey, you. What are you doing?

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.240 line:20%
That's right, you with the headband.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.870
State your name and number!

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.530
FE18081.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.200
My name is Gwess.
I'm just loitering around.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.500
If you have no business here, then leave!

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.580
Leave immediately.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.210
Sure thing, Mr. Prison Guard.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.060
<i>There are four steel doors.</i>
<i>Which one is the control room?</i>

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.980
<i>Also, there are two cameras here.</i>

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.980
<i>What's going on? I'm running out of space.</i>

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.860
<i>What's happening?</i>

Yes, I heard it too.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.820
It was close by.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.080
<i>My body…</i>

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.000

The coffee's ready.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.000
Maybe it was from the coffee maker.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.670
-It didn't sound like it.
-<i>This is bad. What's going on?</i>

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.340
<i>Distance?</i>

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.340
<i>Is it because Gwess is far from me?</i>

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.800
<i>Is this ability affected by distance?</i>

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.010
I heard it again!

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.220
Something's lurking nearby!

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.980
<i>Shit!</i>

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.560

Hey, move out of the way!

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:26.690
I said move it!

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.820

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.040
Make my body smaller so I can escape!

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.920
Just by a bit, though, got it?

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.010
All right, you can sleep on
the bottom bunk bed!

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.890
Please don't hate me despite
what happened between us!

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.600
But please squeak every once in a while.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.850
Just hurry it up!

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.270
Finally.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.270
Now, the charm.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.650
Give me the stone
and tell me who sold it to you.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.860
Of course.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.400
Two hundred dollars, was it--

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.410
Shut up, bitch!

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.910
Tell me who sold it to you!

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.450
All right.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.580
Some woman named Ermes sold it to me.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.790
Ermes?

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.790
<i>I don't know much about her.</i>

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.130
Here.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.760
Well…

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.850
I got her!

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.640
Guards! We have a problem!

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.690
This bitch here crossed the gun point!

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.730
Come here, quick!

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.230 line:20%
What are you doing there?

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.240
How did you get over there?

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.160
Jailbreak!

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.160
Code 999!

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.040
It's all over for you now.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.170
The prison guard
is retrieving the shotgun as we speak.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.000
He has every right to shoot you down!

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.760
No questions asked!

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.970
Jolyne!

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.680
Serves you right!

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.760
It's what you get
for trampling on my heart!

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.480
Good grief, Gwess.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.850
You said everything has a name.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.110
I'll name this ability of mine too.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.190
"Stone Free."

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.320
I'll become free
from this ocean of stones.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.030
Did you hear me?

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.530
Stone Free. That's the name.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:44.670
If there's a hierarchy system
in this prison, I'll follow it.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.970
However, I'm the one who gives orders.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.510 line:20%
Now let me cross over.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.770 line:20%
-What?
-Where is she?

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.140
-She disappeared.
-What?

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.940
Are you sure she was there?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.520
Well, I just saw her back, so…

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.230
Strange…

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.750
Dad…

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:33.250
Although you think I cope

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:38.250
My head is filled with hope

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:47.200
Of some place other than here

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.250
Although you think I smile

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:58.450
Inside and all the while

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:07.250
I'm wondering about my destiny

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:13.600
I'm thinking about

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.350
All the things

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:23.150
I'd like to do

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.900
In my life

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.650
I'm a dreamer

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.550
A distant dreamer

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:43.350
Dreaming far away

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:47.000
From today
