00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.800
Father,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.100
my incarceration has taught me

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.350
how foolish I had been in the past.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.900
I couldn't restrain my greed

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.940
and continued to steal.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.940
I'm ashamed of myself.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.650
It's all thanks to you, Father.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.820
Could I please ask for your assistance
in receiving parole?

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.990
Recent studies have revealed…

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.160
that proper training

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.620
can teach even dogs and parrots
how to read, utilize fire,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.710
and understand art.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.130
If that is the case,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.170
then what is the difference
between man and animal?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.130
What do you think?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.930
I'm not sure.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.850
Anyway, about my parole…

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.560
Excuse me.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.850
Hey.
Got it.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.440
The point is,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.450
after finishing the first cherry
and leaving it in your mouth,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.950
which tooth would you
bite the second with?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.370
You must not bite the first pit
while eating the second cherry.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.450
Sure…

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.460
And what about my parole?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.630
I think there's a possibility.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.170
Do you really, Father?

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.970
I will recommend you to the committee.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.680
Thank you, Fa--

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.970
I quite like

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.060
your mischievous habit of theft.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.650
Truly, an evil disposition
cannot be corrected.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.570
However,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.820
I cannot deny this talent.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.280
You will prove useful to me.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.120
I cannot let Jotaro's Stand

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.870

How do we know we can
This place is fun!

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.320
It's not like the wetlands at all!
Really, now.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.200
I want to play too.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.240
It's called "catch," right?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.370
I trust F.F.,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.290
and Whitesnake doesn't know
that she's alive.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.330
It's the safest place.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.290
You're right.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.800
But it would be even better

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.260
if you could deliver the disc to him.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.260
I know.

phone calls because I attempted to escape.

Jeez.
What?

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.870
You've never thrown a ball, have you?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.330
Oh, crap.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.630
Tuck your hips in.

Jolyne, did you know

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.360
that we've tossed the ball 86 times now?

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.020
We haven't dropped it at all.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.650
Think we can reach a hundred?

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.070
A hundred dollars says it won't last.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.700
I bet 100 dollars.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.040

What do you mean 100 dollars?

I'm betting 100 dollars

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.880
that you won't be able to
make it to the 100th throw.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.590
Where did that come from, all of a sudden?

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.760

We only have 13 more throws!

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.730
You keep quiet!

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.610
I don't have that kind of money.

I can't match this wager.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.030
You can bet any item.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.660
Tobacco, drugs,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.700
gum, a phone call, a vibrator…

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.500
I'll accept anything valuable.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.750
Let me be frank.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.330
I'm not betting on anything.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.750
Hold it.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.090
Jolyne,

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.840
we should accept this bet.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.420
It's a chance to make money.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.680
You can use my money.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.180
F.F. might suck at playing catch,
but still managed to continue to 87.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.100
We can win!

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.770
Come on, Ermes.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.690
You suspect that this is
Whitesnake's trap.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.190
But I know that Miraschon
because we're on the same floor.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.990
She's the greedy self-destructive type
that kept committing petty theft.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.700
Think about it.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.820
Even after your restrictions get lifted,

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.330
you need to buy your time on the phone.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.910
So,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.540
gonna play or not?

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.580
I want to give it a go! We can win this!

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.920
Good.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.050
But you don't have 100 dollars, do you?

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.720
If you raise your voice or get too close,
the bet is immediately off.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.640
Got it?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.100
The wager has already begun.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.350
But it wouldn't be fair for me

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.150
if you play too close
or hold onto the ball too long.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.240
We'll stay at least three meters away
and throw within ten seconds.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.070
Good.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.830
Time to play ball! Let's go.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.790
Don't rush and take your aim.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.660
You have a whole ten seconds
before you throw!

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.040
Eighty-nine.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.630
Only 11 more throws to go!

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.840
Bitch, stay away from my cup!

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.550
F.F.!

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.180
That was close.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.100
Come on, focus!

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.220
It wasn't my fault!

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.810
It's her! She got near my water!

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.060
I'm just enjoying the show.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.610 line:20%
Just stay away from my cup!

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.570 line:20%
All right.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.070
Five more seconds.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.820
F.F., throw the ball!

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.200
Damn, she's distracting me!
Hey!

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.280
I'll hold your cup for you.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.370
One second left.
F.F.!

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.290
Idiot!

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.960
Jolyne!

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.800
That was close, but she caught it.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.680
Sorry, I panicked.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.150
See? A hundred throws!

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.060
Good.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.320
I can go another hundred throws!

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.400
See? An easy win.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.990
Now, give us the 100 dollars.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.910
Hold on, she made a wager with F.F. too.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.700
That makes it 200 dollars.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.370
That's true. She owes us 200 dollars.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.910
Now, cough it up.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.170
A thousand dollars
if you throw a hundred more.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.010
You heard me.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.340
I said let's play for 1,000 dollars.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.800
Are you serious?

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.640
Do you even have that much money?

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.550
Of course, I do.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.600
But like I said,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.770
I'll take anything valuable too.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.890
The rules will be the same as last time.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.020
What do you say?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.650
No, I'm done playing with you.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.360
I'm going to be frank.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.700
There's something I don't like about you.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.200
If you want to wager, go play else
I'll play.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.830
Good.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.580
F.F., hand me the glove and the ball.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.710
Okay!
Ermes, no!

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.130
Jolyne, you're right, she is suspicious.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.710
Especially the way she insists on betting.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.630
But…

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.390
we can potentially make 1,200 dollars.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.680
There's no way we can pass that up.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.060
Be careful, though.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.100
The game begins
the moment you agree to play.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.900
Might be 10 seconds soon.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.610
Ermes!
F.F.!

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.320
More easy money.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.120
Thirty.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.240
Thirty-one.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.200
Thirty-two.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.540
Great, the next one makes it 33.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.840
Inmates, put away your exercise equipment!

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.010
Recess time is over!

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.720
Five…

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.390 line:20%
F.F.!

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.390 line:20%
Thirty-three!

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.640 line:20%
Bitch!

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.350 line:20%
What's with that attitude?!

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.270
Hey, this bet is off. Got that?

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.150
Let's say that a meteorite falls
from the skies above

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.650
into this yard right now.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.820
Then, you'll try to persuade me
to end the game,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.120
blaming it on the meteorite.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.080
Not to convince me,

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.790
but yourselves.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.290
Does that sit well with you, though?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.670
Maybe you ran out of time

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.420
because you took too long
to throw the ball.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.130
If you can honestly say

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.260
that you didn't break
the rules of the game,

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.140
then go ahead,

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.220
end this game.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:11.140
Dammit…

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.480
Ermes,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.060
you know you'll be thrown in
the Punishment Ward.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.400 line:20%
Please, mister.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.570 line:20%
Give me five… No, three minutes.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.120
I'll make another round,
so finish up in two minutes.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.700
F.F., hurry!

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.910
But a measly 100 dollars
only pays for the ball.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.250
I'm putting the glove away. Give it to me!

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.590
What?

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.210
Goddammit!

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.640
<i>Shit…</i>

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.810
<i>I attached a sticker to it</i>

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.770
<i>in case something like this happens!</i>

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.440
Ermes!

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.530
Whoa!

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.110
Let's keep playing.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.040
I'm just watching.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.540
I won't interfere or object.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.630
And I can't prove anything, but…

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.090
Ermes…

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.220
She knows what she's done.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.680
Without a doubt,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.100
she violated the rules
of the game just now.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.680
I know this

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.060
because Marilyn Manson,
the debt collector, appeared.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.690 line:20%
Ermes!

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.400 line:20%
She's a Stand User!

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.830 line:20%
Marilyn Manson
will always collect the debt

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.870 line:20%
no matter where you hide it,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.710 line:20%
or what it is. All of it.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.460
That's not enough.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.170
Kiss…

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.880
It's game over.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.930
Ermes!

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.570
Ermes…

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.900
If I sell this liver on the black market,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.370
it will compensate for
the remaining 590 dollars.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.990
Bastard!

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.500
Take this!

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.290
I am the shadow of Ermes's conscience.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.380
You cannot attack me.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.180
Ermes broke the rules and lost the bet.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.140
I only collected her debt.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.060
If you have any other valuable,

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.180
I can exchange it for this liver.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.810
The bet's not over yet.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.400
What?

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.520
One thousand throws.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.860
If I win,

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.570
give back everything you took from her.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.530
Everything.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:16.530
Good. However, I hope you are prepared

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.490
to wager something as valuable.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.620
I'm aware.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.960
Very well.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.790
The game has already started.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.670
I shall see you again.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.920
F.F.!

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.630
Jolyne.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.930
Ermes, this wasn't your fault.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.850
Miraschon is a Stand User.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.060
Whitesnake must have a hand in this.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:45.440
She must be here to collect
my father's disc from me.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.530
Then you really shouldn't play this game.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.820
You got caught in
me and my father's problem.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.030
I can't let you die.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.990
But what are you going to do?

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.870
A thousand throws?

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.410
That Stand seems invincible.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.250
You're right.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.250
We'll chase Miraschon herself
and beat her!

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.050
The Stand may be invincible,

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.800
but Miraschon isn't.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.300
That's why she ran.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.470
Let's go!

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.440
She's here.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.270
She must have entered this room.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.860
There's a door to the back.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.320
Maybe she escaped that way.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.070
F.F.!

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.200
Jolyne, don't throw it yet!

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:42.660
Flick

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.750
F.F.! It's coming towards you!

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.880
Where is it? I can't see a thing!

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.920
Don't move!

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.380
The ball will hit you!

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.550
Whoa! I got it!

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.060
That was too close!

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.180
Great job, F.F.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.430
Now, calm down so you can throw it back.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.640
I'm right here!

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.730
Where are you?
Hurry!

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.110
It's over for them.

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.150
F.F.!

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.280
I don't have time for this!

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.910
Foo Fighters.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.790
I shot towards

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.420
the direction of her voice.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.590
I didn't even aim!

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.260
<i>Dammit! What is she?</i>

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.100
<i>Lockdown will soon commence.</i>

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.770
<i>All inmates must return to their cells.</i>

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.270
<i>Prepare for headcount.</i>

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.600
<i>I repeat!</i>

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.230 line:20%
She ran to the right!

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.500
How unfortunate.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.290
You can't run anymore.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.250
Now that we know
that you are a Stand User,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.920
I won't hold back.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.250
Wait,

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.670
I'll give it all back.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.710
The liver…

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.920
and the money too!

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.550
That's not enough.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.430
Who gave you that Stand ability?

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.430
What?

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.060
Whitesnake.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.350
It was him, wasn't it?
I want to know who his User is.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.560
What are you talking about?

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.400
You shouldn't test me.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.820
I'm serious!

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.320
I only wanted to go on parole!

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.790
What is this?

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.870
This is an elevator

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.500
for transporting cafeteria food.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.630
How many more seconds?

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:54.920
Six…

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.630
No, is it five?

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.220
Jolyne!

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:06.970 line:20%
Two seconds left…

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.890
F.F., the ball!

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.350
Throw it to me!

What's your next move?

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.780
Eight seconds left.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.370
Seven, six…

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.080
F.F.!

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.840
Will this do, Miraschon?

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.470
Such an easy and simple request.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.930
Feel free to ask me again.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.490
The game of catch

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.110
was just interrupted.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.820
It's game over,

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.740
Jolyne Cujoh!

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.960
Marilyn Manson
will always collect what's owed!

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.330
No matter where it is,

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.250
even if you don't know where,

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.300
Marilyn knows where it is.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.340
Jolyne!

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.220
I'll take the most expensive organ.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.930
And for the remainder,

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.220
your most prized possession,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.640
your father's disc.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.600
And the disc…

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.360
was on her since the beginning!

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.400
I won!

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.110
Your organ,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.820
your disc…

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.280
They're all mine now!

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.830
The game of catch isn't over yet.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.540
But how?

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.500
The ball…

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.480
Impossible.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.480
You broke the rules.
No.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.560
We never agreed on my partner.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.570
The guard is okay too, right?

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.740
The debt collector agrees with me.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.160
How many throws do I have left? Is it 800?

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.580
Or 900?

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.130
It's a pain to count.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.880
Let's say 1,000 throws.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.150
We did it!

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.570


00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.570
MIRASCHON
STAND NAME:
DEBT COLLECTOR MARILYN MANSON
BEYOND RECOVERY

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.780
I will return the disc to my father.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.450
Along with the other disc
that Whitesnake has.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.700
No matter what.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:33.450
Although you think I cope

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:38.450
My head is filled with hope

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:47.400
Of some place other than here

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.450
Although you think I smile

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:58.650
Inside and all the while

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:07.450
I'm wondering about my destiny

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:13.800
I'm thinking about

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.550
All the things

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.350
I'd like to do

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:28.100
In my life

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.850
I'm a dreamer

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.750
A distant dreamer

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:43.550
Dreaming far away

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.200
From today
