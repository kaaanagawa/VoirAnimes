00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.740
Your sword is terrifyingly fast.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.230
It's amazing, but do you really think

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.830
you'll defeat me by the time
the flames on that table strike 12?

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.510
Aren't you being rather conceited,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.080
Mister...?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.750
Polnareff.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.250
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.470
Jean Pierre Polnareff.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.770
Merci beaucoup.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.040
I appreciate your introduction.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.300
But...

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.260
Monsieur Polnareff,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.370
don't assume that my flames

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.860
always burn upward or downwind
as they would in nature.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.490
It is called Magician's Red
because it controls flames freely.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.910
In the beginning, this world
was engulfed in flames.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.580
I expect nothing less from Magician's Red,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.120
who controls the flames that
suggest the beginning of all things.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.910
But, you say I'm being conceited?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810
You're saying that my swordsmanship

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.010
is mere conceit?!

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.850
Foom

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.290
In the moment they lined up,
he pierced five coins in a single strike!

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.320
No. Take a closer look.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.700
That's...

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.030
I-I see... there are flames between each coin.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.210
It appears you understand what this means.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.190
It is not conceit.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.920
My Stand has the power to sever even fire!

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.890
It can slash the very air and create gaps
between nothingness and nothingness.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.100
Which means your Magician's Red is
powerless before my Silver Chariot.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.650
When did he...

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.080
The card that my Stand has,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.910
The Chariot, suggests conquest and victory.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.580
I don't mind taking care of you
in this cramped little space,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.510
but, Avdol, you'd be able to use your

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.580
flame abilities in a much more open space, no?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.660
It would be fitting for my Stand to
defeat you under those circumstances.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.010
A fitting victory.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.920
All of you, outside!

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.480
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.480
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.090
Episode 5: Silver Chariot

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.090
Wh-What is this place?

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.640
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.210
It's Tiger Balm Garden.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.020
What?

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.780
Tiger Balm Garden,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.070
a garden that exists along the hillside
of Hong Kong's Tai Hang Road.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.430
Its unique taste and appearance

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.200
make it number one among
Hong Kong's bizarre zones.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.270
I will make a prediction here.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.420
First, Avdol,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.170
you will be destroyed by
your own Stand's powers.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.280
Avdol...

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.180
Jotaro, you need not interfere.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.560
With such an open space,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.110
I can control my Stand as freely as I please.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.370
Come on!

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.360
Slice

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.000
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Come on. What's wrong?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.840
You're not going to use your precious
flames to your heart's content?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.550
If not, I'm going to take my turn.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.300
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.070
That bastard. He's mocking us.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.070
With repeated stabs, he carved a
statue that looks just Magician's Red.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.340
You know...

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.580
You fit quite well in this garden, Magician's Red.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Suuuuuck

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.350
Here it comes.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.890
You're ready to show your true power?

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.010
Sounds like fun.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.340
I'll take what you dish out.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.270
Hey, hide behind something.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.950
Avdol is going to use <i>it</i>.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.050
"It"?

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:07.100
Crossfire Hurricane!

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.240
Is that all you've got?!

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.280
I told you that my swordsmanship can create gaps

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.320
between nothingness and nothingness,
and blow away flames!

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.280
Crash

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.540
Avdol!

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.790
The flames are so strong
that he's being burned, as well.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.260
It's just as I predicted.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.540
You will die, burned by your own flames!

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.020
Oh, good, good grief!

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.830
You're still going to come at me?

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.810
How unsightly!

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.690
What is this odd resistance?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.650
What?!

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.900
Impossible!

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.280
How can flames come out
from the body I severed?

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.850
That's not the Stand.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.150
It's the statue!

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.760
Your eyes were blinded by the flames.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.590
What you cut apart was the statue
that Silver Chariot carved earlier.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.130
I told you that I could control my flames freely.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.110
The flames that you blew back toward it

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.180
melted its joints and caused it to move.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.510
You are the one defeated
by his own Stand's powers.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.940
And now, face this again!

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.810
Crossfire Hurricane!

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.200
I believe it's ten years too
soon for you to fight me,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.200
a fortune teller, with predictions.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.540
Such terrifying power!

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.040
Since his Stand took that head-on,
it must have melted. It's done for!

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.050
That's one hell of a burn.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.930
Yeah, he's dead. If he's lucky,
he'll be in serious condition.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.240
Actually, that'd be bad luck.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.970
Either way, he won't be
able to stand for three months.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.670
His Stand is destroyed and unable to fight.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.180
Now, Mr. Joestar,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.750
let us hurry on our journey to Egypt.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.840
Indeed.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.360
Boom

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.800
Wh-What?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.320
His Stand is breaking into pieces!

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.080
Bang

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.160
He flew into the air while still lying down!

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.170
Bravo! Oh, bravo!

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.670
H-He's...

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.120
I don't believe it!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.830
He's perfectly fine!

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.800
But why is his body floating in the air?

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.720
Take a good look with your inner eye.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.140
That's...

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.610
Bam

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.170
Yes, this is it.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.610
My Stand with its armor off: Silver Chariot.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.910
You seem shocked,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.530
and it wouldn't be honorable to defeat you

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.800
without explaining my powers first.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.160
You could even call it a surprise attack.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.330
Would you give me the time to explain?

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.270
Very well.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.110
Let's hear this explanation.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.420
My Stand did not break apart and disappear.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.150
Silver Chariot was wearing armor.
That's what it just took off.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.040
What was burned away by your
flames was just part of its armor.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.520
That's why I was only lightly injured.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.260
And with its armor off, it is lighter.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.520
Did you see it lift me up?

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.780
That's right. That's how fast it can move now!

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.580
I see.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.670
So you're saying that because
its armor was so heavy,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.460
it had to take my Crossfire Hurricane head-on.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.550
But that would also mean that it's naked now.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.300
Now that it doesn't have its protection,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.420
if it were to take that attack
again, it wouldn't survive.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.410
Oui, precisely.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.520
But that would be impossible.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.190
Impossible? I'd like to test that theory.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.190
Because I'm going to show
you something astonishing.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.440
Oh? Go right ahead.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.280 line:20%
Line-up

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.280
Wh-What?!

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.700
His Stand just multiplied into six...
no, now there are seven of them!

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.490
I-Impossible.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.580
There should only be one Stand to each user.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.540
It seems that you are astonished.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.320
These are shadow clones.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.010
Shadow clones of my Stand that confuse
not only your eyes, but your senses.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.010
Your senses can't follow its movements.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.560
How do you like its swordsmanship now?

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.980
Silver Chariot

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.980
Jean Pierre Polnareff

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.200
Red Bind!

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.050
I told you that you wouldn't be
able to follow its movements.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.130
Your flames can only grasp shadow clones.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.090
Striking at random now?

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.270
You're getting a bit desperate, Avdol.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.150
It's true; that'll just use up all his energy.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.150
Crossfire Hurricane!

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.510
Non, non, non, non, non, non.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.990
That is also a shadow clone.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.210
Your attack will not work against my Stand.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.790
Come on, come on, come on!

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.080
Avdol!

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.590
Such precision. Th-This is...

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.950
a Stand ability that has
been very highly trained.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.350
For certain reasons,
I trained for nearly ten years.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.280
Now, come at me again.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.190
I will finish you with my next move.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.290
In the name of chivalry,
you keep explaining your attacks.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.110
You're rather honorable.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.460
Therefore, I shall also

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.330
reveal a secret before beginning my next attack.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.160
Oh?

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.680
You see, there are variations
to my Crossfire Hurricane.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.920
It is a flame in the shape of an Ankh,
but it need not be singular.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.420
I can break it up and make it fly in pieces.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.950
Crossfire Hurricane

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.470
Special!

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.480
Just try and dodge it!

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.190
You waste your time, Avdol!

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.610
They formed a circle!

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.690
There's no opening!

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.150
Naïve! Naïve, naïve, naïve, naïve!

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.450
You're naïve!

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.200
I will again use this power against you!

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.590
Sever! Blow it back at him!

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.790
What?!

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.560 line:20%
Kaboom

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.760
That's...

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.430
The hole that was made by the flames earlier...

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.720
I get it!

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.810
The first flames were used to dig a tunnel!

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.060
And then he shot the Crossfire Hurricane through it!

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.310
I told you.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.110
I can break apart my flames

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.320
and make them fly in as many pieces as I wish.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.750
Burning is a rather painful way to die.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.080
Use that dagger to kill yourself.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.020
I was conceited.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.410
I couldn't imagine his flames

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.460
standing a chance against my swordsmanship.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.480
I'll be a good sport and burn to death after all.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:43.160
Since I was defeated by your powers,
it is only due courtesy.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.690
It would be disrespectful to kill myself.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.260
Even now, you remember to be chivalrous.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.780
And you did not throw your
dagger when I had my back turned.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.600
Despite having orders from DIO,
your proud honor shines through.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.160
It would be a shame to kill you.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.690
There must be a reason behind his actions...

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.650
Jojo!

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.570
Yeah.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:21.160
Ugh. Those tentacles are so gross!

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.860
Jotaro, hurry up and get it out.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.410
Shut up, old man.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.410
Hurry! Hurry!

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.680
Good! Now that the flesh bud is gone,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.280
we can be <i>bud</i>dies. Ta-da!

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.400
Kakyoin, don't guys like him
who make stupid puns

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.520
seriously piss you off?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.810
The boat that we had chartered
from the Speedwagon crew

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.310
yesterday should be at the harbor now.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.690
What's wrong? Is there
something else you needed,

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.710
Polnareff?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.570
I haven't thanked you for
freeing me from DIO's spell yet.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.240
For that, you need to thank Jojo.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.020
Don't need it.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.290
It appears there's no one
to accept your kind thanks.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.730
All right. I don't like to be pushy, either.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.840
But there is something else.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:22.220
Monsieur Joestar, I'd like to ask
you a very bizarre question.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.220
A bizarre question?

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.640
Forgive my curiosity,

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.430
but even while eating,
you didn't take off your gloves.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.480
Your left arm wouldn't happen
to be a right arm, would it?

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.560
What? My left arm, a right arm?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.070
That is indeed a bizarre question.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.570
What do you mean?

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.200
I'm looking for the man
who killed my younger sister.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.300
I don't know his face.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.580
But he has two right arms.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.590
I lost it in a battle fifty years ago.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.100
I apologize for my rudeness. Please forgive me.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.850
If you don't mind, tell us what happened.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.360
It's been three years now...

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.120
My younger sister was walking home from school

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.680
with a classmate one rainy day.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.540
It was a country road in my native France.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.240
On the side of the road, a man stood

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.970
with his back to them.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.900
Mysteriously, even though it was raining,

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.170
the rain fell around him in a dome-like shape,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.870
as if an invisible screen surrounded him.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.060
Suddenly, as if cut down by a scythe,

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.180
her classmate's chest was sliced open.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.010
And then...

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.890
My sister was shamed and killed.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.510
That was all that man wanted.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.660
Barely escaping death,
her friend somehow survived.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.160
She said that she didn't see his face,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.490
but both of his arms were right arms.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.590
No one believed her testimony,
but I understood it!

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.390
Because I believed that man
may have a similar power to the

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.850
one that I had been keeping a secret.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.600
He's definitely a Stand user.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.770
I swore!

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.590
My sister's soul would not be able

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.880
to rest unless he atoned with his death!

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.490
I will use my Stand for retribution!

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:56.450
Menacing

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.530
Then, a year ago, I met DIO.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.090
Blam

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.980
I see s-something in the crystal ball.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:19.480
It's...

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.180
A vision. I didn't create it.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.490
What's inside your heart is
being projected via my powers.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.570
How about it?

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.610
Would you like to be friends with me?

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.550
Something is bothering you. You're in pain.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:46.500
Stick with me,
and it'll disappear from your heart.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.490
What's being shown in the
crystal is what pains you, yes?

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.010
Let me help you.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.820
I have pain of my own...

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.170
My body cannot go out into the sunlight.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.950
So please, help me, as well.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.010
I shall find this man for you.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.470
And then I was ordered to kill you.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.860
I believed that was the right thing to do.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.950
It's partially because of the flesh bud,

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.950
but DIO's also skilled at manipulating others.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.210
Indeed. But according to what you just said,

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.480
it would appear that DIO has
found the man with two right arms

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.930
and has joined forces with him.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.140
I've decided to go to Egypt with all of you!

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.440
If I go after DIO,

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.810
I'll be able to find the
one who took my sister's life!

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.260
What should we do?

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.890
I have no objections.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.980
I'm sure you'd follow us, even if we said no.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.540
Jean Pierre Polnareff.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:58.690
Jean Pierre Polnareff

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.440
Stand name: Silver Chariot.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:58.690
Silver Chariot

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.700
Powers: Fast and precise swordsmanship!

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.110
It's an honor.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.850
Good grie—

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.550
Excuse me!

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.500
Would you mind taking our picture?

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.600
He's amazing.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.460
I'm going to use this as my chance.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.430
Thank you!

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.600
We want our backs toward the ocean.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.800
You're annoying me! Ask someone else!

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.750
Now, now, now, now...

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.970
I'll take your picture for you.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.180
Come, come.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.940
You have very nice legs.
Let's get a full body shot.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.370
Ooh, nice!

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.860
I'm going to take one more.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.690
Très bien!

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.980
Just like the button,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.530
I want to push, push, push
your hearts toward mine!

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.200
I don't quite understand his personality.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.460
That was a very sudden change of mood.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.460
More like his head and his lower
half are very clearly separated.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.480
Good grief.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.640
Can't you do something about that uniform?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.870
Students should act like students.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.150
Bring it on! I'll take you!

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.740
Was that a Stand user?

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.740
If a Stand user inhales any cigarette smoke at all...

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 6:

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Dark Blue Moon

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.030
By the way...
