Wh-What? What did you just say, Jotaro?!

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.870
You heard me.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.050
Are you so old that your
hearing's gone, old man?

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.250
I said I was going to declare my pitch.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.750
I'll throw a straight, high to the outside.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.800
Jotaro!

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.090
Will you believe me or not?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.120
Are you stupid?

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.440
Vrrrr

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.920
My Stand can see my opponent's soul,
as if with night vision.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.860
No matter who a person might be,
the soul does not lie.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.410
Yes or no? Right or left?

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.830
When the question is asked,
I know what they will choose.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.720
Outside or inside? High or low?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.460
A change-up or a straight?

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.020
I can know the answer 100% of the time.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.830
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.830
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.130
Episode 42  The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 1

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.430
A straight, high to the outside?

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.180
Yes or no?

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.140
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.100
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.460
Jotaro is not lying.
A straight, high to the outside...

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.040
He's really going to throw that.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.650
What's he trying to do?

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.070
Apparently, he defeated my brother by bluffing,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.800
but does he actually think he can intimidate me?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.110
What a fool.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.160
I'm pitching.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.630
Don't forget that the game will be called
once there's an 11-point difference.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.010
Curve

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.410
What?! It was a change-up!

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.850
It shot through! Impossible! It turned!

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.850
And it's a hit!

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.400
But the infielder throws to first,
and the batter's out.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.120
I-Impossible.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.390
There was no mistaking that he
chose a high straight to the outside.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.930
Even if he were a holy man like the Buddha,
or a genius con artist like my brother,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.880
he couldn't possibly control
his own soul like that.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.800
I'm going with a high straight
to the outside again.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.340
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.970
O-Once again, he's not lying. He's serious!

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.430
Jotaro... You're not cheating, are you?

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.390
I do! I do! I do! I do!

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.100
What?!

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.650
He is cheating?!

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.230
A forkball, low to the inside!

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.140
Pop-up fly to the pitcher.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.060
Out!

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.650
You cheated... Jotaro, you bastard!

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.280
You rigged the console somehow!

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.040
No! No! No! No! No! No!

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.040
What?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.790
It's not rigged?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.690
I know that you're cheating!

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.260
What kind of trick is it?

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.380
H-He's not responding.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.460
Damn it! The question has
to be a yes or no question!

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.270
It seems your mind-reading questions
can only be answered with a yes or no.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.690
Your brother liked to say this...

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.600
It's not cheating if you don't get caught.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.700
It's not cheating if you don't get caught?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.130
How dare you speak like you know it all?!
Who do you think you're talking to?!

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.580
Pitch, Jotaro!

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.880
I'll figure out your trick,
and drag your soul out!

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.980
Now, then. Shall we continue?

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.240
My next pitch will be...

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.460
A straight, high and to the outside.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.090
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.370
Jotaro's soul is not lying.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.490
He's serious about throwing
a high outside straight.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.870
I'll figure it out! I'll figure it out!

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.090
I will figure out this trick!

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.190
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.390
His soul's will hasn't changed.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.800
It's still saying "yes."
He's really going to throw that.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.050
Here it comes!

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.770
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.380
It's still saying "yes."  He threw a straight!

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.260
But it dropped! It's a forkball!

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.100
What?! It changed course!

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.690
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.940
Bottom of the 1st

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.940
Out! Three outs, change!

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.320
I don't understand!
I don't know how he's cheating!

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.140
Up to the very last moment,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.770
Jotaro's soul intended to throw a straight.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.210
And yet the pitch changed!

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.280
Why?! Why the hell is that happening?!

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.970
I will defeat you, D'Arby.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.560
Shut up!

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.720
Th-The fact that you took off
your school cap is suspicious.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.780
The cheating started as soon
as you took off your school cap!

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.410
Get up! I'm going to inspect
your seat and controller.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.820
D-Damn it! I don't get it. I don't know how,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.720
but that cap is how you're cheating!

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.780
I'm right, aren't I?!

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.660
No! No! No! No!

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.500
Your trick is somewhere around here, right?!

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.330
No! No! No! No!

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.000
You're using Star Platinum
to cheat, aren't you?!

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.920
No! No! No! No!

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.720
You rigged something, didn't you, Jotaro?!

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.300
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.090
God damn it! I... I can read people's souls!

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.330
I can read your soul, Jotaro!

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.810
But why are all the pitches
different from my readings?!

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.090
He, uh... looks like he's aged a bit.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.350
He doesn't look like a kid
in his twenties anymore.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.700
D'Arby, it's your turn to pitch.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.090
Hurry up and throw.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.480
Four to three...

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.330
I can win one run back in no time.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.510
I'm a genius when it comes to games.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.030
There's no way I can lose.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.940
I'm a genius when it comes to games!
There's no way I can lose!

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.420
My mind, too...

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.550
Schooled through many battles, it is invincible!

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.120
An expert at games is an expert at life!

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.290
I won't let this damage me!

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.850
It's in! It's a home run!

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.770
The Jaguars score their fifth run!

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.610
It's five to three!

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.140
Sh-Shit! I accidentally let go of his soul!

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.420
Kakyoin's soul and
consciousness have returned!

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.370
N-No! No! I haven't admitted defeat!

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.840
It was an accident!
I let go of his soul by accident!

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.600
If his soul was set free,
that means that your own soul

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.190
has admitted defeat.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.560
What?!

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.780
J-Joseph's Stand...
It's coming out of the controller.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.410
O-Oh, whoops.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.380
S-Something so stupid...

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.900
The cheat was... The one manipulating
the controller... Damn it...

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:21.310
It wasn't Jotaro controlling it,
but you, Joseph Joestar!

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.170
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.730
That's right, D'Arby.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.430
I'm sure your brother would have
been able to figure this out easily.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.930
Bam

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.900
By the way, old man.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.690
I'm glad you caught on to
my idea without a signal.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.880
Of course I can tell what you're thinking!

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.910
You're my grandson.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.640
Snap out of it, Kakyoin.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.040
D-Damn it... From behind...

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.540
Now, then.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.590
All that's left is to dispose of him.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.630
P-Please forgive me!
I gave you Kakyoin's soul back!

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.800
Everything's back to normal now!

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.300
Forgive me, please? Please? Please?

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.650
If you want to know if we'll forgive you,

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.550
why don't you read our souls?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.310
No! No! No! No! No!

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.710
Here's a question. Will I hit you
with my right fist or my left?

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.740
Try to guess.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.240
P-Please, just hit me quickly with your right.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.240
No! No! No! No! No!

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.990
Y-Your left?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.290
No! No! No! No! No!

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.500
I-Is it both?!

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.110
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:44.750
Yes!

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.260
Are you going to do the "ora ora" thing?!

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.890
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh my God!

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.510
D'Arby Younger
Unable to Recover (Must Retire)

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.180
D'Arby Younger has retired.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.900
Looks like we broke through some sort of wall.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.700
We can get out there, Jotaro! Kakyoin!

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.100
Good grief.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.500
Forgive me for interrupting your rest.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.880
I believe that you are aware of this,
but about ten minutes ago,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.380
Joestar and his party infiltrated the mansion.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.860
Also, I must report that D'Arby has fallen.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.700
D'Arby was a genius.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.380
Why do you think D'Arby lost,
despite having the ability to win?

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.360
Come in, Cool Ice.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.170
Pardon me.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:17.170
The Joestars truly believe, from the bottom
of their hearts, that they are willing

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.210
to throw away their own lives to save

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.320
the one who is Joseph's
daughter and Jotaro's mother.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.900
Kakyoin and the other two...

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.750
Hmm...

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.240
Right. Avdol and Polnareff have also decided

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.970
they would risk their lives in order to defeat me.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.220
It appears they think that

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.710
running from me means running from life itself.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.690
How truly foolish.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.750
But it seems that foolish
notion is important to them.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.180
D'Arby had sworn fealty to me,

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.010
but it seems he was not ready to die for me.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.190
That's why he wasn't able to win in the end.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.410
D'Arby will never know why he lost.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.570
Ice...

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.280
Look at the wound on my neck.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.520
It's likely that if I drink the
blood of one more person,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.070
this body of Jonathan Joestar's,
which has resisted me,

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.760
will fall completely under my control,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.810
and this wound shall be healed.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.040
Ice...

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.250
Will you offer me your blood?

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.920
Yes. With pleasure.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.600
Please accept this!

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.590
You removed your own head...

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.270
That makes me happy.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.550
But Cool Ice...

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.330
I cannot accept blood from
someone of your caliber.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.060
I shall heal my wound with another's blood.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.760
There's no need for you to die.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.980
Return to life with my blood.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.990
With your resolve,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.560
I have no doubt that you will triumph.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.750
Lord DIO...

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.680
It truly is best to have your own body.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.910
It's immediately compatible.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.780
I will leave them to you, Cool Ice.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.860
Lord DIO...

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.710
I will live up to your expectations.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.700
I shall eliminate them all, without fail.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.650
Open the door if you're going to leave.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:25.440
After all, your Stand can disappear
completely from this world.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.960
Cool Ice

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.290
The ten minutes we promised them have passed.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.960
Mr. Joestar said to set fire to the place,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.060
but let us enter the mansion instead.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.760
Yeah.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.400
Polnareff, before we go in,
there's something I'd like to say.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:54.020
Even if you were to get lost or
severely injured within this mansion,

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.940
I do not plan to help you.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.320
The same goes for you, Iggy.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.260
It might sound cold,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.620
but we are on this journey to defeat DIO.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.190
Promise me that even if I am defeated

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.520
or become separated from you,
you will not stop to help me.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.240
You must think of your own safety first.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.030
We cannot allow all of us to be defeated
as we try to save one another.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.070
Yeah, I got it, Avdol.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.230
If we get out of here alive,
you'd better treat me to a fancy dinner.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:35.620
And Iggy, too.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.150
All right, let's go in.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.900
Silver Chariot!

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.420
Hey, Avdol. What do we do?

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.270
It looks like it goes on forever.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.850
Mr. Joestar said to set fire to the mansion,

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.560
but in a labyrinth like this,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.200
setting a fire would put us in danger.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.230
More importantly...

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.360
Magician's Red!

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.500
This flame detects lifeforms.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.890
It can sense breathing, cutaneous respiration,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.270
and the movements of both humans and animals.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.500
It can also sense another Stand's energy.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.510
Let us observe it as we navigate this maze.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.850
Why are there six flames linked together?

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.360
Each one points to the front, back, left,
right, up, and down, respectively.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.880
As long as it's within fifteen meters,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.310
it can tell how big something is
and which direction it's in.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.350
Mr. Joestar and the others
were dragged underground.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.570
Let's head down.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.070
The flame has already picked up something.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.630
There's something to our left.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.450
What?!

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.750
The Fool!

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.350
Hey, hey. Wh-Who the hell is that guy?!

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.100
Look around us, Polnareff!

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.100
Huh?!

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.100
The mansion's maze has disappeared!

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.360
It appears he was the Stand user
that created that illusion.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.290
It was instantaneous, but Iggy defeated him.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.120
Name: Billie Jean
Stand Power: Illusions   Retired without a fight

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.120
His name was Billie Jean, and he
was retired without even a fight!

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.870
So the mansion has been
restored to its normal state.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.870
The flames aren't picking
up any signs of life.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.090
After you see this
writing and turn around,
you will...

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.470
After you see this
writing and turn around,
you will...

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.350
After you see this
writing and turn around,
you will...

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.640
After you see this
writing and turn around,
you will...
<font size="30">die.</c>

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.180
Die

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.100
There is no change in the flames.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.820
Iggy's nose hasn't picked up anything, either.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.280
Wh-What is that?!

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.330
Impossible! Iggy's nose and my
flames didn't sense him at all!

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.050
He appeared out of nowhere!

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.040
Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.790
H-Hey, Avdol! Where are you?

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.400
Wh-What was that just now?

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.010
Wh-What are th-those arms...?

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.090
H-Hey, Avdol!

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.370
Where'd you go?!

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.950
Avdol!

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.460
Where are you?!

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.050
Avdol!

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.850
Avdol!

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.430
Wh-What the hell is that?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.260
Where did he come from?

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.520
Why didn't Avdol's flames sense him?

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.730
Hey, Iggy!

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.100
You couldn't smell him with your nose?

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.350
Answer me!

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.480
Where are you, Avdol?!

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.150
Where did you go?!

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.980
Avdol...

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.410
has been disintegrated. He is dead.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.590
I do not know where the void
inside my mouth leads,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.090
but it is a dimension of darkness.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.180
I sent him there.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.220
You two are next.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:22.090
I must correct your arrogant belief
that you can defeat Lord DIO.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.650
One by one... In order, in order...

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.160
I shall scatter you throughout
my dimension of darkness.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.490
You're lying...

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.710
Saying that...

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.310
That you killed Avdol...

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.800
Don't lie to me!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.480
Is fate telling me to live on?

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.060
I heard another wall fall down.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:29.960
More sounds of destruction?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.090
He's full of spite.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.760
I will eliminate you.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.810
Don't let his spite overcome you!

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.940
There's no time to deal with the pain...

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.030
Suck on my sword and die!

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 43

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 2
