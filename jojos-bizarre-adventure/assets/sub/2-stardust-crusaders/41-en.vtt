00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.400
They're coming out of the tunnel!

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.180
Oh! D'Arby is ahead!

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.700
He's ahead by a car length!

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.750
My speed will be doubled.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.740
I have won!

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.540
No!

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.820
You have less power left than me, D'Arby!

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.700
Which means...

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.930
Kakyoin's #28...

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.350
spun and knocked D'Arby's car off the course!

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.960
And it was going at 850 kilometers per hour!

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.370
He's out of the course!

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030
Kakyoin's #28 safely landed.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.910
Yes!

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.450
The one with less power goes flying.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.230
It seems you were wrong to think
that losing power wouldn't matter.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.590
You didn't realize that I intentionally
dropped a length behind you,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.300
so I could knock you off the course.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.500
Really?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.500
It's you who didn't realize.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.180
Losing power was all part of my plan.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.020
I lost power on purpose so you'd
push my car off the course!

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.570
This battle isn't over yet!

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.770
Look at the direction my machine is flying!

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.020
What?!

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.970
I-It flew over the curve and landed
further ahead on the course!

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.240
I-Impossible!

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.340
That's right. Normally, it's impossible.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.570
Even at 850 kilometers per hour, once you're
off the course, you crash into the ground.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.460
You could never reach the
next part of the course.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.720
But Kakyoin, if you were to slam into me,
it would become possible.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.470
I just needed you to send me flying!

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.300
It was all part of my plan to reduce
my power, then have you hit me.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.980
Now, then...

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.730
Shall we continue the race, Kakyoin?

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.590
Don't admit defeat, Kakyoin!

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.830
Kakyoin!

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.360
I now hold his soul in my hands.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.920
He has just admitted defeat.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.130
He admitted within his heart that
it was pointless to continue this race.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.800
But Kakyoin, you are the first
to ever make me sweat like this.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.070
This doll is now an especially
valuable part of my collection.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.680
He is the first opponent to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.820
overcome his fears and not make any mistakes

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.450
due to mental weakness.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.750
K-Kakyoin!

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.240
I shall treasure it,
and take very good care of it.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.420
Now, now.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.290
I'd like to warn you against
attacking me in retaliation.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.110
No, not just attacking me.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.110
If I were to slip on a banana
peel and hit my head,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.620
or choke on a piece of gum,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.690
or die of a heart attack from the bang
of an inflated popcorn bag being popped,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.700
Kakyoin's soul would pass on
to the realm beyond this life.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.020
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.020
Stardust Crusaders

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.800
Episode 41  D'Arby the Player, Part 2

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.080
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.030
J-Jotaro?

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.720
Oh?

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.000
Hey, Jotaro! Why are you sitting down?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.350
I'll defeat him! I'm next!

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.080
Old man, have you played any one of
these games more than Kakyoin has?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.180
Stay out of this, old man.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.150
This isn't like playing cards or hanafuda.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.290
Next is baseball.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.460
I want you to play this baseball game with me.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.460
I'll wager my soul.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.970
Good. And I shall wager Kakyoin's.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.140
I have retrieved my Stand
Atum's arm from your arm.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.490
Now that I have Kakyoin's soul,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.110
there's no point in holding
on to your arm anymore.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.770
It would put my Stand at a disadvantage

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.530
to fight you with only one arm.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.070
Your Star Platinum's movements are
extremely fast and super precise.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.270
But to think that you'd pick this baseball game...

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.500
This is the game I'm best at.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.030
D'Arby! As soon as you lose
to Jotaro, I will finish you.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.640
Remember that.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.710
Kaboom

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.230
Oh! That's A Baseball!

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.890
There is no trickery in this game.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.150
I've confirmed that.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.010
First, please pick your team.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.320
The Jaguars.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.430
Jaguars!

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.950
I see.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.180
So you've chosen a team with a strong offense.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.280
Two of your players have
batting averages over .400.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.550
Then I shall choose the Red Dragons.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.570
Red Dragons!

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.340
Would you like to bat first
or second? Take your pick.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.680
First.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.270
Very well. The Jaguars are up first.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.080
You can draw your own characters
to input as the players.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.670
This is Star Platinum.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.500
Input. Now, let us play ball!

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.660
Jaguars versus Red Dragons.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.100
Play ball!

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.590
Top of the 1st

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:05.260
I've chosen #15 to be my pitcher,
since I was born on January 5th.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.110
Here I go.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.980
The pitcher is winding up.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.070
The first pitch!

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.940
What?!

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.070
Strike!

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.060
H-Hey, Jotaro. What did you just do?

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.620
You swung the bat before the
ball even left the pitcher's hand!

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:43.460
H-Hey, Jotaro... Why do you
keep taking practice swings?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.680
Don't tell me... Could it be that you...

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.140
Have you played this baseball game—No,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.170
have you ever played <i>any</i> video game before?

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.170
Answer me, Jotaro!

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.520
Whatever. I know the rules for baseball.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.030
I'll figure out the controls as I go.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.320
Wh-What?!

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.130
That ridiculous, terribly-timed swing!

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.860
The way you're working the controls...

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.560
This is your first time playing <i>any</i> game, isn't it?!

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.000
Strike two!

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.710
This time, you swung the bat
after the ball hit the mitt!

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.060
You're a total amateur!

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.810
God damn it, Jotaro!

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.810
You've never played a
video game before, have you?!

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.560
Strike! Batter out!

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.350
Stop messing around, Jotaro!

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.840
Why are you putting on that attitude?!

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.680
You wagered your own soul!
You can't back out now!

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.000
Good grief.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.130
You should be supportive at times like this.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.170
"It's just the first inning.
You've only just started.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.050
You can do it, Jotaro." Like that.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.040
What are you thinking?

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.340
Even with your Star Platinum's
super precise movements,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.150
did you think you could beat him with
no knowledge of video games at all?

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.490
What are you thinking, Jotaro?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.720
What on Earth are you thinking?!

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.270
Jotaro...

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.290
Let me warn you that if, on the other hand,

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.990
this is some plan to trick me
by acting like an amateur,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.680
it's not going to work.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.320
No matter the situation,
I never let down my guard.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.300
Once my opponent has wagered
his soul, even if he is an infant,

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.950
I would give my all to defeat him.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.310
Old man.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.740
I'm not thinking about anything.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.370
Except...

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.590
about breaking that asshole's nose,

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:52.260
as he sits there so certain that he'll
never lose to anyone in this game.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.770
I'm only seriously thinking about
getting Kakyoin's soul back.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.360
You can say what you'd like...

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.150
But it's still the top of the
first inning with one out.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.900
Let us continue the game.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.350
Please don't forget that if one of us

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.760
takes an eleven-point lead,
the game will be called.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.160
Second batter, #3.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.460
Strike!

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.050
Th-This can't be happening!

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.480
This time, the ball was at
least 40 centimeters away

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.340
from where he swung the bat!

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.430
Strike two!

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.140
Not even close!

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.950
Strike! Batter out!

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.150
It's no use.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.910
The difference in ability is too obvious.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.250
At this rate, it's as if a tea ceremony club,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.450
where nobody's ever held a bat,
decided to challenge a championship team.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.280
It's too pathetic.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.450
Strike!

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.420
Strike two!

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.780
It seems he truly is an amateur. He's too weak!

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.510
I think I now understand how a judo master feels

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.310
when he can gauge his opponent's strength simply

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.690
from how he puts on his gi.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.600
When it comes to video games,
Jotaro is indeed an amateur.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.730
But I will never let my guard down.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.350
I've memorized the weaknesses of
all the batters in this game.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.750
Next will be a low pitch to the outside.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.860
I'll throw my ultimate screwball and strike
out all three without a single run.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.030
Top of the first, two outs,
two strikes and no balls.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.410
Here comes my next pitch.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.660
Go ahead.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.910
I've pretty much learned how to bat now.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.380
What? What did he just say?

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.690
"How to bat"? What?

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.680
Did he just say "pretty much learned"?

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.260
What is he talking about? What does he mean?!

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.230
What?!

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.750
Jotaro!

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.610
Good. This game is pretty fun.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.360
H-Hey, don't tell me...

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.530
It's still going. The ball is still in the air!

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.570
What did he say just now?!

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.930
"I've pretty much learned how to bat now."

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.330
Learned? Did he just say learned?!

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.240
I-It's fair!

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.110
Y-You're kidding! You're kidding me!

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.280
Home run!

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.040
Home run! A home run!

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.650
Jotaro! You bastard!

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.950
Atum

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.950
D'Arby Younger

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.050
Jotaro!

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.180
What did you just say?

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.170
"Learned"? "I've pretty much learned
how to bat"? Is that what you said?!

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.460
There's no reason for me to say it again.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.100
He was, without a doubt, a beginner.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.340
Is he saying that he managed to learn
the controls by swinging eight times?

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:25.350
Jotaro Kujo has Star Platinum,
who has the power of super precise movement.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.590
Now I know exactly why

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.020
Lord DIO sees him as a problem,
and why my brother lost.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.450
Interesting. This is how my opponents should be.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.540
And you exposed this fearsome

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:47.910
characteristic of yours in the top of
the first inning, right after we started...

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.120
You'll eventually regret that.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.380
Let us continue the game, Jotaro.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.100
He did it!

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.130
It's fair! It's fair!

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.580
He got another home run!

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.320
Now it's four to nothing in the top of the first.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.520
Looks like you've got the
hang of this game, Jotaro.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.860
Keep this up! Keep it up!

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.980
Hey, D'Arby.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.950
I'm sure you don't want to hear this,
but I'll say it as a kindness.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:29.120
If you return Kakyoin's soul
right now and take us to DIO,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.410
Menacing

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.800
we'll spare your life.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.900
My brother was a master at gambling,

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.080
and a master at cheating.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:55.020
Yet he never said to me, "Brother,
why don't we play a game of poker?"

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.440
Not even once.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.850
Do you know why that is?

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:06.360
When I was fifteen,
my brother hit on my girlfriend.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.720
I beat the shit out of him,
even though he was ten years older.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.220
I broke his ribs and kicked him
until he vomited blood.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.460
To that, all my brother
had to say was, "I'm sorry."

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.620
Do you know why?

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.920
What are you getting at, you bastard?

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:26.740
My brother knew ever since we were children
that he had no way of beating me.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.430
He knew there was a reason he couldn't win.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.060
And now, it appears as if Jotaro is getting
excited and really taking off with this game.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:40.680
However, he's uncertain,
just like my brother was as a child.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.870
He's uncertain about my abilities.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.690
"Nah, it couldn't be. Or wait, maybe..."
That's what he's been thinking.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.130
Right, Jotaro?

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.950
What the hell are you talking about?

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.970
I'm changing pitchers! I'll switch #15 for #77.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.960
#                Name             G W L H S ERA

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:03.970
#77 is a fastball pitcher, whose fastest pitch clocks in at 165 kilometers per hour.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.960
Number

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.960
Right-handed
Pitching Speed: 165km/h
 Specialty: Throws fastballs,
but can only throw
straights and forkballs.
Power Level: 4
ERA: 5.23

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.050
And I will declare what kind
of pitch he will throw.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.560
#77 will now throw

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.560
a forkball straight down the middle.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:22.140
Rumbling

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.150
What?! He just declared his pitch?

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.130
He will throw a forkball right down the middle.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.150
Will you believe me or not?

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.970
Jotaro, he's just playing mind games with you.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.880
Don't let him declaring a pitch get to you.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.080
Throw, D'Arby.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.390
Will you believe me or not?

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.470
Here it comes! It's coming
straight down the middle!

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.820
It's a straight!

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.340
But is it going to remain a straight?!

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.090
Will it fall or not?

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.600
He swung! Jotaro bet on the forkball!

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.060
But it's not falling! It's staying straight!

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.520
He caught the bottom of the ball!

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.480
Out!

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.530
Top of the first, three outs! Change!

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.530
Top of the 1st

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.400
How could you be so stupid?!

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.890
You actually believed him

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.460
and swung for a forkball!

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:19.890
No.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.180
He was certain that I would swing for a forkball,

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.600
so he changed it to a straight fastball.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.720
As he said, ever since we entered
this mansion, I've been uncertain.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.390
He somehow knew that Star Platinum
would throw a right punch.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.200
I-Impossible! So are you telling me

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.750
that he's reading your mind?

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.450
Next is the bottom of the first.
It's my turn on offense.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.540
This is a declaration that I will hit a home run.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.700
I shall hit the ball you throw into the left stands.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.510
Old man. You're certain that the game

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.480
and console aren't rigged in any way, right?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.440
There's no chance of that.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.180
And I've been keeping my eye
out for any kind of cheating.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.270
That means the secret lies with his Stand.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.940
It doesn't just take souls.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.480
It has some kind of secret power.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.490
The course of action I'll take is...

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.300
This should tell me something.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.750
What?! He's going to try to
hit the batter on purpose?

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.880
Where might you be aiming to throw? Inside?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.690
Will it be high?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.370
Or low?

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.750
Are you planning some sort of trick?

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.690
What?! He dodged at the same
time as the pitch was thrown!

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.230
Bazoom

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.900
H-He read that! He perfectly read it!

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:17.490
There's no way he could have done
that without reading Jotaro's mind.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.790
Home run!

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.290
That's one run.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.230
I-Impossible.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.110
We've met all kinds up until now,

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.650
but we've never seen a
Stand that could read minds.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.240
If it can read minds, then will no
amount of intelligence or power

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.730
s-stand any chance against it?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.810
Wh-What are you going to do, Jotaro?!

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.320
Bottom of the 1st

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.320
Bam

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.070
Damn it! H-He's declaring another home run.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.330
Will the next one be outside?

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.660
And low?

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.900
Or will it be a straight?

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.220
Clang

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.040
Home run!

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.100
Four to two.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.190
By analyzing various data
and the situation you're in,

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.580
you can figure out how an
opponent's mind works, to an extent.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:35.990
But this Stand can anticipate the
ball's course with perfect precision.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.530
And he's not cheating!

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.470
Another home run! It's four to three!

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.210
How can we stop him from reading our minds?

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.550
How?

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.940
I'm going to turn this around soon.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.260
Now, will the next one be inside?

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.470
Down the middle? High? A changeup?

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.810
I wonder where it'll go.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.810
Your hat...

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.510
Heh, you fool.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.320
Do you think I'm using underhanded
methods, like my brother?

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.260
Jotaro, that's not it!

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.070
Hiding behind your hat won't help.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.320
He's not reading the reflection
of the screen in your eyes.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.730
And it's not a trick where
he's listening to your fingers

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.580
as they push the buttons to figure
out what you're going to do.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.480
I've been watching him.
That's not what's going on.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.030
This is the first time I've
sweat or bled in a while.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.120
That's why I took it off.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.380
I'd like you to hurry up
and throw your next pitch.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.820
But I don't think I have to
worry about sweating anymore.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.390
I'm going to declare my pitch.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.140
It's going to be a straight,
high to the outside.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.850
What?

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.900
Wh-What? What did you just say, Jotaro?!

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.520
You heard me.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:23:08.110
Menacing

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.420
Are you so old that your
hearing's gone, old man?

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.860
I said I was going to declare my pitch.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.910
I'll throw a straight, high to the outside.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.120
Jotaro!

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:22.340
Menacing

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.330
Will you believe me or not?

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.570

I said I was going to declare my pitch.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.920
Jotaro is not lying.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.410
Yes.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.930
You rigged the console somehow!

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:34.440
No.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.820
Your school hat proves that you're cheating!

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.990
It's not cheating if you don't get caught.
