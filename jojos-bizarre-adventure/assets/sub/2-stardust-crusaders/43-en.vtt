What the hell is that?

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.740
Why didn't Avdol's flames sense him?

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.830
Where are you, Avdol?!

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.060
Avdol...

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.690
has been disintegrated. He is dead.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.130
You two are next.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.900
I must correct your arrogant belief
that you can defeat Lord DIO.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.260
One by one... In order...

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.850
I shall scatter you throughout
my dimension of darkness.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.090
You're lying...

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.580
Saying that

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.310
you killed Avdol...

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.040
Don't lie to me!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.790
Wh-What?

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.860
I hadn't heard

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.300
that Polnareff's Stand was so fast,
or could attack at this distance.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.470
Look over here, damn it! You piece of shit!

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.200
Slice

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.190
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.190
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.680
Episode 43  The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 2

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.720
What was that?

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.130
Just when I thought the illusion had gone away,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.280
I heard the sound of a wall
breaking somewhere in the mansion.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.690
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.190
Could it be Avdol and Polnareff?

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.050
Damn it! I know I hit him, b-but he's not dead...

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.500
They suddenly shrank and
disappeared into their dimension.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.130
The user and the Stand both...

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.900
Avdol... God damn it.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.520
You're... You're the one who said...

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.940
Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.450
You said if something happened,
we had to think of ourselves first.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.670
You said you wouldn't save me.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.560
You liar!

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.420
Ever since India, all you've done is
meddle in other people's problems!

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.880
Avdol! You should have just left me alone!

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.020
If I hadn't crouched down just then,
I would have been killed.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.790
Is fate telling me to live on?

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.550
Is Avdol's will telling me to fight?

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.880
It's too dangerous to stay in this room.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.130
Let's move, Iggy!

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.240
Grar

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.750
Up there, Iggy!

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.510
Go upstairs! Up those stairs!

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.650
That's the exit! That's the door we came in.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.100
But we can't go out that way.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.300
Avdol sacrificed himself to save us.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.200
Because he believed that we could defeat DIO.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.460
I can't betray the trust of someone like that!

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.190
Running away now is what a loser would do.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.380
I'm not running away.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.620
I'm running to get to that bastard, DIO!

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.360
Let's run straight to him!

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.200
And I thought they'd go for the exit. So close...

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.010
I'm impressed that he managed to injure me.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.200
It is indeed true that Polnareff

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.480
has a mindset that allows him
to conquer fear and face danger.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.470
Without a doubt, I will corner
and kill him. Without a doubt...

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.980
My Stand is far stronger than he is.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.480
The inside of his Stand's mouth
is a dimension of darkness?!

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.460
I can't even imagine what that dimension is like,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.110
but it lets him get close without any
sounds, smells, or other signs of life.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.260
But how...

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.270
How am I supposed to beat that guy?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.080
H-He cut us off!

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.170
He's nearby.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.670
He's here!

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.970
Iggy, watch my back!

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.730
I'll watch yours.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.170
He can't come through without
breaking a hole in the wall.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.060
What I do know is that

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.430
the moment he shows himself
from that dimension of darkness

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.460
is when we'll have our chance to kill him.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.840
Come at me, damn it! I'll cut you in half!

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.190
Right now, my Chariot is incredibly fast.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.970
Because of how angry I am at losing Avdol!

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.230
What?! H-He's in the crack under my foot?!

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.700
Chario—

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.110
Grar

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.750
My foot!

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.130
First, I've taken your foot,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.350
so you won't be able to run around or escape!

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.140
Bastard!

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.200
Whoa, there.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.400
Mr. Joestar! The sound of another wall breaking!

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.900
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.120
Avdol and the others are in this
mansion, and they're fighting.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.710
Hurry! We have to find them!

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.370
You managed to hide during
the confusion, Polnareff.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.170
But it's no use.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.230
With that foot, you can't go far.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.420
You're probably under some rubble nearby.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.480
You are powerless before me.
Without a doubt, I will defeat you.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.860
Now, where are you, Polnareff?

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.900
What's all this noise, Cool Ice?

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.790
L-Lord DIO!

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.800
Please be careful!

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.410
Polnareff and that dog are hiding nearby.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.210
Please leave this to me.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.890
You need not personally trouble
yourself with this, Lord DIO.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.720
The fake DIO we made using The Fool tricked him.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.980
Usually, I'd feel guilty about attacking
someone from behind like a coward,

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.460
but since that's how you killed Avdol,
I don't feel even a shred of pity!

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.250
It's exactly how you deserve to die!

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.900
Do it, Iggy!

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.970
Cream

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.970
Cool Ice

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.280
Do it, Iggy!

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.220
Break through his scapula,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.480
and split him open to the hip,
like a mackerel!

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.070
No! Damn it!

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.250
He figured it out!

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.390
Sunlight streams through this room's windows.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.320
The real Lord DIO would never

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.170
leave his room to enter this place.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.540
Iggy!

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.980
The real Lord DIO told me he trusts me,
and that he would leave this to me!

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.650
So, no matter what happens, he would
never descend to this second floor!

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.600
Shit! He's going to kill Iggy!

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.110
Iggy will be swallowed up by
that dimension of darkness!

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.860
You shitty little mutt! How dare you?!

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.880
You made me destroy an image of Lord DIO!

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.970
Wh-What the hell? He punched him!

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.930
He didn't use his dimension of darkness!

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.510
He punched Iggy across
the room without killing him!

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.530
Of all things...

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.220
Even if it was a fake Lord DIO made of sand,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.850
how dare you make me strike him?!

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.790
I'll kick you to death, you bastard!

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.560
It takes but an instant to be swallowed
by my dimension of darkness!

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.030
That is not enough time for my anger to wane!

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.040
This is all your fault! You!

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.870
You're the one who has angered me!

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.500
This is all your fault!

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.330
Learn your lesson!

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.490
How's that?! Learn your lesson!
How's that? How's that?!

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.380
S-Stop...

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.640
Cool Ice isn't right in the head.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.180
This is overkill.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.730
He's mad that he had to attack DIO's image?

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.650
His mind itself is the dimension of darkness!

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:30.320
His mind is the black abyss
that rips everything apart!

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.020
Lord DIO said

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.780
that we cannot underestimate
the power of human resolve.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.510
But you're no more than a filthy dog!

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.700
You don't have resolve,
or a proud soul, or anything like it!

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.640
Stop...

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.590
How's that? And that?

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.590
Stop...

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.890
How's that? And that?!

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.680
Stop it, Cool Ice!

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.670
Bam

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.570
I will end this, Polnareff!

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.510
Damn it!

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.310
He disappeared!

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.080
But...

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.380
Iggy!

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.110
Our fake DIO made of your sand Stand failed,

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.080
but your sand gave me a hint.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.210
I've figured out a way to read his movements!

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.440
I can see him.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.640
I can see the route he's taking!

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.020
Serves you right! I've got you!

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.270
You bastard!

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.330
When you use your dimension to move,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.230
you have to swallow up whatever's in your path.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.260
So swallow this! Swallow the sand
and head this way, you shithead!

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.020
And when your rotten, stinking
mouth appears, that's when

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.530
you're going to crumble!

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.030
I hit him head-on! Hell yeah!

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.300
Your other weakness, Cool Ice,

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.720
appears when you try to confirm my location.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.020
You've got to poke your head out
of your dimension of darkness,

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.050
or you can't see what's outside!

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.560
Suck on that!

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.430
Suck on my sword until you die,
you piece of shit!

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.140
Y-You bastard...

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.990
I pierced your brain stem
through your throat, damn it!

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.750
Hurry up and die! You're mortally wounded!

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.140
Just hurry up and die!

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.310
Die, Cool Ice!

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.060
I will not die.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.890
I do not have time to suffer pain.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.360
Whatever it takes, I will kill you!

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.320
Whatever it takes, I will swallow up Iggy
and kill Joestar and the others!

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.140
I can die after that!

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.780
You bastard!

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.740
A wise move. You've pulled your sword free.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.660
This time, I <i>will</i> send you to hell!

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.540
Is this the vile arm that stabbed me?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.260
You bastard...

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.720
Damn it! I had no choice
but to shove him away!

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.840
Shit!

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.480
Oh, no, you don't!

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.810
I cut it! B-But this isn't good...

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.820
Grar

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.350
Damn it! He got my leg. I can't move.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.220
But I don't have time to
think about pain, either.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.450
And I was so close to finishing him, too!

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.530
This guy is just...

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.320
He's obsessive!

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.460
He's crazy, but he's completely
obsessive about serving DIO!

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.200
I can't let that overwhelm me!

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.090
I can't die until I kill you, either!

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.930
That bastard! Here he comes!

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.320
Take this!

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.090
Grar

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.190
I-It's no use. I cut him, but he
swallowed the tip of my sword!

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.890
It's impossible to attack him when
he's in his dimension of darkness.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.410
I'm just going to get being swallowed up.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.360
He's swallowing up everything
in his path. God damn it!

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.910
Bastard... Since he knows I could attack him,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.800
he's decided to just guess where I might be
and strike anywhere and everywhere!

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.010
He's got good instincts.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.470
At this rate, he'll hit me for sure.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.700
I have to pull back Chariot.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.360
D-Damn it... Iggy's losing blood like crazy.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.040
A bunch of broken bones are piercing his lungs...

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.460
Talk about reckless... The walls are disappearing.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.550
N-No... I had the wrong idea!

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.300
This isn't instinct. His moves are calculated!

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.110
He's moving around in circles,

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.350
and the circles keep getting smaller.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.720
He's on a path like a cyclone...

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.700
No, like a mosquito repellent
coil, closing in on me!

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.330
Even if he doesn't show up

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.650
to see where I am, he'll hit me eventually!

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.250
I'm caught in his trap.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.200
A-Am I going to be able to dodge him with this leg?

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.040
I-I've got to dig through the floor and get away.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.710
It's no use. I don't have enough time!

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.960
He's coming at me!

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.760
I somehow managed to dodge...

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.140
But he's going to keep closing in,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.770
like a needle on a record.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.650
In about five more rounds, he'll be here!

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.600
Now, here's the question...

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.280
How am I going to dodge when
I have this hole in my leg?

There's no way Mr. Joestar and the others,

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.080
who entered the mansion ten minutes earlier,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.050
would show up in the next couple of seconds

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.810
like American comic book heroes—ta-da!—

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.690
and save me at the last minute.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.340
For all I know, Mr. Joestar and the others

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.060
are struggling in their battle, too.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.320
Looks like answer #1 is the only option.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.170
Chariot! Pull me out of the
circle as hard as you can!

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.380
Damn it! Pull me faster!

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.850
I-It's no use!

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.040
Reality is cruel.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.810
My Silver Chariot is a Stand
that cuts things with a sword.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.940
Now that I'm so badly injured,
it doesn't have the power to pull my weight.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.530
Damn it...

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.460
You wreck! Keep still, you idiot!

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.910
If you move or use any more
of your Stand's power,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.970
your broken bones will pierce further
into your lungs, and you'll die!

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.860
What are you trying to act
all tough for, you idiot?!

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.980
Are you trying to save me
so you can die along with me?

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.370
I'm the one who's going to look cool saving you!

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.370
You have to survive and warn Mr. Joestar
and the others about this bastard.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.830
The important thing is to defeat him!

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.540
Avdol saved me, but you
don't need to save me, too!

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.400
If we all die, it's over!

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.750
One more time around,
and he'll come right to me.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.750
The answer is #3.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.560
Reality does not forgive.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.440
Looks like his obsession... wins.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.440

Not to the likes of you!
