Previously, on <i>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</i>...

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.160
Tum-ta-da-da!

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.250
Here he is!

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.850
That bastard Avdol was alive!

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.170
Doo-do-doo!

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.710
It was Mr. Joestar and Jotaro who tended
the wounds on my head and back in India.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.340
I also had Avdol do a little shopping for me.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.810
From here, we'll ride to Egypt in this!

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.520
Y-You're kidding! You really
bought something like this?!

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.490
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.490
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.030
Episode 23: The High Priestess, Part 1

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.340
The Red Sea.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.640
Divers all agree:

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.990
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.860
it is the most beautiful sea in the world.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.160
The east and west shores are both red deserts,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.040
Egypt

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.040
Sudan

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.040
Saudi Arabia

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.540
which is why it's known as the Red Sea.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.030
There are no cities nearby to pollute it,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.800
nor rivers that flow into it.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.520
It is an unsullied sea.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.750
Hey, can you drive this thing, Avdol?

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.860
Tsk, tsk. No problem.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.490
I can drive it, too!

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.470
You're not driving this thing.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.860
I'm not letting you crash us again.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.290
Hmph. My grandson is so harsh.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.280
A submarine, huh...

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.850
This is my first time in one,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.810
but it's not as cramped as I expected.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.190
Yeah. This is a vessel that the rich use
to explore the sea floor for pleasure.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.600
As you see, it even has windows.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.780
Oooh! Nice!

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.060
Whoa.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.150
I've always kind of liked this sort of thing.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.850
I wish I could've ridden it with a cute girl...

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.160
I see you haven't changed, Polnareff.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.440
We didn't come here to play.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.770
What's that?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.020
It's a sonar.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.300
It uses reflected sound waves

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.320
to detect things underwater, a bit like radar.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.700
Wow...

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.030
All clear. Nothing is coming toward us.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.690
With this, we can detect anyone trying
to attack us, from any direction.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.390
But if we were to be attacked in here,
we'd have nowhere to run.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.550
We are 60 meters below sea level, after all.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.080
Wow... I guess this is to be expected
of pleasure cruiser for the wealthy.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.020
A refrigerator, coffee maker...

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.650
Not to mention the latest satellite phones.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.300
Wow!

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.410
Get me a drink, Kakyoin.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.270
I'm parched.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.330
I'd like one, too.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.180
All right.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.560
Is cola okay?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.710
Hey, old man.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.060
What's the matter? You're just standing there.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.210
Everyone, be quiet for a moment.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.960
I'm going to make a phone call.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.720
A phone call? To where?

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.990
It must be very important,
if you're calling from here.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.040
Yes, it's an important and delicate matter.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.950
Everyone, please be quiet.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.450
Oh, I don't know... Which one should I pick?

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.950
The sparkly design is more to my liking,

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.790
but it's for the charity event tomorrow.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.970
Maybe a refreshing white would be better...

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.730
What do you think, Rosas?

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.980
They both look lovely on you, Madam.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.540
Coming!

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.970
Hello?

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.550
Oh, Joseph, it's you.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.610
It's been a while. By the way, where are you?

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.120
It's a bit hard to hear you.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.040
R-Right... I'm at a hotel.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.480
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.240
back any time soon, because of work.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.410
Oh, goodness. That must be very difficult.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.570
Traveling on business to another
country right after going to Japan...

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.610
It's been nearly a month now, hasn't it?

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.990
Y-Yes. I'm sorry.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.450
By the way, Suzie...

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.500
Have you spoken to Holly?

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.800
Yes, I just spoke to her on the phone yesterday.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.890
She mentioned catching a cold

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.470
that's developed into a bit of pneumonia.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.740
She says it's not serious, but I'm
thinking about going to visit her.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.600
No. There's no need for that.
I'm sure she'll recover quickly.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.580
You're such a worrywart...

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.170
This was the important conversation?

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.090
Yes. Madam Joestar is full of vitality,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.110
Yes, I'll check up on that myself.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.080
so he needs to check in now and then

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.790
to make sure she doesn't visit Miss Holly
in Japan, and discover the truth.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.450
Right.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.170
Meaning that she...

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.340
Right.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.110
Of course, she hasn't been told anything.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.250
There's no need to worry her.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.310
It's all right. There's nothing to worry about.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.770
Well...

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.540
I see. All right.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.570
I'll hold off on going to Japan.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.380
By the way, Joseph, I have
something I'd like to ask you.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.060
I'm trying to decide between a
white dress and a purple one...

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.350
R-Right. Hey, Suzie, could
you let me talk to Rosas?

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.540
What?

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.290
Madam.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.630
Have you considered your blue dress?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.210
It should be in the back of the closet.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.110
That's right. I'll go take a look.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.140
Hello, it's me, Master Joseph.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.650
Where's Suzie?

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.000
She has left the room.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.120
There is no chance of her overhearing us now.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.380
I see...

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.680
Actually, right now, I'm calling you
from the submarine that I spoke of.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.010
So you were safely able to
meet up with Master Avdol?

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.260
Yes.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.890
So, how is Holly doing?

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.280
Have you gotten hold of the doctors
from the Speedwagon Foundation?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.910
Well, actually...

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.530
Miss Holly says on the phone
that she only has a cold.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.400
She is quite insistent...

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.330
But her condition worsens by the day.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.420
Master Joseph! Perhaps we should
tell Madam Joestar the truth.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.750
No.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.950
There's no need for that.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.290
We will end all of this very soon.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.950
It's best if she can just go
back to her daily routine.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.860
Do not let Suzie know anything
under any circumstances.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.940
I'll contact you again.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.410
As you wish. I pray for your safe return.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.420
Oh, Rosas, did you already hang up?
I wasn't done talking to him!

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.370
Madam...

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.850
Oh, well. It's fine. Let's have some tea.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.570
You'll have some, too, won't you, Rosas?

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:32.150
Oh?

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.230
M-Madam!

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.710
Please have a seat.
I shall serve you the tea.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.460
Really?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.740
You have my condolences, Mr. Joestar.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.870
But don't worry. We're here with you.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.720
Egypt's right in front of us.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.090
We must defeat DIO as soon as possible
and save Miss Holly.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.800
That is exactly why I have returned.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.510
Right. Thank you, everyone.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.710
This is actually pretty easy.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.660
I guess it's no wonder you can drive it, Avdol.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.260
For crying out loud!

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.510
Hey, don't get overconfident.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.940
There are many obstacles in the sea.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.050
Yeah, I know. All right!
Let's speed up just a little bi—

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.090
Polnareff!

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.500
That wasn't me!

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.140
I'm so tired. Are we there yet?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.200
One, two, three, four, five...

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.970
Oh, there are exactly five cups.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:50.950
Hey!

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.950
Hurry up and make some coffee.
I want some now!

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.080
Make it yourself, then.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.300
Hey. I can see the coast of Africa.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.050
We're about to arrive!

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.270
Near this coral reef, there is an
underwater tunnel formed by erosion.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.470
The exit is 200 meters inland.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.650
Let us surface there.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.280
So, we've finally made it to Egypt.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.410
Yeah, finally.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.160
Egypt, huh...

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.670
Yes, finally.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.660
What's wrong?

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.410
Nah, I'm just really happy.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.920
It's been a while since all five
of us were last together.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.850
Hey, Kakyoin.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.850
Why did you bring six cups?
There are five of us.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.240
That's odd. I guess I wasn't paying attention.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.070
I could have sworn it was five...

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.550
Wh—

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.610
What?!

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.620
Old man!

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.290
Mr. Joestar!

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.620
Screech

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.810
Impossible!

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.240
It's a Stand! At some point,
a Stand got into the submarine!

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.410
I-It disappeared!

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.190
No, that's not it!

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.590
It transformed!

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.890
It turned into one of the gauges!

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.510
Just as it turned into a coffee cup!

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.980
Seriously?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.720
We're at the coral reef!

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.490
We were only a few hundred
meters from surfacing in Egypt!

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.990
Mr. Joestar is unconscious,
but his wounds aren't deep.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.570
It was just his artificial hand.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.250
Th-The phone?!

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.130
Who is it at a time like this?

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.860
Ignore it, Polnareff!

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.330
Don't get distracted!

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.620
It's the High Priestess.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.140
The enemy is using the Stand that
suggests The High Priestess.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.390
You know of it?

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.640
I've heard of it.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.190
The name of the the Stand user is Rose.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.080
It's a Stand that can be controlled from far away,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.150
so the user is probably on the surface.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.830
What's its power?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.390
It can turn into anything that's metal or glass,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.270
as long as it's a mineral.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.190
So that includes plastic and vinyl, as well.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.190
Even if we touch it or hit it,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.670
unless it attacks, we have no way of recognizing it.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.200
B-But where did it sneak in here from?

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.630
I see... So that's how.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.890
How simple... So it cut a hole and came in?

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.280
It broke the surfacing system.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.820
We're sinking faster!

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.890
We're suddenly low on oxygen.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.520
Navigation is impossible!

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.150
Damn it! Shut up! Who the hell
is it at a time like this?

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.990
Jotaro?!

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.700
Hey! Don't touch things without thinki—

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.950
Hi, Joseph, it's me!

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:27.020
I wasn't done talking to you,
so I made Rosas give me the number.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.990
Why aren't you speaking?

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.210
Not to mention, what a rowdy hotel you're in.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.080
I hear something like... a siren?

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.610
And the sound of water...
Is a bathtub overflowing?

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.650
Sorry, but the old man can't
come to the phone right now.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.130
That voice... Is that you,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.580
Jotaro?! Where's Joseph?

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.080
You should be in Japan.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.040
Why are you with your grandfather?

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.030
Answer me, Jotaro.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.580
There's nothing to worry about, Grandma Suzie.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.050
The old man has me.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.160
Later. Once things calm down, we'll call you back.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.050
Jotaro!

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.150
Hold on! We're going to hit the sea floor!

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.510
Oh my God!

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.990
I knew this would happen!

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:39.030
Every vehicle we ride in gets destroyed!

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.810
I'm never getting in a submarine again.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.000
High Priestess

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.000
Rose

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.380
How strange...

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.480
I could get through until a moment ago.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.380
It seems as though the line is dead.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.140
But...

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.670
Why was Jotaro...?

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.740
H-Hey, the oxygen's getting thin in here.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.750
Kakyoin.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.620
Did you see which gauge the Stand turned into?

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:35.750
It...

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.480
It looked like it turned into this one.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.630
No! Jotaro! It already moved!

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.650
It's right behind Kakyoin!

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.080
Hierophant Green!

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.160
Slice!

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.750
Kakyoin!

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.830
<c.colorc2935f>Roar</c>

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.230
Everyone, head toward the door.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.110
It's become part of the hull's
surface and started moving.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.210
You say that, but...

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.630
If we stay in this room, we'll all get badly hurt.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.520
Are you all right, Kakyoin?

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.610
Y-Yes...

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.960
Everyone, head to the next room!

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.040
We'll seal this room and trap it inside!

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.540
I-Impossible!

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.970
I-It already moved and
transformed into the door wheel...

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.330
I-I have to take my hands off!

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.720
Its nails tore off Mr. Joestar's artificial hand...

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.930
What?!

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.650
Yes! We got it!

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.750
Th-That was close...

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.250
Apparently, it can't move faster than Star Platinum.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.070
What should we do with it?

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.180
Jotaro, don't hesitate!

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.620
Show no mercy! Hurry up and rip its head off.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.790
Aye-aye, sir.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.300
B-Bastard...

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.410
Bang

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.800
It turned into a razor!

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.970
I-Impossible...

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.780
It's strong!

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.400
I can't believe it landed an attack on Jotaro.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.010
What an enemy...

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.280
Wh-What's going on?

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.860
I'm not sure what's happening,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.480
but are we in a pinch?

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.660
Shut up, old man.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.610
If we touch it, we'll get attacked.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.970
So, we just need to not touch it!

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.960
Magician's Red!

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.920
Silver Chariot!

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.720
It's hard.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.940
Chariot's rapier can't pierce it!

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.780
We should strike while it's visible.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.470
Everyone, stand back.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.710
Th-There's still oxygen over here.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.850
But it's just a matter of time.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.930
Are you all right?

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.680
Yeah.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.620
Leave it, Jotaro! It'll transform again.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.240
We're sinking, so we need to trap that thing!

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.860
We'll figure out how to fight it then!

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.800
I, Jotaro Kujo, will end you myself.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.800
Bam

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.400
What?! Jotaro, you answered
a phone call from Suzie?

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.690
Damn it... You shouldn't have done that.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.420
Well, whatever. Anyway, we'll talk
when we get out of this predicament.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.070
Leave it to me.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.700
Do you have a plan?

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.540
Yeah... A brilliant one.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:43.240
I, Joseph Joestar, have been in
a number of situations like this.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.800
Why was Jotaro with Joseph?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.950
Have you heard anything?

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.120
N-No...

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:04.470
But... I was happy to hear that
boy's voice after so long.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.800
I heard he's become rather wild lately,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.430
but deep down, he's a sweet child
who cares very much for his family.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.700
I'm sure he's helping Joseph out in many ways.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:26.550
Yes, Madam. Master Jotaro and Master Joseph

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:31.180
are most likely fighting a common
enemy together right now.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:39.590
To save Miss Holly, someone very
dear to them, from the evil curse.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.310
What do we do now?

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:55.450
I'm not sure if it's us or the Stand that's trapped.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:00.330
Sooner or later, it'll cut its way
out of that room and get here!

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.830
We are definitely at a disadvantage in
this closed space filled with machines.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.290
This submarine is done for.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.340
We need to abandon it and escape!

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.840
We just need to surface in Egypt!

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.840
But we're 40 meters below sea level!

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.010
It's not that deep, but how are
we going to get to the surface?

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.960
Now we're scuba diving?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.520
I've never done this before...

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.530
Hurry up! Step on it!

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.650
Good grief.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.890
But I can't make the necessary
preparations to dive with this hand.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.530
Help me out, Jotaro.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.540
Do it yourself.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.620
First of all, make sure not to panic.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.450
The ocean floor is so beautiful...

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.540
If it's okay, you'll do this...

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.980
If we're in trouble, do this.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.730
I think I'd like to see your face sometime.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 24

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
The High Priestess, Part 2
