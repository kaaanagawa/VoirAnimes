00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.990
My son has just died...

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.430
I can sense the misfortune that
has befallen my son, Centerfold,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.890
through the connection we share as a family.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.540
My precious son...

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.090
So you died covered with wounds like this...

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.620
I sense it through this pain,
the same pain you felt.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.790
You were magnificent as you
fought for Lord DIO, Centerfold!

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.960
But...

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.040
To kill someone like you, with a soul so pure...

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.810
I'm sure they did something underhanded.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.520
Damn them!

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.520
The bastards!

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.960
I will make sure they pay a terrifying price

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.990
with the Empress card!

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.400
Crush

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.410
Move!

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.980
Now is the time to take action...

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.880
With the Stand that kills slowly!

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.360
I'm so sad!

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.130
I shall kill them all!

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.490
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.490
Stardust Crusaders

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.220
Varanasi

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.220
Calcutta

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.220
India

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.490
Jojo and company are heading to
the sacred city, Varanasi, by bus.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.310
Episode 12: The Empress

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.280
Listen up.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.530
I don't usually lecture.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.300
Stupid people are stupid because
they don't understand something

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.520
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.320
even when you keep repeating it.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.690
You know guys like that, right?

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.980
Idiots that just don't understand.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.920
But you know, uh...

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.420
I never got your name...

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.420
Nena.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.690
Nena! That's a great name.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.010
You're the daughter of

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.220
a wealthy family in the sacred city Varanasi
that we're passing through, right?

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.430
You're good-looking, and I can
see that you're a smart girl.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.010
I have an eye for people,
so I'm going to lecture you.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.950
Hol Horse is a horrible, lying bastard.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.690
You're being tricked!
Your parents would cry.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.370
Listen up.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.720
You can't end up like this.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.620
It's easy to do that when you're in love...

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.310
But you can't look at things this way.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.200
It's important to look broadly, and be rational.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.130
Hey. It's coming into view.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.980
The city of Varanasi.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.930
The holy river, the Ganges.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.390
Saints, the old, the sickly, children,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.500
cows, dogs, monkeys, food,
excrement, burning corpses...

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.780
This river gently embraces
all these things as it flows.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.220
Everything from birth to
death is laid bare in this river.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.430
It is said that people can spend months

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.460
here in the sacred city of Varanasi
without getting bored.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.590
That is probably because
the scenery one sees in this city

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.290
reflects the scenery of one's soul.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.310
Chomp

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.490
Man... it's getting worse.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.320
What's wrong, old man?
You don't look well.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.620
Looks like the spot that I thought
was a bug bite got infected.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.060
It's definitely swollen.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.380
It would be best to have a doctor
look at it before it gets worse.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.590
Hey, doesn't that sort of
look like a person's face?

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.160
Stop kidding around, Polnareff.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.050
Sorry 'bout that.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.910
Want me to go to the hospital with you?

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.450
No! Stop treating me like an old man.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.870
Let's cut this off.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.750
Huh? What'd you say?!

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.840
It's definitely infected.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.180
If we don't cut it off and get
the poison out, it'll get worse.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.770
Hey, hey, hey.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.250
Can't we just put some
medicine and a bandage on it?

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.980
Don't worry. We'll numb
the area, so it won't hurt.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.840
No problem. No problem at all.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.510
Come now, lie down.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.090
I studied medicine in England.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.280
I can do appendectomies, too.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.850
Uh-oh. It's a little rusty.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.210
Well, that's no problem.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.070
All right.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.970
Let's chop that off.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.040
What the hell?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.070
I don't want to watch it being cut off.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.860
No problem.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.190
Hey, are you done?

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.850
Is it over yet?

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.420
Shriek

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.630
Shriek

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.860
What?!

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.930
Hey, Doctor!

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.050
Trying to cut me?
You're pretty stupid, you moron!

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.500
Wh-What the hell is this?!

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.540
I'm the Empress, as in the
Empress card, Old Man Joseph!

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.740
And now, I'm gonna bloody you up good!

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.290
When did you get on me, damn it?!

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.500
Clang

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.590
It has teeth! It stopped the scalpel!

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.530
It's so strong!

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.270
It grabbed the scalpel!

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.370
Slice

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.640
Oh, no!

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.380
Th-Thank goodness it was my artificial hand.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.770
You bastard! You're gonna cut yourself?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.220
I'm part of your body, Old Man Joseph.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.770
You can't get away from me now, honey.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.650
Now, why don't I guess what you're thinking?

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.900
This is what you're thinking...

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.540
Stands can only be beaten by other Stands.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.480
Your Stand, Hermit Purple,
uses the power of remote viewing,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.050
the ability to see things far away.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.310
Is that enough to fight?

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:39.750
Can that defeat the thing
that's fused with your arm?

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.060
Nope! Not possible!

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.390
Where's the user?

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.130
Where was I when you stuck to me?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.130
You fool! Like I'd tell you!

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.970
Damn you!

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.730
Are you going to your friends?

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.730
I wonder if it'll go that smoothly.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.560
Doctor, your next patient is waiting...

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.490
Th-The doctor...!

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.230
H-Hey! Don't get the wrong idea!

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.000
I didn't—

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.540
I am the culprit!

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.200
I am Joseph Joestar! An American!

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.890
I'm staying at Hotel Clarks!

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.920
What?!

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.710
By the way, girlie.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:26.650
I have a thing for hot
young nurses like yourself.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:27.930
What?!

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.420
Murderer!

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.680
Wait! It's not true!

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.690
Oh, no...

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.280
Now you can't go back to the hotel.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.750
Now I can kill you without
anyone getting in the way!

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.250
Y-You little bitch!

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.540
I'll crush you to bits!

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.850
What?

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.320
Hey, this is <i>your</i> arm.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.930
Take care of it, you shitty old man.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.360
It grew arms. I-Is it continuing to grow?

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.050
H-Hey! Let go!

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.120
What are you holding on to? Let go!

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.620
Nope!

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.820
Officer! The culprit's over here!

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.520
He's right here!

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.240
It's been a while since it came to this...

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.220
Hey! What are you doing?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.250
Overdrive!

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.850
You moron!

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.680
This is your arm!

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.640
You think your Hamon would
work against your own body?

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.870
You, right there! Don't move!

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.890
In that case, Hermit Purple!

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.770
I-It's squeezing me...

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.230
I can use Hermit Purple this way, too!

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.030
I told you not to move!

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.510
You! Stop right there!

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.190
Damn it!

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.200
What are you doing? It's dark in here!

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.860
What is happening?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.010
Hermit Purple

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.010
Joseph Joestar

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.120
So really, Nena...

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.290
Real men don't talk big.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.150
That's how you figure out who's a liar.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.500
Since I was avoiding the police,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.290
I ended up going in the
opposite direction of the hotel.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.630
If I'd known this would happen,

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.910
I would have taken Polnareff with me.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.020
Instead of a petty guy like Hol Horse,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.630
how about me? Am I not your type?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.000
I don't dwell on the past.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.250
I don't care who you were dating in the past.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.260
What's important is the future.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.130
If our feelings understand each other.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.430
Oh, look over there.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.600
That place is a hotel run by a
Japanese woman named Kumiko.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.890
She manages it with her Indian husband.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.690
Out of the way.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.040
You'll get run into.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.520
We can probably get a room very cheap.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.030
Oh, really?

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.030
Now, what about this hotel?

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:43.910
Crunch

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.650
Wha...

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.270
What are you doing?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.130
I'm eating, Joestar.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.960
To get bigger.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.330
You stole those at the market!
You quick little bastard.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.170
Plop

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.060
Why, you...

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.570
Wham

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.770
Now I'm this big!

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.230
You might say I'm mooching off my parent...

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.330
Well, I guess in this case
it'd be my parent's arm, Papa.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.950
You ugly bitch!

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.880
I'll show you that I, Joseph Joestar,

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:33.130
have many years more
fighting experience than you!

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.150
I said that, but what the hell am I going to do?

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.970
Damn it...

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.970
Anyway, Hermit Purple!

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.850
Father, thank you for raising me.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.560
But you shouldn't tie your children down like this.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.820
You need to raise your children to be free.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.190
Chomp

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.200
Oh, no!

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.420
I-It's no use.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.930
I want to use Hermit Purple's
remote viewing to find the user,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.330
but I don't have a camera!

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.810
Wh-What should I do?

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.290
At this rate... is not just my arm,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.220
but my whole body going
to become part of her?

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.770
I've now grown enough that I can kill you.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.840
See? My hand can reach your neck.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.410
If I bust the carotid artery
in your neck, you're done for.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.340
Oh, no!

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.410
What's that guy doing?

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.940
You bastard!

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.010
What the hell is that?

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.150
Look!

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.770
That guy's got a nasty-looking growth on his arm.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.090
Damn it! Where's the Stand user?

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.450
Polnareff, sir...

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.370
I'm a woman who can't survive
without a reliable man.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.930
I love you... Because you're
very reliable and kind.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.500
H-Hey, where did all that come from?

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.020
I-Is this for real?

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.220
I'm totally going to fall for her!

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.260
Lucky!

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.840
Hey, Joseph Joestar.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.440
You idiot.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.010
You keep getting further and
further from Jotaro and the others.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:32.020
Do you think I'm running around
randomly just to wear myself out?

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:38.170
I'm running so I can kill you!

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.070
It was so...

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.990
I could dunk you in this!

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.070
Blop

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.610
Stick

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.200
You senile old man!

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.360
A nail?!

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.440
I picked it up earlier.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.220
I picked it up when we were
rolling around on the ground earlier.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.410
So I can cut open your carotid artery!

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:13.480
Did you think I'd suffocate
if you stuck me in here?

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.020
Die!

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.560
I have a physical form,
but I'm not a living organism.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.940
Did you already forget that?

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.790
Only Stands can defeat Stands.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.700
Hey, didn't you say you were going to show

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.120
the difference in our fighting experience earlier?

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.710
Where's that "experience" you were talking about?

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.980
You're just a helpless geezer who's gotten too old!

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.340
M-My artificial fingers...

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.340
They were on the verge of breaking
from her attack earlier,

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.940
and now I can't get any strength in them...

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.650
Just one more push, now.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.260
Your life as an invalid is
about to come to an end.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.720
There's not a single way you can defeat m—

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.060
Huh?

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.030
Not a single way...

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.220
What?

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.790
Not a single what?

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.910
Sorry, my hearing isn't what it used to be.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.650
Run that by me one more time.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.360
Coal tar!

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.200
You stuck me into coal tar!

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.520
It wasn't to suffocate me,
but to solidify me!

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.220
B-But...

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.910
How did you know there was coal tar in there?

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.230
With the power of my Stand, Hermit Purple.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.700
H-Hey, everyone look...

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.640
What is this?

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.610
The ashes that foreigner spilled everywhere...

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.250
They've formed into a map of the city.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.870
Y-You used spirit photography!

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.590
That's how you found the coal tar.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.800
You used the ashes to make a spirit photo!

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:12.390
Now I think you should be able to see
the difference in our fighting experience.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.430
Once your opponent starts to boast
his victory, he has already lost.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.300
This is how Joseph Joestar does things.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.510
I guess I just get better with age.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.520
And...

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.810
A Stand can tear away another Stand.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.940
You're going to say,
"Stop, anything but that."

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.960
Stop! Stop, anything but that!

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.610
Bam

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.660
This isn't good. It pains me, too.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.750
Children can't depend on their parents forever.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:49.520
You've got to go out on your
own once you've grown big!

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.190
Now then... where's this Stand user?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.120
W-Well, then, Nena...

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.060
Let's swear our love with a kiss.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.530
What? What? What the hell?!

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.520
Wh-What's wrong, Nena?!

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.420
Burst

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:34.820
Gyaah

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.600
So that's The Empress's Stand user...

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.300
Huh?

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.590
Huh?!

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.730
This ugly woman...

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.710
She attached her Stand to me
as a tumor with a human face,

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.990
and camouflaged herself as a beautiful woman.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.710
That was pretty careless...

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.650
She totally played you, Polnareff.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.850
U-Ugh...

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.960
Empress

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.960
Nena

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.620
And here I thought we'd
finally be able to sleep in a bed.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.620
Maybe if the old man hadn't screwed up
and gotten cops chasing him down.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.680
I took care of things.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.930
We can take this car.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.650
Polnareff, you can do the driving.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.620
Hey, are you still in shock?

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.970
I was the one attacked by the Stand.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.210
I'd rather have gone through that...

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.010
Next Episode Preview

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.220
So, we're finally leaving India.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.530
Well, I am a girl.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.530
Did you see the driver's face?

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.820
More trouble would be especially bad now.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.730
A truck? Impossible...

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.030
By the way... do you like sumo?

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.020
