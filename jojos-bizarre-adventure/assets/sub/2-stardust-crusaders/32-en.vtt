Stardust Crusaders

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.800
Let's go back in time a bit.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.040
Episode 32  Set's Alessi, Part 1

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.290
While Joseph and Avdol were fighting Mariah,
Jotaro and Polnareff were...

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.250
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.620
Here you are, ma'am.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.590
Your bourbon whiskey and soda on the rocks.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.090
Enjoy.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.760
Oh, it looks so good.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.910
Gulp, gulp, gulp.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.060
My, you drank that down so quickly
this early in the morning.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.190
It's fine.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.170
My husband's on a business trip
and won't be home for a week.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.030
Now, have some cake.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.910
Why, thank you. Don't mind if I do.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.530
Kids are so innocent.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.240
It's almost 9:00 AM...

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.460
The old man and Avdol are pretty late.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.070
They might have encountered an enemy.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.330
Maybe we should go look for them.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.720
Yeah. Good grief.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.630
Come on, Iggy.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.940
I know, I know. You're hungry, right?

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.220
So am I.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.480
Hey, where are you going?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270
Damn it, you stupid mutt.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.560
Let's go.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.860
Hey!

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.030
Let me play with you guys, too.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.400
You're too picky, so no.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.040
Don't be like tha—

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.120
Ow...

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:19.520
Menacing

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.470
You didn't cry, little boy.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.300
Very good. Are you hurt?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.090
How old are you, little boy?

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.550
Four, eh? Hmm...

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.120
Very good. What's your daddy doing right now?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.460
Working.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.060
So your daddy's away at work? Very good.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.100
How about your mommy?

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.520
She's at home doing laundry.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.180
Very good.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.640
So you're here playing by yourself?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.760
Yeah...

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.430
Then I guess I can smack you
for getting mud on my pants!

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.270
Are you going to pay for this?

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.480
How many years am I supposed to wait

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.980
for you to be able to work and pay this off?

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.800
You stupid little brat.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.540
Mommy!

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.300
Hmph.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.030
Mariah is fighting with Joestar and Avdol.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.490
I, Alessi, shall kill Jotaro and Polnareff.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.960
They are strong!

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.140
So I'll win using any
underhanded method possible.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.690
Very good, me.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.620
This man's name is Alessi.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.530
His Stand suggests the god
of storms and violence, Set.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.330
He has a habit of saying, "Very good."

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.180
Polnareff, don't let your guard down.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.690
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.450
Mr. Joestar and Avdol aren't here.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.060
It doesn't look like anything happened, either.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.930
Old man. Avdol. Are you here?

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.190
Jotaro.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.860
I'm starting to get suspicious.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.270
Yeah.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.540
That looks so good.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.450
Give me a bite.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.420
Okay, sure.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.620
Huh?!

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.220
My kebab sandwich! Wait! G-Give it back!

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.410
You thieving dog!

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.710
A pincer attack?

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.170
You still don't get it.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.630
You think you've cornered me,
but it's you two who are cornered.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.350
You'll burn to a crisp!

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.470
Magician's Red!

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.100
Hermit Purple!

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.400
Avdol can defend himself
with his flames, just barely,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.530
but you have no chance, Joestar.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.780
My Bast's power is far greater
than your Hermit Purple's!

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:25.220
Menacing

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.060
Stare

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.320
U-Um... U-Uh... I dropped some change...

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.070
Where can it be...

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.950
Hey... Why are you following us
around, glaring at us all the while?

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.140
I sense murderous intent in you.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.080
Huh?

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.260
W-Were you talking to me?

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.820
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.810
I got these eyes from my parents.
They can't be murderous...

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.360
I found the coin I dropped.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.600
Oh? Then I guess I'll just have to find out

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.350
if you're a Stand user or not...

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.070
Myself!

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.200
Th-That was close...

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.030
So you are a Stand user!

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.000
Zuwooo

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.340
You're running?!

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.010
Hey, Jotaro! There's an enemy!

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.060
An enemy appeared!

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.390
Polnareff...

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.940
Where are you, Polnareff?

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.670
Jotaro, over here!

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.120
Come back here, you!

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.180
Wait!

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.010
What the hell?! He's fast!
Why the hell is he so fast?!

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.610
He got so far already...

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.210
Huh? My voice... Whoa!

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.300
Ow!

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.170
Wh-What? My shoes... They're huge!

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.670
Hey, that's dangerous.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.270
If you run around in the road like that,
you'll get hit by a car.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.220
Good thing I wasn't a car.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.500
Shut up, you dumbass!

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.050
Who do you think you are? You bigmouth!

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.080
Move, you moron! I'm running after someone!

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.170
What the hell are you doing?! W-Wait, what?!

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.710
What?! I'm super-high up!

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.670
Th-This guy lifted me up with one hand!

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.250
How tall is this guy?!

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.890
His face and hands are huge!

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.920
Hey, watch your mouth, brat!

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.140
I'll show you what happens
when you disrespect adults.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.030
Look at your baggy clothes.
Were you trying to be an adult?

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.450
Talk about a snotty-looking little brat...

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.900
Y-You bastard...

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.250
What? What the hell?!

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.120
Move it, kid! You're in the way!

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.630
Wh-What is going on?!

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.630
It's like everyone walking by has gotten huge!

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.300
What?!

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.650
Wh-Wh-What?

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.400
I'm a kid?!

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:24.400
Th-This is really me... I've turned into a kid!

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.010
Set

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.010
Alessi

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.260
C-Could this really be...

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.140
Is this kid really...

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.240
Me?! I-I-I'm a kid!

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.340
I turned into a kid!

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.880
You're kidding! No way! No way!

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.150
Th-That guy's Stand...

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.990
That creepy guy's shadow-like Stand...

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.370
When his shadow touched mine,
he used his power on me.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.800
Wh-What the hell?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.630
Damn it, this isn't good.
This isn't good at all!

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.840
Jo—

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.670
Jo...

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:23.450
Jo... n-no, Jay, Jackie, J-J...

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.040
Wh-What was his name? I can't remember!

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.490
He'd be able to help me... S-So why?

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.960
Why can't I remember?!

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.240
Hey, kid. Did you see a French guy pass by?

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.040
He's about this tall, and he's
got a similar hairstyle to yours.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.790
Th-That's me! Me! Me!

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.340
Good grief... Asking a kid was a mistake.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.080
W-Wait!

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:09.770
Menacing

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.560
When your body becomes a child's,
that means your mind

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.630
will eventually become a child's, as well.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.770
Your memory will begin
reverting to your childhood.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.150
I'm going to forget things
I knew when I was an adult?

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.530
It's true... It's already fading...

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.790
Has the time come?

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.110
I love picking on the weak!

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.000
Very good, me!

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.430
Whoa, there! I'm not letting you get away, brat.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.330
I can't say this too loudly,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.150
but picking on the weak makes me feel really good.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.160
I can't help but think I'm
pretty messed up, honestly.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.880
But you know what they say...

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.940
If you think you're weird,
that means you're not really weird.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.660
So I'm not weird, right?

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.980
I know I won't lose to some kid, either.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.880
Mister guy whose name I don't know, hel—

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:32.150
So you see, my mission is to dispose of you.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.660
I'm stuck! It won't come off!

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.940
Sadly...

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.240
I don't have time to pick on you.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.350
That's Silver Chariot, huh?

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.020
Well, I guess it's possible for you
to use the Stand you had as a child.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.340
But...

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.850
Th-That Chariot...! Even Chariot is a kid!

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.750
Pami! Pami!

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.730
A-And he's super weak! His sword's even bent!

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.910
Since you've been turned back
into a child by my Stand, Set,

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.870
your mental power has reverted to a child's, as well.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.420
That is, your Stand has also reverted to childhood.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.680
Just like your days as an undeveloped child.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.310
Do you understand?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.590
Apparently you do. Very good.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.750
Still, even if it's weak,
you can still use your Stand.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.560
So I'm afraid I must kill you with my own Stand.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.400
Die, Polnareff!

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.110
You're mine!

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.320
Oh, no!

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.380
It snapped!

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:10.530
Huh?

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.920
S-Serves you right! I meant to do that!

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.550
Ow! Ow! It hurts!

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.380
Are you okay, little boy?

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.370
H-He's gone!

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.470
That guy runs away as soon
as there's another adult around.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.410
It saved me this time,
but it's still pretty scary.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.910
Wait, little boy.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.290
You're hurt! What happened?

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.230
Huh? Uh... Um, uh...

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.920
What are you mumbling about?

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.590
Huh?!

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:06.210
We have to treat your wounds.
I'll fix you up at my house. Come on.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.990
I-I guess I'll go.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.360
I've got to find that guy and beat him,
or I won't turn back into an adult!

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.620
He won't attack when adults are around,

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.210
so that's when I have to
figure out how to defeat him.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.520
Come on, now.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.860
Whoa...

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.900
Oh, right.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.870
You're hurt. Here, grab on.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.300
She smells nice...

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.590
It hurts!

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.360
D-Damn it!

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.580
Like hell I'm gonna keep quiet
after a kid makes a fool of me.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.690
For my pride as an adult,
I'll beat him to death!

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.410
Th-That guy... He doesn't seem
to be coming after me.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.680
All right, little boy.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.710
Come to the bathroom with me,
and take your clothes off.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.340
Huh?!

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:28.180
You're covered in dirt.
I'll wash and treat your wounds.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.710
What are you just standing there for?

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.110
Oh, all right.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.520
I'll take them off for you.
Here, raise your leg.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.740
This isn't... This isn't...

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.490
What's wrong?

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.690
N-Nothing.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.000
No, it's something!

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.220
It's definitely something!

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.130
I don't understand why, but it feels like
this should be really embarrassing...

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.510
And, and, and...

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.500
It's so small!

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.770
For some reason,
this makes me so sad. Boo-hoo!

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.950
Now, grab onto my body.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.110
We'll have to get all that dirt off.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.260
Lift up your leg.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:28.900
Huh?

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:43.920
I-I-I-I'm so happy! Seriously?
Seriously, is this really okay?!

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.160
Is it okay? Of course. If we don't,
you're going to get an infection.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.390
Oh, your wee-wee's got dirt on it, too.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.460
I... I feel like something really fun is happening,

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.550
but I'm a kid, so I can't tell what!

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.460
All right, be a good boy, okay?

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.020
Okay!

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.710
You little shit...

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.760
I'll cut you in half, then tear you to pieces!

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.320
What are you smirking for?

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.090
All right. Let's wash your hair.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.240
Huh? No! No, no, no, no, no...

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.120
I hate shampoo!

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.600
It burns my eyes! I hate it!

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:59.600
Rock, paper...

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.260
Scissors.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.590
Monkey, monkey, monkey...

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.130
Monkey do, monkey do...

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.970
Agh! I lost!

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.380
Now, sit down.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.290
Does it sting?

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.080
Yeah, it stings.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.610
Can you wash it by yourself, then?

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.940
Uh-huh, I can.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.200
Oh? Very good.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.610
Menacing

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.120
Bam

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.540
Let me say it again.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.370
Very good!

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.680
N-No way!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.010

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.930
You fell out of the window, covered in blood...

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.260
The iron bars feel too close!

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.890
This is what it means to be utterly helpless!

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.680
I touched the shadow again!

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.690
Lick, lick...

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.790
The lady's gone... The lady...

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.030
What do you think happened to her?
