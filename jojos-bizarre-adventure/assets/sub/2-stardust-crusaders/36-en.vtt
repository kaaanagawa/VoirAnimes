00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.870
Damn, it's dark. My eyes won't adjust.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.790
Where the hell did he go?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.190
It's midday, but it's been such a pain in the ass

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.850
trying to find him in here.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.250
I think DIO was in that room over there...

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.270
Wh-What's that? DIO's leftovers?

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.240
None of these women resisted.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.020
They happily let him drink up all their blood.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.620
I'll never understand what they're thinking.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.360
I guess he's charming as the Devil himself.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.510
And while I'm at it, where did he get

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.840
all these treasures and art pieces from?

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.800
I guess there's nothing he can't do.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.480
Did you

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.850
want something?

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.010
L-Lord DIO!

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.240
D-Damn it.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.720
J-Just standing in front of
him sends chills up my spine.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.270
Calm down, Hol Horse.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.840
Don't let him overwhelm you.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.760
He's nothing. He's only a little
stronger than me, maybe...

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.050
I asked you what you're doing here, Hol Horse.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.360
Ah, uh, w-well... I-I came to give my report.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.050
It appears that the fifth and sixth of the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.210
Nine Gods, Mariah and Alessi,
have both been defeated.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.940
And?

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.270
A-And that was my report.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.330
Joestar and the others will
arrive in Cairo tomorrow.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.950
Only three of the Nine Gods remain.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.450
When I said, "And?"

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.700
I was talking about you, Hol Horse.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.470
Huh?!

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.590
When are you going to fight
them for me, Hol Horse?

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.950
You swore loyalty to me,
but you haven't really fought at all.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.930
Anyone can give me reports.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.980
You failed me twice,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.130
and came running back here.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.920
My body, from the neck down, once belonged
to a man named Jonathan Joestar.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.340
He was Joseph Joestar's grandfather.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.230
Look at these two fingers.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.430
See how the left side is slower to heal?

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.720
The left side of this body is weak.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.310
That proves this body isn't yet completely mine.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.100
That I'm not immortal yet.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.160
So I am not yet prepared to face them.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.740
I expect you to kill Joestar
and the others for me this time.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.240
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.140
Y-You've got to be shitting me!

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.930
Is he trying to drive me into a corner?

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.380
"For me"?

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.130
Don't you mock me.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.800
I just side with whoever's strongest.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.200
I didn't swear loyalty to you
from the bottom of my heart.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.890
I'm not gonna sell you my soul.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.010
Damn it! Are you even all that strong?

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.940
Your back is wide open!

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.720
Maybe your body isn't moving
the way you want it to yet...

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.850
C-Come to think of it, instead of
fighting the four guys in Joestar's party...

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.050
He's alone right now.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.530
It'd be quicker and easier to
blow his head to smithereens

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.690
right here and now.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.870
Then all that treasure will be mine.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.310
He's totally open!

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.160
I'm pointing the Emperor's barrel right
at him, and he hasn't even noticed.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.420
I can finish him off now.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.800
Just gotta pull the trigger...

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.550
It'll be over in an instant.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.970
The Emperor was made for
killing at point blank range!

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.610
I can do this. I absolutely can!

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.150
What are you doing? Hurry up and get going.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.150
I'll kill you!

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.780
I'll leave your brains all
over the floor, </i>Mister<i> DIO!

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.780
Are you really trying to shoot me?

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.830
H-He's gone.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.760
I like you.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.540
At the moment you tried to kill me,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.040
you weren't sweating,
and your breathing was even.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.180
You were absolutely calm.
As I'd expect from Hol Horse.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.800
I-I couldn't see him move.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.700
And even at that...

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.470
He didn't tear through any of these spider webs.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.250
There's no way he could have gotten behind me!

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.090
It wasn't speed.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.870
How?! How did he get behind me?

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.450
I don't understand.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.750
Was that DIO's Stand, The World?

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.130
You're not ready to fight them? Bullshit!

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.650
I-I finally understand, Lord DIO,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.310
that I have no choice but to follow you.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.000
I-I've lost completely...

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:29.180
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.180
Stardust Crusaders

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.260
Episode 36  Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 1

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.070
Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you
enjoyed your flight from Aswan.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.320
Our plane will momentarily land on
schedule at Cairo International Airport.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:46.230
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.690
Whoops! Sorry 'bout that.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.980
Looks like we got to this taxi first.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.430
See ya.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.490
What? Got a problem, dumbass?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.320
H-How horrible...

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.990
Take me to the Mena House hotel in Giza.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.020
I'm going to open up the trunk,

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.130
so don't let the sudden light hurt your eyes.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:38.840
Got it?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.590
Huh? Did you just say something, sir?

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.600
I wasn't talking to you.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.560
Shut up and keep your eyes on the road.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.220
Y-Yes, sir.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.020
Mondatta, I had no choice but to drag you

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.700
onto the plane since you wouldn't cooperate.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.810
Don't be a baby, Mondatta.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.760
Since he got blown up by a bomb,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.160
your brother's stuck in the
hospital for another month.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.920
You're going to team up with me now.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.020
With your book of premonitions
and my assassin's gun together,

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.790
we're going to kill Joestar's group.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.520
Got it, Mondatta?

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.500
I know that you're an introvert
who won't trust anyone

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.330
besides your brother, Zenyatta.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.790
But don't you want to avenge your brother?

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.810
Do you want to grow up a coward, Mondatta?

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.230
I'm doing my best, too!

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.560
We've got to fight!

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.490
Get your revenge, Mondatta!

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.410
I'm going to untie you now.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.520
Can you promise you won't cry or scream?

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.210
All right. Good boy.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.710
Don't work yourself up. You'll get sick.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.700
I'm on your side. Don't worry.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.230
Just relax.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.110
Sir?! Wha— Are you throwing up?!

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.100
Shut up!

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.810
Oh... You were airsick?

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.320
Anyway, l-let's be pals, Mondatta.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.800
I'm Mondatta. This is Hol Horse.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.940
He's super mean and a total jerk!

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.320
While I was sleeping, he tied me
up and stuffed me in a trunk,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.130
and took me away from my brother Zenyatta.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.330
It's so sad!

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.410
But even though I'm scared,
in order to avenge my brother,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.590
I worked up my courage and
paired up with Hol Horse.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.600
So even though you're too
scared to get close to me,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.140
you're trying to be brave in your own way.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:06.660
Is it really true that your Stand's
predictions are always right?

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.940
I trusted the rumors and
decided to team up with you,

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.910
but your brother's failure worries me a bit.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.200
Answer me! They're absolute, right?!

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.920
A new comic appeared on the blank page...

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.270
While Hol Horse and I

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.320
were walking along the outskirts of Cairo,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.800
we met a very pretty lady.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.040
Fabam!

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.050
Suddenly, he jump kicked her!

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.820
After being kicked, the lady was so happy,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.720
she gave Hol Horse some jewels.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.220
Hooray!

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.060
Yay! We're rich!

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.570
What is this?!

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.240
You've got to be kidding me!

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.220
You call this a prediction, Mondatta?!

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.660
It's insane! There's no way this could happen!

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:58.160
M-M-M-My... My Th-Thoth's
comic book predictions

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.210
a-a-a-are absolute!

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.750
Yes, 100%.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.590
100%?! Stop messing with me, kid!

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.840
What kind of woman would be
so happy about getting kicked

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.970
in the neck that she'd give me jewels?

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.680
Menacing

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.880
Listen, Mondatta.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.000
When it comes to women,
no one's a nicer guy than me.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.280
I have girlfriends all over the world.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.280
I may lie to women, but I've never hit one!

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.280
It doesn't matter to me if she's ugly
or beautiful. I respect women.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.250
This prediction will not come true.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.550
Because I swear, I would never hit a woman.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.920
And even if someone paid me
a ton of money, I'd never kick one.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.550
I-It's 100%, yes.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.940
See? Your prediction was wrong!

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.020
Who the hell are you?!

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.550
This is... There was a scorpion
inside my lady's collar!

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.180
And it's a highly venomous species!

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:36.760
What?

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.230
You saw the scorpion

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.980
before it could crawl into my clothes.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.840
If he hadn't crushed it,
you would have been stung...

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.110
You saved my life.
Please, allow me to thank you.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.470
How about my necklace?

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.810
Please take it.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.780
We're invincible!

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:04.040
Mondatta, and I, Hol Horse,
are an invincible duo!

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.960
Thoth

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.960
Mondatta

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.050
The building in this picture, huh?

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:19.580
I've been repairing roofs in Cairo for forty years,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.010
but I've never seen this place.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.340
But judging from the look of the building,

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.500
it must have been built over a hundred years ago.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.270
That means you should

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.520
find it eventually if you look south of here.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.720
The further south you go in Cairo,
the older the buildings are.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.780
Huh...

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.380
Sorry I couldn't be much help.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.910
No, thanks a lot. Sorry to bother you.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.130
Okay. I understand. Thank you.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.090
I called Japan...

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.200
My daughter's condition has worsened.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.700
She has no strength left.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.390
She'll only last three or four more days.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.360
I can feel it.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.540
DIO is near here.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.630
I can feel him hiding somewhere around here.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.960
He's definitely close.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:23.890
Let's go.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.080
If we keep asking around, we'll find him.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.330
Yes, let's go. We'll keep asking.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.250
We meet again, you familiar faces...

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.920
Or something like that.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.930
To think they've gotten so
close to Lord DIO's mansion...

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.970
They're almost there.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.100
By the way...

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.580
Mondatta!

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.860
About your new prediction...
I really can't believe it.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.620
There's no way something that
ridiculous could actually happen!

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.700
M-M-M-My, my—

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.870
Your predictions are 100% accurate, right?

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.500
Th-They are, yes.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.870
Damn it! Are you telling me to believe this?

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.630
You can't be serious.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:28.870
Ta-da!

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.230
"I've finally found you...
Joestar, Jotaro, Polnareff, and Avdol!

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.980
Damn it! They're getting closer
and closer to Lord DIO's mansion.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.400
You fools. I'm just going to
shoot you in the face right now!"

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.210
Grudge Grudge

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.650
...thought Hol Horse, resentfully.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.550
Run Run

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.400
"I'll avenge my brother!"

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.400
...I thought, angrily.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.130
But, Hol Horse, you shouldn't even think

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.660
about using the Emperor in the marketplace.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:55.840
Now, Hol Horse, stick your fingers
up Polnareff's nose, and then...

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.150
Jam

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.840
Yay! Everyone is bleeding and out cold!

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.170
Lucky you, Hol Horse!
This is your chance to kill them all!

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.700
Like hell I'm gonna believe that!

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.800
You call this a prediction?

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.660
Stick my fingers up Polnareff's nose?!

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.850
What the hell?! Well, Mondatta?!

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:20.610
I get that it's a chance to kill them all,
but it's absolutely ludicrous.

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.250
Listen. Even if that happened,
I'd have to get close enough

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.530
to a strong guy like Polnareff to
stick my fingers up his nose.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:35.210
Wouldn't it be much faster if I
just shot him with my Emperor?

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.260
Y-You won't be able to f-fire a bullet, yes.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.480
E-Even if you try to shoot,
fate will make you follow the comic, yes.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.920
Y-You must believe, yes.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.280
I-If you try to go against
what's drawn in the comics,

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.640
you will only suffer.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.520
I-It is fate, yes. It is 100% accurate, yes.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.020
But your brother failed.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.990
M-My brother was trying to save himself

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.740
and transformed into Jotaro without thinking, yes.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.820
If he had trusted the comic and not transformed,

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.070
then the real Jotaro would've blown up, yes.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.580
The predictions are not wrong, yes.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.470
What to do...

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.670
P-Polnareff is gone.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.550
Hey, where's Polnareff?

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.710
He disappeared all of a sudden.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.340
Shit! It can't be...

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.510
Don't move!

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.100
Or I'll put a hole in you.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.470
P-Polnareff...

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.570
Idiot! Don't try anything funny.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.570
Keep your hands where I can see them.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.430
I thought I saw someone
stalking us like a hyena,

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.830
and if it isn't a visit from my
old friend, Mr. Hol Horse.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.640
Still haven't learned your lesson?
Still trying to kill us?

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.340
You took real good care of us in India.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.180
You're lucky Avdol's alive,

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.400
or I would have killed you
the second I saw you here.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.380
Are you alone, Hol Horse?

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.060
Nah, you wouldn't be here alone.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.320
I'm sure you've got someone nearby.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.900
Well? Am I right?

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.480
Damn it!

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.510
At least he doesn't seem to
have noticed Mondatta yet.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.950
I still have a chance...

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.950
Your hand's showing! Your damn fingers!

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.740
You're not scary on your own,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.780
but you have a talent for
discovering other people's talents.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.610
Once you team up with someone who has talent,

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.720
you become terrifyingly strong.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.040
So where's the Stand user
you've partnered up with?

00:19:53.820 --> 00:20:13.940
Menacing

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.350
Your fingers...

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.230
Tuck your fingers in, Mondatta.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.100
If he finds you, we're finished!

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.090
B-Believe!

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.460
You got hit because
you tried to use your gun.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.340
Believe in destiny.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.950
Th-Then our victory will be absolute, yes.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.250
Hey, what's under that box?
Someone's in there!

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.500
Hey, Polnareff, did you
find the guy following us?

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.920
Gah! That's Avdol's voice! H-He's coming!

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.040
Believe, yes!

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.640
Believe, and somehow stick your
fingers up Polnareff's nose, yes!

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.890
S-Seriously?! Damn it...

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.880
I'll do it! I just have to do it, right?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.380
Whoever's under there, get out!

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.400
Now's my chance!
He's looking the other way!

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.110
I know you're hiding under there!

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.240
What the?!

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.640
Yes!

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.910
Yay! Everyone is bleeding and out cold!

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.840
Lucky you, Hol Horse!
This is your chance to kill them all!

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.220
So, when the hell is this chance coming?

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.850
What am I supposed to do now?

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.910
Ache

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.560
What the hell are you doing, Hol Horse?

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.150
I'd like to know myself!

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.110
What the hell am I supposed to do after this?

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.490
What am I supposed to follow up with?

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.660
What's the matter, Polnareff?

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.710
He's not responding.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:40.640
That's odd.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.200
Sh-Shit! Th-The other three are coming this way!

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.550
Damn it!

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.280
How am I supposed to make it
like the prediction from here?

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.250
What the hell am I supposed to do?!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.010
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.620
Damn it! I've been cornered!

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.190
It's a sign for you to look behind me!

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.790
Looks like there was a car accident over there.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.480
I made tea, so have some lunch.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.240
Once I stuck my fingers up his nose,
the prediction came true.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.030
My premonitions are absolute.
It is fate, yes.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 37

Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 2
