Everyone, hold on!

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.490
Oh, no!

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.840
The water sank... Everyone, don't move!

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.520
No one make a sound!

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.010
It's too late to be quiet now.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.480
I know exactly where each of you fell.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.350
Four... Five steps.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.460
They're tip-toeing.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.170
I hear it, I hear it.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.540
Now, that must have sounded like walking.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.310
Accursed water Stand! Attack that spot.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.520
As soon as you show yourself,
my Magician's Red will engulf you in flames.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.880

Episode 26
Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'doul, Part 2

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.040
Here he comes!

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.030
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.920
Wait. Why did he take only five steps?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.220
Why hasn't he moved any further?

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.710
Now!

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.730
Magician's Red!

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.030
What?!

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.530
Wha—

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.780
Avdol!

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.590
Who is out there?

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.500
S-So strong...

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.310
Avdol!

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.220
That was a sneaky little plan.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.630
I must listen more carefully.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.360
Those weren't footsteps at all.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.010
It seems he just threw
some ring-shaped objects.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.050
And this burn...

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.780
That must have been Avdol.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.920
But I defeated him.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.150
Time to finish you...

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.210
There it is!

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.090
...Avdol!

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.990
This time, I definitely hear someone running.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.700
You fool! Jotaro, what are you doing?!

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.840
Judging from the distance between
footsteps, he's about 190...

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.490
No, 195 centimeters tall.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.090
It's not Joestar. These are
a young man's footsteps.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.890
It must be Jotaro.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.840
Jotaro, where are you going?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.970
Hey! It dived!

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.810
The water's started chasing after Jotaro.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.390
So that's what he's trying to do.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.890
It won't attack Avdol again, but... Jotaro!

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.600
He's going to catch up to you!

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.980
I've heard that Jotaro's Stand,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.490
Star Platinum, is the most
challenging of their Stands.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.910
If I can dispose of him, I'm sure
Lord DIO will be very pleased.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.530
For Lord DIO, I'll give my all to defeat Jotaro.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.130
Jotaro picked up something
from the ground just now.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.430
What was at that location?

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.140
What was it...

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.700
No, it wasn't a thing.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.570
It's the dog! Jotaro picked up the dog.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.850
He must have realized, then.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.530
Good grief, you bastard.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.980
You jumped out of the car
before it got attacked, didn't you?

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.070
You can tell where the enemy's
coming from by the smell, can't you?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.620
Don't stop, Jotaro!

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.120
Now, then. You're going to help me out, Iggy.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.790
Where's he going to attack? Tell me, Iggy!

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.550
Otherwise, you'll die, too!

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.910
You won't get any gum from me, either.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.600
Iggy!

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.450
He can float, too?

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.070
You're not getting away!

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.220
I may be heavy, but don't
you dare try to escape alone.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.810
My Star Platinum is incredibly fast.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.960
If you try to shake me off,
he'll snap your neck in an instant.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.920
What? The footsteps disappeared after the jump.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.760
They haven't landed anywhere yet.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.590
Impossible....

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.300
This is good.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.900
Jotaro's going to travel through the air

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.310
and use Iggy to find the enemy's body.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.440
If we can find the Stand user's body,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.060
our chances of defeating
that fearsome Stand are good.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.420
He's gone...

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.660
The sound of Jotaro's
footsteps has disappeared.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.070
Where is he? Where did he go?

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.200
Why have his footsteps stopped?

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.950
He's gradually losing altitude...

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.250
Looks like The Fool can't fly very far.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.420
So now it's just gliding, like a paper airplane?

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.550
My feet are about to scrape the ground.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.350
Hey, don't strain so much.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.010
It's making you fart.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.410
Don't make us hit the ground.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.010
I guess there's no choice.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.650
I'll have to help you gain height
by kicking off the ground.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.890
We regained quite a bit of speed from that,

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.000
but the sound of that impact
put us at a major disadvantage.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.400
He'll know now that we're
traveling through the air.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.680
I see. That dog's Stand...

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.460
It can fly.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.770
And it's coming closer...

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.130
Toward me!

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.810
I must defeat Jotaro before he gets close!

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.270
That guy's Stand is chasing after Jotaro!

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.690
He must've figured it out from that step.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.690
We have no choice but to entrust this fight

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.540
to Jotaro.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.000
It's coming after me.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.930
A helicopter is loud due to the vibrations,

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.380
but Iggy's Stand only makes
sound as the wind hits it.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.870
The enemy probably can't
figure out our exact location.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.560
If I can get to the Stand user
before I lose altitude, I can win!

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:45.860
I finally found him!

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.730
I'm about 400 meters away from his body!

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.670
It seems the enemy is a blind man.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.190
S-Sand! Sand is falling on me!

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.200
He's spiraling sand into the air...

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.820
Not good!

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.340
He can hear the sand bouncing off of us,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.560
like a submarine's sonar!

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.540
I can hear it... The reflected sound.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.230
I even know how high you are...

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.310
Jotaro!

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.090
Geb

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.090
N'doul

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.030
Shoot him!

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.530
Star Platinum!

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.930
No matter how fast Star Platinum may be,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.000
if he can't tell where I'm coming from,
I'm still a second faster!

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.250
One more shot!

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.220
Th-This dog...

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.770
That dog is trying to save itself!

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.630
He pointed out Jotaro's location to my Stand.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.730
He's trying to abandon him!

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.240
B-Bastard...

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.240
You shitty mutt...

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.600
You've acquired such a
selfish dog as an ally, Jotaro.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.900
This is the end.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.920
I will gratefully bring this to an end...

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.990
Shwoom

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.220
Wha—

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.270
What? Something was thrown this way!

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.640
It's slicing through the wind...

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.930
What is it?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.920
It's Iggy.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.250
Come on, now.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.960
If you and Iggy don't use your
Stands to defend yourselves,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.190
there's going to be a collision.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.320
This overwhelming power...

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.910
Curses! He's going to crash into me!

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.490
What kind of person is he? Throwing a dog...

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.840
Damn it! I was one blast away
from finishing Jotaro...

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.320
Damn!

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.110
I couldn't verify Jotaro's location
because I was too busy with the dog!

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.750
Where? Where is he?

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.030
He's not moving...

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.340
He's staying absolutely still somewhere.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.780
This must be his plan!

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.450
Where are you, Jotaro?

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.360
Where? Where the hell are you, Jotaro?

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.960
Right here.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.510
I see...

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.260
I didn't realize you had gotten so close.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:31.010
If I hadn't recalled my
water Stand to defend me,

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.070
you would have already
knocked me out from behind.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.930
I guess I don't need to use this
staff to help me listen anymore.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.850
But I'll need this staff to help me get home.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.440
You knocked off my hat.
Even the ocean couldn't manage that.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.830
But don't worry. I held back.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.370
You aren't critically injured.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.110
Impossible! You just used your own Stand to...

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.240
What the hell are you thinking?!

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.240
Jotaro, surely you considered interrogating me

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.630
about the other eight of us,
who you are about to encounter.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.320
Joseph Joestar's Stand, Hermit Purple,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.790
is able to read thoughts.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.810
So I must not say

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.320
anything that might leave
my lord at a disadvantage.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:30.980
DIO...

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.470
Why are you all so loyal to DIO?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.410
So loyal that you'd die...

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:44.490
Jotaro, I have no fear of death.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.210
Because of my Stand's power,

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.960
I haven't known fear of death since I was a child.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.320
I could defeat any enemy,

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.590
and could commit murders
and other crimes as I pleased.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.600
The police didn't scare me at all.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.230
I'm sure that dog understands how I felt.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:16.010
He was the first and only person to make
me feel from the bottom of my heart

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.770
that I did not wish to die by his hand.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:26.820
He was so powerful, deep, large, and beautiful.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.000
And he was the first in this world
to acknowledge my worth.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.400
I waited so long to meet him.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.000
I have no fear of death, but...

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.570
I feared that he might cast me aside and kill me.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.360
The evil need an evil savior.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.310
I will tell you one thing.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.120
My name is N'doul.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.600
My Stand represents what could
be called the Tarot's origin.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.240
It suggests the deity Geb,
one of the nine Egyptian gods.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.460
Menacing

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.930
He is god of the Earth.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.220
The nine Egyptian gods?!

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.340
What do you mean?!

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.300
I'm only going to tell you about my Stand...

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:32.350
Since it was my Stand that you defeated.
But that is all I'll say...

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.350
DIO, who makes fanatics out of people...

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.780
Just who is he?

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.260
And those who suggest the nine Egyptian gods...?

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.440
I don't know what's going on,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.500
but all we can do is continue our journey.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.820
Hey, hey. No need to be defensive.
I'm not mad or anything.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.020
From your point of view,

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.640
the old man dragged you out
into a desert against your will,

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.580
and forced you into a fight.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.600
That had to be a real pain in the ass.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.870
Hey, Iggy. Want a piece of gum?

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.130
Knock it off. I'm apologizing, aren't I?

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.290
Here.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.670
Good grief. What an annoying dog.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.760
You're in the middle of the desert.
Do what you want.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.290
Well, I'll be damned.
You picked up my hat for me?

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.260
Maybe you're not so bad.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.440
Thanks.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.150
Blob

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.930
G-Gum. Y-You shitty little mutt...

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.070
You're no ordinary dog.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:32.930
Hey!

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.930
Jotaro!

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.410
Jotaro! Are you all right?

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.930
Good grief.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.210
Oh? Could that be manga?

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.570
How unusual!

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.510
So there's manga in Egypt, too?

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.020
Would you like a snack?

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.930
Tasty
Donuts

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.760
Say... I might be asking too much,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.230
but could I take a look at that manga?

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.160
I'm a manga artist out on a research trip,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.360
and I'm very interested
in rare manga and books.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.450
In exchange, I'll let you use these binoculars.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.620
What's this? The title is
<i>Zenyatta Mondatta Brothers Adventure</i>.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.760
There's no author credit...

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.160
Huh.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.420
These pictures are pretty unique.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.170
It's well-printed, and in full color!

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.280
In a certain place,
there lived two very close brothers.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.880
My name's Zenyatta.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.760
My name's Mondatta.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.860
The younger brother, Mondatta, was very shy,

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.550
so he couldn't do anything
without his big brother Zenyatta.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.060
He was always alone.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.760
While his big brother, Zenyatta, was out,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.900
Mondatta met a traveler who was very kind to him.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.900
Smile
Smile

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.030
The traveler gave him snacks and
let him look through his binoculars.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.950
Mondatta had a very good time.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.950
Peace                                                       Eek Eek

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.850
Oh, it's 10:30!

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.570
But that kind traveler

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.670
impaled his throat on an electrical pole and died.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.380
What a strange manga.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.200
Is stuff like this popular in Egypt?

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.420
And this book itself is pretty weird.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.670
The pages from here on are all blank.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.260
Nothing's been printed...

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.990
So it's missing pages.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.810
But it's an oddly realistic and thrilling manga.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.870
I know I may be asking too much,
but would you please sell me this book?

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.100
Not happening.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.650
What?

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.790
My little brother's book is not for sale!

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.020
Menacing

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.940
Get the hell out of here.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.540
Little brother?

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.740
Didn't you hear me?!

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.990
Little bro, I told you not to talk to strangers.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.340
There are a lot of bad people in this world.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.840
Everyone! The bus for Aswan is about to depart!

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.200
Let's go.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.830
They should be heading to

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.480
a hospital in Aswan to treat their wounded.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.480
I see...

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.140
I guess we can't do much about that.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.350
We'll have to wait for the next bus.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:16.280
Ba-bam

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.060
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.380
We are unstoppable brothers!

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.760
Who's there?!

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.960
It's me, Polnareff.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.750
Jotaro, what happened to your uniform?

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.360
You're acting weird today.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.070
Could it possibly be that you're...

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.890
Could it be...

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:36.500
Could it be...

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.800
Zenyatta, the predictions are absolute.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.070
Episode 27

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.070
Khnum's Zenyatta
and Thoth's Mondatta

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.070
Do your best!
