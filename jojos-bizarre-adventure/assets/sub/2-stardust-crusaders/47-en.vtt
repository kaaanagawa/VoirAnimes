Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.760
So my The World's power and
precision are both superior!

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.490
I've seen enough. I'm satisfied.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.520
I will end you now!

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.000
I have decided that
I will show no mercy when

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.900
fighting one of the Joestar bloodline,
but will kill them instantly!

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.080
The way to end you is with
The World's true power!

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.030
The World! Stop time!

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.740
The World!

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.120
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.300

Episode 47  DIO's World, Part 3

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.040
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.140
With this, the Joestar bloodline will finally end.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.900
My archenemies, who dared to
make an appearance in my destiny...

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.610
Farewell!

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.370
Wha—

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.380
What?

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.120
He just moved!

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.210
He... Impossible!

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.520
His finger just moved!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.940
I-It can't be.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.260
It can't be!

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.470
They're... the same?

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.480
So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.880
The World and Star Platinum
are the same type of Stand?!

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.090
Can he see me?

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.610
Or is he moving his hand subconsciously?

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.840
Time's up.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.560
Bam

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.250
Could you see me?

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.560
I asked if you could see me, Jotaro!

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.460
Who knows?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.560
I don't know what you're talking about, DIO.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.260
Very well! It doesn't matter!

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.290
It doesn't matter if you can see me
during stopped time or not!

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.290
If you can move the same way as my The World,

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.920
let me see you moving!

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.340
Yes, it was six months ago
when I first stopped time.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.290
In order to test out my
Stand's power and speed,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.230
I had one of my servants
fire a shotgun at me.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.700
As I went to catch the pellets...

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.710
For a moment,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.860
it looked like everything had stopped.
That's when it all began.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.320
At first, I thought it was an illusion.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.600
Trained boxers and those who are in accidents

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.940
feel each moment as if it were
several seconds or minutes...

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.910
I thought it was something like that.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.170
But The World was able to step

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.930
around the pellets that hung
suspended in stopped time.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.050
And...

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.800
It could grab the pellets!

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.750
It's not an illusion!

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.750
Lord DIO!

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.390
You will surely be able to control time!

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.760
You must believe with more conviction
that you can move within stopped time!

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.750
It must be like breathing.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.890
Like being able to snap an HB
pencil in half with your fingers!

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.780
You must believe it's a perfectly
natural thing for you to do.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.860
What's most important is
to recognize it as such.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.060
You must believe that
it's natural for you to do it!

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.460
You are the emperor of this world!

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.800
It's only natural for you to control time!

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.120
Clang

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.640
And then one day, I felt the wheels of time

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.420
truly enmesh themselves with The World.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.860
It was like a beam of light
piercing the darkness.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.880
It truly was a magnificent feeling.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.430
I, DIO, had truly surpassed
all forms of life and all Stands!

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.920
And now, I can stop time for five seconds,
and longer and longer intervals each time!

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.150
Jotaro! I shall see just
how powerful you truly are!

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.960
The World! Stop time!

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.870
You had placed that magnet on me.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.490
When we were testing each
other's strength earlier?

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.340
It looks like a magnet taken
from a wallet or pocket planner.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.320
You completely fooled me.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.290
I can't take my eyes off you for a second.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.940
But!

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.070
If you're using a trick like this,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.050
that proves you can't move during stopped time!

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.330
You only added a few more seconds to your life!

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.510
This time, you will...

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.620
Die, Jotaro!

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.260
<c.colore1d131>Zwoosh</c>

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.250
Bagoom

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.740
What?!

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.260
H-He... really can move!

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.500
Only for a moment, but he can move!

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.770
The magnet wasn't to trick me
into thinking he could move...

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.710
But to trick me into thinking he couldn't,
and lure me closer!

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.740
You must believe it's only natural
that you can stop time!

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.540
Of all things, this descendant of the Joestars

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.990
has invaded my world of stopped time...

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.210
I could move for a moment... Just a moment.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.800
But...

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.060
Good grief.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.960
It was only enough to get one punch in.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.930
You. Woman.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.440
Fetch my leg from over there.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.300
Hurry up and fetch it!

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.850
Behave like a flight attendant,
bringing a drink

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.150
and caviar to a first-class passenger!

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.390
I guess I have to bash your head to pieces,

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.870
or it'll be like nothing ever happened.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.620
You've already recovered your energy.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.470
Because that hole I put in
your gut is closed up now.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.460
Your eyes followed me in
the world of stopped time...

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.700
So you truly can see my movements, Jotaro.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.900
Seems so.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.980
Kakyoin did quite well for you.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.400
Because he figured out the
secret of The World's powers,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.980
you were able to figure out that you
could move during stopped time,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.820
and so, you were able to invade my world.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.250
Which makes me think...

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.880
Just how long can you move
within my world of stopped time?

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.870
Two seconds? Three?

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.590
Or perhaps you can move five seconds,

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.930
just like me, and you're just
pretending that you can't? And so on.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.410
Well? How about it?

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.220
This isn't good.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.810
I could move longer with some practice,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.650
but right now, a moment is the best I can do.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.120
I believe that you can only
move for a moment now.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.130
But since you have invaded
my world of stopped time,

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:40.560
it would not be wise to
underestimate you by getting close.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.130
Even when I still have an
overwhelming advantage.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.270
Therefore, Jotaro, I've decided how to kill you

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.100
such that it doesn't matter
how long you can move!

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.970
You've gone pale.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.460
When you saw these knives,

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:02.490
you realized that you face a more
horrific fate than that geezer Joseph.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.520
Bastard!

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.690
How the hell does he come
up with stuff like this?

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.980
He's dangerous.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.780
You cannot escape!

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.230
The World!

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.810
Five more seconds!

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.640
Once time begins to move again,

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.460
I wonder if even your Star Platinum

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.850
can manage to deflect so many knives.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.520
Four more seconds!

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.510
Being able to see this must be
all the more terrifying, Jotaro!

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.640
Three more seconds...

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.210
Just two more seconds...
Is that all you can do?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.270
This proves that you really can
move only for a moment.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.670
One more second...

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.590
Zero.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.070
It's over.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.160
I'll add one more, just to be sure.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.520
To be frank, I'm relieved that

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.080
I could defeat you so quickly, Jotaro.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:48.210
I never thought you would be
able to enter my stopped time.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.050
As I see it, those machines known as
automobiles are useful devices,

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.270
but because everyone has one,
the streets become too crowded.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.690
Only I, DIO, should have
power over stopped time.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.560
Good grief.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.280
Throwing all those knives...

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.750
Now my valuable uniform is full of holes.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.620
I stuffed my clothes with magazines
just in case he tried throwing anything...

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.300
But I didn't think he'd throw
that many knives at me.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.900
Playing dead and waiting
for a chance to strike is the

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.980
best chance I have right now.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.610
I need to figure out how
to knock off his head...

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.300
Otherwise, he won't die.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.010
I'd better play it safe.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.250
The Joestar bloodline has
proven itself rather lucky.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.250
He might be trying to
trick me by playing dead.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.620
I must end him beyond
a shadow of a doubt!

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.510
By...

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.340
chopping his head off with this!

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.300
This is truly the end for you,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.610
Jotaro!

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.900
Die, DIO!

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.040
The World

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.550
Die!

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.670
Polnareff!

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.350
The World! Time has stopped...

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.520
So it's you, Polnareff?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.230
And time will move once more.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.930
Too bad, Polnareff.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.450
With just a moment more,

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.340
and with just a tiny bit more force,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.210
you could have torn my brain
apart with your rapier.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.480
B-Bastard! This is impossible...

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.860
You cannot assassinate DIO.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.850
Joestar's Egyptian tour group

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:50.600
will be no more, once I finish you.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.270
Damn it. Polnareff's going to get killed.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.890
I wanted to play dead as long as possible,

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.950
until I could land a blow to his head, but...

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.080
It would be easy for me to keep
Polnareff's head on his shoulders.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:11.620
But DIO won't enter
Star Platinum's attack range.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.670
It'll end up like it did last time.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.760
I have to make sure he
doesn't realize I'm alive.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.560
As long as he doesn't know for sure,

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.210
my chance to get close to him will come.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.390
Talk about irony.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.880
I tried my hardest to move
inside his stopped time,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.080
but now I have to try my hardest
to stay completely still.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.400
Farewell, Polnareff!

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.850
Jotaro, you...

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.660
You're alive... or you're coming around.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.600
Dont move! We're the police!

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.750
We have guns pointed at you!

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.280
Put your hands up slowly.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.180
All right. Perfect timing.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.280
There's something I'd like
you to shoot with that gun.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.230
Shoot the man lying on the ground over there.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.290
You can shoot his leg, his torso...
Whatever you like.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.650
Come on. Be sure not to miss.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.520
Perhaps I was just imagining
that sound I thought

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.290
I heard coming from Jotaro.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.360
What a sick thing to do...

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.210
But now DIO's attention
is on me, not Polnareff.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.930
Right now, he's suspicious as all hell.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.400
He'll try to make absolutely
sure that I'm dead.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.490
This is when things get really dangerous.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.380
The sound of his breathing...

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.330
I don't hear it. He's not breathing.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.780
Then what about his heartbeat?

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.510
This is damn tough...

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.060
If I black out, I really will die.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.390
It won't even be funny...

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.190
If I die because I used my
Stand to stop my own heart...

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.720
His heart isn't beating. He is definitely dead.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.700
I thought he was still alive,
but it was just my imagination.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:57.120
Just in case, I'll lop off his head
so that I can truly rest at ease.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.710
All right, Jotaro?

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.300
Rumble

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.930
What?!

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.350
Rumble

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.190
Stop time!

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.900
The World!

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.380
I went through hell there...

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.540
But even if you stop time,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.360
I'm still going to blow your head off, DIO.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.290
Wh-What? It can't be...

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.580
Finally...

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.100
Finally, I was able to bash his head in.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.620
But that bastard DIO is a monster

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:57.450
Menacing

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.720
who survived a hundred years
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.470
I can't believe he's dead yet.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.160
It's too soon to relax.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.290
I'll kill you...

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:16.030
Wh-What is this? Impossible! M-My legs...

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.420
I can't move my legs.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.160
I can't stand!

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.140
I have a headache... a-and nausea...

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:32.340
How could this happen? Me, DIO, feeling sick?

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.100
My head's been destroyed, so I can't get up?!

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.350
Damn it! I have to do something!

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.070
I covered you with gasoline
so I can track your smell.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.690
I feel bad, kicking a guy
when he's down, but...

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.200
Nah. I don't feel bad about this at all.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.110
My friends and a lot of innocent bystanders

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.910
are dead because of you.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.420
The World!

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.930
If I can...

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.570
If I can get to that place...

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.980
Time... Time will move once more.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.080
He put his ear to the ground
to listen for cars coming near.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.240
But...

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.000
I can't let him get away!

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.420
Screech

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.660
That place... That place!

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.310
If I can just get there...

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.810
This place is taken. You can't escape.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.490
Give up, DIO.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.620
The World! Sto—

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.600
You fell for it, Jotaro!

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.890
This is my escape route!

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.650
You have lost in the battle
of wits against me, DIO!

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.150
Doesn't this street look familiar?

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.830
This street... I-It can't be...

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.460
That's right.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:15.050
It was my escape route to take
the blood of Joseph Joestar!

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.310
DIO, you bastard!

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.020
Jotaro...

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.110
This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:33.150
Joestar blood suits me so well!

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.780
This is the greatest high!

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.030
There's one simple answer.
