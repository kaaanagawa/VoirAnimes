00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.790
Before we get started,
there's something I want to try.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.180
Shuffle those cards.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.860
They're shuffled.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.590
What now?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.360
It doesn't matter which one,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.750
but pick a card from anywhere
near the deck's top and flip it.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.870
Only show yourself the card.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.900
Okay, I've looked.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.030
I'll tell you which card it is: the six of hearts.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.030
I'll name the cards in order from the top.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.160
Five of spades, queen of diamonds,
jack of spades, ace of hearts...

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.740
Seven of diamonds, six of clubs,
king of clubs, two of diamonds.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.090
That's correct!

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.460
But D'Arby's the one who shuffled...

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.490
How did you...?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.170
I can name all of the cards,
in order, from top to bottom.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.010
My Star Platinum was able to see the order
of the cards as they were being shuffled.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.270
That's very interesting.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.270
But that just means I have to make sure
you don't see me shuffling the cards.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.370
Don't you get it?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.280
This means you won't be able to cheat.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.780
I just wanted to let you know that.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.530
Good.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.530
Episode 35  D'Arby the Gambler, Part 2

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.660
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.770
The security seal.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.250
An unbroken security seal

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.580
means that no one has ever touched these cards.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.790
There's one joker.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.420
I don't see anything unusual.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.440
They're ordinary playing cards.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.100
I'm at 538...

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.500
540... No, 556 pages.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.290
I'm at my best again today.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.380
I can figure out which page
I'm on just by the feel.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.170
Jotaro's Star Platinum may
indeed have impressive eyes.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.440
But I, D'Arby, can memorize by touch.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.180
Even when I shuffle the cards,
I know exactly where each is going.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.930
Okay! Open the game!

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.610
Ten of hearts.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.620
Seven of clubs.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.740
Looks like I'm the dealer.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.710
I'd better shuffle at an angle
Star Platinum can't see them from.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.800
Cut, if you please.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.190
And now, I shall deal.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.990
To Jotaro, to me, to Jotaro, to me...

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.450
Wh-What?! What happened?!

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.380
Jotaro, his finger!

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.000
Star Platinum just broke D'Arby's
finger out of the blue!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.400
I told you.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.090
I won't let you get away with cheating.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.410
What? Cheating? When?
He was just dealing the cards...

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.900
He didn't make any suspicious moves.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.570
No. Take a good look at
the cards in his left hand.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.860
The second card is sticking out...

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.060
That's the card he just tried to give me.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.560
He made it look like he was
dealing in order from the top,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.080
but he was actually trying to give
me the second card from the top.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.950
That means...

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.440
The card on top would have gone to him.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.050
He would've had three tens with that card.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.380
This technique is called second dealing.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.330
It takes advantage of the assumption
that the cards are dealt from the top.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.060
Instead, this advanced technique
deals the second card from the top.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.980
When done by the nimble
fingers of a professional,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.020
it's impossible for the human eye to keep up.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.180
And in addition, D'Arby is a man who
can memorize the position of every card.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.550
Wh-What a horrible man. Breaking my finger...

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.520
No, I'm being forgiving.
I could've just cut your finger off.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.800
Good grief. I can't trust you to shuffle the cards.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.540
Let's have someone who's not playing deal.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.710
Let's ask the boy on top of that hill.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.450
Good.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.860
Avdol, could you bring him here?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.260
All right.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.030
Impressive...

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.650
To cheat, one must take advantage
of psychological blind spots.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.850
You need more than sharp eyes
to see through cheating.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.350
It seems I underestimated you, since you saw

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.190
through my second dealing.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.030
I shall accept what happened to
my finger as punishment for that.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.290
And now, I shall dedicate all I have
to playing this game with you, Jotaro.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.530
This is my biggest game since May 17th, 1986.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.800
At that time, I won eight properties

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.350
from a Japanese man named
Shozo Mayama, along with his soul.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.110
He was a rich man, and a very strong man.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.310
You see, I'm not facing you for Lord DIO's sake.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.010
I'm facing you because I'm a born gambler.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.900
Wh-What are you planning to do with
Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's souls?!

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.470
Slash Slash Slash

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.330
I have split their souls into six chips each.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.640
In poker, if you believe that your
cards are no match for your opponent's,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.800
you're allowed to fold.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.020
But you must ante up some chips
to participate in each hand,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.800
so two will not be enough.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.560
When you're able to collect all six chips,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.480
you'll have acquired one complete soul.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.790
Understood?

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.650
Now then, Jotaro. I'd like to give
you some chips to bet, as well,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.230
but I haven't heard you say a certain line yet.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.620
Fine. I'll bet my soul.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.790
Good!

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.290
Jotaro...

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.800
The chips that are as white
as snow represent your soul.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.470
Once I take six of those from you,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.520
you will lose your soul.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.970
Osiris

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.970
D'Arby Elder

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.060
I will use one of Polnareff's
chips as my opening ante.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.770
Let us begin!

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.340
In poker, each player is dealt five cards.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.860
Players may discard cards for new ones
one time in hopes of strengthening the hand.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.990
But once gambling is involved,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.910
it becomes a complex psychological game.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.600
Now, I shall discard two cards.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.440
Jotaro, your soul is represented
by a mere six chips.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.730
Make sure you consider your moves carefully.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.040
Boy, you don't need to
understand what's going on.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.810
Don't worry about a thing.
Just shuffle and deal the cards normally.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.250
O-Okay...

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.830
I'll take three cards.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.390
My, my. What a frightening expression.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.640
You must have a very good hand.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.640
Maybe I should play it safe
and bet just one Polnareff.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.720
Call.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.460
If neither one folds, they'll need
at least three chips per hand.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.030
All right! It's game time, Jotaro!

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.370
Two pair, nines over eights.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.370
I'm so sorry.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.950
Two pair, queens over jacks.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.040
That was close. I almost lost.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.760
So then...

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.770
H-He's only got three chips left.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.520
J-Jotaro...

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.280
Next hand. Deal.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.540
It might not just be the next hand, but your last.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.170
I'll draw one card.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.230
What's the matter, Jotaro?

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.150
Hurry and look at your cards,
and decide whether

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.710
you'll bet or fold.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.260
Jotaro?

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.530
I'll...

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.280
keep my cards as they are.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.040
What?!

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.620
Ah, forgive me, but...

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.210
What did you say?

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.110
Did I hear you wrong?

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.670
I thought I heard you say that
you would keep your cards.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.510
You heard right. I'm keeping my cards.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.340
I'll play with these five cards.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.970
I understand that!

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.650
I'm asking if you intend

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.430
to play those cards without looking at them.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.180
These cards are fine.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.320
You can't be serious! Answer me!

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.510
How can you play cards you haven't even seen?!

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.890
By the way, Avdol, I have a request.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.320
A request?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.280
R-Right. Of course, but why
aren't you looking at your cards?

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.120
I told you to answer me, Jotaro!

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.300
In addition to my last three chips...

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.170
I'll wager Avdol's soul.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.540
Wh—

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.300
What?!

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:34.650
D'Arby, you're a calm man.
Every move you make is calculated.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.890
You may not be powerful,
but you are truly strong.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:43.660
I am not a man suited to gambling,
as I easily become emotional.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.510
If I played you, I would most likely lose.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.400
But I believe in Jotaro.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.610
I'm not sure what his unseen cards mean,

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.790
but if Jotaro has asked me to wager,
I shall do so in total faith.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.750
Even if that wager is for my soul.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.290
Well, this is...

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.020
You've both been overwhelmed by excitement.
You aren't thinking straight.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.770
Boy!

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.500
I said I was changing one card. Hurry it up.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.850
O-Okay...

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.900
Mr. D'Arby, I did just as you said.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.850
I gave this Japanese guy useless
cards that won't amount to anything.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.890
My skill never fails.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.910
You will win. There's no doubt about it.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.860
Jotaro, I'm sure you thought you picked
a boy who had nothing to do with this,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.450
but not only are all of the people in the
café working for me, so is everyone in view.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.670
That includes the owner and those men, too.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.010
No matter who deals, I can't fail!

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.630
As I commanded, Jotaro's cards are worthless.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:01.180
Since he made the abnormally bold
decision not to look at his cards,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.980
I had to panic for a moment...

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.630
But it's a bluff! How dare
he try bluffing against me?

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.690
Does he actually think I'll fold? What a fool...

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.990
Hmph. Very well.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.700
In addition to your three,
I'll call with all six of Polnareff's chips.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.120
But on top of that...

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.580
I shall raise you all six of Joestar's chips.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.710
That brings the total to fifteen.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.960
What?

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.280
Wh-What?! Hold on a minute!

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.120
Jotaro doesn't have any more chips to wager!

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.640
What are you talking about? Of course he does.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.010
What do you mean?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.330
Well, for proof, I'll need you to write this down.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.270
Then my Stand will be able to work.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.770
What are you talking about?

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:53.480
You have the soul of Kakyoin,
who's still in the hospital.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.320
What?!

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.110
Now, time to be frightened!
You're going to lose even more confidence!

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.140
I'll see your cool facade crumble
right before my eyes!

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.850
How dare you try to bluff me, D'Arby?

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.840
I won't be satisfied until I see

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.330
your poker face collapse
into terror when you lose!

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.290
Fine.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.460
I shall wager Kakyoin's soul, too.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.040
J-Jotaro!

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.890
Y-You're wagering the soul
of a man who isn't even here!

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.740
Is that going too far?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.450
Hey, Jotaro! What did you just do?!

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.330
What did I do? What are you talking about?

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.440
You just lit a cig—

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.410
Is something the matter?
Are you not feeling well?

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.950
Th-This little...

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.160
His confidence! He couldn't possibly...

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.660
Could he have used Star Platinum to
switch the cards while I wasn't looking?

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.430
Menacing

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.390
I, Jotaro Kujo,
will wager my friend Noriaki Kakyoin's soul,
and offer it if I lose.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.520
S-Stupid brat!

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.680
Don't cast that worried look in my direction!

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.760
If they find out you're working for me, I'll kill you!

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.960
You fool! Damn it!

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.830
I have four kings in my hand.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.970
The only hands stronger than that
are four aces, a straight flush,

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:36.950
Four Aces

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.960
Straight Flush

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.960
and five aces, using the joker.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.960
Five of a Kind

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.730
If Jotaro, who didn't even look at his cards,
got any of those hands,

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.390
it could only happen after
replacing all five cards.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.810
No matter how fast Star Platinum may be,

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.430
could he have possibly switched out not only one,

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.080
but all five cards without me noticing?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.330
Of course not! There's no chance in hell!

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.920
There's no way he could have switched

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.910
all five cards under the eyes
of the undefeated D'Arby!

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.370
All right, Jotaro! Let's do this!

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.000
How dare you try to bluff with that cigarette?!

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.420
Y-You've got a drink?! When did you...

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.530
Y-You bastard! How dare you underestimate me?!

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.930
Very well, let us do this!

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.240
My cards are—

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.430
Hold it.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.040
I still have the right to raise.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:35.520
What?!

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:41.150
R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-Raise?!
You don't have anything left to wage—

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.410
I raise you my mother's soul.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.410
What?!

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.740
You mother?! Jotaro, Ms. Holly's soul...

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.040
Bang

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.590
I came to Egypt to save my mother.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.410
So if I wager her soul, she won't complain.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:12.950
But, D'Arby, you'll have to
match my mother's soul.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.750
For that...

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.570
I'll have you tell me the secret of DIO's Stand!

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.740
His demeanor...

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.890
He must know the secret of DIO's Stand.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.220
But traitors will be killed.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.660
If he speaks,

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.040
it means that D'Arby's life is good as over.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.040
Jotaro... If you're that confident,

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.280
you must be sure to win, right?

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.990
I can believe that, right?

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.010
Your cards are that strong, right, Jotaro?!

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.930
Well? Do you bet or not?

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.690
Let's hear you say it loud and clear, D'Arby!

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.830
I'll say it!

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.470
I'll say it, damn it!

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.950
I'll say it!

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.810
I'm the greatest gambler in the world!

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.400
I'll take this bet! I'll call!

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:46.220
Call, call, call, call, call,
call, call, call, call, call...

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.010
I'm going to call!

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.260
Ca—

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.090
C— C— Ca— C— C-C-C—

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.770
I-I can't! I'm terrified! I can't speak!

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.450
I'm so scared, I c-c-can't speak!

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.200
C-C-C-C...

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.160
I-I can't... I can't breathe...

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.030
C-C-C-C-Ca—

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.170
Ca—

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.160
This guy... H-He passed out!

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.500
He's standing, but he's unconscious!

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.720
He got so nervous, he passed out.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.480
Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's souls
are coming back! We're saved!

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.380
He gave up on the wager in his heart.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.740
He admitted defeat, so their souls were released.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.080
F-Four of a kind!

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.200
H-His hand was a four-of-a-kind with kings!

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.460
J-Jotaro, what in the world was your hand?

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.040
I-I knew it...

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:28.800
Woozy

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.050
All of the cards I dealt him were worthless!

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:38.190
Even Star Platinum wouldn't be
able to cheat someone like D'Arby.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.680
I managed to scare him so much, he folded,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.230
but with such a worthless hand...

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.710
Good grief. If I had known,
I would have freaked out.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.710
F-Freaked out?

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:52.820
Jotaro, you wagered all
that on worthless cards?!

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.050
It appears his collection has
been freed to cross over, as well.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.730
Come on, everyone! Let's all play mahjong!

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.690
Backgammon is a lot of fun, too,
and dice games are thrilling.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.060
Though I'll beat you all!

Osiris's D'Arby: Retired

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.210
Osiris's D'Arby has retired.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.320
I don't think we'll be able to
get DIO's secret out of him now.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.490
Yeah. But he was a strong enemy.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.700
He almost beat all four of us by
himself. He's really something.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.550
Yes, he was truly terrifying.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.830
I'm not sure what's going on, but yeah.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.510
We didn't get to look good at all this time.
