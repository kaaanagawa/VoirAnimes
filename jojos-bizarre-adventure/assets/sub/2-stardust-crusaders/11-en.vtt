00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.170
He's got such a strong face,
and yet he died in an instant.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.230
Well, the end of someone's life is
usually a pretty sudden curtain call.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.590
It's probably normal to die without
being able to say goodbye.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.440
It may seem like I'm talking as
though I know everything, but...

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.750
Polnareff! Please, don't let him get to you!

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.190
Do you still not understand?

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.690
Mr. Avdol told you not to fight by yourself!

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.020
And you ignored that...

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.570
You wanted to get revenge,
even if it meant dying with your enemy.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.400
Mr. Avdol followed you because that
worried him, and this is what happened!

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.410
So what am I supposed to do?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.340
We need to fall back for now.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.490
Avdol was cruelly stabbed in the back.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.300
My sister was killed without resistance.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.790
You want me to hold these
regrets inside and run away?!

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.060
Don't fight them when we don't
even know how their Stands work yet!

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.900
Don't fight a battle that will kill you!

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.310
That's what Mr. Avdol was trying to tell you.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.580
Hey! Come on, li'l Pol Pol.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.500
Why, you...

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.160
Polnareff! Slowly come back towards me.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.700
We're going to use that
truck to get out of here.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.490
Y-You're telling me to hold it in?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.990
A-All ri—

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.130
Hey, Polnareff.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.350
Bam

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.980
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.980
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.440
Episode 11:
The Emperor and The Hanged Man, Part 2

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.860
Avdol died for you.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.660
I think that means you owe him.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.820
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.700
He might not have died, if not for you.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.270
Y-You bastard.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.420
Where's your real body?!

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.250
Polnareff, calm down!

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.080
But there's no need to be sad.
Actually, you should be happy...

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.510
Since you'll be together again soon.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.550
You'll die, and then you can be with
those two fools in the next world.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.650
Your little sister was really cute, Polnareff...

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.200
Once you're reunited with your
sister, you should ask her

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.200
about exactly how I killed her!

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.200
Polnareff, don't let him provoke you!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.960
He <i>wants </i>you to attack!

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.170
Bastard!

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.970
Your Chariot cannot cut my Hanged Man.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.500
I am within a mirror.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.940
Your Stand can't enter a mirror. That's why!

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.360
You mad?

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.310
I bet you're mad.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.450
Hey, Hol Horse. Fire away.
Let's put an end to this idiot.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.410
Aye aye, sir.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.650
Die!

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.500
Emerald Splash!

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.170
What?!

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.300
What? He shot...

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.550
...Polnareff!

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.360
Kakyoin, was it? Not bad.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.970
That's out of my Stand's range.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.380
Even if I hit him from here,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.830
the bullet wouldn't hit with much force.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.720
Mr. Centerfold went after them, eh?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.880
He must really want to finish off Polnareff.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.670
S-Sorry, Kakyoin.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.340
I-I...

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.270
I thought I didn't care if I died,
so long as I could avenge my sister.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.360
But I understand now...

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.320
I understand how Avdol felt.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.410
I won't let his feelings go to waste.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.110
I'll fight to keep living.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.860
Do you really understand?

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.600
Yeah.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.370
Crack

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.370
Take this instead of a handshake as
proof that we've made up, Polnareff.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.010
Right. Th-Thank you, Kakyoin.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.510
When they come after us again,
we'll defeat them together.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.170
Avdol, you...

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.260
At that moment, I'm sure that
I stabbed him with the sword.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.790
But my strike didn't land.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.030
There was no resistance.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.660
Even after breaking the mirror,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.000
his Stand, Hanged Man,
still attacked from the shards.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.510
He'll attack my reflection
from within the mirror.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.590
My Stand can't go inside a mirror...

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.720
How am I supposed to attack him
if he's in some kind of mirror world?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.870
Damn it!

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.680
Polnareff, you keep talking about

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.310
"inside the mirror" and "the mirror world,"

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.100
but there is no world inside a mirror.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.610
This isn't some fantasy or fairy tale.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.700
What are you talking about?
You saw it, too, didn't you?!

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.900
You can only see him in a mirror,
and when you turn around, he's not there.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.740
Yes.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.150
But what you see in a mirror
is just a reflection created by light.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.750
You don't have to tell me that!

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.990
Listen! I'm talking about
what's going on right now.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.300
If there are such things as Stands,
there could be a mirror world, too!

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.600
There isn't.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.390
Look, you...

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.540
I think that fact is what will let us
solve the mystery of Hanged Man.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.420
If Stands can defeat other Stands,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.110
then there's still something
we don't know about his—

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.380
Polnareff! He's inside the
plating on the steering wheel!

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.060
What?!

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.580
He's caught up to us!

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.080
Look out!

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.750
A-Are you okay, Kakyoin?

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.650
I-I hit my chest, but I'm fine.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.320
What?

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.320
Chariot!

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.370
Slice

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.080
Kakyoin! Get away from
anything that's reflective!

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.720
Damn it... I got it. I just saw it.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.490
He's going from mirror to mirror!

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.220
He moves by jumping from one
reflective surface to another!

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.760
He traveled all this way

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.730
by reflecting over and over!

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160
Reflecting?

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.130
That means he's actually light!

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.650
The true nature of his Stand is light?

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.730
Kakyoin! He was just in the car's bumper!

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.140
He's going to reflect off of the
car's bumper and into something else.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.060
Don't go near anything that's reflective.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.740
And take anything off
your body that reflects!

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.740
Take off the buttons on your uniform!

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.430
Mister, are you guys okay?

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.220
Want me to bring some medicine or something?

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.630
Hey! Kid! It's dangerous, so get out of here!

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.800
Hey, your car's totally messed up...

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.230
Hey, you're bleeding.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.760
What?!

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.440
Are you okay?

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.440
Th-That asshole!

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.230
He's in the kid's eye!

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.470
Hey, kid. Don't look at us.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.980
Huh?

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.650
I told you not to look at us!

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.540
Stop following me with your eyes! Damn it!

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.300
Huh? But you're hurt.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.350
I'm fine! See? Perfectly fine!

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.660
So go look over there!

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.700
But you're bleeding...

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.050
Look over there, you brat!

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.540
Damn you, Centerfold!

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.230
What are you going to do?

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.550
You wouldn't stab this cute little kid's eye out

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.550
with that sword of yours,
would you, Polnareff?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.150
Polnareff!

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.550
I finally got you.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.440
You can't run anymore.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.140
Not unless you stab the kid's eye out.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.400
What a coward! This is unforgivable!

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.660
Hey, Kakyoin.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.490
You don't say things like
that in this kind of situation.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.220
Listen! In situations like this,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.000
you've got to say something more
like this before you get your revenge.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.710
My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:11.430
For my sister's honor, and so that
my friend Avdol can rest in peace...

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.390
I'm going to hurl you

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.790
into the depths of despair, Centerfold!

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.020
Forgive me, kid! I'll buy you a caramel later!

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.360
There's sand in my eye!

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.350
Slice

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.610
Bam

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.610
P-Polnareff, he's in your eye...

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.580
I don't really understand the principle,

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.950
but he essentially moves at the speed of light.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.210
A speed that you wouldn't
normally be able to see.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.210
But I knew that if the kid closed his eyes,

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.850
the next place he'd move
to would be my own eye.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.220
I see...

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.270
Hanged Man can only exist
within the world of reflections.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.780
When one world is about to be destroyed,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.930
he has to move to something
else that's reflective.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:05.970
So...

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.110
As long as I can read his trajectory,
he'll be easy to cut with a sword.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.340
His real body is over there!

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.410
You bastard. Finally...

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.140
Finally!

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.700
We finally meet...

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.850
Centerfold!

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.940
My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.650
and I've seen through your Stand's secret.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.820
It's a Stand of light that
moves at incredible speed.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.290
There's no way I can catch it.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.660
But if I know where it's going to go,

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.280
and I slash its trajectory in that moment,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.290
I can slash you, too!

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.280
If Kakyoin and Avdol hadn't shown up,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.790
I probably wouldn't have figured that
out and you would have killed me.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.420
Polnareff! He's not the
man with two right hands!

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.300
That's not Centerfold!

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.990
Wh-What?!

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.080
Polnareff!

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.020
Emperor

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.020
Hol Horse

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.330
Polnareff!

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.460
Over here.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.150
Bam

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.430
You fool!

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.120
I'm Centerfold.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.540
You...

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.260
He's just a drifter that
happened to be in town.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:56.040
I just used a knife to give him
the same wound I have.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.630
You totally fell for it!

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.650
Coming close to him

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:06.310
without knowing what I
looked like was a big mistake!

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.410
You bastard!

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.320
Take this! My Emerald—

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.090
Hey, hold on a sec.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.300
Take a good look around you.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.130
Hey, gather 'round!

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.810
These guys say they'll give you money!

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.380
What?!

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.630
They'll give us money for nothing!

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.880
Thank you!

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.430
You have such big hearts!

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:35.880
Thank you! Thank you!

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.290
Thank you!

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.640
Please give us money!

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.390
Have you figured out what's going on?

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.360
You say you've seen through my Stand?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.620
You fool.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.020
I've known about my Stand's
weakness for quite some time.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.020
If there are lots of reflective surfaces
so you can't find its trajectory,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.280
it has no weakness!

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.340
Don't look! Don't stare!

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.700
Don't stare at us!

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.830
You can't run anymore.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.170
What are you going to do? Blow everyone up?

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.030
You sacrificed your youth to hunt me down...

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:21.600
And you're going to fail before you finish?!
Talk about a lonely, boring life.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.000
Meanwhile I, Centerfold,
will continue to have cute girls

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.730
like your sister all around me,
and live a fun, happy life!

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.390
Come to think of it, your sister

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.320
was really good at sobbing...

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.530
You can die now.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.900
Wh-Why, you...

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.510
Polnareff, that's not what you say here.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.540
When taking revenge,
you shouldn't say, "Why, you..."

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.960
You say this.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.230
My name is Noriaki Kakyoin.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.440
To avenge my friend, Avdol,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.970
and so that the soul of my friend
Polnareff's sister may rest in peace,

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.920
I will have you pay with your life.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.000
I'll give this gold coin to whoever picks it up.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.580
It's so shiny, you can see your face in it!

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.160
Now I see, Kakyoin.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.750
Looks like all of their eyes
are focused on one point now.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.790
Yeah.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.290
We know the trajectory that
Hanged Man will have to take!

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.240
Merci, Kakyoin!

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.810
The moment!

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.900
Rip

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.500
Hold it!

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.450
It won't open!

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.560
Looks like you're the one who's
really good at sobbing, Centerfold!

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.000
Well, you're about to fall to Hell,
sobbing the whole way down.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.240
But there's one thing I can't rely on
the guardians of Hell to do for me.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.010
And that's...

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.720
To turn you into a pincushion!

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.560
I've been waiting years for this moment!

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.040
I'll leave the rest to King Yama.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.290
So this is the true Hanged Man...

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.290
He was rotten to the core.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.350
I got my revenge.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.930
Hanged Man

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.930
Centerfold

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.610
Hold it!

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.160
I finally caught up with you guys.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.030
Why are you walking so slow?

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:33.540
If you're gonna run,
run like your lives depend on it.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.790
Right, Mr. Centerfold?

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.510
Better say your prayers. Your lives end here!

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.770
So act like this is the end and come at us!

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.740
Show us what you've got, damn it!

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.890
Right, Mr. Centerfold?

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.520
Hey, are you listening, Mr. Centerfold?!

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.460
I don't think he's listening anymore.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.820
He's rather busy right now...

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.340
Since he's being sentenced in Hell!

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.470
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:22.510
Don't try to pull that nonsense!
Bluffing won't work on me!

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.580
There's no way you can beat him!

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.780
Even I don't stand a chance
against the invincible Hanged Man!

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.050
Polnareff, your jokes suck.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.680
That piece of shit's body is about
two or three thousand meters that way.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.860
Want to take a look?

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.320
Okay, I will!

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.900
Hey! You're running away?!

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.210
I-I don't stand a chance!

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.240
I'm at a total disadvantage by myself!

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.830
I'll run for now and wait
for the next opportunity!

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.110
I'm the type whose power only shows
when I'm paired with someone else.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.060
Being #2 is better than #1!

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.710
That's Hol Horse's philosophy of life!

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.050
Got a problem with it?!

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.010
What?!

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.650
Mr. Joestar! Jotaro!

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.430
We already know about Avdol.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.440
Though it was a simple funeral,
his body's been buried.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:32.620
The one who stabbed Mr. Avdol in the
back was the man with two right hands,

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.580
but the cause of death was Hol Horse's bullet.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.010
What shall we do with him?

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.660
I'll give him his sentence.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.010
Death!

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:48.740
Wha?!

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.720
Please run, Sir Hol Horse!

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.100
Sir Hol Horse!

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.780
What's with this woman?!

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.030
I don't know what's going on,

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.730
but I'm always thinking of you!

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.010
That is my reason to live!

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.190
Please run! Hurry!

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.820
You bitch! Let go of me!

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.820
What are you thinking?!

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.380
Jotaro! Kakyoin! Don't let Hol Horse get away!

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.070
Too late.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.160
Huh? Oh...

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.730
Well said, baby!

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.120
I'll gladly accept your
feelings and keep on living!

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.630
I'm running away because I love you, baby!

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.190
Forever!

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.250
Why, you...

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.290
Come back here!

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.390
Ah...

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.040
Don't "ah" me, you bitch!

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.810
Polnareff, that woman was
just another one he was using.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.590
And he no longer had any intention of fighting.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.450
We have no time to deal with him.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.070
Avdol is gone.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.670
But we have to hurry ahead.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.460
It's already been fifteen
days since we left Japan.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.480
Damn it...

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.740
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.010
All right! Let's resume our trip to Egypt.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:25.320
Listen up! In order to defeat DIO,
our hearts have to be as one.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.400
We can't go off on our own!

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.880
That's when he'll come after us.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.700
Got it?

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.760
Let's get a move on!

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.780
Good grief.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.700
The city of Varanasi is coming into view.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.770
Murderer!

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.390
I am the culprit!

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.680
I am Joseph Joestar! An American!

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.940
What?!

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.700
I love you.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.370
Hey... doesn't that sort of
look like a person's face?

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 12

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
The Empress
