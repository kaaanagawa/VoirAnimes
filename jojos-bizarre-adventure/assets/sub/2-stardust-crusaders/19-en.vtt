00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.850
So noisy...

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.270
What is this place?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.040
It's an amusement park!

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.220
I've never been here before.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.370
Wh-What am I doing lounging
around on a ferris wheel?

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.290
Something's wrong.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.550
I'm sure we were traveling through
the Saudi Arabian desert by camel...

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.460
But everyone's gone.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.880
Am I by myself?

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580
Still, something's strange.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.890
There are no children in this amusement park,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.610
but I keep hearing a baby crying.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.650
I wonder where it is...

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.750
Menacing

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.250
Th-This card is...

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.530
Death 13!

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.750
The card is moving!

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.150
Kakyoin! Kakyoin!

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.800
Come on, give me a break!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.410
Stop freaking out and shaking
the bed like you're in <i>The Exorcist</i>.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.070
You scared me to death.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.960
Where are we?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.720
Don't ask dumb questions.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.790
Come on, get up already.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.960
Once we eat, we're flying outta here.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.390
Today looks like another hot one.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.560
I had a terrifying dream.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.890
It was truly terrifying.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.570
Ooh, what did you dream about?

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.300
Let's hear it!

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.540
Well, I can't remember. I've forgotten it all.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.150
What?

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.400
Anyway, it was terrifying.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.530
You saved me when you woke me up.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.530
Man, don't say weird stuff like that.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.560
We're leaving. Hurry up and get ready.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.000
My hand is cut.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.070
When did that happen?

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.410
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.410
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.990
Episode 19: Death 13, Part 1

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.090
Jotaro and Mr. Joestar have
already headed to the plane.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.060
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.380
We're gonna travel 500 kilometers today.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.310
My dog!

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.070
My dog... is dead!

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.520
Who would do such a thing?!

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.350
A dog...?

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.740
A dog...

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.250
I could have sworn I saw a dead dog not long ago...

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.390
It's awful, but it has nothing to do with us.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.830
Let's go.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.550
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.050
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold on a sec, Mister.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.560
Whaddya mean you can't sell us the plane now?

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.820
You said last night you'd sell it,
and even took my money.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.300
I'll return your money.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.780
You see, the baby's sick. It's a 39°C fever.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.440
Huh?

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.740
There's no doctor in this town, so we
have to take the baby somewhere else.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.590
Th-Then how about the plane over there?

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.120
That one's broken.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.500
The others are out and
won't be back any time soon.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.600
What's up? Some kind of argument?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.500
Yeah.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.900
A baby...

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.310
A baby, a baby...

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.260
I seem to recall hearing a baby cry...

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.760
But I can't remember where...

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.550
The plane will be back tomorrow night.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.070
I can sell it to you after that.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.040
Tomorrow night?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.450
Someone's life is on the line for us, too.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.350
We can't afford to spend two days lollygagging.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.400
Then are you going to let that baby die?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.910
Well...

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.550
Um, how about this?

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.770
Let's leave the baby with these gentlemen,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.130
who can visit the doctor on their way.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.170
Uh, but that's...

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.310
The Cessna only carries four.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.670
But there's room enough for a baby.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.300
I could swear I just saw it smile...

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.890
And it already has teeth...?

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.530
You sure, lady? You wanna
leave the baby with these guys?

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.890
H-Hold it. That's also a problem!

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.820
It's dangerous for a baby to come with us.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.590
I said this would be dangerous...

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.660
Don't worry, Mr. Joestar.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.460
No one would send their
Stand after us in the air...

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.380
We even made sure the
plane itself wasn't a Stand.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.260
I'm more worried about the Old
Man's flying than enemy Stands.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.330
Oh, thank goodness. What a relief.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.420
By the way... I wonder whose baby that was.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.120
You're not its mother?

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.580
I found it by the well this morning.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:53.450
But somehow, that baby's voice made me dizzy,

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.090
and made me think it needed to be on that plane.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.040
Wha...

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.560
I always get so tired when I get on a plane...

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.140
Sorry, Mr. Joestar, but I'm
gonna nap for about 30 minutes.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.060
Sure.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.580
The hell is this?!

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.160
K-Kakyoin, what is this place?!

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.580
Where's Mr. Joestar? And Jotaro?!

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.090
Bam

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.910
The dream I had this morning is continuing.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.130
We're inside the dream!

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.250
What? A dream?

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:45.970
Yes.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.340
Oh! So this is just a dream.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.730
What a relief. A dead dog
isn't scary if it's just a dream.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.480
Polnareff, what are you saying?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.690
Dreams are only scary
because you think they're scary.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.060
Come on, relax.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.240
You're wrong! How could we
both have the same dream?!

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.560
You've got a point. It's kinda weird,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.250
but that could happen in a dream.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.550
Whoa! How did this happen?

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.270
This is both convenient and lucky!

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.170
See? If you think they're fun,
dreams become fun.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.290
Listen! You saw this dog's
corpse this morning, didn't you?

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.190
This dog must have had the same dream I did.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.100
It was killed in the dream!

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.480
That's also when my hand was cut.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.230
By who?

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.360
The enemy's Stand, Death 13!

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.320
The enemy's Stand?

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:43.950
Yes.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.760
Oh, you had a dream about Stands?

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.960
Come on, relax already.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.600
No! It wasn't a dream about Stands.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.000
A Stand was in my dream!

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.910
Right. So this is a dream, yeah?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.380
You're so dense!

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.970
Lali-ho! Talk about a big idiot!

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.930
For pity's sake...

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.930
I'm saying that you're slow, Polnareff!

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.440
I-It's coming from the dog's wound...

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:28.860
Lali-ho! You're in the Death
God's world of dreams, Polnareff!

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.860
A megaphone...?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.360
Wh-What the hell is that?

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.130
Polnareff, get ready to battle! That's Death 13!

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.840
W-Wor—

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.080
Come forth, Hierophant Green!

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.940
Come out, Hierophant!

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:01.810
Chario—

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.820
Hierophant isn't coming out!
I can't summon him!

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.820
Chariot isn't coming out!

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.990
Is it because we're inside a dream...?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.000
Lali-ho! Don't you think it's romantic,
being able to die in a dream?

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.580
Lali-ho!

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.000
Death 13

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.850
J-Jotaro, do you feel that?

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.640
Yeah. I feel it.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.610
Are you stupid?

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.780
You know that only a Stand
can defeat a Stand, don't you?

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.490
It's time for your eternal sleep, Polnareff.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.250
Lali-ho...

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.250
Polnareff!

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.450
Die!

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.110
Polnareff.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.730
Wake up, Polnareff.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.590
Polnareff, the baby's wet himself.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.710
Change his diaper.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.400
Curses! Someone must have woken him up.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.650
He's quite lucky.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.890
Lali-ho. Well, that's fine.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:38.120
As soon as he wakes up,
his memory of this is gone.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.320
I'll just have to get him
when he falls asleep again.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.580
Then, Kakyoin, I guess you're first.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.340
Lali-ho!

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.520
Hey, are you awake, Polnareff?

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.470
The diaper! Change the diaper!

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.340
All right...

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.850
I feel like I had a terrifying dream...

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.060
But I don't remember what
happened in it. I've forgotten...

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.900
Once you've changed his diaper,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.900
you can go finish that dream.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.980
I won't wake you up again.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.150
H-Hold on a second!

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.310
This kid's crapped his diaper!

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.630
Look! Just look at this!

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.280
Well, he's a baby.
That's why he wears diapers.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.640
Seriously?! You're serious about this?!

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.140
I had no idea! What a vile creature...

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.270
Man, it's all over the place...

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.830
Stop yapping and change it already.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.910
It stinks.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.760
Aren't you embarrassed?
Hurry up and become an adult.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.080
Does this work?

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.060
Well, I say it's good.
Jotaro, hold on to the edge there.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.460
I'm going to pin it.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.430
Right. Like this?

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.540
Hey, hold on to the baby.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.000
Lali-ho!

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.930
Stop! Stop it!

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.210
What's the matter, Kakyoin?

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.880
Hey!

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.890
What's going on?

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.810
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.140
Crap!

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.470
I can't control it!

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.150
Hey, are we going to crash?

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.960
Stop!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.780
Kakyoin, what the hell is wrong?

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.410
He was like that this morning, too!

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.430
Whatever, just calm him down.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.150
Old man, hurry up and regain control!

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.000
We're going to crash!

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.640
Hey, Kakyoin, calm down.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.960
We're about to crash because of you.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.470
Lali-ho.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:04.970
Talk about a rough sleeper.
You're gonna kill my user at this rate.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.290
Y-Your user is that baby?

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.770
I-I can't believe it...

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.650
He's only about six months old...

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.150
Eleven months. Eleven months!

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.480
I'm a genius. A genius!

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.660
I may crap in my diapers, but I
know a lot more than you guys.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.630
Lali-ho!

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.770
Now you won't be able to scream anymore.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.450
A Stand within a dream...

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.890
I have to let Mr. Joestar and
Jotaro know of this somehow...

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.170
What are you doing?

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.500
Hurry up and level us out.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.520
Stop fussing! I'm a man who doesn't know panic.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.360
I'm working on that right now!

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.370
I'm not waking up...

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.940
Lali-ho. Looks like no one's going
to notice if you're cutting your arm

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.250
with a knife that's smaller than my wee-wee.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.380
Besides, you can hurt yourself all you want
in a dream, but it won't wake you up.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:25.500
As long as you're asleep,
I control your mental energy.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:32.390
Death 13 is a Stand that enters
the unguarded mental state of sleep.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.970
Damn it. Stop!

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.500
What's wrong, old man?

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.990
We're crashing!

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.490
I'll control it with Hermit Purple!

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.580
I did it!

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.790
I got control back just in time!

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.670
A close one...

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.250
Looks like we managed to avoid crashing.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.420
Those guys are dangerous.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.370
Now then... how about I kill you
by crushing that heart of yours?

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:14.650
Then Joestar and the others will just
think that you had a heart attack.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.190
Die! Kakyoin!

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:23.520
Did you all see that?! How do
you like my flying now, huh?!

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.060
Hey.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.530
Smash

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.810
Wh-Why is there a palm tree out here?!

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.050
Good grief... So...

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.790
This is actually happening?

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.130
Abu Dhabi

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.880
Crash

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.130
Cairo

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.500
Crash

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.130
Crash         Site

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.700
Is this enough?

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.330
Yeah, thanks.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.610
We survived, but...

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.830
Kakyoin, what's going on?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.140
This is all your fault.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.620
I don't know...

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.400
I feel like I might have had a terrifying dream.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.370
When I woke up, I was dead tired.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.380
Is there something wrong with me?

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.410
Cheer up. I'm sure you're just too tired.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.180
It's been about a month since we left Japan,

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.680
and the enemy's been
attacking nonstop ever since.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.580
Hey. Looks like the baby's fever's gone down.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.820
Thank goodness he's safe.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.770
If we lost him, I don't know what we'd do.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.320
Peek-a-boo!

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.570
Peek-a-boo!

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.040
Such a cute smile!

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.680
What's so funny about that?
It's not even a joke or anything.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.330
What an idiot.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.840
Shut it. I'm getting tired of humoring this guy, too.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.100
Hey, Old Man. The radio's not busted.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.790
What should we do?
Should we send out an SOS?

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.430
That'll mean DIO can find us, but...

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.790
It can't be helped. Let's call for rescue.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.940
We'll do it for the baby.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.290
I thought something hurt...
There's blood again.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.350
Did I cut it when we crashed?

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.580
Bam

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.500
What? The cuts form letters.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.250
Baby... Stand?

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.000
That's what it says...

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.340
Wh-What does that mean?
It's my handwriting.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.510
I can't remember...

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.640
Did I do this to myself?

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.780
There isn't any blood on my knife,

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.310
but it seems it was done with this blade.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.210
Did I forget something really important?

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.490
Damn it. I heard they were clever...

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.000
But he actually carved letters

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.270
into his arm while cutting himself...

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.460
What was that look in the baby's eyes?

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.760
And as soon as our eyes met,
he consciously looked away.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.300
Baby...

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.700
Stand...?

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.230
Baby... Stand.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.180
Did something really happen to my mind?

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.320
I'm starting to think...

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.500
that this baby is really a Stand user!

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.840
Hey, Kakyoin! What are you doing?

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.840
Come on, that's too rough.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.050
You could strangle him doing that.
What's wrong with you?

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.350
M-My apologies...

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.560
There, there, it's all right.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.850
Let's get something to eat.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.450
I'm sure you'll calm down once you eat.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.980
Hey, Jotaro. It looks like
Kakyoin's really losing it.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.620
There, there, everything's okay.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.070
I wonder if he's gonna make it through this trip.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.010
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.050
What do you think about Kakyoin?

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.150
Did you see that?!

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.120
Kakyoin, that's enough. Stop that.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.240
How foolish are you?

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.730
He's a Stand user!

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.940
Did you cut that into your arm yourself?

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.780
Do they misunderstand even more?

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Lali-ho!

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.030
