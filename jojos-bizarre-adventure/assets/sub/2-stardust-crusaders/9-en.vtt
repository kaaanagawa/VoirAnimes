00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.250
DIO!

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.310
Where's Kakyoin?

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.600
He's with Jotaro.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.280
Can I get some ice cream?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.010
Welcome.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.510
Little girl,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.120
ice cream is good, but this is tasty, too.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.730
It's chilled coconut juice.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.240
How about it?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.980
I guess we can try it.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.450
Give us three.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.860
Thanks. That'll be twelve dollars.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.870
Hey, make that six dollars.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.520
This should cover it.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.700
Okay.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.240
Thanks!

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.080
I'll take that!

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.150
Menacing

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.150
You thought you could get away
with stealing my wallet, you little shit?

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.030
Huh?

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.360
Cough up your guts!

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.360
Smash

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.210
Kakyoin!

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.990
Why, you...

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.490
You're worth about as much
as a sewer cockroach's dick.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.250
The idea that...

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.940
Choke

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.280
you thought you could steal my wallet with

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.610
Crack

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.660
Snap

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580
the same fingers that wipe your filthy ass...

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.650 position:80%
Pop

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.590
I can't let you get away with that, can I?

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.410
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.810
Hey! What are you doing, Kakyoin?

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.100
He's going to die.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.740
A-Amazing. A back-breaker?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.290
Such a vicious move!

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.730
And he's using such filthy language...

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.490
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.860
Kakyoin!

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.620
Didn't you hear me tell you to stop?!

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.600
Kakyoin, you bastard.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.090
Something's wrong with you.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.340
Did you get worked up?

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.010
That hurt...

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.130
You didn't have to push me like that.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.450
That guy tried to steal my wallet,
which makes him a very bad person.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.350
Of course I should punish him.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.730
Am I wrong, Jotaro?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.550
He's...

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.500
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.500
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.110
Episode 9: Yellow Temperance

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.260
What are you glaring at?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.410
The look in your eyes is awfully hard, Jotaro.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.220
You couldn't be

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.230
planning to part ways with me just because

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.970
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.110
I hurt that thief a little, could you?

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.010
Hey, a rhinoceros beetle.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.390
Awesome!

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.100
A rhinoceros beetle? Where?

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.780
There're four of them up there.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.020
I see them!

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.370
Awesome!

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.760
Jojo,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.450
don't think so hard about this.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.660
I'm just a bit annoyed today.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.000
The trip's exhausted me
and left me in a bad mood.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.990
You're in a bad mood?

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.380
Seemed to me you felt pretty good.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.660
The old man and Avdol think it's a
good idea to head to India by train.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.480
We're leaving tomorrow.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.490
We're taking a cable car to
Singapore Station to reserve tickets.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.620
Mr. Kakyoin...

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.150
Jojo's getting further ahead.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.660
R-Right. I'll catch right up.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.290
I guess you like coconut juice
a lot, huh, Mr. Kakyoin?

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.710
Huh?

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.790
Th-That was a rhinoceros beet—

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.180
N-No. I must have seen it wrong.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.690
It must have been a fiber from
the coconut or something.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.250
Yes. I love coconuts.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.240
Is something wrong?

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.960
I-It's nothing.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.630
Hey, Jotaro.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.680
Are you going to eat that cherry?

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.990
If you're not gonna eat it, give it to me.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.230
I'm starving.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.230
Uh-oh! Look out, Jotaro!

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.010
Jojo!

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.680
Kidding!

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.140
I'm just kidding,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.770
dear Jotaro.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.450
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.120
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.960
I-It's like Kakyoin-san's
a totally different person!

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.360
There you go again!

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.300
What're you glaring at with
that stupid look on your face,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.390
Jotaro, my buddy?

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.270
Get on, Kakyoin.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.390
The cable car is here.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.920
I told you to get on.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.990
Here, I've got a ticket for you.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.760
Take it and get yourself lost,

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.500
now that you've been possessed!

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.750
Wham!

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.020
What?!

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.260
That's not quite right.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.920
"Possessed" isn't quite right.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.810
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.980
That's not Kakyoin!

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:21.610
Haven't you realized that my
body's been getting bigger?

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.630
Who are you?

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.930
A Stand?

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.550
But I was able to touch him just now...

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.120
Is there a Stand that I can actually hit?

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.660
Jojo!

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.020
I combine with any flesh that I consume.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.900
So I'm a Stand that normal
people can see and even touch.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.070
I'm Yellow Temperance, of the Temperance card.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.180
This is my true, handsome face!

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.190
Come on, Jotaro, my buddy!

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.090
Take a look at your hand.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.860
There's a little bit of me
there from when you hit me.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.190
Let me warn you.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.950
If you touch that, it'll go
after your left hand, too.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.240
Go ahead and pick your
nose with that left hand!

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.280
This is a Stand that devours things slowly...

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.960
The more it eats, the bigger it gets.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.330
You'll never get it off!

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.390
D-Damn you...

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:19.500
Come on!

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.270
Whaddya mean, "come on"?!

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.510
While I'm digesting you, I'll be sure
to stuff your mouth with your own shit!

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.260
I-It burns.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.610
Y-You bastard...

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.150
Oh, J-Jojo's grandpa? There's trouble!

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.370
Anne? What's wrong?

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.310
M-Mr. Kakyoin is...

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.650
Kakyoin?!

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.530
Did he actually betray us?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.410
Mr. Kakyoin's face split apart!

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.610
But Mr. Kakyoin wasn't actually Mr. Kakyoin!

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.420
And...

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.470
Jojo's in the cable car and there's

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.920
this weird slime eating his finger
and we're in a lot of trouble!

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.920
Calm down! Where are you right now?

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.090
The cable car station near the trade center!

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.800
He's being attacked!

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.640
Mr. Kakyoin is attacking Jojo!

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.170
Hurry and come back to the hotel—

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.110
Did someone say my name?

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.020
Where have you been?

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.590
Jojo left me behind,
so I was sunbathing by the pool.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.420
With your school uniform on?

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.400
Yes. So?

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.070
It's all right. He's the real one!

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.660
Which means, Anne, your Kakyoin is...

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.000
a fake!

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.450
I know that!

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.550
Jojo!

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.570
Jojo just jumped out of the cable car!

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.050
Star Platinum

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.050
Jotaro Kujo

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.370
G-Good grief.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.300
A Stand that combines with flesh?

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.770
It's devouring my finger...

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.400
Anyway, before I fight him,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.250
I need to do something about this Stand.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.550
If worse comes to worst,
I might have to chop off my finger.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.600
Do you really think you got away?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.500
Well, I guess I'd better tell you.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.970
Get a straw, suck out all the
gunk in your ears, and listen up.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:30.470
My Stand, Yellow Temperance,
has no weaknesses.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.680
It's not that you ran away.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.350
It's just that I don't have to chase you,

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.610
you little shit!

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.120
It'll burn me, too,
but I guess I'll burn it to death.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.800
This...

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.660
It just made it spread!

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.790
Heating it is a bad idea...

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.800
Damn it.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.640
Pardon.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.960
Oh, my. Talk about a strange entrance.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.480
Don't mind me.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.650
Hey, kid. Lemme see your ice pop for a sec.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.310
Hey! What are you
doing to that boy's ice pop?

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.670
Is this your kid?

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.820
No.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.150
Then shut up and enjoy the scenery.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.220
Sorry. When we get to the ground,
I'll buy you a new one.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.830
'Kay.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.330
If I can't heat it...

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.910
That bastard!

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.720
N-Now it's forming needles and
digging deeper into my hand!

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.550
Hey, you! Fire and ice won't work at all.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:09.190
I told you. It doesn't have a weakness.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.090
You little shit!

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.910
You're...

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.910
Papa! The puppy! The puppy!

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.420
You bastard! You were already in this cable car?

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.010
M-My Pocky!

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.840
It's dangerous! Don't pull!

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.060
Let go!

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.100
I'm here to finish you off...

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.440
Jotaro, my buddy!

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.480
You're fast! But...

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.730
Like I keep telling you,
I don't have any weaknesses!

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.100
Are you even listening to me?

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.440
You dumbass redneck!

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.420
My Stand is essentially an
armor that consumes power.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.200
A barrier that attacks!

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.370
No matter how fast you may be,
no matter how strong you may be,

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.480
it's absolutely useless
before Yellow Temperance!

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.750
You can't defeat me!

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:16.220
You can't even run,
unless you cut off your right hand!

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.470
Do you understand?!

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.390
You have no way of winning!

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.250
You can't get away!

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.140
Not until you're digested! I'll eat you up!

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.230
Good grief.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.210
This thing really doesn't have a weakness.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.100
It could be the most powerful thing ever.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.530
How terrifying.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.870
But the Kujo family... No.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.530
The Joestar family has its own philosophy

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.440
when it comes to fighting.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.250
I still have

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.500
just one strategy left.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.750
What?

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.570
That's...

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.630
That's...

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.480
...to run away!

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.350
What the hell?!

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.620
You're in the middle of being eaten, you ass!

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.100
My Stand's got a hold of you that you
can't escape, and you say you'll run?

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.360
I may be running...

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.360
But I'm running into the water.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.810
I-I can't breathe...

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.300
You opened your Stand's guard
so you could breathe.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.100
No matter how invincible that Stand may be,

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.840
if I defeat the user, the Stand will die, too.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.630
Do you understand?

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.050
You sure said all the crap
you wanted to back there.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.770
I'm the type that takes such things to heart.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.310
Crush

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.330
S-Stop...

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.820
I can't recover anymore!

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.450
My nose is broken.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:09.580
They're going to have to wire my jaw, too.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.650
DIO bought my services.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.090
I don't plan to risk my
life going after you people.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.240
There! See?

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.920
How about you talk?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.720
Tell me about the Stand users
that are planning to attack us.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.880
Th-That's the one thing I can't say.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.710
I have some pride.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.730
I can't rat out my own side...

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.270
I see. Well, that's honorable.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.650
I remember now!

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.430
Death, The Empress, The Hanged Man,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.780
and The Emperor are the
four that will come after you!

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.690
I see. And what are their powers?

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.450
I-I don't know.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.720
N-No, really! I really don't know!

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.740
Stand users don't show others their powers,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.300
because it'd expose their weaknesses.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.570
B-But there is some witch
who told DIO about Stands...

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.890
And her son is among the four.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.950
His name is Centerfold.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.850
He's a man with two right hands.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.050
His card is The Hanged Man.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.240
He's the one that killed
Polnareff's sister, isn't he?

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.740
I've heard a rumor about his powers...

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.350
A mirror. Apparently, he uses a mirror.

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.190
I haven't actually seen it,

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.490
but Polnareff has no chance of winning.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.840
He's gonna die.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.510
I just realized, Jotaro...

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.830
But it looks like the goddess
of fortune is still on my side.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.240
See that drain?

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.260
There are a lot of crayfish around it.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.080
Take a good look.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.200
A manhole...

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.330
That little drain

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.080
is connected to the manhole that's near me!

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.070
I'm gonna pull you in and hold you there!

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.420
Now you can't attack me!

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.920
Looks like what I told you

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.100
about the man with two
right hands will go to waste.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.950
Jotaro Kujo!

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:37.480
To think there was a hole so close
that I could pull you into...

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.980
Man, am I ever lucky!

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.080
I even ate some crayfish and powered up.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.740
I'll crush you up

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.490
and turn you into jam!

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:55.950
If I kill you, DIO will give
me a hundred million dollars.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.750
To think I can make that much
from a few minutes of fighting.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.740
Don't you think I'm pretty lucky?

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.100
You ball-less little dick!

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.760
Good grief.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.750
It's rather hard to observe yourself.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:19.290
Haven't you realized you
were only lucky up until now?

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.900
Before, you only suffered a broken nose.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.650
That was when you were truly lucky!

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.150
Crush

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.820
A water pressure punch...
f-from inside the drain?!

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.670
I-I was just kidding, Mr. Jotaro!

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.860
I was just messing with ya!
I didn't mean anything by it.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.680
Come on, now.
Did you take it personally?

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:03.960
Y-You're not thinking of
hitting me any more, are you?

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.580
I'm a seriously injured man...

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.360
My nose is broken and my
jaw's gonna have to be wired shut...

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.460
I have nothing more to say to you.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.830
You're too pathetic

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.460
to talk to any more.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.010
Yellow Temperance

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.010
Rubber Soul

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.600
Good grief.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.100
So we're finally heading to India.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.360
So the man with two right
hands is called Centerfold...

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.970
By the way, where's Anne?

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.880
She was at Singapore Station

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.150
up until the time the train departed, but...

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.640
I'm sure that the time for her
to meet her father had arrived,

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.160
so she went to see him.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.570
I can't help but think that
the brat was lying about

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.570
seeing her father, though...

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.170
Well, it's a bit lonely without
her around, isn't it, Jojo?

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.130
But talk about creepy...

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.090
A Stand that perfectly disguised itself as me.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.390
Apparently, it had already
transformed when we left the hotel.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.240
Jojo, are you going to eat that cherry?

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.220
I don't mean to be greedy,
but they're my favorite.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.740
Could I have it?

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.690
Yeah.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:30.910
Thanks.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:37.820
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.990
Hey, look, Jojo. Flamingos in flight.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.780
Good grief.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.790
Jojo...

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.770
My wallet's already been stolen!

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.380
No, thank you!

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.580
Tip! Tip! Tip!

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.020
If you don't give me a tip,
you won't go to heaven, Mister.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.520
Hey! Don't put your nose on it!

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.030
Avdol! Is this India?

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.990
Episode 10

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.990
The Emperor and
The Hanged Man, Part 1

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.990
Yes! Isn't it a great country?
