00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.810
As I thought...

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.240
Joseph's blood suits me well.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.230
It suits this body so perfectly,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.080
my strength is recovering
faster than ever before!

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.920
It suits me...

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.300
It truly suits me!

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.130
This body belonged to Jonathan
Joestar one hundred years ago.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.810
The blood that I just drank was
from his grandson, Joseph!

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.960
And the one who allowed me to make it this far

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.730
was you, Jotaro.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.250
The Joestar bloodline was mere dog shit
on the road that is my destiny,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.570
just something lying in my way...

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.980
But in the end, it appears that the
Joestars are fated to be my tools.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.420
O-Old man...

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.880
O-Old man.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.890
No matter...

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.930
No matter what DIO is about
to do to my body down below,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.960
you must never get enraged
and lose your cool, Jotaro.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.930
Don't worry about me anymore.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.290
This happened because it had to happen.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.040
Is this... the old man's soul?

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.260
Kakyoin solved the mystery of DIO's Stand.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.990
I relayed his message to you.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.300
If we had all fought DIO at once,
we would have all perished instantly.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.380
You've become able to move
a bit within stopped time.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.620
You have two or three seconds now...

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.060
Use that time wisely.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.030
No matter what DIO does now,
you mustn't get angry.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.360
If you fly into a rage and strike first,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.040
you'll only put yourself in a bad situation.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.370
Jotaro...

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.300
This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.790
So much happened.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.240
I swear...

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.430
These fifty days really were fun.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.200
Was I seeing things?

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.530
Hey!

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.570
Where are you looking, Jotaro?

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.280
Bam

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.170
B-Bastard...

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.940
Now he's just an empty shell!

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.800
The old man told me not to
get angry, no matter what.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.800
But that's not possible.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.060
No one could stay calm after seeing that!

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.100
This is the final round!

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.530
The World!

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.070
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.900
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.900
Stardust Crusaders

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.410
Episode 48  Long Journey  Farewell, My Friends

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.240
The World! Stop time!

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.050
Wryyyyyyyyyy!

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.300
One second has passed!
Two seconds have passed...

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.420
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.480
Three seconds have passed! Four seconds...

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.780
Five seconds have passed.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.860
Six seconds have passed.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.810
Seven seconds have passed!

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.830
I still feel the power!

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.720
I can still keep it up!

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.580
By the way, Jotaro.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.540
You shouldn't be able to move any longer.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.190
You probably gambled on the two seconds

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.220
before time starts to move again,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.970
but you've miscalculated.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.340
What a truly magnificent feeling!

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.700
I feel so good, I could break out into song!

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.900
Eight seconds have passed!

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.440
One hundred years ago, I attained immortality,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.470
but I didn't feel as absolutely
wonderful then as I do now!

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.240
Joestar blood suits me so very well!

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.090
This is the greatest high!

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.590
O-Old man... You were right.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.400
Getting mad has gotten me into trouble.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.750
But this isn't the end of it.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.630
I still have plenty more rage to hurl at him!

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.360
Nine seconds have passed!

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.590
I've stopped time for nine seconds!

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.270
But it appears that stopping time for
nine seconds is my current limit.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.060
Y-You bastard...

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.560
Now to unleash all of my Stand's power!

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.370
Jotaro! You said something
about being pissed off...

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.100
But your fury can achieve no more than that!

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.910
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.460
Useless!

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.970
And now, without pause, my final attack!

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.540
The last and final time I will stop time!

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.140
Within my nine seconds of
stopped time, I shall end this!

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.850
The World!

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.200
One second has passed.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.370
Two seconds have passed.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.260
Three seconds have passed.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.630
For some reason, DIO disappeared
while time was stopped.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.520
Four seconds have passed.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.510
However, Jotaro has abandoned thought.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.130
No matter what DIO has planned,

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.090
or what attack he might unleash

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.520
in the two seconds that Jotaro
can move within stopped time,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.850
all he needs to do is drive Star Platinum's
fists into him in those two seconds!

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.270
Five seconds have passed.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.940
The one thing that I know, DIO,

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:27.030
is that the next time I see your face,
I'm probably going to bust a vein!

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.030
Six seconds have passed.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.120
Bring it on, DIO!

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.810
Seven seconds have passed.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.810
Road roller!

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.120
Kaboom

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.140
It's too late! You cannot escape!

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.610
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.150
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.920
Eight seconds have passed!

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.530
I'll smash you flat!

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.290
Nine seconds have passed.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.690
I did it.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.160
It is over.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.980
Star Platinum has finally been
defeated by my The World!

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.120
Immortality! Eternal life!

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.210
And Stand power!

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:44.570
This proves that no one can surpass DIO!

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.320
Puny humans! I shall rule you all!

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.790
Bow before my knowledge and might!

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.330
Ten seconds have passed!

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.630
Now my ability to stop time
has reached ten seconds!

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.090
Now, then...

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:08.440
I guess I should find Jotaro's
lifeless body and drink his blood.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.500
If there's any blood left to take!

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.920
Wh-What?

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.150
My body's movements a-are slowing down...

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.910
N-No... I'm not slowing down...

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.280
I-I cannot move. I-Impossible!

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.830
M-My b-body won't move at all!

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.620
DIO!

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.090
It's been eleven seconds.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.540
I guess that's your limit now.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.050
What?!

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.260
I stopped time at the nine second mark.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.550
That let me escape.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.180
Good grief.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.840
Now...

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.240
It won't take even a second to finish you off!

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.910
J-Jotaro!

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.990
The World

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.150
I-Impossible! You stopped time?

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:25.000
Right at the end of my
nine seconds of movement...

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.870
How does it feel, DIO?

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.330
Having someone approach from behind
while you can't move a muscle,

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.570
if I had to describe it,

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.070
is like when a guy who can hold
his breath underwater for a minute

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.730
finally comes up for air at the very last second...

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.970
When suddenly, he feels someone
grab him, and he's dragged

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.880
back down into the water.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.850
Does that sound right?

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.120
But for you, I feel no pity at all.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.790
Crack

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.540
Time has begun to move again.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.340
I don't feel even the slightest
bit of compassion for you.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.590
I haven't even an ounce of pity for you.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:24.310
However, just finishing you off
by beating you to death now

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.940
would leave a bad taste in my mouth.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.440
How many seconds will it take
for your legs to recover?

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.450
Three seconds? Four?

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.600
The moment you've healed,
I'll throw Star Platinum at you.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.950
So bring it on!

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.000
If I were a gunslinger in a Western, I'd say...

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:51.070
"Draw. Let's see who's
the fastest gun in the West."

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.170
H-He's...

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.930
mocking me!

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.130
But... But, Jotaro...

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.200
You may have come this far,
but you are still only human.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:13.440
You think like a human,
who has so little time to live.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.530
About things leaving a
bad taste in your mouth,

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.200
or living your life with no regrets...

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.700
That kind of reasoning is about
as compelling as rat shit

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.960
in a bathroom, and it will be your demise!

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.960
I, DIO, have no such thoughts.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.060
Within my mind is but one simple thought.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.630
Just one!

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:40.260
To be victorious and rule! That is all.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.470
That is all I need to feel satisfaction!

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.990
How I do it...

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.850
...does not matter!

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.190
How do you like being blinded by blood?!

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.940
I've won! Die!

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.720
Wha...

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.330
What?!

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:31.540
I-Impossible... I-I'm DIO...

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.060
I am DIO!

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.760
Now if I just wait until dawn,
you'll turn into dust.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.200
There's only one reason why you lost, DIO.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.500
There's just one simple answer.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.010
You really pissed me off.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.100
D

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:07.180
DI

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:07.270
DIO

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:07.310
DIO.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.350
DIO..

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.470
DIO...

DIO...

Star Platinum

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.980
Jotaro Kujo

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.870
This is the Speed Wagon Foundation Car Two.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.080
We are currently traveling
north on Al-Nil Street.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.880
We have retrieved DIO's body.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.450
I repeat. We have retrieved DIO's body.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.320
DIO's body will stay alive until
it is exposed to sunlight.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.510
Proceed with caution!

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.120
Make sure you don't let down your guard.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.010
Roger.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.270
Noriaki Kakyoin is dead. We are
transporting his body via helicopter.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.510
Jean Pierre Polnareff is unconscious.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.620
He is currently being treated in Car One.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.430
Roger.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.530
By the way, I've got a
question for you, Car Two...

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.170
Why did you put DIO and Joseph
Joestar's bodies in the same car?

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.130
Because it's not over yet.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.050
DIO borrowed something...

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.790
Huh?

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.090
And I need to get it back.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.790
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.800
Is it possible to transfuse blood
from one corpse to another?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.580
A-Are you suggesting we put DIO's blood
into Mr. Joestar's withered corpse?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.310
Are you trying to bring
Mr. Joestar back to life?

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.730
DIO sucked out his blood just minutes ago.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.160
DIO's upper body has been annihilated,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.320
but I want him to return what he's still got.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.980
Don't you think we can still make it in time?

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.920
So he says. Did you hear that? Over.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.320
R-Roger...

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.960
I-It's impossible! He doesn't have a pulse...

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.240
That means his heart has stopped,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.140
so it's impossible to make blood
circulate throughout his body!

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.170
Impossible?

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.210
We did a lot of impossible
things on this journey.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.770
I'm tired of hearing that things
are "impossible" or "useless."

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.470
Those words mean nothing to us.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.270
You said we have to get
his heart moving, right?

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.710
Good timing.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:16.000
Thanks to DIO, I've had practice
with stopping and starting hearts.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.610
I hear a pulse!

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.360
His heart's moving!

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.580
Hurry! Extract the blood from DIO's
body and perform the transfusion!

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.580
This just might work!

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.010
L-Look!

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.150
His shriveled skin is already regaining color!

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.020
His flesh is softening and stretching!

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.820
Brainwaves! We're detecting brainwaves!

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.290
I can't believe it! His heartbeat is regular!

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.240
His eyes! He opened his eyes!

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.540
We did it! He's come back to life!

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.670
Old man?

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.470
You fool, Jotaro!

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.980
Y-You bastard! It can't be...

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.480
Thanks to you, I live again!

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.770
You!

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.920
W-Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding!
Kidding! I'm just kidding!

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.910
It's just a joke! A joke!

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.060
Sorry! I was just messing with you a little.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.430
It's definitely me!

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.670
I'm Joseph Joestar. I was
born September 27th, 1920.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.420
My wife's name is Suzie Q.
I like to collect comic books!

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.170
Who's the female lead in the
1981 film, <i>Tarzan, the Ape Man</i>?

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.980
Bo Derek.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.810
Who sang the parody of
"Beat It," named "Eat It"?

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.430
Al Yankovic.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.190
Good grief. I guess you are the real thing,

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.580
if you know pointless crap like that.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.980
This is Car Two. It's amazing!

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.740
Mr. Joestar has woken up!

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.730
Mr. Joestar has come back from the dead!

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.840
Hooray! Over!

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.030
Now you've returned what you took from us,

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.750
DIO.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.040
Now, it's over.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.500
So many people lent something to DIO.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.370
Many people, for the last hundred years.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.840
They lent him everything.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.830
And too many of those things
will never be returned.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.510
Yeah. The things we can't get back
are too numerous, and too great.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.790
What we've lost is as vast
as the planet Earth itself.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.740
But it's all because of them...

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.010
It's because of them that we still live.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.220
Kakyoin.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.570
Iggy.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.650
Avdol.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.460
It's over.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.710
Are you really going back to France, Polnareff?

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.840
You don't have any more family there, do you?

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.130
Why don't you come to New York with me?

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.310
Mr. Joestar, even though my family
is gone, France is my homeland.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.920
I have many memories in my hometown.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.820
No matter where I go,
I'll always return there.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.550
But if you ever need me, give me a call.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.240
Wherever in the world you are,
I'll come running.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.990
It'll be lonely without you.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.700
There were many hardships,

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.180
but it was a lot of fun.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.960
That journey was fun
because all of you were there.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.950
Yeah.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.420
Yes, it was fun. I believe that
from the bottom of my heart.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.440
Passengers on France International
Airlines Flight 92,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.730
bound for Paris, please head to Gate 18.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.720
Well, see ya, you shit-stained geezer!
I hope you live forever!

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.230
And you, his stingy grandson!
Don't you dare forget me!

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.810
Let us meet again!

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.740
If you don't hate me by then,
you little jackass!

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.880
I couldn't forget a guy like you if I tried.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.750
Take care.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.870
So long.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.050
Yeah.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.380
So long.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.730
Holly...

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.250
Why are you sitting up all of a sudden?

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:54.460
I... Suddenly, I feel so much better!

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.380
And I just felt it in my heart...

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.170
What?

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.280
They're both coming home, Mama!

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.540
Holly!

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.750
Papa and Jotaro!

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.020
They're coming home!

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.030
End
