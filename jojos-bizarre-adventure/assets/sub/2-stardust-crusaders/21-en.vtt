Previously, on <i>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</i>...

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.790
Hey, old man. Something's not right.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.190
You're going the wrong way.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.040
You seem to be heading toward that island.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.090
Before we enter Egypt, we need to
make a slight detour and meet someone.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.370
He's a man who's extremely
important to this journey.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.220
An important man...?

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.900
Hey, now. Does someone actually live here?

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.760
It's such a tiny little island,
and it looks deserted.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.700
Indeed. Mr. Joestar, does he really live here?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.970
He lives here by himself.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.580
That's what he told me back in India.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.530
Eh? Who do you mean by "he"?

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.850
What? Indian curry?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.260
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.260
Stardust Crusaders

Episode 21: Judgment, Part 1

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.270
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.650
Hey. Someone's watching us
from the grass over there.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.400
What?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.400
He's running away!

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.080
From the back, he looks...

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.760
Yeah. That's definitely familiar!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.160
Hold it! Please wait!

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.930
Come, now. Are you hungry, Michael? Prince?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.440
I kept the nutritional balance in mind
and mixed in the shells you love, too.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.480
There's more over here.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.440
Get nice and fat so you'll
be a tasty chicken, Lionel.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.150
That man... He can't be...

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.400
It can't be...

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.860
Hold it!

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.050
I'll go talk to him. All of you, wait here.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.720
My name is Joseph Joestar.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.760
I'm traveling to Egypt with these three—

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.630
Go away! I won't hear it!

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.710
That voice...

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.750
D-Don't talk to me!

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.730
No one comes to see me with good news!

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.140
It's only when something bad happens!
I don't want to hear it!

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.190
Go away!

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.060
Mr. Avdol!

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.770
Avdol...

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.720
Go away!

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.130
I-It can't be!

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.280
That's Avdol's...

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.950
father.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.160
His father?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.000
He left the world behind,
and lives alone on this island.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.560
I didn't tell any of you about this

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.190
because if DIO were to find
out that we had stopped here,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.920
the peace Avdol's father
enjoys here could be compromised.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.710
I didn't want to let that happen.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.330
But telling him about his son Avdol's death

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.180
won't be easy to do...

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.020
Polnareff!

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.770
Avdol's death was not your fault.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.410
No, it's my responsibility.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.950
I have to carry that.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.430
Is his father a Stand user, as well?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.390
Yes, but I don't know what sort of Stand it is.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.240
Given how his father has treated us,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.540
it's hard to imagine he'll help us.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.320
Leave this all to me.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.200
I'll try talking to his father.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.330
Even if it was to avenge my sister's death,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.250
I'm still the one who let Avdol die.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.280
I'm sure there's nothing I can
do to make it up to his father...

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.530
How depressing.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.080
This is pretty shiny.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.190
I wonder if it drifted up from some sunken ship...

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.380
It's got barnacles all over it.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.210
Looks like it's made of gold, but...

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.780
There's some creepy face carved into it.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.970
But it looks valuable.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.390
I'll try to rub these barnacles off.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.100
Wh-What the?!

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.600
K<c.colorf39df3>a</c><c.colore45c3b>b</c><c.color9fe811>o</c><c.color9064c5>o</c><c.yellow>m</c>

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.260
I-It's gone!

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.240
Wh-What was that just now?

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.850
Did the air trapped inside
burst out all of a sudden?

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.780
It's not Aladdin's magic lamp or anything...

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.380
That scared me to death.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.710
Three!

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.880
You get three!

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.190
I'll grant your wishes.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.630
Tell me three things you desire.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.530
Wh-What the hell is this?!

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.630
My name is Cameo.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.850
I want to thank you for
freeing me from the lamp.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.050
So tell me your three wishes.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.860
Are you a new Stand user?!

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.360
Silver Chariot!

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.100
H-He's pretty good.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.380
He's got incredible power...

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.290
Hey! Judging from your power,
your user must be close by!

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.620
Who is it?!

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.720
Is the answer to that question your first wish?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.720
Are you sure you want to
make a boring wish like that?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.880
Don't "I'll grant you three wishes" me!

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.260
Are you saying you could make me
a super rich man right now?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.480
Huh?!

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.110
Is that your first wish?

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.390
Just try it if you can!
Stop messing with me, damn it!

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.410
Very well. I'll grant that wish.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.290
Hail 2 U!

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.280
(Fortune be with you!)

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.190
Wha...

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.020
What the hell was that?

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.480
It wasn't the enemy's Stand?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.100
What a strange guy.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.300
He didn't attack me, but
told me to make three wishes.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.980
I don't know what's going on,
but I've got to be cautious.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.990
Something's on this island.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.180
I'll have to tell Mr. Joestar
about what just happened.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.940
It could have something to do
with Avdol's father, as well.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.810
What's that?

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.420
I hear a really loud metallic sound...

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.970
Th-This is... It can't be!

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.310
Th-This is gold from the Napoleonic era.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.640
It's not an illusion, or a dream.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.480
It's the real thing.
It's a real treasure of gold!

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.360
A-Are you mocking me?!

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.390
No... If he were mocking me,
when did he bury this here?

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.800
He didn't have time to bury
this after I made my wish.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.750
How'd he bring this here?

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.530
Tell me your second wish.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.010
I shall grant it for you.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.150
Y-You bastard! What are you plotting,
doing something like this?!

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.640
Like I'd fall for your trap!

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.480
If you're my enemy, act like it, and fight me!

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.600
Or I'm going to take this treasure.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.610
Is the answer to that
question your second wish?

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.030
Are you sure you want to
make a boring wish like that?

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:32.410
To thank you for letting me out of
that lamp, I will grant you any wish.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.600
Y-You bastard!

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.820
All right... Then, make me...

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.550
A manga artist!

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.460
That was my dream as a kid!

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.930
I want to be bigger than Disney!

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.460
Don't make me some pathetic sap.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.710
I'm going to build Polnareffland!

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.700
W-Wait, hold on.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.060
Hold on just a second.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.940
Wait, just wait...

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.110
Actually, I want a girlfriend!

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.440
More than wealth and fame...

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.210
I want love!

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.910
Someone who's really cute,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.750
and a relationship like we're
bound by the red string of fate...

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.490
I want to meet a girl who feels the way I do!

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.210
If you can do that, do it right now, damn it!

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.000
A girl, eh? Very well.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.380
N-No, wait. Actually, hold on a sec.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.660
Can you...

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.990
bring someone back...

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.160
from the dead?

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.660
Is the answer to that
question your second wi—

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.070
Oh, stop that already!

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.680
Bring my dead sister back to life!

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.290
Bring my friend, Avdol, back to life!

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.540
You can't do that, can you?!

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.470
Very well.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.430
I'll grant that wish.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.310
Wh-What?!

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.980
Silver Chariot

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.980
Jean Pierre Polnareff

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.490
You said... you can grant that?

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.180
Indeed. But you made two wishes there,

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.250
so I'll grant them one at a time.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.250
I'll start with your second wish, your sister.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.340
Hail 2 U!

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.510
H-Hold it! Who the hell are you?!

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.190
Why would you—

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.630
Wh-What was that sound?

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.940
That sound I just heard...

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.510
I-It sounded like the ground was being dug up...

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.840
I hear the digging again!

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.590
Wh-What <i>is</i> that sound?!

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.680
I-It can't be!

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.380
A-A woman crying?

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.270
Who the hell is there?!

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:51.690
Th-This is...

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.240
H-Hair...

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.220
A woman's hair.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.210
A woman's footsteps...

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.710
I-Impossible!

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.070
It can't be... It can't be true...

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:26.310
My little sister is buried back at home in France...

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.380
Who the hell are you?

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.350
Just who the hell are you?!

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.920
Don't... come near me...

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.760
I'm in pain...

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.290
My body's not complete yet...

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.830
That voice...

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.200
Sherry!

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.750
Where did Polnareff go?

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.810
He's not here, either.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.350
It's gotten rather dark.
Where could he have gone?

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.190
He couldn't have run into the enemy, could he?

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.940
Sh-Sherry...

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.190
Is that you?

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.640
It is you, isn't it?

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.010
Wh-Where are you going?

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.050
Where are you going, Sherry?!

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.780
It's me! Please wait!

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.350
Why are you running away, Sherry?!

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.270
Where are you? Please, let me see you!

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.190
Please wait, Sherry!

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.230
Let me see your face... Just one more time...

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.230
Brother!

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.600
Brother! Raise me higher! Higher!

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.150
Yay! Now spin!

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:15.170
Oh, how lovely! I've been
wanting a new umbrella.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.420
Thank you, Brother.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.300
I'm off, now.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.910
Sherry! Sherry!

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.990
What... is this dead bird?

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.100
It looks like it was bitten apart.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.210
Sherry!

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.810
Are you there? Why are you running?

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.500
It's me, your older brother!

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.120
Because... I'm covered in dirt...

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.350
And my hair is all scraggly...

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.060
Don't worry about that, Sherry!

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.890
No matter how dirty, you're still you.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.460
Why are you crying?

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.400
Why are you sad, Sherry?

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.530
Sherry...

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.760
No.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.050
No, don't.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.550
Don't come near me!

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.140
B-But why? What are you saying?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.040
Because...

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.270
You'll hate me.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.820
Hate you? Have I ever said that I hated you?

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.150
You have.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.240
When we were kids...

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.910
When I gave your tropical fish to the cat...

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.280
You got really angry and said you hated me.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:21.030
Yeah, I was angry then,
but I've always loved you!

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.180
Even now!

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.350
Really?

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.170
You've always loved me?

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.680
Of course I have!

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.800
You'll love me, no matter what I do?

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.660
I'll always love you, no matter what.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.560
Sherry, you really are Sherry.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.870
You don't know how much I've missed you.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.060
I see.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.330
I feel the same, Brother.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.240
Sherry, please look this way.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.570
Please show me your face.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.380
Why are you crying? Why are you sad?

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.950
Sad?

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.550
No, Brother.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.090
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.730
Huh? Then...

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.190
I'm...

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.960
happy...

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.740
because I can eat you, Brother!

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.320
Ch-Chariot!

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.540
Sher... ry...

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.720
I'm sorry that I bit you, Brother.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.770
My body's not complete yet.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.310
But if I eat your flesh,
Brother, I'll return to normal.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.760
It's okay if I eat you, right?

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.560
You always did what I asked you to.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.480
Cameo!

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.860
What is it?

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.990
Y-You bastard!

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.960
What? Do you have a complaint?

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.580
I granted your wish.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:22.910
My only power is to grant wishes.
The rest is up to you.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.590
Th-Then I'll tell you my third wish!

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.470
Make my sister...

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.060
Make my sister...

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:48.590
Make my sister disappear!
Return her to the earth!

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.160
Nooope!

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.470
What?!

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.290
You still don't get it, Polnareff?

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.310
I'm a Stand!

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.820
I'm the Stand that suggests the Judgment card!

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.210
My power is to grant the wishes people hold

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.310
deep in their hearts, giving them form from dirt.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.980
You made your own sister,
from your own heart!

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.060
Y-You...

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:30.320
Anything you've created, I cannot unmake.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.240
I win this battle!

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.240
Bam

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.490
By the way...

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.160
You said something about a third wish,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.100
but you've already made
your third wish, haven't you?

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.080
You—

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.090
You don't mean...

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.970

When a man wishes from the heart,

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.560
all of his greatest weaknesses come to light.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.550
Because of you, I...

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.700
Avdol, I...

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.490
I never thought you'd be this hurt.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.460
I'll get better if I eat, right?
