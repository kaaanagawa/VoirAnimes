00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.160
There is an emotion called fear.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.740
It's a very natural emotional
reaction found in all animals.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.300
Why does fear occur?

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.310
There is the fear caused by animal instincts,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.100
and the fear born of logical thought.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.610
Namely, when you encounter
something stronger than yourself

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.830
and realize that you have no way of facing it,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.200
or when you encounter something unknown.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.560
Something as simple as
"not knowing" can evoke fear.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.750
When faced with fear,
you have a number of choices.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.300
You might struggle, resist, flee,
accept, or many other things.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.630
But upon meeting Lord DIO,
a new reaction arises...

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.500
Joy!

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.140
How do people act once they feel joy in fear?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.880
He is currently on the plane
that Joestar and the others are on.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.010
They will not reach their destination safely.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.990
A... a rhinoceros beetle?

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.280
No...

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.410
A stag beetle!

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.330
Avdol, is that a Stand?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.210
Are we already encountering
another Stand user?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.730
It is very possible.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.050
It could be a bug-shaped Stand.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.490
It hid in the shadow of the seats...

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.050
Wh-Where did it go?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.340
Jojo! It's on the side of your head!

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.450
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.450
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.920
Episode 4: Tower of Gray

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.400
I-It's huge! It has to be a Stand.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.330
That bug is a Stand!

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.360
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.060
It's disgusting...

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.840
But leave this to me.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.430
B-Be careful.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.840
I've heard there is a user of a bug Stand
that likes to rip out the tongues of its victims.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.880
Star Platinum!

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.430
I-It dodged!

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.660
I-I can't believe it!

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.670
It's faster than Star Platinum,
whose speed and precision

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.720
are such that it can grasp bullets.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.910
It has to be a Stand.
That bug is a Stand!

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.730
Where is he? Where is he hiding?!

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.440
Where is the one who's controlling it?!

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.650
I-It's attacking!

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.130
No!

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.870
Jotaro!

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.870
Jojo!

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.340
Luckily, it could stop the spirit beetle's
mouth needle with its teeth, but...

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.260
Since it tried to bite off Jotaro's Stand's tongue...

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.370
It must be him!

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.220
The Tower card of the Tarot...

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.910
The one that depicts a Stand suggesting

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.230
destruction, calamity,
and the end of a journey:

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.730
Tower of Gray.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.990
Tower of Gray commits mass murders,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.280
making them look like accidents.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.140
The airplane crash that happened last year

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.340
in England, causing 300 deaths,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.620
is thought to have been its work.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.290
I had heard rumors,
but it seems he's working with DIO!

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.840
I-It dodged it.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.500
Not just the single hand,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.450
but it also dodged a two-fisted rush of blows.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.830
I-It's so fast...

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.290
Even if you were to have ten guns
shoot bullets from one centimeter away,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.910
they would not be able to touch my Stand!

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.900
And you couldn't kill my
Stand with a bullet anyway.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.980
He has to be nearby!

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.230
Who is it?

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.660
Where's the one controlling the Stand?

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.550
Which one of the passengers is he?

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.710
If we can track him down...

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.840
It disappeared again.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.180
It moved over there!

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.300
What's it planning to do?

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.110
I-It can't be!

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.850
Burst

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.620
Bingo!

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.050
Got their tongues!

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.370
And my objective...

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.150
Massacre!

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.780
This word's meaning: to kill everyone!

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.590
I-It actually did it...

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.990
I will burn it to death!

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.260
Magician's Red!

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.120
Wait! Wait a moment, Avdol!

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.650
It's so noisy...

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.110
I wonder what all the ruckus is...

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.280
Look out!

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.250
I guess I'll go to the bathroom.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.350
What's this slimy stuff?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.500
M... A...

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.680
I-Is it blood?! Blood!

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.790
Atemi.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.190
We have to defeat it before
the other passengers panic.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.890
But, Avdol,

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.730
an active Stand like your Magician's Red

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.420
could make the plane explode.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.030
And Jojo, if your power were to put a
hole in the fuselage, it'd be a catastrophe.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.460
My quiet Stand,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.370
Hierophant Green,
is most suited to defeating it.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.220
Noriaki Kakyoin, eh?

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.580
I've heard all about you from Lord DIO.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.370
Stop.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.880
If you know that your Stand is quiet,
there's no point in challenging me.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.140
You cannot catch me with your speed.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.680
Fwish

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.680
You think so?

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.560
Emerald Splash!

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.360
Emerald Splash!

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.470
You seem to think you can
hit me if you fire enough shots,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.450
but you haven't hit me at all!

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.870
This isn't good. It's still dodging with its speed!

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.500
K-Kakyoin!

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.610
My speed is on an entirely different level.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.930
You're way too slow to get a bingo.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.890
And Kakyoin...

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.300
With my next attack,
I'll stab your Stand's tongue with

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.110
this Tower Needle, and rip it out!

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.970
Emerald Splash!

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.980
Don't you get it?

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.570
Th-This isn't good!
It dodged Emerald Splash again!

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.160
Once this rips your tongue out, you'll go mad...

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.170
From the pain!

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.960
What? If its tongue is ripped out,
it'll go mad from the pain?

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.760
<i>My</i> Hierophant Green?

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.230
What?!

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.700
If it rips <i>you</i> apart, it'll go mad, all right...

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.930
From joy!

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:28.610
Hierophant's appendages had
already slipped beneath the sheet.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.830
Didn't you realize I was trapping
you there with Emerald Splash?

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.410
So that geezer was the user?

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.810
A repulsive Stand usually has a repulsive user.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.940
It doesn't appear that he has
DIO's flesh bud in his forehead...

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.700
From the start, Tower of Gray was
an evil Stand that killed tourists,

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.070
making it look like an
accident only in return for pay.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.530
I'm sure DIO was able to
use him because he was

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.000
easily bought, and blinded by greed.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.450
Something's wrong.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.470
I could be imagining it, but it seems
like the plane is flying crooked.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.500
It <i>is</i> crooked.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.650
I-It can't be!

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.170
Sir, where are you going?

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.870
The cockpit is up ahead,
so passengers may not enter.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.000
I know that.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.380
S-Sir!

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.580
My! What a handsome man.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.250
Move, bitch.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.460
What a shock!

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.630
Whoa, there.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.380
Pardon.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.200
It is inexcusable of him to treat
women in such a cruel manner...

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.880
But this is an emergency.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.140
Please forgive him.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.440
Okay...

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.490
This is awful!

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.100
Bam!

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.050
We've been had!

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.730
Their tongues have been ripped out.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.180
That stag beetle bastard!

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.410
He had already killed the pilots?

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.780
It's falling.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.910
The autopilot's been destroyed, as well.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.290
This plane's going to crash!

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.000
Splat

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.710
What?

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.610
I am the Stand that holds The Tower card

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.570
which suggests accidents
and the end of a journey.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.730
You will not reach Lord DIO!

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.590
Even if you survive this crash,
you are 10,000 kilometers from Egypt!

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:15.250
Those who swore loyalty to Lord DIO
will pursue you every hour of every day!

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:20.950
There are Stands in this world
that you can't even imagine.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.140
Lord DIO is the master of Stands!

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.430
Lord DIO has the power to
reign over all of them.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.090
There's no way you'll reach him!

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.550
You bastards will never reach Egypt!

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.270
You're definitely professionals.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.510
It's a good thing you didn't scream.
That would've been annoying.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.860
Now, I've got a request.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.380
This old man is now going to
emergency land this plane on the water.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.410
Go put life jackets and seat belts
on all of the other passengers.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.870
G-Got it!

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.460
Old man.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.150
Well... I have experience
with propeller planes, but...

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.170
Propellers?

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.420
But, Jotaro... this is my third time.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.100
Have you ever heard of someone being in a

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.150
crashing plane three times?

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.560
I'm never...

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.270
I'm never riding in a plane with you again.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.990
Tower of Gray

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.990
Gray Fly

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.570
The plane landed 35 kilometers
off the Hong Kong coast.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.670
Jotaro and the others had no
choice but to head to Hong Kong.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.610
Today, a jumbo jet made an emergency landing

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.760
35 kilometers south of Hong Kong,
near Lamma Island.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.090
Efforts are underway
to rescue all passengers.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.180
Hong Kong!

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.640
Hong Kong Island! Kowloon! The New Territories!

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.860
With more than 235 islands in the area,

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.550
— Hong Kong —

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.110
the view of the area at night is
known as the "Million Dollar View."

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.210
Right. That's fine.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.500
Please make sure the only
ones aboard are us and the crew.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.410
Right. We don't want any more victims.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.490
Also...

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.060
Hey, big guy!

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.370
Are you guys tourists?

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.980
Want some rice porridge?

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.790
If you're in Hong Kong,
you gotta try dim sum or rice porridge.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.420
We have hot cola, too.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.040
Rice porridge, eh? Not bad.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.690
Did you know, Jojo?

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.430
Unlike in Japan, rice porridge
is a staple food in Hong Kong.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.000
I'll have it the popular way,
with pork and a century egg.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.150
Coming right up!

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.330
Then I'll have—

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.480
Hey!

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.070
What are you guys trying to eat?

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.030
We're going to go to my friend's shop.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:05.040
Hey, dandy guy. Want to try
some Hong Kong hot cola?

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.440
Hot?!

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.410
Everybody knows that
cola's supposed to be cold.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.980
Old man, who were you calling?

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.000
Hm? Oh, I'll explain everything
when we get to the shop.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:25.430
We need to work out a plan that'll get us
to Egypt as safely and quickly as possible.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.760
A plan?

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:33.390
Mr. Joestar, we cannot allow any
more innocent civilians to be hurt.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.310
The quickest way would be by plane, but...

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.630
Indeed.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.330
It's now become impossible
for us to fly to Egypt.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.520
If we encounter another Stand user
like the last one on a commercial flight,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.460
we're sure to cause a disaster
that will harm many people.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.960
We'll have to get to Egypt by either land or sea.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.960
But if we fail to meet DIO within fifty days...

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.720
If we had stayed on that plane,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.220
we'd probably be in Cairo by now.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.930
I'm aware of that.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.230
But it's too soon to worry about it.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:26.000
A hundred years ago,
Jules Verne wrote a story in which

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.220
the protagonist traveled around the world

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.540
in 80 days, traveling 40,000 kilometers.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.370
That was in the age of trains and steamboats.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.780
Even without a plane, in fifty days,

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.870
we'll be able to travel
the 10,000 kilometers to Egypt.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.630
As for the route...

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.350
I say we go by sea.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.490
We'll charter a suitably-sized boat,

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.900
go around the Malay peninsula,
and cross the Indian Ocean.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.980
It'll be the Silk Road of the sea.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.910
I believe that is best, as well.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.980
If we go by land, borders will be a hassle.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.360
And we'd have to cross
the Himalayas and a desert.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.700
If we ran into trouble,
we'd lose a great deal of time.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.070
There are too many dangers.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.770
I haven't been to any of
those places using either route,

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.040
so I can't say anything.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.080
I'll leave it up to you two.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.330
Same.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.090
Then it's decided.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.680
The greatest danger will be

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.750
the Stand users that DIO sends against us.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.090
We'll have to do our best to get
to Egypt without being spotted.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.450
This is a sign to let them
know we want more tea.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.560
If you do this in Hong Kong,
they'll bring you seconds.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.570
Also, when they pour tea into your cup...

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.870
This means "thank you."

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.340
Excuse me, do you have a moment?

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.530
I'm a tourist from France,

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.480
and I'm having a hard time
with the kanji on the menu.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.220
Would you please help me out?

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.990
You're annoying. Go away.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.690
Come now, Jotaro. It's fine.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.130
I've been to Hong Kong many times,

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.930
so I can at least read the kanji on the menu.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.280
Why don't you join us?

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.290
So, what did you want to order?

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:33.030
Food with shrimp, duck,
sharkfin, and mushrooms?

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.840
We'll have this, this, this...

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.710
And this, too.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.210
Oh, and this.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:49.160
Gong

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.170
This looks like food with beef,
fish, clams, and frog, but...

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.160
Roasted Frog        Rice Porridge

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.160
Clam Dish                                                    Stewed Fish

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.280
Indeed. This is rather different.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.430
I knew this would happen.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.200
Well, it doesn't matter.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.440
It's on me!

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.790
It doesn't matter what you order.
It's all delicious!

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.230
All right, everyone, dig in.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.410
Wow, this is...

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.120
Well? It's pretty good, isn't it?

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.130
Well, they've certainly taken
a lot of time to prepare this.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.880
Look, these carrots...

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.470
They're shaped like stars.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.190
It reminds me of something...

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.190
That's right.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:47.550
Someone I know has this
exact mark on their neck...

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:58.230
Menacing

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.230
You...

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.420
Are you another...

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.790
Mr. Joestar, look out!

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.880
It's a Stand!

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.280
Magician's Red!

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:17.760
What?!

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.180
Another Stand user!

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.690
H-His sword is so fast...

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.670
My Stand holds The Chariot card!

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.200
Silver Chariot!

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.330
Mohammed Avdol,
it appears that you want to die first.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.330
I've made a fire clock on that table!

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:50.460
I will kill you by the time
that clock burns to twelve!

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.840
Would you like to be friends with me?

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.970
Something is bothering you.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.630
Stick with me,
and it'll disappear from your heart.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.940
That left arm is not a right arm.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.630
To think you're trying to use

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.030
fortune-telling to fight a fortune teller...

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 5
