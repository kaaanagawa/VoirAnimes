Oh, a new page

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.090
has appeared.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:15.650
La la

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:15.650
La

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.450
The buddy brothers, Zenyatta and Mondatta,
took the bus that came four hours later.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.550
So they weren't in the accident. La la!

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.370
Trot

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.370
Trot Trot

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.840
What new adventure awaits the buddy brothers?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.990
As they entered the city of Aswan...
"Oh! There they are!"

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.880
"The five nasty bad guys are there!"

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.420
"They're talking to each other."

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.720
They seemed so worried...

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.750
It's them.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.060
They drank black tea that was poisoned. Gulp!

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.470
B-Brother...

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.220
So all we have to do is poison them.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.420
My brother, we are invincible together.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.420
With your Stand, a manga that tells the future,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.340
and my Stand,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.180
which transforms my face...

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.290
They're as good as dead!

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.200
Our cards are the God of Knowledge,
Thoth, and the God of Creation, Khnum!

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.930
We're the Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.550
Episode 27
Khnum's Zenyatta and Thoth's Mondatta

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.580
It's definitely at this café,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.800
at this table, where they will
drink the poisoned black tea.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.220
Th-The predictions made

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.970
by my Stand, the God of Knowledge,
Thoth, always come true.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.070
How are those two doing?

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.230
Avdol's neck wound didn't damage
anything vital, fortunately,

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.740
so he'll probably be released tomorrow.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.850
But Kakyoin's injuries are serious.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.650
He might go blind.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm worried.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.840
Sadly, Kakyoin might be out
of action for the rest of this trip.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.800
Hey, there are a lot of cafés around here.
Let's get a drink and relax.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.840
Great idea. Which one?

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.110
My cigarette picked that one.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.160
Welcome.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.910
What would you like?

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.320
Let's see... I'd like some black tea.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.410
Same.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.660
All right. Three black teas, then?

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.500
No, we'd better not.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.270
Huh?

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.220
Listen. We're in Egypt, which is enemy territory.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.980
More enemies are lurking around
us than ever before,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.300
and we don't know when they'll attack.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.600
We have to be more careful than
we've been when it comes to poison.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.270
From now on, only drink from bottles or cans.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.360
What? Are you serious?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.660
I am serious.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.990
Hey, forget the black tea.
We're going to have cola instead.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.520
Cola?!

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.280
Yeah. Something wrong with that?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.350
N-No. Okay. Cola, right?

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.190
So three colas, then.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.690
Oh, and we'll take the caps
off at the table ourselves.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.210
Also, I want the third, fourth,
and fifth colas from the right.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.710
C-Cola with the caps on?!

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.390
I won't be able to poison them...

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.000
Was the prediction wrong?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.220
No, my brother's manga is always right.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.050
B-Believe! I must believe in my brother!

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.070
If I, the big brother, don't make
an effort to achieve our destiny,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.140
we won't be able to defeat them!

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.060
Brother, the predictions are absolute!

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.650
Hey, Manager! This cola isn't cold at all.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.000
Your shop serves warm cola?
I'm not gonna pay, you jackass!

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.540
Hey, are the colas not cold?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.450
Th-The refrigerator is broken.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.180
You're being too paranoid.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.210
Even if that guy were our enemy,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.400
and if he were really trying to poison us...

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.660
How would he know that we'd come in here?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.220
This city has all these cafés,
and I happened to choose this one.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.420
If there were only one café,
maybe, but there are plenty.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.270
I'm just saying that being careful can't hurt.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.900
If you're that concerned, then let's change cafés.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.870
We'll go to the one across the street.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.630
All right.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.730
Fire!

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.160
Huh?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.730
My café is on fire!

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.140
A spark from a cigarette some jackass
left in the road got into the trash!

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.040
Hey, Manager. We'll take three black teas after all.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.620
W-We won...

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.820
Man, to throw a lit cigarette in the trash...

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.060
This world sure has some real jerks in it.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.390
They're drinking it... They're drinking it!

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.720
D-D-D-Drink it all down...

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.860
Th-They drank it!

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.590
Eek! This dog ate my cake!

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.030
Who the hell brought a dog in here?!

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.950
Iggy!

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.220
Whose dog is this?

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.200
Hey! Get this dog outta here!

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.960
Damn it, Iggy!

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.160
Stop, you shitty dog!

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.300
Damn it! They even had it in their mouths!

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.230
Shit! What's supposed to happen after this?

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.310
I-It doesn't say yet...

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.160
B-But the prediction wasn't wrong.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.480
Just, Thoth can only see the very near future.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.720
This time...

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.990
This time, we'll use the next
prediction to kill them for sure!

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.860
That's right. We're...

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.980
The Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.640
"Damn that dog! Curses! We failed!"

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.790
"We were so close!"

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.140
Big brother Zenyatta and little brother
Mondatta were very frustrated.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.330
But after pulling themselves together,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.840
Zenyatta and Mondatta chased
after the three guys and their dog.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.830
Hup Hup

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.660
While chasing them,
although this isn't really important,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.390
the brothers passed a man
with a very annoying face.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.520
The brothers hated guys who looked like that.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.190
I bet he did something in a past life...

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.190
I'm so pissed off all of a sudden. I'll punch him!

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.700
Bam

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.700
Ugh!

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.690
Even though he had done nothing wrong,
Zenyatta senselessly punched him!

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.740
Eek!

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.740
The man with the annoying face panicked!

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.680
He accidentally dropped his wallet,
which was full of money.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.600
"Yay! We're rich!"

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.150
The brothers sure are lucky! Peace!

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.910
Idiot.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.120
W-We scored big, Brother.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.840
Ah! B-Brother, it's showing up.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.780
They continued to chase Joestar and the others.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.840
Joestar and the others got in a car

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.890
and headed to the hospital
to see Avdol and Kakyoin.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.770
Smile
Smile

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.780
Zenyatta planted a bomb shaped
like an orange in their car.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.060
Jotaro went flying!

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:49.700
Kabam

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.700
His head was split into two bloody halves,
and he was out of the game for good!

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.550
Th-Th-Th-That prediction is so detailed...

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.080
Yes!

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.910
Khnum

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.920
Zenyatta

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.840
Clank

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.440
Menacing

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.530
Kabam

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:30.110
M-M-My Stand, Thoth, can
only see the immediate future.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:37.130
But once it prints a prediction,
there is no way to change it! At all!

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.920
Jotaro will definitely explode!

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.230
The bomb will detonate three seconds
after he sticks his finger in to peel it.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.710
Without fail!

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.870
His fate

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.850
has been decided!

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.460
Who's there?

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:55.860
Wha—

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.810
Who's in our car?

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.690
It's not Jotaro?

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.940
No. Jotaro said he was going
straight to the hospital.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.110
Be careful!

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.110
C-Crap...

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.270
Don't let him get away!

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.280
C-Crap! It's Joestar and Polnareff!

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.510
Yeah, I know!

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.570
Hey, don't hide in there!

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.290
Who are you? Come out.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.880
We told you to come out, damn it!

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.250
Hurry it up!

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.950
Hey, hey, why the panic?

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.510
It's me, Polnareff.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.960
Oh, it's you, Jotaro.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.610
My Stand, Khnum, is a transforming Stand.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.230
I can change my height, weight,
and even smell to whatever I want.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.090
I made the hat by transforming my hair!

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.070
But what happened?

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.270
You said you were going
straight to the hospital.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.050
Huh? Um, uh... Yeah.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.870
I left something in the car, so I came back for it.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.340
My wallet. It was my wallet, yeah.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.830
Good grief.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.300
Jotaro, what happened to your school jacket?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.040
S-School jacket?

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.550
Wh-What? What? School jacket?

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.340
That's really not a good look on you.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.870
Oh... Right, clothes. School jacket, huh...

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.270
I-It's at the cleaners!

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.850
I took it to the cleaners,
and didn't have any money.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.480
Th-That was a good answer. Yeah!

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.860
Huh. I see...

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.640
Then hurry up and get in the car. We're going.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.160
Huh?!

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.590
Huh? The car?

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.350
I-It can't be...

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.000
It can't be... It can't be!

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.840
The Jotaro that gets his head blown in half

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:44.290
isn't the r-real Jotaro, but... No! M-M-M-Me?!

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.830
Impossible!

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.580
Nah, a-actually, I think I'm going to walk...

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.650
What the hell are you talking about, Jotaro?

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.010
From here, it'll be a lot faster to take the car.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.610
Z-Zenyatta!

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.560
C-Crap...

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.500
I have to get out of this Jotaro
disguise as soon as possible.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.940
O-Or I'll be the one who gets blown up!

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.830
I-I know! I just have to throw the orange away!

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.680
I'll just throw the bomb away

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.840
and put it back in the car later,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.960
so it can blow up the real Jotaro!

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.060
Yes!

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.690
There! Now I'm safe!

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.480
Hey, it's Iggy! I can't believe he
jumped in while we're moving.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.460
He's got an orange in his mouth!
Did you steal that, Iggy?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.300
That might be a nice gift for Kakyoin and Avdol.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.440
Wha?!

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.440
Yow!

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.820
"Yow"?

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.360
You don't usually make noises
like that. You're acting weird.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.420
N-No... Yow. You know, y-yow.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.560
I-I was saying there was a cyow over there...

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.530
Jotaro... You're really weird today.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.610
You're not together, man.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.340
You're not actually...

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.710
a fake, are you?

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.450
G-Good grief. What the hell are
you talking about, Polnareff?

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.480
Are we at the hospital yet?

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.580
Say, Jotaro. Do that special trick of yours.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.080
Ba-dum!

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.450
Special... trick?

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.110
What is he talking about?!

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.100
I learned it from you.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.260
You know, this!

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.550
Hey, you've gotten better.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.180
O-Oh, that's what you meant.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.690
I'm saved! If that's the trick,
while it seems dangerous, I can do it!

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.020
Sure! I'll do it. It's easy.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.360
All right! Do the one where you
have five in your mouth at once!

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.490
F-Five?!

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.160
Come on! Hurry up and do it.
I wanna see it again.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:27.170
C-Crap. What the hell kind of
weird talent does Jotaro have?!

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.980
I-If I can't do it...

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.960
They already think I'm acting strange.
They'll be even more suspicious of me!

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.430
Polnareff already looks like he might start
to peel the orange bomb at any time!

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.540
A-All right, damn it!

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.120
I'll do it!

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.690
F-Five, right? Five.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.440
Ta-da!

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.360
Come on, hurry up!

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.460
I'll do this! I'm gonna do this!
I just gotta do this, right?!

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.120
All right! My secret talent!

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.340
O-Ow, hot! Hot!

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.590
H-Hot... Hot...

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.460
I did it! I did it, damn it!

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.260
There! Did you see that?! I did it!

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.190
People can do anything when
their lives are at stake!

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.260
Here.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.170
Last time, you drank some juice
without putting the cigarettes out.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.570
Come on.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.080
Aw, you failed.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.750
Jotaro, are you all right? Oh my God!

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:54.980
Brother! Brother! Mondatta!
Please make this prediction go away!

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.010
Get rid of that page!

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.160
Zenyatta! The prediction is absolute!

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.240
Hurry up and take off your transformation!

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.020
If you undo the transformation,
then the real Jotaro will get blown up!

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.270
You can do it!

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.510
Jotaro, you're acting really weird today.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:20.030
I-I just... f-feel a bit under the weather...

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.160
C-Crap!

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.480
K-Knowing them, once they get suspicious,
they're going to keep poking at me!

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.100
If I undo the transformation,
they'll beat me half to death,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.470
but if I don't, then I'll get killed by the bomb!

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.460
Kabam

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:48.700
Good Idea

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.750
Th-That's it! I'll just use feeling bad as an excuse.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.720
I'll say that I have a stomach ache,
and have them let me out of the car.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.390
Jotaro, the way you have your hands together...

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.210
You've got your left thumb on top!

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:08.310
C-Crap! Does the real Jotaro
always put his right thumb on top?!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.620
Crap! What am I going to do?!

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.370
H-H-H-How am I going to fool them now?

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.670
The way you put your hands together proves
that you were a woman in a past life!

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.350
My fortune said

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.460
that since I put my right thumb on top,
I was a man in a past life!

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.220
Wow, really? I always put my
left thumb on top, myself.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.540
Then you were definitely a woman
in a past life, Mr. Joestar.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.850
What do you mean, definitely?

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.200
How would you even prove that?

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.230
It's so stupid!

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.590
M-My stomach really is starting to hurt...

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.780
Being with these two is going to kill me.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.910
A-All right. I'm going to tell them
that my stomach hurts...

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:58.210
Jotaro, let's see who can eat
a whole orange faster!

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.460
What?!

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.840
H-Hey...

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.220
Stop, damn it!

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.770
Whoa! What are you doing, Jotaro?!

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.610
Oh...

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.920
Wh-What's wrong, Jotaro?

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.440
Oh, it's nothing.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.280
You really are acting weird.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.160
I don't think y-y-you should eat that orange.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.520
Huh? Why?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.260
W-Well, you know...
It's the one Iggy picked up.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.240
It could have been in the gutter.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.280
Eat this one instead.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.160
It's not dirty or bruised. It's fine.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.990
Whatever. I'll eat this one,
and you try with one of those.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.970
Ow!

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.010
H-Hey.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.720
My stomach hurts!

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.270
My stomach hurts so bad, I can't stand it!

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.540
S-Stop the car! Hurry!

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.260
Your stomach hurts?

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.020
I can't stand it anymore!
Let me out! Let me out!

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.550
I'll go behind some rock!

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.940
But the hospital's right there...

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.410
Just go ahead without me.
Seriously, just go on ahead!

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.610
Hold it, Jotaro!

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.760
Here's some paper.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.550
I...

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.430
I did it!

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:39.240
I actually got away, God damn it!
I finally got away! Serves you right!

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.150
I'm gonna go undo my
transformation behind that rock!

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.740
An orange that Iggy picked up, huh...

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.410
It really could have been in a gutter.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.500
What should I do?

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.240
Throw it away?

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:04.090
Yes! Now I can use my Stand Khnum's
powers to undo the transformation.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.050
And then I win!

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.480
The Zenyatta Mondatta brothers win!

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.220
We win!

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:12.160
Squish!

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.690
Ah?

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.310
Oh, shit!

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.570
What was that sound?

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.460
Don't worry about it.
Probably construction or something.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.580
Z-Zenyatta...

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.700
S-Speak to me!

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.430
We've lost, Mondatta.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.180
No...

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:58.060
N-No! My Thoth hasn't lost yet.
I-I will k-kill them myself!

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.500
Mondatta...

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.500
Don't, Mondatta.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.690
They're not normal. It's impossible.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.240
I made up my mind! I'll do it on my own!

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.860
I can do it on my own!

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:19.180
You were always so shy...
You've grown, Mondatta.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.050
I'm going to kill them!

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.270
What's Thoth's next prediction?

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.750
Found you...

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.340
Th-They're the ones!
They punched me and stole my wallet!

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.470
Everyone! If you beat the shit out of them,

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.500
I'll make sure you're richly rewarded!

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.170
It's that guy!

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.690
Brother! I'm really scared!

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.270
Despite finally deciding that
he would do it on his own,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.280
Mondatta didn't have time to get revenge.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.240
But don't give up, Mondatta!

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.830
That's just how life is.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.600
Huh?

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.710
Well, if it isn't Jotaro.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.100
Hey. Took you long enough.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.400
Long enough?

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.220
You're way too quick at taking a shit outside!

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.110
You got here faster than a car...

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.890
And you got your jacket
back from the cleaners, too?

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.590
What the hell are you two...

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.820
Hey, an ambulance.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.280
Looks like someone's hurt.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.000
That's too bad...

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.640
Oranges, huh? I was just getting thirsty.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.300
I'm going to have one.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.680
Oh?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.530
That man's clothes...

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.790
Do you know him?

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.760
Of course we don't.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.480
Now, let's go find out how
Avdol and Kakyoin are doing.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:54.940 position:20% line:50%
Ba-dum-tss

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.360
The brothers were taken
out of the battle together.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.470
The fight had ended without
Jotaro and the others

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.360
even knowing they had been attacked.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.610
Ba-dum-tss.

Hey, look, it's a sword.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.770
He's holding a sword.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.690
It won't come out... It won't even budge.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.690
I want to cut you down now, too.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.110
Use me, and kill them.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.950
Come at me with your Anubis Stand.
