Tokyo

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.850
Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore...

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.980
Hong Kong

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.150
Singapore

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.540
And now

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.020
Calcutta

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.630
we're about to cross India...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.750
But, well, I'm a little worried.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.170
My image of India is a place where people

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.530
only eat curry and you
could fall ill at any time.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.630
I'm worried that my body may not
be able to handle the culture gap.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.640
That assessment is rather distorted.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.950
You needn't worry. It's a nice
country, where simple people live.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.150
I can guarantee it.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.280
Well, we're in Calcutta. Let's go.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.700
Honk

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.330
Hey, give me a tip!

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.160
Let me carry that for you!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.080
Want a tattoo? You're so pretty.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.510
Need some anti-venom?
It won't hurt your stomach.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.500
I'll show you a hotel!

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.080
Calcutta, India.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.010
In the 20th century,
its population is 11 million.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.760
An immense energy swirls about the city!

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.500
I stepped in some cow shit! Damn it!

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.500
I don't need any.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.770
My wallet's already been stolen!

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.770
Seriously, no thank you.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.650
Tip! Tip! Tip!

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.150
If you don't give me a tip,
you won't go to heaven, Mister.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.030
Hey! Don't put your nose on it!

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.740
A-Avdol! Is this India?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.530
See? Isn't it a great country?

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.230
This is what makes this country so wonderful!

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.470
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.470
Stardust Crusaders

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.450
Episode 10: The Emperor and the Hanged Man Part 1

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.300
Here, have this.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.500
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.240
This is chai.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.090
It's delicious.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.040
Chai.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.010
A popular drink in India.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.140
A sweet drink made by boiling
black tea, sugar, and ginger with milk.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.900
At last, a little peace.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.660
It's just a matter of getting used to it.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.370
Once you get used to it,
you'll see how wonderful this country is.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.140
I like this place. It's pretty great.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.280
Seriously, Jotaro? You really mean that?

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.490
Talk about culture shock.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.160
I'll like it once I get used to it, huh?

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.090
Well, they say that people
adapt to their surroundings.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.430
Where's the john?

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.230
It's over there.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.990
Polnareff.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.870
Yeah?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.680
What about your order?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.640
I'll leave it to you.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.850
It had better be something amazing.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.070
Gorgeous, splendid food
that suits a Frenchman like me.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.290
Which means we can pick anything.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.030
Let's see, something he'll like...

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.690
Excuse me.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.120
Oh, please wait, sir.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.080
Please use this.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.070
What's this stick for?

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.830
Hey.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.530
The toilet's shaped oddly, but it's pretty clean.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.430
A nice guy like myself can't
stand it when bathrooms are dirty.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.530
Is something wrong?

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.510
D-D-D-D-Don't "Is something wrong?" at me!

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.320
Th-Th-Th-Th-The toilet...

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.210
The toilet...

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.700
Oink

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.270
There's a pig sticking
its head out of the toilet!

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.040
This toilet is unusual, even in India.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.870
They accidentally made the
pig pen down below a little too high.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.080
So when the pig gets hungry,
it sticks its head out.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.350
Th-That's not what I'm aski—

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.030
Er, wait, what?!
That means this pig's food is...

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.810
That's why it's there?!

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.870
That's why you use this.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.080
Here...

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.270
See? Now you can go while the pig's
recoiling from the blow to the head.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.160
Our manager actually gets the
pig to lick his butt and always says

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.420
how great it is, because he gets so clean.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.800
Please, take your time.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.420
W-Wait! Don't leave me alone!

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.770
Gulp.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.760
Menacing

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.000
I don't think I could ever get used to this...

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.160
I'll wait until we get to the hotel.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.200
Crap.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.760
H-He's gone?

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.390
I could have sworn I
saw something weird there.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.670
I must have imagined it.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.600
I guess I can't help it.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.100
I mean, there was a pig in the toilet.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.790
It's not surprising I'd see an illusion
of a monster outside the window.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.170
So this is what they mean
by culture shock in India.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.000
Wha...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.880
What?!

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.820
Huh? Huh?

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.340
Wh-What is this?!

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.550
I can only see it in the mirror!

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.850
So this is the mirror Stand
that Jotaro heard about.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.100
Th-This isn't good.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.100
This really isn't good!

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.110
Silver Chariot!

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.700
Wh-What the hell is that?!

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.670
Damn it!

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.120
Stand!

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.130
Where's the user? Who is it?!

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.880
The man with two right hands...

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.510
There are so many people...

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.650
Damn it!

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.010
What's wrong, Polnareff?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.180
What's happening?

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.020
If that...

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.410
If that was the Stand, that means...

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.480
That means he's finally here!

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.030
Jotaro, the Stand user you heard
about that uses mirrors is here!

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.700
The bastard that killed my little sister!

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:40.290
The bastard that stepped all
over my sister's life, soul, and pride.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.120
I can finally... I can finally see him!

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.830
The one you seek vengeance upon is here?

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:53.210
Mr. Joestar, I'll be traveling on my own here.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.980
Wh—

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.790
Now that I know the guy
who killed my sister is nearby,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.060
I'm not going to wait
for him to come after me.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.590
I'd be at a disadvantage
if I let him attack me,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.210
and it's not my style.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.600
I'll find him first, and kill him!

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.540
Even though you don't know what
he looks like, or what his Stand is?

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.500
Knowing that he has two right hands is plenty!

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.190
And he knows that I'm after him, as well.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.790
He should be worried that I'll
come for his head in his sleep.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.250
See ya.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.850
You'll go out for wool,
only to come home shorn.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.680
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.160
Just as it sounds.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.350
Are you implying that I'm going to lose?

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.100
Indeed.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.450
Can't you see that the enemy
purposely attacked to get you alone?

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.010
I will not allow you to travel alone, Polnareff.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.280
Listen up. I'm going to make this clear.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.500
I never cared about DIO.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.430
I told you in Hong Kong that
I was only traveling with you

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.830
so I could get my revenge.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.640
Mr. Joestar and Jotaro
should already know this.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.930
I've been alone from the start!

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.760
I've always been fighting alone!

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.960
Such a selfish man!

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.820
Did you forget that you
were brainwashed by DIO?

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.950
Have you forgotten that
this all leads back to DIO?

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.980
Like you'd ever understand how
I feel after having my sister killed!

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.480
I heard that the last time you met DIO,
you got scared and ran away.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.460
A coward like you would
never understand how I feel!

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.490
What did you say?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.100
Don't touch me.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.040
You were just lucky that
you beat me in Hong Kong.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.700
Don't lecture me.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.990
Why, you...

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.410
Oh, did that piss you off?

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:41.750
But don't forget that I'm a lot more
pissed off than you are right now!

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.370
You can just keep acting like
the mature one as always, Avdol.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.130
Why, you—

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.050
Mr. Joestar!

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.930
That's enough. Let him go.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.780
Now that he's like this, no one can stop him.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.310
No, I'm just disappointed in him.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.160
I didn't think he was that sort of man.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.090
I did indeed run in fear.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.450
That's also why I believe we will win,

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.980
and can say with certainty that you'll lose.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.120
What?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.280
Then I'll say this with certainty, too.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.300
Your divination will be wrong.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.690
Tromp Tromp Tromp

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.970
Get off.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.710
I'm here to see a friend.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.710
Go back yourself from here.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.500
Please, make me your wife.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.450
I will dedicate my life to you.
Just tell me whatever you wish of me.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.260
So please, let me stay by your side forever.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.270
Don't be stupid. You're still only sixteen.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.020
I'm old enough to marry.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.880
I love you.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.220
Listen. I'm just a drifter.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:42.190
I live each day like it's my last,
and one day, it will be my last.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.270
Royalty like yourself can't
think about marrying me.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.700
No matter how much we love each other.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.590
Really?

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.590
You love me?

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.100
Yeah. You're the only one
I love in the whole world.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.720
That's exactly why.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.970
It's because I love you that I can't marry you.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.370
You understand, don't you?

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.580
It's hard for me, too.
My chest feels like it could burst.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.520
But I'll come see you once in
a while and hold you like this.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.280
That's enough to make me happy.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.210
Yes...

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.050
Later. Love ya.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.390
It's not nice to eavesdrop.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.060
I'm sure you'd like to say
I'm being as indirect as ever,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.570
and that there're girls like her everywhere...

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.440
But she's an easy mark, and it's convenient.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.380
She'd do anything for me,
even throw away her own life.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.580
You know how I work, don't you?

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.580
Menacing

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.980
Mr. Centerfold.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.620
By the way, about Silver Chariot's Polnareff.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.390
Seems he's looking for you on his own.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.200
What will you do?

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.730
He fell hook, line, and sinker
for your plan to lure him out.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.490
Shall we kill him first?

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.540
Blam

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.160
Let's go.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:13.520
With you and your Hanged Man,
and me, Hol Horse, with my Emperor,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.930
We can kill 'em all.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.980
Hanged Man

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.980
Centerfold

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.630
So he didn't come back after all.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.300
What?

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.810
You saw him?

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.240
You're sure you saw a
man with two right hands?

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.640
Where?

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.820
Huh? That's weird.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.580
I lost him. He was just right there, too.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:53.980
What?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.290
He was with that man right there.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.170
Fwoosh

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.670
The gun is mightier than the sword.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.480
Man, talk about a memorable quote.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.770
Who the hell are you?

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.190
Hol Horse is the name.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.980
I'm the user of the Stand
that suggests the Emperor card.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.750
Lord DIO paid me to get rid of you guys.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.160
Hey, country boy.
I don't need the self-introduction.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.430
Do you know the man with two right hands?

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.010
Well, that was rude.
You asked, so I answered.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.170
Well, whatever.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.170
I came here with him.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.440
He's nearby.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.260
What?

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.650
Where is he?!

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.220
No point in asking that.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.520
I, Hol Horse, will be taking care of you.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.290
Trash like you always says that,

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.730
and it always ends up the other way around.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.590
Oh? Was that funny?

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.640
Lord DIO said that Polnareff was
a man who underestimated others,

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.240
and that I'd have no problem beating him.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.390
He was exactly right,
so I couldn't help but laugh.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.760
If I can't see him until I defeat you,
then that's just what I'll do.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.880
Bring it on.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.820
You know Stratego, right?

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.710
The tank is stronger than the soldier,
and tanks are weak against mines.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.330
See, it's pretty much the basics of battle.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.630
My Emperor is stronger than you,

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.650
so I thought I'd let you know about
my Stand's abilities before we fight.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.460
The gun is mightier than the sword.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.150
Seriously, such a memorable quote.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.410
What are you trying to say?

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.320
My Stand shoots.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.330
A sword can't beat a weapon that shoots.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.600
So, what? A pea shooter?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.410
I'll kill you!

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.160
You underestimated me, Polnareff!

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.260
Blam

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.100
And now, you've lost!

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.000
Fwoom

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.100
If it takes off its armor...

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.930
It's nothing but a bullet!

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.150
What?!

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.850
I-Impossible! The trajectory curved!

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.160
C-Crap!

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.070
The bullet is also my Stand.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.050
Underestimating me by
not even considering that

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.160
will cost you your life!

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.480
Polnareff!

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.130
Wha— Avdol!

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.350
I went looking for you because
I was worried, and look what I find!

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.440
You're too full of yourself, Polnareff.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.060
W-Worried?

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.890
Damn you! Are you going to lecture me again?

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.560
The enemy knows everything about you!

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.440
You said you've lived life alone,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.670
but from now on,
you won't be able to win alone!

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.450
What bad timing for an outsider to interfere.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.740
Curve

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.570
Move, Polnareff! The bullet's coming back!

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.130
Magician's Red!

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.370
I'll burn it to cinders!

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.260
Damn that Avdol!
He went after Polnareff himself.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.010
Where are you, Mr. Avdol? Polnareff?

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.350
I have a terrible feeling...

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.890
Hey, there's a weird fight going on over there.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.330
The puddle...

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.830
What?!

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.010
Mr. Avdol!

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.920
Man, today must be my day.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:30.000
My gun and Centerfold's mirror
don't do very well with Avdol's flames,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.620
so we thought he'd be
our most formidable enemy.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.990
Talk about luck!

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.310
There are no scary pieces
left in this game of Stratego.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.760
Mr. Avdol!

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.880
H-He's just hurt...

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.550
It's just a minor wound.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.380
See? He's going to start speaking...

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.410
He'll open his eyes at any moment.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.060
Right, Mr. Avdol?

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.840
You're going to wake up, right?

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.140
Mr. Avdol, wake up!

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.590
Please! Mr. Avdol!

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.000
Impossible. This was too easy.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.910
It was too quick!

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.460
That's what he gets for lecturing people.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.850
Look at him now.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:28.420
Wha...

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.620
What did you say, Polnareff?

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.170
Mr. Avdol was worried about you—

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.170
Who asked him for help?!

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.060
He likes to meddle in other people's business,

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.300
but he's slow as hell, so they got him.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.310
Guys like him just get in the way...

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.940
That's why I said I'd do this myself.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.790
You bastard...

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.330
He saved your life. How dare you...

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.160
It really annoys me!

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.710
Having people up and die on me...

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.370
Polnareff...

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.220
It just annoys me so much!

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.010
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.070
He's got a bold face,
and yet he died so easily.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.770
Come to think of it, she
was really good at sobbing...

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.420
Your sister, that is.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.980
Are you telling me to hold back?

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.260
Don't fall for the enemy's provocation!

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.990
Mr. Avdol told you not to fight by yourself!

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.990
Episode 11

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.990
The Emperor and the Hanged Man Part 2
