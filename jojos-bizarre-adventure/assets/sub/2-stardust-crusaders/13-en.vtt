00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.720
India

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.230
Calcutta

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.230
Varanasi

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.230
Pakistan

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.660
Jojo's group acquired a car while
in the sacred city of Varanasi,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.230
Delhi

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.240
and are now heading toward Pakistan.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.890
Soon we'll reach the Indo-Pakistani border...

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.550
We'll be saying goodbye to India very soon.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.980
Indeed. At first I wondered what
kind of country we'd walked into,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.550
but now I miss the hustle
and bustle of Calcutta,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.960
and the rushing waters of the Ganges.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.750
I'll be coming back again,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.520
so I can make Avdol a proper grave.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.900
Mr. Avdol...

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.020
The road's getting narrower.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.640
Stop driving so slow! You're in the way!

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.910
I'm gonna pass them.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.980
Polnareff, you're being reckless!

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.840
This four-wheel drive is great!

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.060
Hey, do you think that might've
flung pebbles at their car?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.430
Who knows? It could have.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
We don't need any trouble
or accidents right now.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.390
I'm wanted because of what
happened in Varanasi, you know.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.190
I'd like to get across the border safely.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.650
What's the matter, Polnareff?

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.330
I just told you we don't need accidents!

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.910
N-No, look! Look who's standing over there!

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.760
Good grief...

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.280
Hey! Looks like we meet again.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.630
Give me a lift?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.490
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.490
Stardust Crusaders

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.270
Episode 13: Wheel of Fortune

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.570
I mean, I'm a girl.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.810
Soon I'll be wearing a bra,
and doing my nails for the boys.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.530
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.260
I'd look pathetic wandering around
the world when I'm that age.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.410
This is the only chance I have! Right now!

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.740
To run away from home and see the world...

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.170
Don't you think so?

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.430
I mean, I feel bad for lying about
going to see my dad in Singapore,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.680
but let's just forget that.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.580
It's the car we passed earlier.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.410
They appear to be in a hurry.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.180
Let them pass.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.640
Yeah...

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.450
Hey, now!

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.830
What are they trying to do?

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.780
I let you pass, so hurry up and go.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.550
Maybe they're mad because
you were so reckless earlier.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.610
Did you see the driver's face?

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.340
No... Maybe it's because of
all the dust on the window,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.740
but I couldn't see them.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.060
So you couldn't, either...

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.640
It couldn't be...

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.060
Be careful, Polnareff.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.660
Now he's telling me to pass!

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.440
Looks like he remembered
how shitty his car is.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.640
You should have just stayed behind
me in the first place, dumbass.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.140
What?!

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.140
A truck? That's impossible!

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.420
It's no use! We're going to crash!

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.340
Star Platinum!

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.330
Th-That was close!

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.140
If it weren't for Star Platinum's power,
we would have been crushed.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.150
Where is it?! Where's that car?

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.300
Looks like it took off.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.320
Do you think that car's driver might be
one of the Stand users that are after us?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.160
Or do you think it's
just some random asshole?

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.950
Of course it's someone who's after us!

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.980
We were almost killed!

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.040
But there hasn't been anything
like a Stand attack yet.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.340
Anyway, all we can do is be careful
as we head for the border.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.160
If someone comes after us again,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.120
we'll just take them down,
no matter who they are.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.220
Yeah.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.730
What should we do about that truck?

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.680
Star Platinum punched it,
so it's pretty messed up.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.560
Just pretend you never saw it. Ignore it.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.130
So cool... I'm gonna go crazy...

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.210
A roadside tea house...

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.760
Let's take a break.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.760
If we take our time, we may
avoid running into that car.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.240
What's that?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.170
Sugarcane juice.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.570
Wanna try some?

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.070
All right, then...

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.790
What?!

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.690
I-It's him!

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.230
That car's here!

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.410
Hey, I need to ask you something.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.390
Where's the driver of that car parked over there?

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.650
I-I'm not sure. I didn't
notice when it parked there...

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.400
I doubt that the driver will just
come out and announce himself.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.740
He's messing with us!

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.190
This leaves us with only
one option. Right, Jotaro?

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.910
Yeah...

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.360
It'll involve some innocent bystanders, but...

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.870
We'll just beat them all down!

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.800
H-Hey, Jotaro, stop!

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.920
Mr. Joestar, you too?! This is going too far!

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.000
A face like yours looks the most suspicious...

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.390
C-Come on!

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.560
D-Did we just get played?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.110
Did anyone see his face?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.110
N-No. What is he trying to do?

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.600
He seems like a random crazy driver,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.120
but also like someone who's after us.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.740
It's going to piss me off

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.870
if we don't chase him
down and take care of this.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.250
Not to mention

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.730
we owe him payback for the truck
that almost hit us earlier!

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.230
Damn it! For a piece of shit car,
it goes pretty fast.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.500
That's strange. According to the map,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.170
we should be running
parallel with train tracks here.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.920
Who the hell cares?

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.520
We're gonna catch him in a second.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.170
That bastard!

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.070
I'm gonna nail him on that curve!

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.180
Impossible! It's a dead end!

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.440
He's gone! Where did he go?!

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.190
He disappeared after the curve?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.300
And a car couldn't cross
that suspension bridge...

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.440
What?!

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.590
I-It's him!

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.890
He's coming from behind!

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.940
How did he get behind us?

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.630
H-He's pushing us with immense horsepower...

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.340
What the hell is this? A tank?!

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.510
It's no use! Everyone,
abandon the car and get out!

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.350
Polnareff!

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.790
What kind of driver gets out of
the car before everyone else?!

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.310
Who's going to hold down the brake pedal?

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.850
Huh?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.110
S-S-Sorry!

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.610
Hierophant Green!

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.200
Fwoom

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200
Stop!

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.860
Hierophant isn't strong enough
to hold this much weight!

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.450
It'll just tear its body apart!

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.370
I beg your pardon, Mr. Joestar,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.480
but I know myself quite well.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.960
I am not a fool.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.180
It flew up holding the car's wire winch!

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.870
Hmph. Not bad, Kakyoin.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.770
By the way, do you like sumo?

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.100
Especially deadlocks at the edge of the ring...

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.730
It's exciting, isn't it?

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.940
Ow...

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.870
Indeed. I quite enjoy sumo.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.130
But Jotaro, in sumo, it's against
the rules to punch your opponent.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.020
Star Platinum

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.020
Jotaro Kujo

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.660
Since I didn't see anything that
looked like a Stand attack,

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.650
I guess it was just some weirdo.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.830
Yeah. Either way, he can't possibly survive.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.280
Well, I guess he got what he deserved.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.540
But I wonder why...

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.390
That car was suddenly behind us.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.000
It's so strange.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.130
It's not strange at all...

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.500
It's the radio!

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.630
It's coming from the car radio!

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.970
It was able to do that
because it's a Stand, Joestar!

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.510
What?!

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.900
If it knows my name, it must be one

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.780
of the Stand users that are after us!

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.010
Where is it coming from?

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.010
Could it be from the car that just fell?

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.270
That's impossible! That thing is totaled!

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.100
No, there's a possibility
the whole car is a Stand.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.650
Just like the Stand for Strength was a boat.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.780
The Wheel of Fortune...

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.160
That is the card my Stand suggests.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.620
The Wheel of Fortune?!

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.620
What is that tremor?

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.040
This isn't good...

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.580
Everyone, get in the car!

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.100
No, don't!

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.300
Everyone get away from the car!

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.320
It can't be...

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.050
The ground!

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.880
Crash

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.190
Impossible! It burrowed up through the ground!

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.950
I think it's pretty obvious
that car is actually a Stand!

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.900
It appears that the Stand's user is inside.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.830
What the hell?!

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.750
What is that thing?

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.840
It's like a living creature!

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.390
It transformed! It's going to attack!

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.390
Zoom

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.180
Hmph.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.890
It wants to see who's stronger.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.760
Don't, Jotaro. Don't fight yet!

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.680
Not until we know
what that Stand's power is!

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.240
Jotaro!

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.480
I-Impossible... I couldn't see it.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.240
What did it shoot at me, and how?

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.460
You couldn't see it?

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.040
You'll soon find out...

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.020
When you're about to die, that is!

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.630
Jotaro!

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.090
Jotaro! Polnareff! Kakyoin!

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.840
What the hell is this?!

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.680
The wounds aren't deep,
but it's digging in!

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.420
I can't see it at all.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.630
The Stand appeared to be throwing
something at us, but there's nothing

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.440
sticking out of our wounds.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.340
Are you all right, Jotaro?

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.190
Don't worry about me. Anyway...

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.490
I don't know what kind of attack it is,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.910
but it's got good control.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.790
I'll go after your legs so
you can't run anymore,

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.620
and then run you over!

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.330
Run between the boulders!

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.050
Stop running away!

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.050
What?!

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.990
What the hell are you guys? Cockroaches?!

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.740
Oh, no! It's forcing its way in!

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.480
We're no match for it.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.000
It's acting like some stupid musclehead
who couldn't figure out a puzzle ring,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.480
so he just pitched a violent fit instead!

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.940
Head further back!

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.390
N-No one's carrying me!

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.740
Yeah, I ran away from home.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.230
I'm a good-for-nothing!
I'm all alone and no one loves me!

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.910
I'll just die!

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.020
Good grief.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.110
If you have time to say all that,
you can run, you little brat.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.080
I love you, Jotaro!

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.060
Climb if you want.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.090
There are literally no roads left for you!

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:56.000
Not for escape, not for survival, not for Egypt,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.310
not even a road toward your shining future!

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.460
Because...

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.490
This

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:06.070
Wheel of Fortune is going
to grind you into hamburger

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.500
and splatter you all over these boulders!

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.580
Oh, no!

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.170
I-It's climbing up...

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.610
Is there anything this car can't do?!

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.510
Good grief.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.740
Looks like we're going to have to face it.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.520
Everyone, stay back.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.180
Once it climbs up here,
we'll see the car's underside.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.180
That's when we'll find out who's stronger.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.940
I see. Once the car's underside is in view,

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.660
we may be able to attack it.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.370
You're quite energetic, Jotaro!

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.040
But not smart at all!

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.070
Your bodies reek of something,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.790
and you haven't even noticed!

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.050
Come to think of it, I smell gasoline.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.870
It's our bodies!

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.500
Our bodies smell like gasoline!

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.560
It was shooting gasoline at us!

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.440
It was shooting small amounts of
gasoline at high speed, like bullets.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.170
I-Impossible...

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.700
So his attacks weren't to wound us,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.240
but to soak our bodies with gasoline?!

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.030
Looks like you finally caught on,
but it's too late now!

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.410
These electric wires will spark!

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.690
What?!

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.800
Jotaro!

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.070
Jotaro!

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.070
Don't go near him, Mr. Joestar!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.810
There's gasoline on our bodies, as well.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.770
Jotaro!

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.400
I win! Part Three is over!

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.290
Oh? And who exactly is going
to replace me, Jotaro Kujo?

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.050
You didn't think it'd be you, did you?

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.330
You burrowed into the
ground with Star Platinum!

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.100
So the only thing that
burned up was your jacket!

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:40.170
Hmph. By the way, weren't you
saying something about roads earlier?

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.390
You were wrong.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.730
A road is something that you make yourself.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:50.370
And so, I, Jotaro Kujo,
will show you how it's done.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.410
I'll show you exactly how roads are built!

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.750
I-I'm being crushed...

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:03.960
Jotaro!

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.530
That's how it's done.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.330
Where you went flying,
there is now literally a road.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.860
Good, good.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.870
What an odd character.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.240
His arms were so huge,
and yet everything else is so small.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.910
Talk about a bluff.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.890
Hey! Don't you run away!

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.260
Don't kill me! I'm just in this for the money!

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.310
Oh, God.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.150
To think that the Stand was
disguising such a small car, too.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.240
It looks like a sheep that's just been shorn.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.620
How pathetic.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.250
I am a priest in training. Please do not disturb
my ascetic exercises by undoing my restraints.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.160
Well, then. Let's take
this car across the border,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.560
since our car was destroyed.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.060
It's pretty beat-up.
I wonder if it'll last that long.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.730
Help! Help!

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.450
By the way, you're going back
to Hong Kong on an airplane.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.390
Aw, why?!

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.070
Shut up! Don't you get
that you're in the way?

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.540
We might not make it...

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.110
Help!

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.960
Wheel of Fortune

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.960
Zii Zii

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.760
Sob...

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.460
Sob, sob...

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.240
Sob, sob...

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.940
Sob, sob...

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.300
Sob, sob, sob, sob...

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.560
All of the seven Stand users
I sent have been defeated.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.250
All of them have been crushed!

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:32.190
I cannot bear to face Lord DIO.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.520
Curses! That hateful Polnareff! Kakyoin!

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.490
As well as Jotaro and that geezer Joestar!

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.800
I, Enyaba, will now face you personally!

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.740
With my own Stand, the Justice card!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.480
The fog is getting worse from over there.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.310
They died with that look of fear on their face!

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.010
Why is that?

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.130
What is with everyone in this town?

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:32.900
This isn't an ordinary murder.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.340
Joestar and company.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.730
You seem to be travelers.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.030
Assalamu alaikum.
