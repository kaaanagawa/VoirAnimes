Episode 20: Death 13, Part 2

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.410
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.910
Saudi Arabia,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.100
approximately 8,800 kilometers from Japan.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.260
It's been around four weeks since we left.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.560
If we don't hurry, there'll be serious trouble.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.800
Kakyoin...

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.210
Hey, Jotaro.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.080
What do you think is up with Kakyoin?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.270
He was flailing around in his sleep on
the plane, and now he looks like this.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.550
He even went after the baby.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.800
Something's wrong with him.
I think he's at his wit's end.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.280
I don't know if he can continue this journey.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.580
I panicked back there, thinking
Kakyoin had figured out who I am...

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.950
But now, Kakyoin's half-doubting himself.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.060
And we're in the middle of the desert.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.770
Now, I just have to wait
until they're all asleep.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.490
If there's no one to wake them up...

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.860
That smells great. What are you making?

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.420
Baby food.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.930
This is milk, egg yolks, bananas,
and bread all stewed together.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.840
Here. Want a taste?

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.810
It's good!

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.150
I could totally go for this!
Give me more! More!

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.150
Hey, now. There won't
be any left for the baby.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.660
You bastard! Don't eat my food!

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.570
I'm hungry! Hurry up and feed me!

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.120
A—

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.080
A scorpion!

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.030
Th-This isn't good!

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.180
That was close...

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.820
C-Crap!

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.440
Kakyoin was watching.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.660
He killed the scorpion.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.780
Th-That baby really is...

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.370
Sh-Shit!

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.360
That's all you get.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.440
Mr. Joestar, Polnareff, did you see that?!

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.250
Huh?

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.130
That baby isn't normal after all!

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.550
He just killed a scorpion!

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.760
In the blink of an eye!
He stabbed it with a safety pin!

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.140
Kakyoin, hold on.
What are you talking about?

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.060
That is not a normal baby!

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.810
He's not even a year old,
but knew what a scorpion was...

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.110
And he killed it with those tiny hands!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.610
A scorpion?

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.290
Where?!

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.510
In here!

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.430
The dead scorpion on the pin should be in here.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.870
I-It's not here...

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.830
B-But it's true!

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.000
Where'd you hide it?!

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.340
Is it in your clothes?!

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.260
We got it, Kakyoin! That's enough! Stop!

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.350
Mr. Joestar!

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.350
I said this earlier, but you're tired.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.400
Let's talk again tomorrow morning,
after you've calmed down.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.580
Okay, open wiiide! It's dewicious!

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.380
Oh? That's strange. I'm sure you're
hungry, but you don't want any?

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.720
Say "ah."

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.260
S-Stop it!

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.220
There's a reason I can't eat right now!

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.480
Mr. Joestar! I'm sure of it now!

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.480
I don't know where he hid the scorpion,
but he's a Stand user!

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.010
And I have the very thing to prove that!

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.860
Look at the wound on my arm!
At what it says!

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.500
This is a warning.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.950
This must be a wound I got in my sleep.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.450
Oh, my God!

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.710
Kakyoin, did you do that to yourself?

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.340
Eh?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.330
K-Kakyoin, you've finally...

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.590
Oh, my God!

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.090
That big idiot!

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.540
Didn't you realize that if you showed
them that, they'd think you were a fool?!

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.860
D-Did they misunderstand me even more?

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.490
A-At this rate... I have no other choice.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.770
I'll have to use force!

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.120
Hierophant Green!

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.120
Bam

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.750
It's no use. He's totally lost his mind.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.760
I-Impossible. I-I'm certain, Jotaro...

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.770
His Stand was the one in our dreams, Polnareff.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.770
We can't fall asleep, Mr. Joestar.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.670
Please, believe me. Everyone...
If we fall asleep, we'll be killed.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.640
Please, believe me. Believe in me...

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.460
Yes! I got away without being found out!

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.370
You guys lose!

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.090
You lost to your own disbelief in your friend!

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.570
It's my victory, you fools!

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.400
I can't believe it...

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.150
So Kakyoin can't fight or travel with us anymore?

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.820
We'll figure out what to
do with him in the morning.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.770
Let's go to bed.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.190
Polnareff, help me move Kakyoin.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.410
Sure thing.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.590
Jotaro, bring the sleeping bags.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.310
Yeah.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.170
Did you say something?

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.780
Not really. He's just heavy.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:26.820
Now I can slice you all up and scatter
your remains all over the desert!

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.230
I see.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.570
Why are we in sleeping bags at an
amusement park, like a bunch of idiots?

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.790
That's right!

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.110
Th-This is...

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.680
Jotaro! Mr. Joestar! Be careful!

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.200
I-I remember now.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.680
W-We're inside a dream.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.060
It's terrifying!

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.210
This is a world of nightmares!

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.220
Oh, so it's just a dream.
Then I'm just gonna relax.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.670
Don't have the same reaction I did!

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.390
Listen! What Kakyoin was saying is true!

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.600
Baby. Stand.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.930
We're in enemy territory.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.040
I know it's hard to believe,
but the Stand user is that baby!

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.000
There's no one to wake you up now.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.780
So there's absolutely no way
for you to escape Death 13's world.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.090
Now I'll finally finish you all.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.130
Since I made Kakyoin pass out,

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.220
he should already be somewhere in this world.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.380
We have to find him!

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.270
Where are you, Kakyoin?

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.390
I have to apologize to him.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.620
P-Polnareff, what's with your hairstyle?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.490
Did you mess up styling it?

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.310
Eh?

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.700
Polnareff!

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.370
Curl

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.850
What?

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.580
M-My...

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.000
My artificial hand!

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.630
Pop!

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.730
Holy shit!

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.860
How are we supposed to fight this?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.870
How?!

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.240
A-Anything can happen here.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.750
There are no rules or logic.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.020
It's a world where we're at his mercy!

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.760
Wait. There was just one rule.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.500
The thing that'll

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.890
slice us into little pieces

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.560
is his Stand,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.110
and his Stand alone!

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.770
Lali-ho!

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.990
Death 13

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.990
Manishu Booi

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.640
Lali-ho!

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.410
Star...

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.750
It's no use, Jotaro!

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.810
We can't bring our Stands into the dream world!

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:45.900
...Platinum!

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.940
<c.coloreb13c7>Rumble</c>

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.200
Th-That's odd... His Stand appeared.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.730
Clank

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.260
Lali-ho! I'm a fake!

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.650
Loom...

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.460
This overwhelming power! This absolute fear!

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.650
It's so much fun!

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.030
A Stand is spiritual energy.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.320
And dreams are the spirit unguarded!

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.170
Death 13 has surrounded that unguarded spirit,

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.980
and that's why you can't summon your Stands!

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.000
Although...

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.460
Whoosh

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.750
If you had

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.050
summoned your Stands before you fell asleep,

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.140
you could have brought them with you,
like the clothes you're wearing,

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.430
the sleeping bags, and the artificial hand.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.290
Death 13 will never have to face another Stand!

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.440
And the only thing that can
defeat a Stand is another Stand,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.440
so I'll always win!

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.710
Now...

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.540
How about you give me a scream?

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:20.200
One that symbolizes how happy and
refreshed I feel at my easy victory!

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.540
Lali-...ho?

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.640
Lali-ho!

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.390
Oh, it's just the fake one I made.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.460
Wh-What?!

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.970
Impossible!

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.500
This one's not a fake!

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.920
Crush

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.810
This is the real Hierophant!

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.680
It's back!

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.590
It's Kakyoin!

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.650
Kakyoin's right there!

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:55.020
Bam!

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.210
When I lost consciousness earlier,

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.030
did you forget that I had Hierophant out?

00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:00.820
I had Hierophant hide underground
before I fell asleep.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.850
Squish

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.290
Help me!

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.170
Now, it's time for your punishment, baby.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.540
D-Damn it!

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:16.870
Let go!

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.360
Stop, Death 13!

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.120
He's completely in your blind spot.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.940
If you keep resisting...

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.360
Even if you're just a baby,
your neck will be broken.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.650
Kakyoin!

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.320
Kakyoin. We owe you an apology.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.740
I thought you might have become weak-minded.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.160
I couldn't believe in you.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.840
You were fighting this battle alone...

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.980
I'm sorry.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.120
No, Polnareff. It couldn't be helped.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.780
I only figured out a way to bring my Stand

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.340
with me into the dream after you hit me.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.180
So in a way, this is all thanks to you.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.240
R-Really?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.760
I-I can't help but feel a bit conflicted.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.230
I'm kind of ashamed...

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.310
He's holding back because I'm a baby...

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.960
Kakyoin, your naiveté will cost your life!

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:29.120
You're still inside my nightmare world!

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.300
Hey, what's with the clouds?

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.510
The clouds... are moving strangely,

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.690
and coming closer!

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.300
Don't try anything funny,

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.530
Death 13!

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.790
Kakyoin! Get Hierophant away from his back!

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.020
What?

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.740
I'll chop you in half!

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.780
I-Impossible!

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.710
He chopped himself...

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.450
in h-half.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.100
Kakyoin!

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.890
Lali-ho!

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.670
Didn't you realize it?

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.120
Death 13's body is actually hollow!

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.740
Death 13 is just the head,
arms, and the giant scythe.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.390
You enormous fools!

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.480
Let's see.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:40.400
Kakyoin's body should also be
split in two inside the sleeping bag.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.310
Just kidding!

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.640
Kakyoin!

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.580
Y-You're all right?

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.910
Please look closer.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:53.910
My Hierophant isn't so careless
as to stay on his back forever.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.490
He's not chopped in half!

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.890
He's taken on a string-like form...

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.850
And he's crawling into my ear!

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.280
M-My arm is moving on its own...

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.530
It's coming in...

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.660
Bam

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.280
I told you!

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.760
He was in your blind spot,

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.640
so your scythe couldn't touch him.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.170
Now, if you don't wish to
be destroyed from within...

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.880
How about you heal this wound on my arm?

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.280
Anything can happen in dreams,

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.840
so I'm sure you can heal a cut, right?

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.800
R-Right...

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.750
All right, everyone. Wake up!

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.370
Polnareff, wake up! Breakfast is ready!

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.670
I feel like I had a terrible dream...

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:19.960
Same here.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.730
I can't remember it,
but I still feel like it was terrifying.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.550
Kakyoin!

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.960
A-Are you all right?

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.810
What do you mean?

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.690
Wh-What do I...

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.360
You were totally deranged last night!

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.990
You even carved letters into your arm...

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.440
H-Huh?

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.280
The wound is gone?

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.960
Now, I'll just go change the baby's diaper.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.510
Huh?

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.310
Come on, it's morning.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.990
He seems to be getting along with the baby,

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.500
so maybe I was just dreaming...

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.830
So... Did you sleep well?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.250
Oh, well!

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.790
Everyone has forgotten.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.580
A Stand whose existence is completely forgotten...

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.970
What a unique Stand.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.350
But I remember.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.430
I'm the only one who brought
a Stand into the dream.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.400
Listen. Because you're a baby,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.660
I won't mortally wound you,
or injure you at all.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.370
We'll take you to a nearby town.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.680
You need to go back to your mother.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.210
But don't ever come near us again.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.670
If you do, I'll punish you.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.260
Just like this...

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.730
My poop?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.980
Oh, Kakyoin.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.650
You even made some baby food?

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.180
I did.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.240
Let's see. I'm sure you must be hungry by now.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.690
Hey, no... You wouldn't...

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.790
Come on, it's dewicious! Open wiiide!

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.050
Oh, this again? I wonder what
he's got against this stuff....

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.750
At this rate, I'll have to force-feed him.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.050
Stop!

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.420
Hey, Mr. Joestar.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.170
If you force him, he'll just hate it more.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.350
In cases like this...

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.370
Coochie-coochie-coo... Coochie-coochie-coo...

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.270
Coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie-coo...

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.930
See? Isn't it delicious?

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.630
Ba-dum-tss.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.960
Hierophant Green

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.960

Egypt

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.440
Cairo

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.020
Joestar and the others have now
crossed the Arabian Peninsula,

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.290
and are currently crossing the
Red Sea, about to enter Egypt.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:16.470
But!

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.950
Hey, old man. Something's not right.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.270
You're going the wrong way.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.960
Shouldn't you be heading directly west, to Egypt?

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.470
You seem to be heading toward that island.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.400
Yeah, that's right. I have my
reasons for not telling you before,

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:43.210
but before we enter Egypt, we need to
make a slight detour and meet someone.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.710
He's a man who's extremely
important to this journey.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.460
An important man...?

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.020

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.520
I'm the one who let Avdol die.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.880
There's no way I can make up for that.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.390
To thank you for freeing me from the lamp...

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.070
It's an actual treasure!

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.240
...I'll grant you three wishes!

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.030
Can you bring someone back to life?
