00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.530
Enyaba, there's something I'd like to ask you.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.530
What does it mean to live?

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.390
To obtain what one desires.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.200
To put it simply, that is all it means to live.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.780
People want money, they want fame,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.060
they want food, they want love,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.000
they want a lover...

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.730
But when they attempt to obtain what they desire,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.720
there is always a battle, is there not, Enyaba?

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.290
Indeed.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.250
If they lose the battle and
fail to obtain what they desire,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.660
they feel frustration and a sense of failure.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.770
They are hurt...

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.520
And they feel fear when
faced with the next battle.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.600
I believe that conquering
fear is what it means to live.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.980
The one who will stand at the top of the world

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.970
is the one who feels no fear whatsoever.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.210
Do you understand, Enyaba?

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.320
I was the one who told you about

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.990
the existence of your Stand and how to use it.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.480
And you have an immortal body.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.290
Is there anything that you fear?

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.150
Perhaps.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.990
What concerns you?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.530
The Joestar bloodline.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.970
Joestar? Those two? They are mere trash.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.970
They are no match for your Stand!

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.540
Yes...

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.420
But when the lives of those trash
are so deeply entangled with my own,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.190
I cannot help but believe it is destiny.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.430
To be more specific...

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.330
It is not the Joestars that I fear.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.430
It is the fact that I cannot
underestimate the Joestar bloodline.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.950
I feel that I must rid the
Joestars from my wheel of fortune.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.110
You thought to eliminate them
yourself simply because you feel

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.330
that they cannot be underestimated?

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.570
Yes.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.790
Foolishness!

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.260
You should never engage in such foolishness!

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.850
We already have seven Stand users—
The Empress, The Hanged Man,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.590
Strength, The Wheel of Fortune, Temperance,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.470
The Emperor, and The Devil— on the move.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.130
You need not worry about
taking action yourself, Lord DIO.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.500
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.500
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.110
Episode 7: Strength

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.440
Whoa!

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.180
A-A freighter!

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.000
I didn't see it at all.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.000
Jotaro, what are you concerned about?

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.880
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.770
Do you think there might be

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.420
another Stand user on this freighter, too?

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.740
No, I was just wondering why

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.160
no one's shown themselves,
even though the ramp is down.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.810
They came this far to rescue us!

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.320
There has to be someone aboard!

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.080
Even if they're all Stand users,
I'm getting on this boat.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.910
Grab on. I'll help you up.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.580
Good grief.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.160
Wh-What's with this boat?!

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.490
There's no captain in the pilothouse!

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.360
There's no operator in the radio room.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.670
There's no one anywhere!

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.680
And yet, look!

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.540
All the meters and machines are working properly.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.390
Maybe they're all in the bathroom
with a bad case of diarrhea.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.380
Hey! Isn't anyone around?

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.500
Everyone, come over here!

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.330
A monkey!

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.650
There's a monkey inside that cage.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.810
An orangutan.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.030
Who the hell cares about a monkey?!

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.530
Let's split up and find whoever's been feeding it.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.590
Well?

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.680
It doesn't appear to be broken, but...

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.270
Avdol! That sailor's in danger!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.570
Good grief.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.320
A welcome like this is a bit much for a girl.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.080
B-But no one was touching it...

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.030
I saw that crane move, even though
there was no one operating it!

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.090
Th-That crane impaled him on its own!

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.090
Be careful! There's someone here.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.890
Hey! Don't touch any of the machinery.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.640
If it moves or runs on electricity,
don't lay a finger on it!

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.470
If you want to live, follow my orders.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.270
Don't leave the cabin down
below until we say it's okay!

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.530
Did anyone see even a
glimpse of a Stand just now?

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.560
No...

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.770
My apologies...

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.290
I was the closest to the crane,
yet I felt nothing.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.240
All right. I will have my
Hierophant Green look around.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.990
I-I have no idea what's going on,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.100
but dangerous things keep happening
when you guys are around.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.110
Are you guys jinxes?

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.880
I've heard about people who cause
disasters that endanger everyone,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.790
and that I should avoid them.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.920
Is that what you are?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.170
I have just one bit of truth for you.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.580
We are on your side.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.490
Make sure you stay with the others. Got it?

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.300
Okay.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.040
You want me to open the cage?

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.480
I can't.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.960
I don't know where the key is, and you're so big.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.820
You're giving me an apple?

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.460
But it doesn't make sense...

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.540
This apple's been cut with a knife,
and the color hasn't changed yet...

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.060
It was just cut.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.800
Hey, so there is someone
somewhere on this boat, right?

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.570
Do you know where the
person who feeds you is?

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.430
Scratch

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.280
Y-You're a pretty smart monkey, aren't you?

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.160
Is a monkey like you actually into looking at

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.800
pinups of human girls?

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.410
Hey, be careful!

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.990
They say an orangutan has
five times the strength of a human,

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.360
so it could easily rip off your arm.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.860
Come on. Stay with us in the
room on the other side.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.590
Don't go off by yourself.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.040
O-Okay...

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.880
It's inconceivable.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.830
I've had Hierophant Green search everywhere,

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.730
but I can't find any signs of life.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.590
We've searched every
pipe and crevice, but nothing!

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.430
Well?

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.770
I-It's no use. I can't get a connection.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.700
Well, try one more time!

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.630
I'm all sticky from the salt water...

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.270
Hey!

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:01.640
Jojo!

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.870
Here's your lock!

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.270
This ape... is no ordinary ape.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.110
Could it be that he's...

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.190
Slice

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.960
I-Is he the one that removed the fan?

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.080
So this ape's a Stand user.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.630
But where's the Stand?

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.010
Why can't I see it?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.010
What?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.890
The steel propeller bent on its own?

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.310
Jojo!

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.810
Wh-What is this?

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.780
Once again, I can't see the Stand,
and yet the window broke.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.980
Star Platinum!

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.960
What's with this thing?

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.210
The ape sank into the wall and disappeared!

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.520
Hey. You saw that, didn't you?

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.150
Stay close to me.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.970
Something bad is going down.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.630
The ape vanished into the wall...

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.090
But that orangutan has to be the Stand user...

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.600
When I touched it with my hand,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.230
I felt a Stand's energy coming from it.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.810
But why can't I see the Stand?

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.990
But... if I can see it, that would mean...

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.330
Wh-What?

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.770
Wh-What is this?!

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.580
C-Crap!

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.670
Th-This is...

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.460
Is this freighter...

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.090
C-Could it be that the ship itself is...

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.390
So the Stand is the freighter!

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.710
C-Crap!

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:14.510
All of it! Everything!
This ship itself is a gigantic Stand!

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.770
The ship?!

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.980
There are Stands that people,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.540
like that girl and the crew members
who aren't Stand users, can see?

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.210
We would have to assume

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.560
that it's because the
energy of its presence is so

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.910
enormous and powerful.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:32.140
But it must demand tremendous
power to operate such a gigantic Stand.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:37.170
Kakyoin! Use Hierophant
Green and contact Jotaro!

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.210
I-I can't!

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.760
It's got a firm hold on my Stand.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.070
So this is what it means to face certain doom.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.390
We were already hopelessly ensnared.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.490
The pressure is getting greater...

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.210
At this rate, our bodies will be torn apart.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.320
E-Everyone will be...

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.430
W-We were careless...

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.440
The word that the orangutan
was pointing to was "strength."

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.980
It means force, energy, power, or aid.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.960
And... it is the eighth card of the Tarot!

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.950
The eighth card of the Tarot. It suggests challenge,
powerful will, and hidden instinct.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.970
It suggests challenge, powerful will,
and hidden instinct!

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.970
Ba-Bang

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.240
This ape thinks it's already won.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.110
"This ship, the entire thing, is my Stand!"

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.310
"You've completely lost!"

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.740
"You can't do anything!"

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.900
That's what it's saying.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.380
That's what this ape is saying!

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.290
That button's not part of your Stand.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.600
You mad?

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.090
I guess it wounded your pride,
since you thought you'd already won.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.880
No, it's not hurt...

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.300
Because apes don't have any pride!

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.930
Graaaa

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.970
That's exactly what makes you an ape.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.720
What's going to hurt...

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.060
is your head!

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.030
Good grief.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.840
I've heard that, when frightened,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.330
animals show their stomachs
to signal that they're giving up.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.010
So you're asking me to forgive you?

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:33.640
But you've already broken
the rules of being an animal.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.580
So I don't think so.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.890
Wham! Wham! Wham!

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.210
It's distorting...
The whole ship is twisting up!

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.910
Hey. Be surprised later.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.970
This ship's about to sink.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.310
We're gonna get out of here,
by the boats we came in on.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.130
I-I can't believe it.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.140
The ship's shape is changing.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.390
It's turning into such a shoddy little boat...

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.500
Unbelievable...

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.270
So that monkey used its own
Stand to get this far into the ocean.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.580
What terrifying power.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.270
That was the first time I've
encountered such energy.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.540
We were completely overwhelmed.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.560
If Jotaro hadn't figured it out,
we would have been done for.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:36.620
But are we going to encounter
even more Stands with

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.660
unknown powers from now on?

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.620
Want some gum?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.600
So we're going to be drifting again.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.980
Good grief. My cigarettes are soaked.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.360
There'll be plenty of sun and
time for them to get dry, Jojo.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.250
We'll just have to pray that we get
rescued and reach Singapore safely.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:01.340
Tokyo

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.520
It's been four days since we left Japan...

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.340
Crash

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.340
Hong Kong

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.340
Cruiser Sinks

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.340
Ghost Ship

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.340
Singapore

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.810
There are 46 days until the time limit.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.040
Cairo

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.990
Strength

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.990
Forever

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.000
It seems Strength has been defeated.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.030
But have no fear.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.790
The remaining six Stand
users are all very powerful.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.310
And one of them is also my son!

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.020
My son's right arm shall take care of them all.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.590
You are a strange old woman.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.890
What is it that you desire?

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.620
I have already told you many times...

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.690
My wish is to stay by your side.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.890
Your guardian spirit has an
unbelievable amount of power.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.440
Your ability to escape trouble,
and your strange life,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.200
are also the result of that.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.850
I would like to see your life!

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.000
That is all...

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.000
Once upon a time,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.110
a prince from the land of Sumatra

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.090
went out to sea, seeking new lands.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.850
He then found an island where

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.980
there were white-maned
lions called Singas,

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.260
and so he named the island Singapura.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.400
A country of straits that ships and tankers from

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.760
around the world pass through!

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.430
A country whose people share

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:26.770
both Western and Eastern heritage
thanks to free trade: Singapore!

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.490
Good grief. We're finally here.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:34.530
We'll stay at a hotel tonight and
figure out our route to Egypt.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.580
All right, let's stay at that hotel.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:30.700
I guess you guys won't even give us a chance to rest.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.190
She'll be in danger if she stays with us.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.860
And Polnareff fell into that trap?

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.510
There...

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.130
...is...

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.020
...a...

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.030
...traitor.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Joestar, you bastard.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
