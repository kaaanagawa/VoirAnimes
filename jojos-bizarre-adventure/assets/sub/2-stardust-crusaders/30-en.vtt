00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.520
Pardon us.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.830
How are you feeling, Mr. Kakyoin?

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.630
I've never been without my vision
before, so it's a bit unsettling.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.800
Does it hurt?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.640
Not much. I think the painkillers are working.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.470
I see. That's good.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.210
Hello, Mr. Kakyoin.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.490
Doctor, when do you think I
can take off these bandages?

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.690
I don't have any time to waste.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.120
Mr. Kakyoin, while your eye
injuries are not life-threatening,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.770
they are not minor, either.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.190
I'm afraid we won't be able
to discharge you anytime soon.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.520
To be honest, I can't even give you an estimate.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.000
Just kidding!

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.820
It's true that you'll need time to heal.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.070
But just a moment ago,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.060
for some reason, we were contacted by
doctors from the Speedwagon Foundation.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.560
They asked that we put you in their care.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.550
With their advanced medical techniques,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.060
I'm sure you'll recover much more quickly.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.770
So exactly who are you, anyway?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.050
The Speedwagon Foundation is world-famous.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.820
I don't think they'd get involved
with an ordinary high school student.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.950
I have an acquaintance who's
very reliable, that's all.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.210
Thank you, Mr. Joestar.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.280
I might be able to join
you sooner than I expected.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.700
Jotaro, Polnareff, Avdol, Iggy...

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.570
Please wait for me.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.260
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.260
Stardust Crusaders

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.880
Episode 30  Bastet's Mariah, Part 1

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.390
This is Luxor, a city about halfway up the Nile.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.840
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.830
In ancient times, it was called Thebes.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.590
Far to the west of the Nile,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.510
there lies a valley where the
pharaohs of old were laid to rest.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.540
This is the Valley of the Kings.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.210
The tomb of the famous King Tutankhamun
lies in the Valley of the Kings.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.960
Wow, so this place is pretty historical.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.880
Apparently, there are still people who

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.570
dig underneath their houses
in secret to the government,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.450
hoping to find gold and treasure.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.170
I wonder if there are still any
tombs or treasures left to be found.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.600
There may be.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.310
By the way, where did the old man go?

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.990
To the bathroom.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.820
Iggy's with him, so if anything
seems odd, they'll notice.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.250
Bathroom?

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.450
Do you need to go, too?

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.480
If it's a <i>real</i> bathroom, sure.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.000
Oh my God!

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.850
The air's so dry, the poop turns
into dust and flies away.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.760
So instead of using water,
this toilet uses the wind?

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.290
And there's no paper.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.770
This is...

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.150
Could this be a sand washlet?!

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.090
You clean your ass... with sand?!

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.870
Desert sand is sterile.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.950
Oh my God!

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.130
I'm not Polnareff, but I think I'll
wait until we're at the hotel.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.060
With a bathroom like that,
I might as well just go behind a rock.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.660
That's a strange sight to see in Egypt.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.040
This makes no sense.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.980
Why is there an electrical outlet in this rock?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.450
What would you even use it for?

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.240
It's not like it could be wired to anything.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.430
I-It shocked me...

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.770
Mr. Joestar, what's the matter?

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.430
We're going to head out soon.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.380
Huh? R-Right...

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.790
Got it. I'll be right there.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.900
But what a surprise that was...

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.080
Since there's power running to it,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.770
does that mean they
have electricity around here?

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.440
What a strange place.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.610
How surreal...

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.690
Bam

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.930
Her card represents the Goddess Bastet.
The user's name is Mariah.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.230
You always want to touch what's off-limits.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.780
We could make it to Cairo in two
days, but we're all injured.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.270
Why don't we spend tonight and
tomorrow in Luxor to take a break?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.690
Let's do that. Ever since we got to Egypt,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.470
the enemy Stands have been getting stronger.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.510
We've just barely been winning.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.550
Hey, Mr. Joestar, is something wrong?

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.380
My prosthetic hand's been acting up.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.680
Well, I'm sure the joints just need oiling.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.810
Hey! Isn't that radio broken?

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.730
How strange. It's made in Japan,
and I just bought it...

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.900
That static's irritating! Could you turn it off?

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.010
Mr. Joestar?

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:49.000
Yeah, I agree. We should probably
rest up before we enter Cairo.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.060
But we cannot let our guard down.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.040
All right. Let's find a hotel.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.050
How strange.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.490
Thanks, old man.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.800
Ah, thank you!

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.450
Hey, the radio suddenly works.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.690
Huh? That's weird... My hammer's so heavy...

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.510
Wh-What?!

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.020
Th-The nails... The nails! It hurts...

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.370
What? Did you hit your fingers?
Be more careful!

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.530
Slamming that hammer around is dangerous.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.520
For crying out loud...

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.770
Mr. Joestar...

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.060
Mr. Joestar, please wake up.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.470
Hey, hurry up!

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.980
Polnareff is fussing about
getting breakfast somewhere.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.080
Hurry and wake him up, Avdol!

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.480
Tell him to be down here in five minutes!

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.060
Most old people wake up early in the morning.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.920
Damn it. What a rude little shit...

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.570
Tell him I'll be right down.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.480
Right.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.780
Did my watch stop?

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.680
But you know, Mr. Joestar...

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.310
For a man of your age,
your sleeping habits are quite amazing.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.160
You've turned a full 180 degrees.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.360
You fell asleep facing south,
but now you're facing north.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.420
Perhaps that proves you're still young?

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.330
I'll be waiting downstairs.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.410
Something strange has been
going on since last night...

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.900
And my prosthetic hand's still acting up.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.550
Wh-What's wrong with this chair?!
It's moving on its own!

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.590
Could it be that the whole floor isn't level?

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.900
This was a pricey hotel, but it
must have been built on the cheap.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.150
Where should we go today?

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.980
The Karnak Temple was amazing,
so I'd say something like that.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.070
It's a bit far, but how about
the Valley of the Queens?

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.800
What the hell are you doing, you dirty old man?!

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.160
Pervert!

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.080
I-I have no idea what's going on...

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.300
Flip

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.970
Oh, my. What a forward, aggressive approach.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.400
You're j-u-s-t my t-y-p-e...

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.060
Smooch!

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.420
Oh my God!

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.450
Something strange is going on!
Something <i>really</i> strange!

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.200
Something has seemed off since last night!

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.780
What?!

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.580
Th-This is...

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.040
Th-They're sticking to me...

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.970
All of this metal is sticking to me...

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.920
Steel is fixing itself to my body!

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.920
Could it be that my body...

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.890
My body...

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.560
Has it turned into a magnet?!

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.980
Ow!

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.490
Th-This magnetism... Could it be a new Stand?

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.110
But why? Why can't I see the Stand?

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.030
Why are the knives and forks flying
at me without a Stand around?

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.910
C-Could it be...

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.820
Has the shock from that rock
turned my body into a magnet?

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.050
I-I can't get loose...

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.800
O-Oh, no! The escalator is made of steel!

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.310
And the magnetism is getting
stronger by the minute!

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.780
What?!

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.880
H-Hey, you! The lady in the miniskirt!

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.690
This is trouble!

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.990
Your chain's gotten tangled
around my hands and body,

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.290
and it's getting dragged into the ramp!

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.710
Push the emergency stop button
at the bottom of the escalator!

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.030
At this rate, your chains will get dragged in,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.720
and they'll chop my hands and feet off!

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.670
H-Hey, are you listening?

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.020
Enjoy, Joseph Joestar.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.030
Wh-What?! D-Don't tell me you...

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.630
You're the Stand user?!

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.950
Bastet

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.950
Mariah

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.830
D-Don't tell me you...

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.080
You're the Stand user?!

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:17.320
Rumble                                       Rumble

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.950
Once you're ensnared by my Stand
Bastet's magnetic energy,

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.350
there's no way to break the spell.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.370
S-Someone! Someone stop this escalator!

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.230
I-I know!

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.030
I'll push the emergency stop button...

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.610
With my Hermit Purple!

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.180
Y-You're kidding! It's not there?!

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.440
Th-The emergency stop button isn't there?!

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.080
I-Impossible! This escalator

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.550
doesn't have a button?!

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.050
I'm getting pulled in!

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.180
My neck! My neck!

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.350
It's gonna cut my head off!

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.030
This is the end!

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.440
It's gonna cut my head off!

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.780
Ahem. Ahem!

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:21.450
This is the end! I'm going to die!

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:21.450
Mr. Joestar. Ahem! Hello, Mr. Joestar.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:27.200
Gonna be chopped right off!

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.200
Ahem.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.910
The escalator has stopped.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.570
I pushed the emergency stop button.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.340
It was on the side.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.200
No problems!

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.350
This escalator inspection has found no problems!

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.350
The stop button works just fine!

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.980
Hey, are you from the hotel?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.530
Could you sign off on the inspection? Right here.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.650
What are you talking about, Mr. Joestar?!

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.780
The enemy. I'm under the
spell of an enemy Stand.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.160
My body is like a magnet now...

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.730
She turned me into a magnet!
Steel sticks to me!

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.340
Pull this thing off me!

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.430
And the magnetic force
keeps getting stronger...

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.110
It's her! That woman is the user!

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.620
What?

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.550
Catch that woman!

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.430
We have to stop her magnetism at once,

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.900
or it'll get so strong,
I won't be able to move!

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.570
Let's go get Jotaro and Polnareff!
They're waiting outside.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.820
What?!

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.310
Grab

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.690
This... It's heavy...

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.320
Avdol?!

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.830
We can't wait on Jotaro and Polnareff!

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.160
That woman's going to escape.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.640
Mr. Joestar, don't stay! Go!

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.660
R-Right!

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.790
I'll at least get a look at her face!

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.050
Th-This is...

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.610
Sh-She went into the women's restroom.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.860
What should we do?

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.060
I'm going in.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.660
My life depends on it!

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.190
I'm going to catch that woman, no matter what!

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.190
Mr. Joestar?!

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.660
The old man's not here yet?

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.700
Yeah. Avdol went to get him,
and he's not back, either...

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:38.920
Could it be...

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.000
They secretly...

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.910
went to eat something
super-delicious without us?!

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.570
He's just taking his time in the restroom.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.350
If they don't show up in the next five
minutes, we'll go look for them.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.350
Oh, right. Restroom. Yeah, that's possible...

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:03.360
Come to think of it, the toilets
in this hotel were so clean...

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.560
Mr. Joestar, it's good that we came in here...

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.400
But as I expected, most of the stalls are in use.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.400
Shh!

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.250
Oh, shh...

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:28.680
Sorry. But I-I don't know...
Which one is she in?

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.120
She has amazing legs.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.450
H-Her legs?

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.670
Yes! Look for those legs!

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.870
You'll know right away if you spot them.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.440
W-We're going to look in?

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.370
That's not it.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.910
Or these...

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.490
Nope.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.540
Menacing

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.360
M-Mr. Joestar, right here!

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.050
Come here! Are these her legs?

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.420
Bam

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.870
Oh, my. You're the wonderful man I met earlier.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.210
You came all the way here this time?

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.590
What a bold approach...

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.010
Smooch!

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.280
Holy shit!

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.140
It's that old hag! But she was upstairs!

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.820
Th-This isn't good!

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.760
We got the wrong person.
This is incredibly bad...

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.460
How could you screw that up?!

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.770
Avdol, run!

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.860
Wai—

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.520
Perverts!

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.700
This is not in line with my image!

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.910
Bathroom disaster is Polnareff's thing!

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.420
It's a peeping old man!

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.340
How awful!

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.570
You perverts!

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.290
No, you're wonderful!

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.750
She's headed that way!

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.770
Damn it. When did she get over there?!

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.460
After her!

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.640
A-Avdol, I forgot to tell you earlier,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.720
but don't touch anything that
looks like an electrical outlet.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.470
Don't touch it, no matter where it is!

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.860
That's the enemy's Stand!

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.020
You'll feel like you've been shocked,
and then the magnetism starts!

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.320
I'm afraid I've touched it, Mr. Joestar.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.130
What?! Wh-Where?!

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.530
When I pushed the emergency
stop button at the escalator...

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.580
There was an outlet nearby,
and it shocked me.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.080
Th-That woman...

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.060
M-Mr. Joestar, please don't run so close to me.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.790
It's hard to move with you stuck to me.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.940
Y-You get away, Avdol!

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.970
What are you talking about?
You're the one getting closer!

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.850
Two magnets, when close together,

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.600
will attract each other!

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.620
To think that my body, too,
would become a magnet...

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.980
Mr. Joestar, this situation...

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.740
Yeah, it's extremely bad.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.990
Th-This enemy...

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.490
This enemy...

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.250
She's strong!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.010
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.450
My body, too, became a magnet...

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.320
We can't help it!
We're both in her power now.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.730
What a strong woman!

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.720
What should we do? At this rate...

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.290
I've never backed down from a fight!

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.460
I'm just going...
