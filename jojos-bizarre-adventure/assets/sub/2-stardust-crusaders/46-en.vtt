00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.160
What are you doing, Kakyoin?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.760
I've got it.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.800
I've figured out a way to reveal
what DIO's Stand truly is.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.910
What?!

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.270
Rumble

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.660
Whenever Noriaki Kakyoin sees his
Hierophant Green, this is what he remembers.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.830
Your little Noriaki doesn't try
at all to make friends.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.180
It's not that the other kids don't like him.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.170
He just doesn't open up to anyone.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.800
As his teacher, I'm very concerned.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.770
I'm his mother, yet I still
don't know why he's like that.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.270
Ever since I was a child, I thought

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.320
that living in a city means
meeting a lot of people.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.860
But even in an entire lifetime,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.500
how many people meet others they can truly
understand, and who understand them?

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.500
My classmates' address books are
filled with their friends' names.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.990
There must be about fifty friends in each.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.740
Maybe even a hundred.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.050
My mother has my father,
and my father has my mother.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.310
But I'm different.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.330
I'm sure rock stars and people on TV
have tens of thousands of friends.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.710
But I'm different.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.630
I probably won't ever have someone
who sees me for who I am.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.760
Because I don't have a
single friend who can see

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.340
my Hierophant Green.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.430
It's impossible for

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.640
those who can't see him to understand me.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.750
Until I met Mr. Joestar, Jotaro,
Polnareff, and Avdol,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.270
I felt that way all the time.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.440
I wonder why I get goosebumps

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.670
when I think about Avdol and Iggy.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.390
Perhaps because they were

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.450
the first friends I shared
a common goal with.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.160
This journey to defeat DIO...

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.660
Even though it lasted only a few weeks,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.210
they became friends I
could truly connect with.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.010
Noriaki Kakyoin looks at
Hierophant Green and thinks:

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.810
I'll make him invisible to everyone,
just like he used to be.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.540
Yes, to reveal DIO's true
identity and defeat him,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.640
I'll make his presence completely disappear.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.270
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.270
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.940
Episode 46  DIO's World, Part 2

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.200
Hey, Jotaro!

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.190
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.580
That car's crushed to pieces.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.160
Up there.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.160
The old man and DIO are on the rooftops.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.900
Only Kakyoin and Joseph are before me.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.880
I see.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.290
They split up so they could
attack from both sides.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.390
So Jotaro and Polnareff must
intend to attack me from behind.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.560
How useless.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.020
This is...

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.530
Kakyoin's Hierophant!

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.330
Hierophant's barrier!

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.450
This is...

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.180
That's right!

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.480
Hierophant's barrier, which
activates when touched,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.090
completely surrounds you for
20 meters in every direction!

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.240
Now I can sense both your
movements and The World's!

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.050
Take this, DIO! 20-meter
radius Emerald Splash!

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.840
You fool. You shall soon know

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.640
that The World's true power is, indeed,
the power to reign over this world!

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.140
Bring out your Stand, DIO!

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.270
The World!

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.440
Doom

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.530
What?! Kakyoin!

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.530
He was suddenly blown away!

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.010
Impossible!

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.500
Kakyoin!

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.040
Wh-What... just happened?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.870
Did he beat me?

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.760
It's no use. I think my injuries are fatal.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.550
I can't speak... I can't even lift a finger.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.430
It's 5:15...

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.740
That means it's around midnight in Japan.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.730
I wonder what my parents are doing.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.330
Maybe they're already asleep.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.350
I'm sorry for making you worry so much.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.020
Noriaki Kakyoin's final thoughts

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.270
were not of his parents in Japan.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.330
Though he cared deeply for his parents,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.210
when his mind drifted to the final
question that puzzled him,

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.390
thoughts of his parents drifted away.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.650
I can sense every movement of those
who touch Hierophant Green's barrier.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.400
But DIO ripped apart the entire barrier at once.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.400
Why wasn't it done strand by strand?

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.970
It was completely simultaneous,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.410
without even a microsecond
of a time between them.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.160
The entire barrier, over a 20-meter radius,
was ripped apart all at once?

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.080
How?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.440
Without even the slightest delay...

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.230
How... all at once...?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.740
How?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.880
Kakyoin!

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.850
I-I can't let this continue! Hermit...

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.860
Joseph... You're next.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.200
Don't you think taking the blood of a Joestar

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.700
would be just the thing to make
Jonathan's body completely mine?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.490
DIO!

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.130
How could he hit them all with
no time passing between them?

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.000
Time passing...

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.910
Time...

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.240
Time...

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.140
The time!

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.010
I... I understand now.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.820
H-How could this be?
There's no other explanation.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.660
I-I have to tell them about this!

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.900
This terrifying truth... Somehow...

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.790
I have to tell Mr. Joestar...

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.650
At this rate, everyone will

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.040
be defeated.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.780
How dare you do that to Kakyoin?!

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.660
I'll take that body back, for my Grandma Erina!

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.980
Erina? Ah, that country girl.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.130
How foolish.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.440
I shall drink your blood and kill you.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.820
Joseph Joestar!

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.110
Die!

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.320
M-My final Emerald... Splash...

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.760
What?

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.560
He didn't even aim in the right direction.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.640
I suppose he wanted to use up

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.920
the last of his strength to go out with a bang.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.860
Impossible!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.790
Kakyoin wouldn't do something
pointless at a time like this.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.950
So why in that direction?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.410
What does it mean?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.580
Is he trying to tell me something?

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.410
It's a... message.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.330
It's the best I can do...

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.240
Mr. Joestar...

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.920
Please understand.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.890
Please, figure it out...

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.220
Kakyoin...

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.650
Noriaki Kakyoin

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.610
Noriaki Kakyoin has died.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.350
Noriaki Kakyoin
— has died —

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.070
Hermit Purple!

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.500
And take this!

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.330
The sun's own energy, Hamon!

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.340
You old fool! Your Stand is the weakest of all!

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.860
I won't let you get away!

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.890
Kakyoin, why did you shoot the clock tower?

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.900
What was shooting the
clock tower supposed to tell me?

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.400
It must mean something important!

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.240
I-It's Mr. Joestar!

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.890
DIO's chasing after him.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.640
Where's Kakyoin?!

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.860
Could it be, Kakyoin...

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.610
Were you able to solve the mystery

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.830
of DIO's Stand while all that was going on?

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.750
He destroyed the clock with Emerald Splash.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.350
He destroyed the clock's hands...

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.720
He... stopped the clock?

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.560
I-Impossible! Could it truly be...

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.350
The true power of DIO's The World

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.110
is the power to stop time!

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.490
Take this, DIO! 20-meter
radius Emerald Splash!

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.870
The World!

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.990
Doom

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.980
This is The World.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:14.650
But since time has stopped for you,
you can neither see nor feel him.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.370
Die, Kakyoin!

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.140
You don't even realize that you've been killed.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.590
There's no way for you to
even know what happened.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.970
I understand, Kakyoin!

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:47.530
You died to send me that message...
and I've gotten it!

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.990
Hermit Purple

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.990
Joseph Joestar

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.710
It stops time?

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.750
It's a Stand that can stop time and keep moving?

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.250
That's too dangerous! Way too dangerous!

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.290
Calm down... Calm down and think!

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.800
I don't know the meaning of the word "panic"!

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.090
I need to think of something...

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.180
Some way to break through and defeat him!

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.680
H-He disappeared!

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.330
Wh-What's wrong?

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.110
Not going to hit me, DIO?

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.270
Weren't you going to drink my blood?

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.510
You've suffused your body with Hamon

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.000
to protect yourself.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.040
Hermit Purple, infused with Hamon,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.570
is like a high-voltage wire wrapped
around your body, isn't it?

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.790
You're quite the schemer,
you cunning old geezer.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.260
The same goes for you.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.810
You realized I was using Hamon
and made sure not to touch me.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.430
Very attentive of you.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.400
But I've figured something
out about your Stand.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.630
DIO, though you can stop time,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.780
it looks like you can only do so very briefly.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.990
About three to four seconds, I'd say.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.830
If you could stop time for any longer,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:30.860
we would have all died back at your mansion,

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.130
and you wouldn't have had to chase us down.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:39.300
So you understand how The World works? Hah!

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.880
I'll spare you a bit of praise for that.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.890
It was Kakyoin who figured it out.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.770
I won't let Kakyoin die for nothing!

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.010
And what of it?

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.770
What good does understanding
my Stand's power do for you?

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.360
What can your Hamon possibly do now?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.530
Hermit Purple and Hamon!

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.510
Enough!

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.070
I don't need to touch the Hamon to attack you!

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.740
Hey, look.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.460
That old guy fell outta the sky!

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.680
Santa! I bet he's Santa!

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.470
What were you doing on the roof?

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.960
Checking out some hot chicks?

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.100
Old man...

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.850
J-Jotaro!

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.210
Stay back!

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.860
Don't come near me!

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.780
Jotaro... What perfect timing.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.320
But he's not quite in range.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.120
I'll deal with Joseph first.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:57.000
Jotaro! The secret of his Stand,
The World, is time!

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.130
It's a Stand that stops ti―

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.880
The World!

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:18.400
At first, I could only stop time
for a mere blink of an eye.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.980
But as my neck wound began to heal,

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.900
I soon could stop it for two seconds, then three.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.240
I can now stop time for five seconds.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.820
It's strange to think of it as five seconds,
since it occurs when time is stopped,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.910
but I have five seconds in which to act.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.330
Eventually I'll get to a minute...
Then ten minutes, then an hour...

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.180
Then as long as I want!

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.720
It's quite exciting,

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.750
knowing that I will be able to stop
time for longer and longer...

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.090
Oh, that's right, Joseph.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.980
You were using Hamon to protect your body.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.500
Hamon gave me a little trouble
a hundred years ago,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.910
but it's powerless before The World.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.330
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.330
Useless!

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.230
Halt

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.230
The grandson of Jonathan, Joseph...

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.880
You are now dead!

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.720
One more second...

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.520
Zero.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.990
The World

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.040
Old man!

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:03.120
S-Stay back! R-Run... J-Jotaro...

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.630
D-Don't go near him.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.430
K-Keep your...

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.950
d-distance...

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.310
Stay away... Stay away from him...

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:25.540
Y-You're no... match...

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.120
I've already taken care of Kakyoin, too.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.130
Polnareff must be hiding somewhere...

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.750
Hah. But it doesn't matter.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.260
You're next, Jotaro!

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.290
You bastard.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:57.780
DIO!

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.940
Oh? You're approaching me?

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.100
Instead of running away,
you're coming right to me?

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.110
Even though your grandfather, Joseph,

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.240
told you the secret of The World,

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.370
like an exam student scrambling to finish

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:16.620
the problems on an exam until the
last moments before the chime?

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.500
I can't beat the shit out of
you without getting closer.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.080
Oh ho! Then come as close as you like.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:40.550
Too slow, too slow!
The World is the ultimate Stand.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.710
Even without his power to stop time,
his speed and power

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.660
far exceed that of your Star Platinum.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.860
So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.200
Not much range, but immense
power and precise movements.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.000
I wanted to try a little test to find out

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.700
just how much more powerful The World
was, compared to your Stand.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.420
Though it appears a test was hardly necessary.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.140
Test? Is that what you call just patting me,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.140
and not even enough to hurt?

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.960
Well, I guess you ripped my
20,000 yen pants, though.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.680
Why are you Joestars so stubborn
about admitting defeat?

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.920
Hmph. I suppose I shall rise
to your silly provocation,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.430
and test you just a bit more.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.570
Shall we compare the speed
of our attack rushes?

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:47.040
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.360
I first experienced stopped
time half a year ago.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.360
It began when everything around
me seemed to have stopped.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.900
It will be The World's true power
that deals the final blow!

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.950
The World, stop time!
