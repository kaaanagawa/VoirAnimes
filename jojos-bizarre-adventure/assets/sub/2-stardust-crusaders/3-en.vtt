Episode 3: The Curse of DIO

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.770
It's too late for him.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.630
He's not going to make it.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.010
He'll die in the next few days.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.320
Jotaro, it's not your fault.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.420
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.700
Look. The reason that this
man swore loyalty to DIO

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.760
and came to kill you...

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.780
is right here!

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.480
What is that spider-like growth?

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.060
You said that's the reason he swore loyalty to DIO?

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.120
That is a flesh bud, formed from DIO's own cells.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.570
It connects to his brain.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.850
This tiny little flesh bud was implanted in his brain

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.530
to influence his mind.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.670
In other words, that flesh bud is a controller

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.370
that draws forth certain feelings.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.100
Charisma!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.870
The feelings that make
soldiers want to obey dictators!

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.760
The feelings that make true
believers follow cult leaders!

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.760
This young man admired
DIO and swore loyalty to him!

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.250
DIO is a charismatic figure,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.700
which means he can sway others

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.250
with his overwhelming powers of attraction.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.400
He used that to order this young man,
called Kakyoin, to kill us.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.120
So operate on him and remove it.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880
The brain is very delicate.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.070
If he were to move while we were extracting it,
we could inflict brain damage.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.760
Jojo.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.070
The following happened four months ago,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.300
in Cairo, Egypt.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.130
I met DIO!

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.870
I am a fortune teller by trade.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.660
I have a shop in a souk called Khan el-Khalili.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.720
It was the night of the full moon.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.540
He...

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.860
stood quietly on the stairs that
led up to my shop's second floor.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.370
His cold gaze felt as if it was
trying to stealthily pierce my heart.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.530
His golden hair,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.720
his near-transparent alabaster skin,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.860
and his strange sensuality made
it hard to believe he was a man.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.010
I had heard about him from
Mr. Joestar, so I knew immediately

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.660
that he was DIO, back from the Atlantic's depths!

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.010
I hear that you have powers
that ordinary people don't.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.970
I'd be grateful if you could show them to me.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.980
It was then that I found him truly terrifying.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.100
His words brought such peace to my soul.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.200
They had a dangerous sweetness.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.200
That's exactly why he was terrifying!

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.360
Come, Avdol...

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.230
Auuuugh!

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.620
I ran for my life.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.120
I didn't dare think of fighting him.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.210
I was very lucky.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.750
Because I had heard about
DIO and realized it was him,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.940
I was able to immediately
jump out the window.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.990
I knew the labyrinthine souk below like the
back of my hand, so I was able to escape.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.040
Otherwise, I would have
ended up like this young man,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.690
made into one of his
followers through a flesh bud.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.590
You would have died a few years later,
your brain completely devoured.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.330
Died?

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.090
Hold on a minute.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.330
Kakyoin here...

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.590
isn't dead yet!

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.290
Bang

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.980
I'll pull it out using my Stand!

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.260
Wait, Jotaro!

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.750
Old man, don't touch me!

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.690
I'll pull it out without harming his brain.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.270
My Stand moves with such precision
that it can grasp even a bullet.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.890
Stop! That flesh bud is alive!

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.860
Don't you realize why part of
the flesh bud is outside of his body?

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.610
That's why not even the
best surgeon could extract it!

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.070
Shit!

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.170
The flesh bud stabbed him with a tentacle!

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.780
This isn't good! Let go, Jojo!

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.680
It will try to enter the brain of
anyone who tries to extract it!

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.710
You...

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.250
Don't move, Kakyoin.
If I fail, your brain is done for.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.090
Let go, Jojo! It's gone up to your face!

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.640
Wait, Avdol!

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.290
My grandson is quite the man.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.560
It's entered his body,
and yet he's completely calm.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.860
He isn't even trembling. Nor is his Stand!

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.190
He moves with more precision
and strength than I anticipated.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.990
He did it!

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.540
Overdrive!

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.800
Wh...

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.810
Why?

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.930
Why did you risk your life to save me?

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.600
Who knows?

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.030
I'm not really sure myself.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.530
Mama sees right through you, Jotaro.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.800
First Aid Kit

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.230
And done.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.880
Thank you... very much.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.950
Kakyoin, wasn't it?

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.970
You should rest for a while.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.560
Stay the night tonight.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.920
Huh? Um...

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.600
Papa, please get his futon ready.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.720
Why do I have to do that?!

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.240
I've never even liked the
idea of sleeping on the floor!

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.610
Holly, replace the futon
in my room with a real bed!

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.550
Papa, you're in Japan,
so please just get used to

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.450
the Japanese way of doing things.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.700
Oh, and call me "Seiko."

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.530
What?!

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.210
Holly comes from the word "Holy,"
which is "Seinaru" in Japanese.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.360
So all my friends call me "Seiko."

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.490
What the hell is that?!

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.630
"Holly" is the wonderful name I gave you mys—

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.180
If you don't call me "Seiko"
from now on, I won't answer.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:02.930
Holly!

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.130
Does it hurt, Kakyoin?

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:05.890
I-I'm fine.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.890
Holly!

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.160
Good grief...

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.350
All right, Kakyoin, take off your uniform.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.040
Huh?

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.890
Come on, now.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.410
Holly!

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.610
Hmph.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.840
Holly! Hey, Holly.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.800
Hey, where are you?

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.430
Take a good look. These are Jotaro's pants.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.390
Where are mine?

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.550
The size is just right, but I can't wear these!

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.380
Hey, Holly!

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.740
Oh, I have to call her "Seiko"
or she won't come out?

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.640
No, my daughter is Holly.
Holly! Answer me!

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.570
I'm definitely going to go to school today.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.190
That's weird...

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.970
Here, a goodbye kiss.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.850
Smooch.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.980
That's usually how it plays out...

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:45.430
Menacing

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.730
Bam!

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.740
Ms...

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.910
Ms. Holly!

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.310
Ms. Holly! Ms. Holly!

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.840
She's got a really high fever...

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.810
Is she sick?

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.430
This is... It can't be!

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.760
P-Pardon...

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.990
H-How can this be?

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.350
It's intangible...

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.750
It's a Stand!

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.140
A Stand has manifested
from Ms. Holly, as well!

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.990
Hermit Purple

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.990
Joseph Joestar

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.890
Ms. Holly has a Stand, too.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.540
B-But this high fever...
The Stand is causing her harm.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.960
We thought that only Jojo and Mr. Joestar
were being affected by DIO's body,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.130
and were relieved that Ms. Holly was unaffected.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.560
No, we merely wanted to be relieved.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.520
But there's no way she could be unaffected.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.390
Anyone who has the blood of
the Joestar family in their veins

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.140
should be affected by DIO.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.220
But...

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.810
Stands are controlled by a person's mental strength,

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.480
and move with their fighting instincts.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.860
Ms. Holly is very gentle and peaceful.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.830
She therefore lacks the
strength to withstand DIO's curse.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.870
She has no power to move her Stand.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.160
That's why her Stand is moving
against her and harming her!

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.670
This isn't good at all. At this rate...

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.060
She'll die!

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.920
She'll be killed!

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.880
Menacing

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.890
A S-Stand...

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.140
Holly...

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.050
Smash

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.530
This... This is the one thing I feared most!

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.580
M-My daughter finally has a Stand.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.590
I knew she didn't have
the power to withstand it.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:15.460
I knew she didn't have the power
to deny the curse from DIO's soul.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.480
Tell me how we should deal with this!

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.480
There's only one way.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.130
We need to find DIO!

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.530
We need to kill DIO and lift the curse!
That's all we can do!

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.040
Bam

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.410
But...

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.590
No matter how many times I try,
he hides in the darkness.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.250
In every spirit photo I take,
the background is darkness!

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.860
I cannot find out where he
is with my spirit photos.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.410
We've used various means to analyze them,
but with this darkness, it always failed.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.680
You should've told me that in the first place.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.810
I might be able to find out where

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.550
Bang

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.330
that darkness or whatever is!

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.950
Did you see something in the space behind DIO?

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.160
My Stand is able to move with

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.090
such accuracy that it could
extract a flesh bud from his brain,

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.010
and with such precision that it can grasp a bullet.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.420
Let's have him sketch.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.090
Whoosh

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.100
Whoosh

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.310
A fly! A fly was in that space!

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.820
But a fly won't help us at all—

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.560
Wait a moment!

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.430
I've seen this fly before!

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.270
What?!

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.930
Jojo, do you have an encyclopedia?

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.400
We've got a library.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.320
I'll take the memo.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.340
And I'll go investigate.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.570
Holly!

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.480
Papa, I...

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.290
Just rest. Jotaro, get some water.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.810
You seem to be doing well.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.730
Sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.740
Is it really possible for your own Stand to kill you?

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.160
It is. In the past, I have seen
many people suffer that fate.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.590
Right now, it's just her back,

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.010
but eventually that Stand,
growing like a fern,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.590
will slowly bind Ms. Holly's entire body.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.230
She will suffer high fevers and various illnesses,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.980
fall into a coma from which she'll never awaken,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.020
and die.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.430
A normal human

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.330
would die of something unseen and unknown,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.860
and no skilled doctor would
be able to treat them.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.700
No one, not you nor I,
can do anything about it.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.530
But there is still hope.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.870
It will take fifty days for
her to reach that state.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.770
We will find and defeat DIO before that.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.250
If we are able to destroy
the connection to DIO's Stand,

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.740
we can save her!

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.880
Thank you, Jotaro.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.090
Really, I wonder what's wrong with me...

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.260
I can't believe I took fever and passed out.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.260
But...

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.890
I feel better now.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.940
She hasn't realized what happened,
since it's coming from her back.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.590
You gave me quite the scare, Holly.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.090
Come now. You've got to
brush your teeth now that you're up.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.060
Say, "ahh."

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.060
Ahh...

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.570
We've got to wash your face...

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.080
Your hair is a mess, too.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.580
Then we'll take care of your nails...

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.450
Ahh...

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.450
Ahh...

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.630
Papa, help me change my underwear, too.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.920
I'm kidding! It was a joke!

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.890
Now, then, what do you want
to eat for dinner, Jotaro?

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:26.890
H-Hey...

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.100
Don't move! Just stay in bed!

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.650
I-I'm saying that you shouldn't do
anything until your fever goes down.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.530
Just shut up and get better soon.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.300
Holly, come on...

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.290
You're right.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.910
You're all so nice when I'm sick.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.860
Sometimes having a cold isn't so bad.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.520
H-Holly!

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.480
Sh-She lost consciousness again.

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.990
She's acting cheerful, but she's burning up.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.600
The way she acted confirms it.

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:18.760
Though she hasn't said anything,
my daughter is aware of her Stand.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.720
She was actually trying to hide her Stand from us.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:29.030
She was trying not to worry us!

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.800
That's what kind of person my daughter is.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.620
Mr. Joestar, I've found it!

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.040
That fly is...

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.110
Nile

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.110
Nile Ue Ue Fly (Male)

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.410
This.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.330
The Nile Ue Ue Fly.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.310
It dwells only within the Nile River Basin.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.960
The ones with the stripes
on their legs are known

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.390
as Aswan Ue Ue Flies.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.710
Egypt!

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.430
And we've narrowed it
down to the Aswan area.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.760
DIO is there!

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.120
So it is Egypt...

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.600
Kakyoin.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.670
What do you mean by that?

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.930
The flesh bud was planted in
my brain three months ago.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.790
When my family was on vacation in
Egypt visiting the Nile, I met DIO.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.970
You were in Egypt, too?

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.430
It appears that, for some reason,
DIO doesn't want to leave Egypt.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.160
When are you going?

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.210
I'll go with you.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.920
Go with us? Why would you?

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.430
About that...

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.430
I'm not sure why I suddenly
want to join you, either.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.870
I've regained my senses because of you.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.940
That's all.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.880
Holly... we'll save you, no matter what.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.200
Don't worry.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.260
There's nothing to worry about...

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.270
We'll make you better.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.260
You just take it easy.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:12.450
Jojo's mother, Ms. Holly, is a woman
who can calm the hearts of others.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.300
People feel at ease when she is nearby.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.030
This may sound awkward,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.800
but if I were to fall in love, I'd like
it to be with someone like her.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.980
I'd feel like I have to protect her.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.530
I'd want to see her happy, kind smile.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.200
Indeed.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.200
There's no time. We're leaving immediately.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.300
They're doctors from the Speedwagon
Foundation. We can trust them.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.650
They will take care of Holly around the clock.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.780
Jojo, before we leave, since I am a
fortune teller, I shall name your Stand.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.640
Name?

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.390
With the cards of fate, the Tarot.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.390
Choose a card blindly and it shall be decided.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.360
This will suggest your fate,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.980
as well as suggest your Stand's power.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.070
The Star! The Star card!

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.740
Then I shall name your Stand...

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.910
Star Platinum!

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.770
Jotaro Kujo

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.980
Jotaro Kujo. Stand name: Star Platinum!

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.840
Jotaro Kujo                                     Star Platinum

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.840
Powers: Precise movements
and splendid strength!

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.880
Joseph Joestar. Stand name: Hermit Purple!

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.840
Joseph Joestar

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.840
Hermit Purple

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.800
Power: Spirit photos!

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.880
Mohammed Avdol. Stand name: Magician's Red!

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.340
Mohammed Avdol

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.590
Magician's Red

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.610
Powers: Fire and heat!

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.630
Noriaki Kakyoin.
Stand name: Hierophant Green!

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.890
Noriaki Kakyoin

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.890
Hierophant Green

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.900
Powers: Long distance
manipulation and Emerald Splash!

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.820
All right, we're off.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.630
Bam

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.990
Let's go!

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.760
As I anticipated...

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.590
They have figured out my location.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.700
Will you come here to Egypt?

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.120
Joseph and Jotaro...

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.500
He saw us.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.380
I definitely felt DIO looking at us just now.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.420
Yeah.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.460
Be careful.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:16.570
The next Stand user may
already be on this plane.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.970
Next Episode Preview

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.280
We've already found the next Stand user!

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.010
Impossible! It's faster than Star Platinum!

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.100
What?

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.300
It writhes in pain when torn apart.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.670
Wow... He's so handsome!

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.990
Pardon me. Do you have a moment?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.990
Episode 4:

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.990
Tower of Grey
