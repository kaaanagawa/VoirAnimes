00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.370
After capturing Enyaba,
Jojo's group acquired a carriage.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.650
They then arrived in Karachi,
the coastal town that leads

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.010
Calcutta

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.010
India

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.010
Pakistan    <font size="16">Delhi</c>

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.010
Indus River   <font size="18">Karachi       Varnasi</c>

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.830
Pakistan in commerce and industry,
which lies near the Indus River delta.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.290
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.290
Stardust Crusaders

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.770
Episode 16: The Lovers, Part 1

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.250
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.530
Hey, a doner kebab place!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.860
Why don't we stop and get something to eat?

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.280
Doner kebabs are the
hamburgers of the Middle East!

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.170
A slab of meat is placed on a spit,
and its surface roasts as it turns.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.920
They then shave off the cooked meat

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.520
and eat it on bread.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.880
It is quite a delicious dish.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.810
Excuse me. I'd like five of those.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.510
Five will cost you a thousand yen.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.260
A thousand yen?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.990
In the Middle East, the logic of Japan and

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.680
the West doesn't apply at all.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.520
Namely, prices are very unspecific.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.950
Foreigners who come here for the first time,

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.440
with no understanding of the art of haggling,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.310
have no idea what things cost
and are easily exploited.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.280
But in this world, such exploitation
is not seen as a bad thing.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.910
The one who was tricked into
buying is seen as an idiot.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.200
I will now explain how to buy things!

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.960
A thousand yen?

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.210
In this situation, for instance,
act like you see through the trick...

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.120
Don't mock me, now! That's far too much.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.510
...and laugh out loud. And then...

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.970
How much would you buy them for?

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.210
...they will ask the customer
how much they're willing to pay.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.640
Make it 250 yen for five!

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.930
In return, the customer names a price so low,

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.820
you'd feel a bit guilty even saying it. And then...

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.200
They'll take the attitude,
"Seriously? Have you no sense?"

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.010
and act as though you're mocking them...

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.420
If I sold them for that much,
my whole family would starve to death!

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.880
Then they will gesture as if
their head were being cut off.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.860
But you mustn't give up yet.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.030
Then maybe I'll just buy them somewhere else.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.590
Act like you're leaving...

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.690
Okay, friend! I'm very kind to foreigners.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.230
I'll sell you five for 700 yen.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.680
...and they'll say that to try and stop you.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.830
Make it 300.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.710
Let the haggling begin!

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.050
600!

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.250
350!

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.280
550!

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.090
400!

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.350
450!

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.610
425!

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.810
I'll take them!

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.370
All right! I got them for less
than half his original price!

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.180
Take that! I made out like a bandit!

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.000
And just as you think that...

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.270
I usually sell five for 150 yen!

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.460
Bye-bye, thank you!

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.350
Hey! That old lady's awake.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.140
Eh?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.610
I-I... I haven't said anything!

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.490
Wh-Why are you here before me?

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.090
Do you think that I, Enyaba,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.580
would actually tell them
the secret of Lord DIO's Stand?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.580
Huh?

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:18.180
Menacing

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.210
Wh-What the hell are these tentacles?!

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.480
Why...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.540
Why have you come to kill me?!

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.490
It means that Lord DIO truly trusts no one.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.970
I will be making sure you never speak again.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.250
And as for you four there...

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.430
I will be taking your lives.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.970
Old lady!

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.600
What?!

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.210
My name is Dan...

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.900
Dan of Steel.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.010
My Stand suggests The Lovers card.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.360
I will see to it that you all
meet the same fate as Enyaba.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.890
How could you?!

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.120
That old lady was one of you, wasn't she?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.270
Old lady!

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.020
L-L-Lies... Lies...

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.470
It's a lie...

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.840
Lord DIO would never do this to me....

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.450
The thing coming out of the
old lady's body is not a Stand!

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.050
They're real! They're real, moving tentacles!

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.230
He would never do something like this to me...

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.650
He would never plant a flesh bud...

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.150
Flesh bud?!

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:00.320
Lord DIO is my reason to live...
We trust each other...

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.530
Old lady!

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.790
Th-They...

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.020
They melted from the rays of the sun.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.170
The flesh bud! It's DIO's own cells!

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.770
Precisely! I'm impressed you
were able to figure that out.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.030
That is what the flesh bud,
made from Lord DIO's cells,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.550
looks like when it's grown.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.520
I just grew it inside of Enyaba.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.680
Enyaba, I hear that you were the one

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.840
who told Lord DIO about the Stands.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.950
But there is no way that Lord DIO

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.530
would ever trust a little
old woman like yourself.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.280
It seems you hadn't realized that.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.700
Old lady!

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.580
Tell us what the true
identity of DIO's Stand is!

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.790
Tell us!

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.020
You placed your hope and trust in DIO!

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.630
And now you know he's not
the man you thought he was!

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.640
I have to defeat DIO! Please, tell me!

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.220
Tell me! Tell me about DIO's Stand!

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.020
Lord... DIO...

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.550
He believes in me.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.710
I can't tell you...

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.270
Oh, God!

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.860
How sad...

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.160
How truly sad that old woman was.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.320
But the fact that she trusted him so deeply

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.810
shows how powerful Lord DIO's evil charm truly is.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.870
Since Enyaba was connected with my sister's death,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.700
I'm pretty conflicted about this.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.510
But I will kill you.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.940
It'll be four against one,
but we won't hesitate.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.300
Prepare yourself.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.790
Stand up.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.750
Hey, jackass!

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.320
Don't try to act cool at a time like this.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.810
Even if you won't attack us, we're going to fight.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.280
Do as you please.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.080
But none of you will

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.070
be able to even lay a
finger upon me, Dan of Steel.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.070
Smash

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.610
What?!

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.090
Wh-What happened, Mr. Joestar?

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.040
He flew back just like that guy!

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.820
You fool! I was still in the
middle of my explanation.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.920
You were very close to killing
your own grandfather.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.800
Listen carefully.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:15.280
Do you really think I appeared
before you just to kill Enyaba?

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.300
Y-You bastard...

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.530
You said you had the Stand
of the Lovers' card, didn't you?

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.150
Wh-What is that?!

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.950
The battle has already begun, Mr. Joestar.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.830
You fools...

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.450
No matter how hard you look,
you won't be able to find my Stand easily.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.120
Hey, brat.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.090
I'll give you a tip,
so hit my leg with your broom.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.470
I-It can't be...

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.970
Hit me!

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.730
What happened, Mr. Joestar?!

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.860
I-It hurts!

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.730
I don't know what's going on,
but there's tremendous pain...

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.780
You haven't figured it out, Joseph Joestar?

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.370
My Stand goes inside the bodies of others.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:18.370
The moment Enyaba died,
it entered your brain through your ear.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.690
What?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.610
Meaning, the Stand and
myself are one and the same.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.930
If my Stand gets hurt, so do I, and vice versa.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.810
If you so much as scratch me,

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.770
my Stand, which is within your brain,
will react to my pain and suffering

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.560
in that same moment by going berserk.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.820
It will inflict pain several times greater
to the same part of your body.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.940
I'll say it once more...

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.950
You will not be able to
lay a single finger on me!

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.260
Not to mention, The Lovers has
taken Lord DIO's flesh bud into your body.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.580
It's growing within your brain.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.420
Just like Enyaba, it will eat you
from the inside and you will die!

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.720
Ow!

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.520
When did I say you could strike me again?

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.600
You little brat!

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.540
Well, to be honest, my Stand,
The Lovers, is very weak.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.010
It isn't powerful enough to
move even a single strand of hair...

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.970
It is the world's weakest Stand.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.110
But...

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.660
You don't need power to kill humans.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.750
Do you understand, gentlemen?

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.090
The Lovers

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.090
Dan of Steel

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:56.260
If I were to be in a car accident,
hit by a baseball,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.100
or even to trip and fall, Mr. Joestar...

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:05.980
Your body would suffer far
greater damage than mine.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.440
I-I can even feel real pain
in my artificial left hand...

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.710
And in ten minutes,

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.440
your brain will be eaten through,
and you will die like Enyaba.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.760
Jotaro, calm down! Don't do anything stupid.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.880
No. I'm going to kill him so quickly,
he won't have a moment to feel pain.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.220
Without a moment to feel pain, huh...

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.430
That's a great idea.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.190
Let's see you try it, Jotaro.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.680
It sounds fascinating.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.240
What were you planning to destroy?

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.940
Come on! My face? My throat?

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.070
Come on, what's wrong? Just try it!

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.510
Let's just see what happens!

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.200
How about busting a hole through my chest?

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.180
Or how about you give
up on using your Stand,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.620
and crack my head open with a rock?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.970
Here, I'll even get the rock for you.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.710
Is this one big enough?

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.840
You don't want to underestimate me.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.320
When I say I'm going to do something, I do it.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.400
Don't do anything rash, Jotaro!

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.120
You've already seen his powers!

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.400
Are you trying to kill your own grandfather?!

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.730
H-He's the type that might actually do it...

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.910
You aren't taking me seriously.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.930
Oh...?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.080
You...

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.590
Jotaro!

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.750
Don't underestimate me, you bastard.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.440
After the geezer Joestar dies, next it'll be...

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.400
Look out!

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.440
...your brain that I send The Lovers into and kill!

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.000
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.130
H-How can this be?

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.090
My grandson is being beaten up to save me...

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.040
We're completely caught up in his pace.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.100
His Stand is inside my brain...

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.320
When I was younger, there was a time when
poison was placed into my heart, but...

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.240
I must do something... I must do something!

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.490
H-Hey!

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.680
Jotaro! Keep him away from Mr. Joestar!

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.230
We're going to get as far
away from him as possible!

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.720
Oh, I see...

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.120
So you think that if you move far enough away,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.450
my Stand's power will disappear?

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.520
But one's weakness can also be one's strength.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.850
My Stand, The Lovers, may be weak,
but once it is within a body,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.500
I can control it from a distance
far greater than any other Stand.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.650
Even hundreds of kilometers away.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.550
Hey, Jotaro! I'm talking to you!

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.100
What are you looking away so calmly for?

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.180
Look at me!

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.810
You sound like you're starting to lose your cool.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:38.570
Do you plan to follow me until Joseph dies?

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.530
Dan, was it?

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.070
I will definitely make you pay for this.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.420
If that's why you're following me,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.920
maybe I should borrow a little more.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.120
Is this all you have?

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.750
I see that your watch, audaciously
enough, is a TAG Heuer...

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.220
I'll be borrowing this.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.700
There!

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.280
It's an electronics store!
Mr. Joestar, they have TVs!

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.350
H-Hey! What are you trying to do?

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.360
Polnareff, did you think
we were just running away?

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.620
I'm going to fight the
Stand that's inside my head.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.620
F-Fight?!

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.510
We only have a few minutes.
You'll be assisting us.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.370
Huh?!

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.840
Hermit Purple!

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.100
There it is!

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.900
Oh, no!

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.640
How can it be that I had to
see inside my own brain?

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.760
I-I can see now that
there's a really tiny Stand

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.940
inside of you, Mr. Joestar...

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.350
But how do you plan on defeating it?

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:09.780
Your Stand and mine will enter
Mr. Joestar's body, and defeat it there.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.670
Wh-What?!

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.550
Stands are images made of energy.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.380
They should be able to shrink.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.500
Kakyoin!

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.460
Hey, take it easy on me.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.460
There's no time to lose.
We're going in, Polnareff!

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.210
A-All right!

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.240
Hierophant Green!

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.970
Silver Chariot!

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.070
Smaller!

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.100
Get smaller.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.730
We're going to be entering a blood vessel.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.730
R-Right...

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.230
A drainage ditch...

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.990
I could jump across this ditch,

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.760
but if I were to trip and twist my
ankle, it could be dangerous.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.500
It'd be a pain to go all the way
to that bridge over there.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.550
Hey, Jotaro.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.570
Lie down across this ditch
and make yourself into a bridge.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.500
I'll walk over it on you.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.170
What? You're not going to be my bridge?

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.760
What the hell are you talking about?

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:19.230
I said, make yourself into a bridge!
You ridiculous bastard!

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.730
Wh-What's wrong?!

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.480
Mr. Joestar!

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.520
M-My leg...

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.080
I-It's going numb...

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.990
What the hell is Jotaro doing?!

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.000
What's the matter, Jotaro?

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.300
Come on, hurry up.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.470
Good.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.890
You're a rather sturdy bridge, aren't you?

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.600
Aren't you? Aren't you?

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.970
Aren't you?

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.820
Aren't you?

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.230
Aren't you...

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.340
Mr. Joestar,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.160
the enemy's Stand, The Lovers,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.020
is in the brain stem, the point
where the nervous system begins.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.980
Polnareff and I will enter the
vein from inside your ear,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.360
then swim through the blood
vessels toward the brain stem.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.960
Polnareff, open a hole in the
wall of the blood vessel.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.410
H-Hey, hold on a second!
You're using your Stands, right?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.860
Can't you just slip through it?

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.360
At this size, it's not possible.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.500
The blood vessel's wall is too thick.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:05.350
The hole will be microscopic,
so there's no need to worry.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:10.130
Cutting through a blood
vessel or nerve right now

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.890
would take several minutes.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.010
Otherwise, our Stands would have
already cut down the enemy Stand.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.040
Though we may have already started...

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.440
Keeping our Stands this
small is really exhausting.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.740
It requires a lot of Stand power.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.810
Here we go!

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:38.280
Oh, my God! I-I don't feel so well...

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.060
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.820
My back itches...

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.350
I'm in a really good mood right now.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.640
How about I have you lick it for me?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.610
The one who knows himself best will win!

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.100
Everything begins when

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.070
you acknowledge your own weakness!

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.070
Episode 17

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.070
The Lovers, Part 2
