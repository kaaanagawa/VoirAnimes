Previously on Jojo's Bizarre Adventure...

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.780
A Stand has manifested
from Ms. Holly, as well!

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.990
You will not reach Lord DIO!

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.080
But if we fail to meet DIO within fifty days...

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.460
Someone I know has this
exact mark on their neck...

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.630
What?!

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.480
Kaboom

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.370
I've decided to go to Egypt with all of you!

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.700
If I go after DIO,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.020
I'll be able to find the
one who took my sister's life!

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.490
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.490
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.130
Episode 6: Dark Blue Moon

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.760
The loathsome curse of DIO...

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.490
Even the Speedwagon Foundation's doctors,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.740
who have the latest medical technologies,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.970
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.240
stand powerless before DIO's curse.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.970
Egypt

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.510
In order to save Holly, Jojo and
crew head toward faraway Egypt.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.430
Japan

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.290
Hong Kong

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.290
Hanoi

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.750
In order to avoid danger,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.710
Bangkok

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.710
Ho Chi Minh

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.710
they travel by sea rather than air,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.710
heading first to Singapore.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.710
Singapore

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.860
To get from Hong Kong to Singapore,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.930
we'll be on the water for three full days.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.260
Well, let's relax and keep our spirits up.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.270
But seriously, guys...

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.450
Can't you do something
about those school uniforms?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.170
You're going to continue
our journey wearing those?

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.990
Isn't it ridiculously hot?

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.690
Well, we are students...

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.200
And students should behave as students.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.070
But I suppose that sounds like a stretch...

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.830
Hmph.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.330
Hmph! Japanese students are such stiffs.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.150
I see... so this is Bushido.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.940
Once you clear your mind,
even fire seems cool.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.860
But you know, girls won't fall for stiffs like you.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.700
Let go! Let go of me! You big lug!

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.930
Shut up!

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.080
Damn it, let me go! Let me go!

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.080
What a little brat.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.430
Hey, what's going on?

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.180
I thought we agreed there'd
be no passengers on our boat.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.680
Let go!

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.940
I'm sorry. It's a stowaway.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.690
This brat was hiding in storage down below.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.190
A stowaway?

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.700
Come at me if you're gonna!

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.940
I'll kick your balls in!

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.910
I'll turn you in to the naval police.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.450
What? The police?!

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.260
P-Please. Let me go!

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I just want to go see my dad in Singapore.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.790
I'll do anything!
You can work me as hard as you want!

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.400
Let's see. What should I do?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.800
Should I let you go?

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.570
What should I do?

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.570
P-Please!

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.750
What should I do?

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.340
Ow!

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.800
I'm not gonna let you go after all. Hell no.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.850
First, I'm gonna go let the
Captain know, so come wit—

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.700
Whoa! He jumped in! Talk about energetic.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.080
Is he planning to swim to shore from here?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.590
What should we do?

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.010
Just leave 'im.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.930
I'm sure he dove in because
he's a confident swimmer.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.210
Th-This isn't good!
Sharks gather around these parts!

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.760
This isn't good!

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.500
Hey, you brat! Come back!

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.650
Get back here! It's dangerous!

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.430
There are sharks!
Those waters are shark-infested!

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.650
Huh?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.360
Crack!

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.050
Good grief, you little brat.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.770
You're...

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.940
A girl?

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.680
And a little runt of one, at that.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.700
H-How dare you grab my chest like that?!

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.660
Damn it!

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.620
Good grief.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.210
J-Jotaro! Below you!

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.230
Something's attacking from underwater!

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.830
It's not a shark! It's really fast!

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.740
Jotaro! Hurry!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.640
Hurry and swim to the boat!

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.210
I-It's too far.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.160
If it's at that distance, leave it to me.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.320
Hierophant Green!

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.140
I-It disappeared! It's a Stand!

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.500
That thing is a Stand!

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.760
A seafaring Stand...

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.010
I don't believe I've ever
even heard of such a thing.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.490
This girl... Sh-She couldn't be...

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.370
Could she be that Stand's user?

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.040
Could she have led Jojo into the
shark-infested ocean on purpose?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.940
Wh-What's with you jerks,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.130
all glaring at me like that?!

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.490
I don't know what's going on,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.070
but do you want a fight?!

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.890
Don't underestimate me! I'll take you on!

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.800
One-on-one!

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.770
Face me, one-on-one!

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.000
You little shits!

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.910
She can't be serious.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.180
Maybe we should toss
her back into the ocean.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.300
Don't be rash.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.170
If she was really an ordinary stowaway,

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.100
she'd have been eaten by sharks.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.010
I've already checked the
ten people on this boat.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.460
I don't know who it could be,
other than this girl.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.220
Isn't there a way we can
find out who she really is?

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.430
Hey, how's DIO doing?

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.520
DIO? What the hell is that?

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.900
Don't act like you don't know,
you little brat!

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.740
You damn punks!

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.930
Do you want to talk to me,
or do you want to get stabbed?

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.900
Which is it?!

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.460
This demon's blade is telling me that it wants

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.530
the blood of its 340th victim already.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.950
What's so funny, you stupid grunt?!

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.740
Grunt?

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.010
You know, I really don't think it's her.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.210
Yes, but...

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.470
So is this girl our stowaway?

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.880
Captain.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.310
I'm pretty harsh when it comes to stowaways.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.820
O-Ow... Ow...

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.840
You may be a girl,
but if I go easy on you,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.360
we'll just get more and more stowaways.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.560
We're gonna hold you in

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.250
one of the rooms below
deck until we get to port.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.250
Captain, I'd like to ask you something.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.290
You've verified the identities of
all ten of the men on board, right?

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.560
Of course.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.080
All of them are veterans
who have been on this boat

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.920
for over ten years.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.550
I'm not sure why you're so worried about that.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.050
By the way...

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.290
I request that you refrain
from smoking aboard this ship.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.560
What did you plan to do with the
ashes and butt after you're done?

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.030
Were you planning on throwing
it into the beautiful ocean?

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.070
You're a guest on this ship,
but I'll have you follow her rules,

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.070
Mr. Outlaw.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.970
Got it?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.750
Hold it.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.800
If you're going to put it out, just put it out.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.930
Don't be a condescending
prick about it, you jackass.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.810
Hey, Jotaro! Don't be rude to the captain!

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.600
You're the one at fault.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.450
I'm very aware that I'm being rude.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.860
He isn't the captain... I just figured it out.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.240
He's the Stand user!

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240
Wh...

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.490
What?!

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.170
Sta... nd?

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.000
What might that be...?

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.080
That's inconceivable, Jotaro.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.290
Captain Dragon came recommended with
verification by the Speedwagon Foundation.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.010
He's someone we should trust.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.510
There is a 0% chance that he's a Stand user.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:14.010
Hold on, a Stand? I have no
idea what you're talking about...

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.320
Jojo, random guesses will only
make things more confusing!

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.450
Do you have any proof, Jojo?

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.030
I've found a way to differentiate
Stand users from other people.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.080
What?!

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.930
That is...

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.150
If a Stand user inhales even a
little bit of cigarette smoke,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.790
a vein pops up on the tip of their nose.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.040
What the hell are they all doing?

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.380
You can't be serious, Jotaro!

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.790
Yeah, I'm lying.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.630
But it looks like we've found the idiot.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:11:01.140
Menacing

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.460
Jotaro, how did you know he was suspicious?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.840
Actually, I didn't think he was at all.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.400
Huh?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.410
But I planned to try this
with all of the men on board.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.830
You're cold. Damn, but you're cold.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.330
You're right. I'm not the captain.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.850
The real captain is already sleeping with the

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.170
fishes at the ocean's bottom back in Hong Kong.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.670
Then you can sleep at the bottom of Hell!

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.550
Grab

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.970
Damn it!

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.200
Splash

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.390
I-I can't move...

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.860
Trouble on the water!
Lies and betrayal!

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.340
The Moon card, which suggests
fear of the unknown.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.240
Its name: Dark Blue Moon!

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.960
If I tried to take five of you at once,
even I'd break a bone or two,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.990
so I was going to hide my identity
and take care of you one by one...

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.580
But if you've figured me out,
I guess I have no choice.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.370
I'll have to take on all five of you!

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.320
Getting my hands on this girl is a sign

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.680
that my luck is changing for the better!

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.240
I'm going to jump into these
shark-infested waters with her.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.360
Of course, you guys will end up following us in.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.710
If we fight in the water,

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.600
where I have the advantage,
I can beat all five of you.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.020
Don't underestimate me by taking a hostage!

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.610
Don't think that I, Jotaro Kujo,
will be shaken by this!

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.780
Underestimate? No, this is a prediction!

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.620
I hear that your Stand,
Star Platinum, is pretty damn fast.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.990
I'm not trying to brag,

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.670
but my Dark Blue Moon
is pretty fast in the water.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.880
It can swim more elegantly
than any fish in the sea!

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.450
Why don't we test them out?

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.130
Follow me... if you're prepared to
choke to death on all the seawater

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.630
you're about to swallow.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.260
Crush

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:19.410
H-He attacked faster than we
could fall... That's impossible...

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.890
You're the only one who's
going to choke on seawater.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.080
Avdol, say something.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.690
You tried to out-predict me, a fortune teller...

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.480
...but it's ten years too early for you.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.010
Star Platinum

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.010
Jotaro Kujo

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.430
He's drifting away.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.890
He sure talked up his Stand's powers,

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.940
but it looks like he was just an idiot.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.920
Jotaro, what's wrong?
Hurry and lift up the girl!

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.200
What's wrong, Jotaro?!

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.850
D-Damn it... I'm being pulled in...

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.450
Th-These are...

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.800
Acorn barnacles!
The crustaceans called acorn barnacles!

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.340
They're all over Star Platinum's
arm and on the side of the boat!

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.910
He's still planning on fighting.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.790
He attached them to me earlier,
when I hit him.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.820
They keep multiplying!

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.080
My Stand's strength is being drained...

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.570
H-He suddenly disappeared.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.440
The captain, he's nowhere to be found!

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.430
Jotaro! Bring in your Stand!

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.020
I can't,

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.870
which is why I'm sweating way
more than I want to right now!

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.280
Jojo!

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.280
Jotaro!

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.370
Shoom

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.370
Jojo!

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.960
C-Crap!

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.090
Th-This isn't good!

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.110
Welcome! Welcome!

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.770
So you've finally come to where
Dark Blue Moon reigns supreme,

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.620
the undersea realm.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.040
It's a bad idea to underestimate me, boy.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.680
Even in the ocean,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.280
the Stands can still communicate, so go ahead.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.320
Try to sound all cocky, like you did earlier.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.010
Go ahead, boy!

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.970
So what do you want to be?

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.980
Tell me what kind of fish dish you want to be.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.590
Fish cakes? Or maybe sashimi?

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.230
I'll make a meal out of your Stand.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:02.020
You fool... You're trying to sound tough, boy,

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.870
but inside, this is what you're thinking:

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.300
"How long can he stay underwater?"

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.420
"I can probably last about two minutes,

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.380
but can he last longer than me?"

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.920
Let me answer you.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.680
My lung capacity is three times
greater than a normal person's!

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.030
And I've trained them.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.290
My best time underwater is
6 minutes and 21 seconds!

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.680
I'm sure you're getting dizzy
just hearing that number.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.600
And!

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.430
Dark Blue Moon's fins are

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.650
underwater cutters that move
sharper than a ship's propeller!

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.500
Before you get overconfident again,

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.200
take a good, hard look at your Stand!

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:52.700
The acorn barnacles I attached to it will
keep absorbing your power to propagate.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.100
I'm sure you can feel your power draining away.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.110
Trying to run away by swimming back up?

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.720
Take a good look around you!

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.300
Haven't you realized that
Dark Blue Moon has been

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.340
creating an underwater whirlpool, boy?

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.250
Swim! Swim!

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.900
It's gonna get harder to breathe,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.310
and your power is still draining!

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.910
But it's too early to kill a

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.530
self-absorbed little brat like you just yet!

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.360
I-It's been too long!
He's still not coming up!

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.810
A whirlpool!

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.900
There's a giant whirlpool!

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.830
Where the hell is Jojo?!

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.430
Let's go save him!

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.800
Th-These are scales!

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.510
Th-That guy's Stand has
scales as sharp as razors!

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.600
There are countless scales
swirling in that whirlpool.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.730
He wasn't bluffing when he
said he could beat all five of us.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.100
That whirlpool is like a watery ant lion pit!

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.600
It's very possible we could all die if we dive in.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.360
H-His scales?

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.850
And now I'm going to guess
what you're thinking next!

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.350
"In a whirlpool, only one spot stays still."

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:16.830
So mundane!

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.910
"It's the center!"

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.750
"If I jump into the center
where he is, I can attack him."

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.880
That's what you're thinking, isn't it?

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.680
If you think you can hit me
with that punch of yours again,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.470
come at me.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.720
Come at me with your worthless Stand,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.580
its power drained by the acorn barnacles.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.450
See if you can manage an attack

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:42.080
that's even sharper than these
underwater cutters, boy!

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.070
C-Curses... It's too reckless to act.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.070
It's Jojo!

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.420
I could see Jojo in the whirlpool!

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.310
This isn't good!

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.120
He was limp!

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.190
Limp? He wasn't struggling at all?

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.330
That might be a good thing.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.290
What?

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.710
How dare you say you were
going to turn me into sashimi?!

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.800
The one that's going to be
sliced up like sashimi is...

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.810
Star Finger!

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:21.440
Wha...

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.150
Slice

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.400
The one who was turned
into sashimi was you, after all.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.160
Blub, blub, blub, blub...

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.870
What's that? I can't hear you
very well since we're underwater.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.160
Speak up!

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.260
But your power was being drained...

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.550
You let yourself go limp on purpose

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.030
to concentrate your power in your fingers...

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.920
Th-That's what you were thinking...

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.590
Nope. What I was thinking was...

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.880
If you pissed yourself when you lost,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.750
it'd be gross since we're in the water,

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.810
old man.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.130
Jojo!

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.780
That's my grandson for you!

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.990
Well done, Jotaro! Hurry and come u—

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.230
Th-That captain had
planted some bombs after all!

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.160
Damn it!

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.350
Hurry up and get the emergency boats out!

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.340
We'll signal a nearby boat for help!

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.030
Dark Blue Moon

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.030
Fake Captain Dragon

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.350
Have some water.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.450
We've sent signals for help,
so someone should be here soon.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:20.350
I don't know what in the world is
going on, but who are you people?

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.010
We're hurrying along a journey, just like you.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.590
Though you're on a journey to see your father,

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.860
while I'm on one for my daughter.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.900
Pbbt

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.600
Hey! That's our precious water!

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.420
How dare you spit it out?!

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.780
N-No... E-E...

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.290
E-E-E-E-E...

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.400
Everyone, look!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.010
Next Episode Preview

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.400
What is this boat?

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.100
The ramp's down, so why
hasn't anyone shown their face?

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.310
There are no signs of life.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.600
I'm all sticky from the salt water...

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.390
So that's what this means...

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.030
You think you've won...

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 7:

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Strength
