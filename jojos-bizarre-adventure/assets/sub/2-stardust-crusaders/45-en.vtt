So we finally meet,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.920
DIO!

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.370
Congratulations, Polnareff.
You've avenged your sister,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.750
and managed to travel from
the Far East to make it here.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.600
If you want to give me a prize for that,
how about you give me your life?

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.820
I shall give you a chance.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.570
Go down two steps,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.160
and I'll let you join my side again.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.490
But if you'd rather die,
then climb those stairs.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.780
When I first met you,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.780
I succumbed from the bottom of my heart
to your spell of fear and immense evil.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.620
That was when I became a loser.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.800
It's much scarier than death,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.930
living with no desire but to do your bidding.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
But right now, I don't feel any fear at all.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.170
I feel only my will to fight.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.350
Since I met Mr. Joestar and the others,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.500
this journey of 45 days
and the death of my friends

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.410
have completely blown away my fear of you.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.730
Is that so?

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.450
Then climb those stairs.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.740
I see, Polnareff.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.060
You've gone down the stairs,
which means you wish to join me, DIO.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.650
Wh-What?! I know I just took a step up...

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.240
What's the matter? You're losing
your composure, Polnareff.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.160
Doesn't one lose his
composure when he is afraid?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.940
Or is it that in your heart,
you know you must climb up,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.080
but you're so terrified that your body

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.440
subconsciously did the opposite and went down?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.900
Impossible! I know I went up the stairs!

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.930
Wh-What did he do?! Is it his Stand?

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.700
I-It can't be...

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.650
DIO's Stand...

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.570
The World?!

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.300
Wh-What is...

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.930
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.930
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.640
Episode 45  DIO's World, Part 1

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.500
Polnareff, have you ever considered
why humans wish to live?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.750
Humans live hoping to conquer
their anxieties and fears,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.410
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.960
and attain peace of mind.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.440
Seeking fame,

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.800
controlling others,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.010
and acquiring wealth are all
done to achieve peace of mind.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.430
Marriage and friendship are also pursued
as means of attaining peace of mind.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.890
When humans say they wish to help others,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.060
or that a thing is done for love or justice...

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.840
It's all merely to give themselves peace of mind.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.670
To achieve peace of mind
is the goal of all mankind.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.700
Now, given that, what anxiety could
you possibly feel toward serving me?

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.100
Any other peace of mind
will come easily if you do.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.470
Doesn't challenging me, even knowing
that it may spell your death,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.170
bring you anxiety?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.800
I-It can't be! Am I subconsciously
submitting to him?

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.650
You are a very capable Stand user.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.370
It's a waste to kill you.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.940
Why not cut ties with Joestar and the others,

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.350
and serve me for eternity?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.950
I can promise you peace of mind for eternity.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.440
I can't go on like this...

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.030
Avdol, Iggy... Give me courage!

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.770
Y-You talk too much, DIO!

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.570
I've already died once.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.330
I won't die again until I figure out
the identity of your Stand!

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.380
You leave me no choice.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.770
Then you'll just have to die, Polnareff!

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.680
So that's The World? Bring it on!

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.140
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.790
M-Mr. Joestar!

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.280
Don't worry, Polnareff.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.830
DIO!

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.830
That was DIO, wasn't it?

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.180
We're going after him!

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.510
Before you go after him, let me say this.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.750
I just experienced his Stand, just for a moment.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.530
Actually, it wasn't so much an experience...
It was completely beyond my understanding.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.010
I-I'll tell you exactly what happened.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.190
I thought I was climbing the stairs
toward him, but before I knew it,

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.890
I was actually going down!

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.640
I-I'm sure you guys don't
understand what I'm saying,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.320
and I don't know what he did, either.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.300
I thought I was going insane.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.830
It wasn't anything simple,
like hypnosis or super speed...

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.700
I experienced something much more terrifying.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.390
Where are Avdol and Iggy?

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.910
Th-They didn't make it...

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.660
They died saving me.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.500
I see.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.290
Mr. Joestar, the sun is setting.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.070
We must hurry.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.530
You're right.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.430
Hey, Nukesaku. What's above this floor?

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.040
A-A tower.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.400
There is a single room at the very top.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.460
Lord DIO stays there during the day.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.660
Do any other staircases lead up to that tower?

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.490
N-No. These stairs are the only way.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.190
All right. Lead the way.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.600
So that's him.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.680
The man we're about to face

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.580
is one I've never met,
yet one I've known for so long.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.400
Yes. I have always known him.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.970
I've known him since the day I was born.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.270
The same goes for Jotaro.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.620
He's not someone we have fond memories of.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.650
Our Joestar blood always knew that

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.320
he was someone we would encounter
one day, someone we must defeat.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.300
I have no regrets.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.290
The journey we've made,
the events about to transpire...

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.330
I regret none of it.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.730
What I'm feeling right now
tells me the side I'm on is white.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.520
DIO's side is black.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.660
Mr. Joestar and the others, too, are white.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.190
Despite my injuries, I can
feel my courage growing.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.170
I am on the white side,
the side of righteousness!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.210
Once he steps out of the coffin, we'll attack.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.700
But be careful.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.100
There's no guarantee that he's in there.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.630
Nukesaku, open the lid.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.890
L-Lord DIO, I promise, I did not betray you.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:40.280
It's because I truly believe in
your power that I led them here.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.840
As certain as when you piss in a
strong wind, it'll get on your pants!

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.110
Please understand!

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.590
Shut up and open it already!

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.290
Make sure you kill these bastards,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.170
Lord DIO!

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.530
He's going to come flying out!

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.180
Huh?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.510
Me?!

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.270
I-I was the one inside?!

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.870
But I was the one that opened the lid!

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.810
Wh-What?! How?!

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.110
I never took my eyes off him!

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.710
Did any of you see the
moment Nukesaku entered...

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.700
No, was put into the coffin?

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.190
N-No... I was watching the whole time,

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.950
but when I realized it, he was already inside!

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:39.000
It's as Polnareff said!
This is not merely a trick or super speed!

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.370
We're in danger.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.270
Something here is truly dangerous!

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.460
Run!

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.010
D-Damn it!

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.670
What are you doing, Polnareff?

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.680
Damn it!

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.880
What in the world was that?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.960
I didn't actually see it, but it felt much

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.040
more powerful than any Stand
we've encountered so far.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.740
It was like knowing a bulldozer is present
from the sound of its engine alone.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.520
I felt it, too. It was incredible murderous intent!

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.520
It felt like someone stuck an icicle up my ass!

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.500
If we had stayed in there,
we would've been killed, one by one!

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.890
This is bad... This is extremely bad.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.150
The sun's almost out of sight!

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.760
His time has come.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.290
Don't tell me that we're

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.280
going to be helpless until sunrise tomorrow.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.480
I'll telling you now, Mr. Joestar!

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.040
There's no way I'm going to run away now!

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.460
I agree with Polnareff.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.810
I feel the same way,
but the situation has changed.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.170
We've encountered his Stand, The World,

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.690
but we have no idea what it does.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.380
When climbing a mountain,
if you don't know the route,

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.750
or where the summit is,

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.730
you are guaranteed to get lost. Guaranteed!

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.710
It's as inevitable as belching
after you drink a cola.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.850
We know DIO will come after us.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.160
He'll try to finish us before sunrise.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.420
In that time, we'll have
the opportunity to figure out

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.830
his Stand's true ability.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.580
We have to wait for that chance.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.230
No! I can't run away!

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.820
Avdol and Iggy died for me!

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.040
I'll do underhanded things,
and even go to Hell itself,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.430
but I will not run away!

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.620
Wait, Polnareff!

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.770
It's no use trying to stop him, old man.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.890
Jotaro, tell us what you think we should do.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.270
Polnareff is fighting him as he pursues him.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.280
We'll fight him as we retreat.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.900
That means

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.280
we'll be in position for a pincer attack.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.660
Hey, you there.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.210
I want to buy that truck. Sell it to me.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.970
What'd you say? I need this to do my job!

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.030
What're you—

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.340
I'm flooring it, Kakyoin!

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.720
There you are, DIO!

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.280
Run away until sunrise? Like hell I can do that!

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.310
I'll finish you myself if I must!

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.600
If I don't know what your Stand is,
then even without that knowledge,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.000
there are still plenty of ways to beat you.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.140
I'll assassinate you!

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.500
Don't do anything rash, Polnareff!

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.140
I told them to leave someone
as stubborn as you alone,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.260
but the old man and Kakyoin
insisted that I stay with you.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.470
So here I am.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.270
Jotaro...

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.410
Good grief.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.980
The World

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.250
Ah, the automobile...

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.580
Its power and speed are impressive.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.750
In my day, we had only horse-drawn carriages.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.920
Hey! What do you think you're touching?

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.140
This car belongs to Senator Phillips!

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.300
Do you wanna puke from your eyes?!

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:17.770
My, my... Young folks are
so hot-blooded these days.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.570
Ow!

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.660
Shut up and get in the front seat.
You're going to drive.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.130
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.920
Do you think you're going
to get away with this?!

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.090
No, of course he won't!

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.130
No one could get away with doing this to me.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.600
I graduated high school and
college at the top of my class!

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.180
I was captain of my college wrestling team!

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.300
Even after I graduated,
I was respected and revered.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.720
That's how I became a politician!

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.880
I have a villa on a thousand acres in Hawaii!

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.940
I married a beautiful model
who's 25 years younger than me!

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.420
I pay 50 times more in taxes
than ordinary people!

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.900
I've defeated every enemy that I've faced.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:03.410
I'll eventually become president.
I am Senator Phillips!

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.120
Listen up, young buck!

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.530
You'll get life in prison for this!

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.730
You hear me? Life in prison—

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.160
I'll say it once more.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.590
Drive.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.760
Wh-Who the hell is he? He's going to kill me!

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.330
If I don't escape, he'll kill me!

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.890
If I don't escape, he </i>will<i> kill me!

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.570
Help... me?

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.250
Wh-What?!

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.950
Wh-What?!

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:42.170
I thought I jumped outside,
so wh-why... why... am I inside...

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.630
Why am I inside?

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.280
Floor it until you catch up to that truck.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.040
If you fail to catch up to it, I'll kill you.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.900
Y-Yes, sir.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.620
Why inside?! Why?!

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.750
I know! It's because I'm a senator!

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.050
There's nothing a senator can't do!

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.820
The black atmosphere that emanates
from him is still close...

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.860
It's coming after us.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.810
<i>He's</i> coming after us!

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.610
Can DIO tell exactly where you are, Mr. Joestar?

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.940
No. His body is that of my
grandfather, Jonathan Joestar.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.690
We can sense each other due to something
like a strange wavelength between us,

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.330
but we can only tell that the
other is close, not where he is.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:40.420
I couldn't tell exactly where the mansion was,
either, even though we were nearby.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:45.750
All he can sense is that a Joestar is nearby.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.560
He can't tell the difference
between Jotaro and myself.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.260
He shouldn't be able to realize that
Jotaro and I have split up.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.810
That's strange...

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.400
In movies, the engine always starts right up.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.910
W-We're stuck in traffic.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.900
Rush hour traffic in the
evening is bumper to bumper.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.890
Go.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.290
You say that, but I can't move forward.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.250
The sidewalk is wide enough. Go.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.190
The sidewalk?!

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.810
It's packed with people heading home from work!

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.670
That makes no difference. Go.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.930
Y-Yes, sir!

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.120
Floor it.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.720
Yes, sir!

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.880
It started. Hurry up and get on, Polnareff.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.270
R-Right...

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.310
I've gone to such lengths for you!

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:56.200
You'll spare my life... You'll spare
this senator's life now, won't you?!

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:57.580
No.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.110
I see! This is a dream!

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.840
A senator like me could never die this way.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.840
It's a dream! A dream! Hooray!

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.140
There he is. Get closer to them. Closer.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.170
If I'm not close, I cannot use The World.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.890
He's getting closer. It's that car! DIO's in there!

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.220
Kakyoin!

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.990
Kakyoin's...

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.360
Take this, DIO! Emerald Splash!

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.930
Wh-What is he?!

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.100
He didn't so much as move from his seat,

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.100
but he managed to dodge with just one finger!

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.560
How about this?!

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.690
Even when I concentrated the Splash,
he dodged. D-Damn it!

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.570
When did he release his Stand?

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.900
Impossible! How could I not notice?!

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.870
He was a bit too far away.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.160
He went flying out of The World's range.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.420
Wh-What's happening?!

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.550
Would it benefit me in any way if I told you?

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.150
Keep your eyes forward and drive.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.580
Careful, Kakyoin! You got too close to him!

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.560
I-I apologize. I-I couldn't help it.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.750
A few months ago, he said,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.980
"There's no need to make
yourself vomit from fright."

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.570
"Relax. Relax, Kakyoin..."

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.580
Damn it! Never again! I will never lose again!

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.340
Kakyoin, are you all right?
Did you see The World?

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.720
Yes... I attacked from around ten meters away.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.610
If I had gotten any closer,
I would have been done for.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.840
It's obvious that his Stand

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.330
has some terrifying secret far
beyond anything we can imagine.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.220
But I've managed to figure out two things.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.920
First, it can't attack over distance like
Hierophant Green and Hermit Purple.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.800
It's a close-range power type, like Star Platinum.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.960
Its range is about ten meters.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.170
Second, it attacked with its fist.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.250
So it doesn't use ranged attacks, like bullets.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.890
If we can get within ten meters
of DIO without him noticing,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.160
I think we may have a chance of defeating him.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.660
We need to investigate carefully.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.190
There's no such thing as being too
cautious when it comes to him.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.760
That's strange. His car stopped.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.100
Watch out! Something's flying at us!

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.960
Mr. Joestar!

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.460
What are you doing, Kakyoin?

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.940
I've got it.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.300
I've figured out a way to reveal
what DIO's Stand truly is.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.970
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.190
I wonder why I get goosebumps
when I think about Avdol and Iggy.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.420
Perhaps because they were the first
friends I shared a common goal with.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.030
This journey to defeat DIO...

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.030
Show me your Stand, DIO!

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
