00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.990
Have your wounds healed, Avdol?

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.270
Yes. But I'm much happier
that you'll be all right, Kakyoin.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.470
So I will.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.500
He didn't cut my pupils,
so I've been told it will heal soon.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.790
In junior high, one of my
classmates was hit by a baseball

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.640
so hard that his eye was mashed in,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.770
but he was fine by the next day.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.680
It was just fluid leaking out of his eyeball.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.130
Seriously?

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.260
No!

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.470
In a few days, I can take off my bandages.
I'll catch up with you then.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.010
We're less than 800 kilometers
from DIO's lair in Cairo.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.260
Everyone, please continue on, and be careful.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.140
Hmm, the numbers on this receipt from
the hospital... Are they Arabic numbers?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.290
It's so confusing.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.080
This 0 is actually 5, right? And this
dot is actually zero, and this 7 is a 6?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.340
And this wormy-looking one is...

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.460
A 4. So, the amount we owe is...

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.890
46,350 Egyptian pounds?!

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.860
That's expensive!

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.720
How cute!

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.340
What's with this puppy?

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.570
It's so unique.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.480
What in the world? He's chewing gum.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.340
Is he waiting for someone?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.980
He's so well-behaved.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.900
And here I thought he
was just waiting outside.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.640
Good grief.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.480
He's a hit with chicks!

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390
I wonder why he's chewing gum.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.010
What a strange puppy.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.870
Um, hello?

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.330
Let me give you some advice.
You'd best get away from that dog.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.670
He may seem charming,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.040
but in general, he hates people.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.560
If you let your guard down,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.800
you'll regre—

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.090
D-Damn mutt! G-Get off of m—

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.780
I-It stinks!

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.230
Oh, goodness! It farted!

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.410
So cute!

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.970
You get along so well.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.360
W-We don't get along at all!

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.960
Damn it, Iggy! Get off of me!

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.440
We're heading in, you lovebirds.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.070
M-Mr. Joestar?!

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.030
Hey, hang on!

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.740
Y-Y-You...

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.990
You shitty little dog!

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.250
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.250
Stardust Crusaders

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.990
Episode 28  Anubis, Part 1

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.280
They say the ancient Egyptians
always buried their dead

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.460
beyond the Nile's boundary,
where the sun sets.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.420
That's why the whole city is
on the east side of the Nile.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.260
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.760
All structures built on the west
side involve graves and the dead.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.860
But our enemies don't
care about east or west.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.950
They'll attack from every direction.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.850
Man, your cow is so lazy.
She's pretty strong, though...

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.240
Hey, Chaka! Hurry up and walk!

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.020
Stop wasting time!

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.550
Damn it! He's so worthless.
Who the hell do you take after?

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.470
The cow and the kid both look just like you!

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.220
A sword?

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.290
What's it doing here?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.390
Hey, look! It's a sword!

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.480
Give it here!

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.410
What? Did someone drop it?

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.400
Who drops a sword?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.160
This is amazing! It looks pretty expensive.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.210
Hey, maybe the owner's around somewhere.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.410
I bet he's in a panic if he dropped this.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.450
Maybe it's just some antique
that's been lying around.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.760
Should we take it to the cops?

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.370
Idiot! We could make a fortune if we sold it.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.920
But I'm the one who found it...

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.310
If it's just a replica, it's worthless.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.860
Come on! Hurry up and draw it.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.840
Right!

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.430
What's wrong?

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.190
I-It won't come out! It won't budge at all!

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.560
Give it to me.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.360
Here.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.380
Hold that end.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.190
Right.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.240
I-It's no use. The blade isn't even showing at all!

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.500
Let me try, too.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.320
Shut it! If I can't do it,
there's no way you could, idiot!

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.340
M-My hand!

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.990
My hand!

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.220
M-My hand! My hand's been cut!

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.040
What cut my hand?!

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.370
The blade wouldn't even come out!

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.550
I haven't touched anything but its hilt!

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.480
What a creepy sword...

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.300
Hey! Let me try to get the sword out, too!

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.260
Shut up! If you want to try, then just do it!

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.810
I-It came out so easily.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.080
I didn't even have to pull hard.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.050
But...

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.380
I can hear the blade ringing...

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.620
I-I'm no expert on swords or anything,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.500
but I've never seen a blade this beautiful.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.550
It looks like a Japanese sword!

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.700
It's as if the blade were wet...

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.900
What an amazing find!

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.940
Hey! Give it here!
You shouldn't be holding it!

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.360
Give it to me!

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.450
H-Hey, wha...

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.930
What... What did you do?!

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.180
I-I don't know...

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.040
Y-You were standing behind me, Dad.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.030
I-It's not my fault...

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.030
What the hell are you doing?! Hurry!

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.270
Hurry up and take him to a doctor!

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.970
Slice

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.750
Th-There's something weird about this sword!

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.100
It's like it's got a mind of its own!

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.910
Calm down.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.360
Calm down, Chaka.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.710
It is nothing.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.760
Nothing at all, Chaka...

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.680
Wh-Who are you?

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.350
I can hear a voice from somewhere...

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.300
My name is Anubis.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.150
I am the Stand whose card

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.800
suggests the God of the Dead
and the guardian of the graveyard.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.220
You unsheathed me.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.490
<i>You shall become my user...</i>

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.490
Yes, you are my user!

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.680
You have become an expert...

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.910
<i>You are an expert in swordsmanship.</i>

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.150
You are stronger than anyone.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.940
Wield me, and kill!

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.610
Both he and Dad deserved to die.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.870
I feel like slicing you up, too.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.240
Wh-What? H-Hey, Chaka, stop!

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.330
Please stop!

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.130
Swoosh

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:43.130
I-Impossible! But the cow's not hurt...!

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.870
Kill Joestar! Chop up Polnareff!

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.290
Slice Jotaro in half!

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.320
You are an expert! A master swordsman!

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.830
You are stronger than anyone
and can cut anything!

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.400
Kom Ombo?

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.710
Do we really have time to stop here?

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.410
Stop griping.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.710
As long as they let us ride
the ferry, we can't complain.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.220
Man, I'm starving!
Let's get something to eat.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.430
You're so loud. Here.
For now, that'll have to do.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.510
That's for Iggy!

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.350
Well, don't worry about it. Just take it.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.770
By the way, where's the restroom?

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.210
Let's go look for one.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.570
Hey, mister, over here.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.030
Want some papyrus?

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.030
Papyrus is what paper's made of.
Why not buy some as a memento?

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.320
Look, look! It's the real thing!

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.640
Papyrus?

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.200
I'll sell it cheap.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.530
It's totally the real thing?

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.080
You betcha. This piece was made
by a famous Egyptian craftsman.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.950
Hm...

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.990
This is a fake. If it were real,
it wouldn't rip so easily.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.100
I know these things.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.100
Huh?

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.600
Where did Mr. Joestar and the others go?

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:21.980
Huh?

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.110
Iggy?! Why, you little... Hold it!

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.880
Hey! Pay for this!

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.440
That stupid dog totally gave me the slip...

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:43.560
Menacing

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:20.990
Hey.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.720
You've got some balls,

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.300
to attack with so many people around.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.970
It's unusual, too.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.970
You guys usually don't let us see you,
or attack us head-on.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.620
That's pretty manly.
I didn't think any of you were like that.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.560
Identify yourself.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.730
My name is Chaka.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.640
I am the user of the Stand which
suggests the God of Death, Anubis.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.160
Jean Pierre Polnareff,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.410
I will take your life.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.960
"I will take your life"?
That's a pretty straightforward line.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.510
You're a tougher, more manly enemy than I thought.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.560
Come at me with that Anubis Stand of yours!

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.810
Chariot!

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.540
He's got a sword, but...

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.590
Does he plan to fight me with that
sword instead of using his Stand?

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.300
Something's wrong.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.480
The way he moves... The way
he wields the sword, his stance...

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.600
He's a complete amateur!
But something's not right.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.570
This isn't good.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.810
I should keep my distance.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.000
Anubis

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.000
Chaka

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.060
Wh-What the hell?

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.790
The sword passed through the pillar.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.020
And my shirt isn't cut!

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.810
He somehow cut just me, but not my shirt!

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.480
If I hadn't kept my distance, I'd be dead now.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.150
You bastard! Chariot!

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.070
Stop hiding, and show yourself!

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.710
C-Crap...

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.730
What the hell? I lost him.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.680
I-I don't know which pillar he went behind.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.690
That Stand can phase through
matter to cut its target.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.190
My Chariot is only able to strike at
a bit more than a meter, at best...

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.520
Damn it. He's got me at a disadvantage.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.570
Attacking me, Polnareff, with a sword and
getting a hit in... You've got some nerve.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.620
But this is the end of
you and your confidence.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.250
Well, Chakster, how about this?

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.580
Bring it on!

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.140
All I have to do is stay away from the pillars!

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.440
You're not gonna pop up out
of the ground at me, are ya?!

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.630
What?!

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.730
The pillar...

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.800
I can do more than just pass through them!
I can cut the pillars themselves in half, too!

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.400
Die, Polnareff!

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.920
Th-That was close.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.010
That's Chariot's secret technique,
which not even Jojo knows about.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.680
Launching the blade like that...

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.690
I only have one blade. If an opponent
dodged that, I'd be unarmed.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.840
So I only use that attack
when I'm in real trouble.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.860
Well, I guess he's not dead.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.010
Definitely down for the count, though.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.580
That's strange...

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.330
The sword's still in its scabbard.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.270
Did it just slip back in by chance?

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:35.180
Now that I see this sword up close,

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.700
it's really beautiful.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.860
I think I'll pull it out more...

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.630
Hey, Polnareff. There you are.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.040
You went off by yourself, so we were worried.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.640
What if the enemy attacked you?

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.210
Polnareff?

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.190
Huh? O-Oh. It's you, Mr. Joestar.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.750
I'm not sure if it's because

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.820
I turned around too quick, or because
of my wound, but I feel so out of it.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.590
Polnareff, why are you crouching?

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:18.980
Did you step on a turd?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.570
What? You've got a sword...
Did something happen?

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:28.760
Yeah... A stupid guy decided to attack me.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.340
What? The enemy?!

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.580
It's over now.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.330
He said he was the Stand Anubis's user.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.000
He was an expert swordsman, able
to phase through objects and cut them.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:43.300
He was a powerful enemy.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:48.340
"Of course, he definitely wasn't as strong as me,"

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.600
Polnareff thought to himself.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.720
He attacked me with this swor—

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.020
Huh?

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.730
It's gone?!

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.060
Mice! Mice are trying to take the sword!

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.230
Hey!

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.120
Talk about creepy...

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.950
So thieving mice living down here?

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.470
If you're gonna steal,
steal some damn cheese!

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.210
How strange...

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.170
Now the sword is in so tight,
I can't get it out.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.900
Polnareff!

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.320
I'm glad that you're safe,
but we should always travel in pairs.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.420
Be careful!

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.470
Our enemy won't hesitate to
attack anyone who's found alone.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.140
Oh, no! That's our ship's whistle.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.960
Let's hurry back. We're going to Edfu today.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.610
Wait. Hey!

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.870
Polnareff...

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.490
What are you going to do with that sword?

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.040
I'm going to hand it over to the police,
since it's clearly a dangerous weapon.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.060
Yes, that would be best.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.560
If you left it in those ruins,
you don't know who might pick it up.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.380
It looks valuable, too.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.980
Hey, Iggy! Quiet!

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.810
What if we get thrown out?

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.520
What the hell is with you today?

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.970
Well, the damn dog won't shut up.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.530
I guess I should take care of it now.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.740
Polnareff! I thought we told
you not to go off on your own!

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:37.210
I just told you! Jotaro, go with him.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.050
Right.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.680
Hey. Shouldn't we get to the police station?

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.520
Oh, come on!

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.270
A man's got to look his best, right?

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.850
Oh, right.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.710
Hey, Pops, would you put
this sword over there?

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.610
Sure.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.270
No matter how you look at it,
it's clearly a dangerous weapon.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.120
I was rolling around so much yesterday

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.180
that this handsome nice guy got all dirty.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.070
Make me shine, Pops.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.780
Sure.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.160
Ow! Ow...!

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.450
Hey, Pops! That razor's dull.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.970
Sharpen that thing!

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.460
This ought to be the best part of a haircut!

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.090
Good grief. You're such a whiner.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.170
Really? Sorry about that.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.990
Good!

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:22.100
Now it's cutting good and close. Feels nice.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.780
That's so... good to hear.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.830
Très bien! Très bi-e-n!

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.160
Could you get under my chin, too?

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.320
Sure.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.270
Right here... underneath your chin, correct?

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.760
Right under your chin! Right, Polnareff?!

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.250
What?!

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.270
It's me, you fool.
The Stand that represents Anubis!

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.970
Grr, grr!

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.600
The sword itself is a Stand!

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.730
I won't lose to someone I've faced before!

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:32.860
He's strong...

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.650
The more I fight him,
the faster his attacks become.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.370
The look in Polnareff's eyes...

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.030
I'll have your head!

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 29

Anubis, Part 2
