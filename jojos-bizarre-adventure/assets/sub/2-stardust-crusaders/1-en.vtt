00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.490
— 1983: The Canary Islands, Off the Northwest African Coast —

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.830
W-We did it!

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.220
We finally pulled up the treasure chest
that sank one hundred years ago!

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.020
All right! Careful now!

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.640
Keep calm! Just bring it this way...

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.640
I know! I know!

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.520
Up we go.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.900
Isn't it a bit long and narrow
to be a treasure chest?

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.110
Hey! You're lifting it too high!

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.160
Okay, I'm putting it down.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.290
One, two, three!

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.010
All right! H-Hurry up and pry it open.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.780
Wait. Th-This is bizarre.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.040
This box is locked from the inside.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.730
Who the hell cares? Bust it open!

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.970
Just hang on! There's something written on it.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.920
D-I-O... DIO.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.230
Is it a name?

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.670
What the hell does it matter?!

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.540
The sun's going to set soon.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.960
Once it gets dark, we won't
be able to see anything!

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.630
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.690
Okay, I'll go get the blowtorch.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.820
Let's say hello to our treasure!

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.320
One day, an unmanned
cabin cruiser was spotted.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.980
The boat was in perfect working order,
and there were no signs of an attack.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.820
Aboard, there were only
three half-full cups of coffee,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.240
and...

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.700
On deck, a steel box, which had been
opened with an acetylene torch.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.690
The box was empty,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.590
and strangely, it had two compartments,
as if designed to shelter something.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.030
It was thought to have contained treasure,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.840
but after a few months, it was forgotten.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.130
Jotaro Kujo, 17 years old.
Height: 195 centimeters.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.240
His father is Japanese, and a jazz musician.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.570
1987: Japan

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.450
He's currently on tour.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.990
His mother is an American of British descent.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.000
Yes, Jotaro is definitely my son.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.910
Apparently, his friends at school call him "Jojo,"

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.810
derived from the "Jo" of Jotaro and the "jo" in Kujo.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.890
That's pretty dumb!

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.800
S-So...

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.180
How many people did Jotaro kill?!

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.420
No! Don't tell me! I don't want to hear! No!

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.070
Uh, who said he killed anybody?

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.570
He got into a fight.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.920
Actually, the thugs he faced were
armed with nunchucks and knives.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.180
There were four, including a former boxer,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.750
and between them, fifteen bones were broken.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.650
They all had their balls crushed, too...

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.650
Ah, pardon my language...
And they were sent to the hospital.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.170
Ma'am, please make sure he learns his lesson!

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.410
Okay!

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.650
But the problem is what happened after.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.340
Could you copy this and pass it around?

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.290
Yes, sir.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.670
Your son is quite the oddball.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.020
Come in. We'll show you the way.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.260
Thank you.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.640
Well, anyway, please take him home.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.750
What? He's being released already?

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.380
Well, we can't keep him forever.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.020
By the way, ma'am,
your Japanese is very good.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.270
How long have you lived in Japan?

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.570
Twenty years.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.290
Ah, no wonder.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.290
Good work, gentlemen.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.340
We've had our hands full lately.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.750
There's even a waiting list for cells.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.770
Your son is just up ahead.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.540
Jotaro!

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.830
Jotaro, throw the ball to Mama!

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.090
Very good!

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.540
Do your best at the sports meet tomorrow.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.280
Yeah!

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.840
Jotaro...

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.050
Entrance Ceremony

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.810
We should celebrate.
What would you like to eat today?

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.310
I just want to eat your cooking, Mom.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.610
Jotaro... Jotaro...

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.730
Jotaro... Jotaro...

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.420
Jotaro!

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.730
Shut the hell up!

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.820
You're so damn annoying, you bitch!

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.200
Bam!

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.280
Okay!

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.710
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.710
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.960
He's actually a very sweet child.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.560
Episode 1: The Man Possessed by an Evil Spirit

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.990
He's not capable of doing something so appalling.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.140
Hey! Don't fall asleep, Kujo!

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.690
You're being released. Get out!

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.030
What part of "go home" don't you understand?!

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.700
Mom, go home.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.980
I'm not going to leave here for a while.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.460
I've been possessed by an evil spirit.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.400
I don't know what he'll make me do.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.450
Even during the fight,
it took all I had to stop it.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.630
So don't let me out of this cell.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.090
For crying out loud...
See what I'm talking about, ma'am?

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.260
We're trying to release him,
but he refuses to leave.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.460
Forgive my asking, but is
your son all right upstairs?

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.050
This isn't a hotel!

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.070
Please! Let us change cells!

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.990
He's telling the truth!

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.030
There really is an evil spirit possessing him!

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.670
It's terrifying!

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.350
We won't do anything bad again!

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.600
That's enough! Quiet down!

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.470
Wh-What is that?

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.700
You've been locked up!
How'd you get that in here?!

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.910
I told you.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.430
It's the evil spirit.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.940
The evil spirit brings things to me.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.970 line:20%
Nokotta! Nokotta! Nokotta!

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.600 line:20%
He tosses him out of the ring!
Chiyonofuji wins all fourteen matches!

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.600
H-He's listening to a boombox
and reading <i>Shonen Jump</i>!

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.020
H-How?! Th-This is a problem!

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.260
This is a huge problem!

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.820
Hold it!

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.260
This might not be enough to
stop you from releasing me.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.390
I'll show you what a terror
my evil spirit can be.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.090
Just so you'll understand how
dangerous it could be to let me out.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.770
M-My gun! How?!

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.870
W-We've got trouble!

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.230
Well? Did you guys see
my evil spirit just now?!

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.240
If you didn't, then...

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.300
J-Jotaro!

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.530
There's someone behind me.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.570
It seems to have possessed me recently.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.580
His grandpa, Joseph, had strange powers...

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.450
B-But what's happening to my son?

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.950
Jotaro Kujo

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.270
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.380
Papa!

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.380
Over here, Papa! Over here!

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.210
Holly! Hey, outta my way!

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.550
Papa!

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.700
Papa!

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.640
I'm so glad you came!

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.130
If my only daughter needs my help,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.120
I can be anywhere in the world within 24 hours!

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.350
Where's Mama?

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.130
She complained...

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.920
But I told Suzie it was a business
trip for Joestar Real Estate Agency.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.440
Papa...

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.580
Holly... Holly.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.200
Hey, Holly! Get off of me already!

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.950
No!

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.270
It's been forever since you've held me, Papa!

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.630
Look, you...

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.250
You're a 45-year-old woman.
How can you talk like that?

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.000
Oh, now you've done it!
I'm going to tickle you!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.840
Tickle, tickle, tickle...

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.840
Hey! Stop that!

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.510
Take that and that!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.040
What the hell are you guys staring at?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.350
Mama...

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.350
Don't look!

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.730
I'll take your bag.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.850
By the way, Holly, about Jotaro...

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.360
You're certain he said "evil spirit"?

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.080
Oh... my dear Jotaro!

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.020
Yes. The policemen said they couldn't see it,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.590
but I clearly saw it.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.700
I saw a separate arm...

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.510
And it grabbed the gun!

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.000
Others couldn't see it, but you could?

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.210
Yes...

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.270
So Jotaro says that he's
been possessed recently,

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.250
but nothing strange has happened to you?

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:46.350
No. But Jotaro says he won't leave
the cell until he knows what's going on.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.880
What should I do, Papa?

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.140
There, there, my beloved daughter.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.520
I, Joseph Joestar, am here now,
so there's nothing to worry about.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.570
Right.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.820
First, I'd like to hurry

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.580
and see my grandson, Jotaro!

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.140
H-How terrifying!

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.080
He's got more stuff again...

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.110
And it's violent.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.920
There's something terrifying possessing him...

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.230
I-If anyone outside found out about this,
I'd lose my job in a heartbeat.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.520
Don't worry.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.100
I'll take my grandson home.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.430
"Grandson"?

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.190
Hey, what are you planning to do?

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.580
I told you, you can't go in any further!

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.980
Convince him from over here! It's dangerous!

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.330
It's fine. Step aside! Leave him to me.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.730
We can't be held responsible for this! Y-You...

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.740
Come now, you're in the way.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.700
Jotaro! It's your grandfather!

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.240
I'm sure he'll be able to help you!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.570
Please come out with your grandfather.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.790
Get out. We're going home.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.760
Get lost.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.790
I didn't ask you to come here.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.470
Help me? What the hell can you do?

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.350
Sorry you came all the way from New York,

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.850
but there's no way you can help me.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.100
Bam!

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.290
Th-The pinky from my artificial left hand!

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.800
When was it torn off?

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.050
You see? Do you get it now?

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.830
That's my evil spirit.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.770
Don't get close to me.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.330
You'll just shorten what
little life you have left.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.930
H-How can this be? I don't believe it...

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.570
It was able to deceive me right off the bat...

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.960
Yes... I know exactly
what Jotaro's evil spirit is.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.910
But rather than explaining it with words,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.820
if he experiences the truth himself,

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.280
he'll understand it much better.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.070
No, he needs to physically understand,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.230
because of the dangers
he'll face in the future.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.260
Avdol, you're up.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.530
This is my Egyptian friend
I met three years ago,

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.670
Avdol.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.100
Chase my grandson Jotaro out of this cell.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.040
Don't.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.240
He looks strong, but do you really
think I'd let someone

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.630
chase me out of here just
because you told him to do it?

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.640
Hell, no.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.390
Now I'm just gonna be even more stubborn

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.790
and want to leave even less.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.920
I'll have to get a bit violent.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.980
But soon enough,
he'll be so addled with pain,

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.450
he'll be squealing,
"Please get me out of here."

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.890
That's fine.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.320
Papa, what are you doing?

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.020
H-Hey, we can't have you—

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.180
Shut up.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.150
Yes, sir!

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.050
That's...

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.360
That's right.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.770
Avdol also has a so-called "evil spirit."

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.510
An evil spirit that Avdol can control freely!

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.140
The evil spirit's name is...

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.430
Magician's Red!

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.620
I-It's hot! Fire! I'm burning!
My arms are burning!

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.820
Wh-What is this evil spirit?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.600
Kujo's plastered himself
against the wall and won't move.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.580
I don't get this at all.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.810
B-But isn't it getting sort of...

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.300
How is it that hot?!

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.460
That's insane! It's way too hot!

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.220
There it is! It's finally shown itself!

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.720
And the fact that it's so clearly
visible means it's very powerful.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.970
Why you...

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.720
I can't believe he's able to
make it manifest this clearly!

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.390
I'm surprised you have an evil spirit, too.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:18.370
And Grandpa, the identity of the evil spirit...

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.950
I know it, yes.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.120
Mr. Joestar,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.800
you asked me to get your
grandson out of the cell.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.080
I was planning on holding back,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.030
but considering its unexpected power,
one misstep and we'll be in danger.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.720
Shall I stop?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.160
If you still insist that I get him out,
I'll have to get violent enough

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.600
to send your grandson to the hospital.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.850
That's fine. Give it a shot.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.350
Yes, sir!

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.130
Red Bind!

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:50.410
This is...

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.720
It's so hot!

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.330
I have no idea what's going on!

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.220
Papa! What are you doing to Jotaro?!

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.710
Holly, be a good girl and keep quiet.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:07.400
'Kay?

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.050
I-I can't breathe...

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.060
The evil spirit's withdrawing.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.280
If the heat is restricting your breathing,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.380
your evil spirit will weaken.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.430
I shall reveal its identity!

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.300
It may seem like an evil spirit, but it is not.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.600
Jotaro! What you believed to be an evil spirit

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.810
is a powerful vision,
created from your own life energy.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.070
Because it appears next to you,
that vision is called...

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.610
A Stand!

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.770
Bam!

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.180
A Stand?

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.530
As told in Aesop's fable,

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.330
the cold wind only made the
traveler pull his coat on tight,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.520
but the heat made him admit defeat.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.160
Do you want to come out
of your cage now, Jojo?

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.920
Enough of this.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.170
The reason I won't leave

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.260
is because I keep harming
others without realizing it.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.980
Sure, it interests me that
you have an evil spirit, too.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.520
But if you keep going,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.360
you're gonna die.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.190
He broke the toilet!

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.460
Th-That's destruction of property!

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.410
I warned you.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.210
Bastard!

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.320
Don't say I didn't warn you!

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.970
Hey!

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.470
Why'd you suddenly turn your back on me?!

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.720
Turn and face me!

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.270
Mr. Joestar.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.470
As you can see,
I've gotten him out of his cell.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.520
But...

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.790
Are you saying you let me win?

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.040
Not exactly.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.980
I truly did plan to send you to the hospital,

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.670
but I did not expect such power.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.840
If I hadn't stopped this steel rod,
what were you going to do?

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.610
My Stand is Magician's Red.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.220
It could melt a steel rod
like this in the air with ease.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.530
Avdol has the same power as you.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.180
You don't have to stay in that cell

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.560
to research your evil spirit any longer.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.990
Magician's Red

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.990
Mohammed Avdol

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.990
Oh, thank goodness.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.000
Jotaro finally came out of his cell.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.560
You're so annoying, you bitch.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.590
Okay!

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.580
Hey!

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.750
How dare you call your
own mother a bitch, huh?!

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.940
And, Holly, stop smiling
after he just called you that!

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.880
Okay!

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.500
Grandpa, there's one thing...

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.100
I'm going to ask you about
one thing I don't understand.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.970
Why did you know about my evil spirit—
no, my Stand or whatever?

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.470
That's what I don't understand.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.110
Very well.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.610
I came all the way from
New York to explain that.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.380
But in order to explain it,
I must start at the beginning.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.120
This has to do with the Joestar family.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.750
First, take a look at these pictures.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.500
What are they?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.650
That's a hundred-year-old coffin
pulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.730
off the African coast four years ago.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.760
Coffin?

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.680
After I obtained and researched it,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.530
I found out that it was on the
boat where my grandfather,

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.600
the man four generations before you,
Jonathan Joestar, died.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.150
It was apparently empty
when they discovered it.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.360
But I know exactly what was inside!

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.610
Avdol and I are trying to
locate him as we speak.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.740
Him? Hold on a sec.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.790
You're making it sound like
there was a person in there.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.870
Why would you call something lost
at sea for a hundred years "him"?

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.040
He is evil incarnate!

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.250
His name is DIO!

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.980
He has awakened from his hundred-year sleep.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.550
We are fated to fight him!

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.020
What was that, Jotaro?!

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.430
Don't make a face like this
has nothing to do with you!

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.160
This face means,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.060
"That was so stupid, I don't
know what to say," Gramps.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.330
G-Gramps?

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.790
Avdol, was it?

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.040
I don't know who you are,
but you're sure full of yourself.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.760
And Old Man, do you expect
me to hear such a crazy story

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.240
and just say, "Oh, I see," and believe it?

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:03.000
But is it not a fact that our
evil spirits are crazy, as well?

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.250
Well, whatever.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.920
Soon, you'll have no choice but to believe.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.260
If you ask me why I know of DIO's existence,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.550
and why I'm after him...

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.170
I'll show you the reason.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.050
Actually, about a year ago,

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:25.360
I also suddenly obtained an evil spirit,
or rather, the power of a Stand.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.650
What?

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.190
Old Man, what did you—

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.990
I shall show you!

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.790
This is

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.550
my Stand!

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.470
<c.colord5de40>Crash!</c>

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.610
Did you see it?

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.550
The thorns that came from my hand?
This is my Stand!

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.800
Its power is to take spirit photos of
visions I captured from far-off places!

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.550
Though I have to smash and destroy a
30,000 yen camera every time I do it.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.560
Sir, is something wrong?

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.750
We're fine. Go away.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.810
Right...

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.420
The vision that's going to
appear in this picture,

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.320
Jotaro...

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.620
will be what determines your fate!

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.820
What?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.960
Jotaro, Holly, have either of you ever
looked carefully at the back of your necks?

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:18.950
What do you mean?

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.500
You've probably never taken a close look.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:27.630
But right around the base of my neck,
there is a star-shaped birthmark.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.380
I'll ask again. What the hell does all this mean?

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.740
I asked my mother about it,

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.260
and she said that my father,
who died when I was young, also had it.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:44.380
Apparently, those of the Joestar
bloodline all have this birthmark.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.850
Hey, Old Man,

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.360
I'm asking you what's going
to show up on that photo.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.950
It is our destiny, as yet undiscovered!

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.100
Papa...

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.160
Damn it, just show me what's on it already!

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.130
DIO!

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.190
He is always the one who
shows up in my spirit photos.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.670
And on the back of his neck...

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.130
From this bastard's neck down,

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.790
is the body of my grandfather,
Jonathan Joestar,

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:16.290
Rumble

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.300
which that bastard has taken over!

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.770
A hundred years ago,
an incident occurred in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.340
I only know what I heard
from my grandmother, Erina,

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.090
but DIO took over the body of
my grandfather and survived!

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.890
And this much is certain:

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:36.990
He is currently hiding somewhere
in the world, plotting something!

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.460
It's been four years since he came back.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.810
The reason my spirit photos and your evil spirits

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.880
all began manifesting in this past year...

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.000
is most likely DIO!

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.250
In the wider world, our gifts
are considered psychic powers.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.310
I've had my Stand since birth,

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.200
but your powers are bound to DIO's body...

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.260
In other words, Jonathan's body,
by invisible threads.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.590
All we can say now is that DIO's
existence is what brought forth

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.270
the powers that were dormant within you.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.520
Avdol, from this photo,
can you tell where he is now?

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.600
I cannot. There's hardly any background visible.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.000
As I thought.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.410
I'll take a closer look.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.790
Please. Hm?

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:25.930
Oh, Holly.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.530
I apologize for bringing all this up so suddenly.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.980
Now, let's go home.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.920
Y-Yes...

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.020
I will be staying in Japan for a while.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.090
And I'll be staying at your place.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.730
Yes, Papa.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.470
Let's go, Jotaro.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.570
It happened again...

00:22:54.850 --> 00:23:00.400
Just now, it felt as though
someone was watching me again.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.950
Is it Jonathan's descendants, after all?

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.960
This body must be sending out some
kind of soul signal to his descendants.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.310
Very well. This might be called fate...

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.700
A fate I must be rid of,

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.620
a destiny I must erase.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.030
I have already made my move.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.020
Jotaro!

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.370
Here, a goodbye kiss.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.150
You bitch...

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.970
I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.780
I just transferred here yesterday.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.280
Does this look like a pen to you?!

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.800
The loser is the evil one.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.020
Episode 2:

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.020
Who Will Be the Judge!?

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.300
The one who'll be the judge is...
