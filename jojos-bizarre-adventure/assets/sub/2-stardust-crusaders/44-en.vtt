00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.450
Wh... What are these remnants of destruction?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.080
It's a perfectly round opening,
like someone pulled out a cork.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.230
Wh-What is it...?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.960
The destruction continues on beyond this room.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.910
These are clearly signs that Avdol and
the others encountered an enemy.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.390
Jotaro! Break down this door! We're going in!

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.430
Yeah.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.270
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.270
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.490
So long, Iggy.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.540
Episode 44  The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 3

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.760
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.500
Polnareff. It is not by your hand that I bleed.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.650
It is by Avdol's.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.370
At that moment,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.500
I had planned to eradicate
both you and Avdol all at once,

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.920
but he knocked you out of the way.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.480
Normally, in such a situation,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.430
one would instinctively
focus on protecting himself.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.850
This blood is the result of that.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.230
But although I am injured,
it will take some time until I die.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.660
I shall go finish off Joestar and the other two!

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.690
I will, without a doubt, eliminate them.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.280
Iggy... I told you over and over
not to use your Stand...

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.660
Trying to act all cool and shit...

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.420
I told you so many times.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.750
Polnareff!

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.020
Cool Ice said that a mere
dog could not have resolve.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.270
That he could not possess a proud soul.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.760
But Stands are the soul's manifestation.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.920
Iggy's soul had moved on its own.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.350
It had no choice but to move.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.410
Th-This feeling in the sand...

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.200
How could this have happened? Damn it!

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.450
It's an empty shell. A Stand's empty shell...

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.750
This is cold annihilation...
The destruction of life.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.520
Damn it! I'm the one who survived!

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.300
Ig...

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.460
Iggy!

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.350
You're too slow, Cool Ice.
And you're exactly right.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.510
I have really bad luck when it comes to friends.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.940
I was supposed to save Iggy,
but instead, he saved me.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.370
Damn it...

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.470
How can this be?

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.020
I just realized how much I liked him.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.840
It always happens this way.
I only understand after they're gone.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.090
I thought you were a stubborn,
shitty little mutt,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.260
but I loved how you acted so stubborn,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.140
and refused to be friendly with any human.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.960
I realize now that your refusal to show

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.080
affection for anyone proved
just how proud you really were.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.250
I told you not to save me...

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.570
Damn it! It's because of your stubbornness that...

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.860
<c.color46399c>Rumble</c>

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.140
I knew it. Cool Ice, you bastard...

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.000
I thought it was strange.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.090
You're immortal. DIO did
something to you, didn't he?

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.310
Wh-What... i-is... this?!

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.560
You didn't notice your body changing?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.740
You received his blood, didn't you?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.650
To think you're becoming something
I've heard stories about.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.550
You're the same as DIO.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.850
A soulless, filthy vampire!

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.630
You bastard!

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.370
Looks like you started to turn into a vampire

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.730
around the moment I stabbed
you through the mouth.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.050
Go on.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.250
Indulge your obsession to the fullest!
Try and do something!

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.640
You're obsessed with
protecting DIO, aren't you?

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.390
Come at me! I'm right here!

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.470
What's wrong, Cool Ice? Come on!

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.730
You will not...

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.940
Go to Hell.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.860
A-Avdol... I-Iggy!

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.930
W...

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.260
Was that an illusion?

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.300
Or...

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.800
Either way, I have to climb up those stairs

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.970
and get to DIO.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.750
I don't have time to cry in sadness now.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.200
Avdol has died
Iggy has died

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.900
The Fool

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.910
Iggy

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.830
Japan.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.460
It has now been 43 days since
Jojo and the others departed.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.670
Stop for a moment, Rosas.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.680
Please, stop the car.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.800
Soba                   <font color="#222146" size="24">Soba Midokoro</c>

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.120
Madam, you're not thinking about
stopping at that soba stand, are you?

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.130
Indeed I am!

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.120
It's been so long since I've been in Japan.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.120
I'm going to have a bite
before I go see my daughter.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.860
You hold my little turtle for me.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.070
You mustn't, Madam!

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.700
These places are intended for busy men,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.770
not for ladies like yourself.
That is the Japanese way.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.200
You are Madam Joestar.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.920
Oh, hush. I'm going to record
a commemorative video.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.360
Very good! Very good!

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.750
Soba

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.250
This plebeian atmosphere... It's so good!

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.170
Do not puke or piss

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.480
Mr. Rosas.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.680
Have you not told her about
her daughter Holly's condition?

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.460
Hurry it up, Rosas! Come, come!

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.440
I-I'll be right there...

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.470
I... I haven't told her yet.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.720
She came to Japan thinking

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.470
she was just visiting her daughter,
who had mild pneumonia.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.660
I have served the Joestar family for 30 years,

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.880
ever since Miss Holly was in grade school.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.680
I know I should have told her the truth.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.330
But... I lacked the courage.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.970
So we arrived in Japan before I could tell her.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.940
Miss Holly's strength has run out.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.370
She has only a few days left.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.440
I could tell her, if you'd like.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.850
N-No... I have lied this long
to Madam about Miss Holly.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:11.740
Hiring
Part-timers

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.740
I will tell her myself.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.080
Is it true that she might be cured if

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.230
the man called DIO is defeated?

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.750
Yes. <i>If</i> he is defeated.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.370
Miss Holly's body is reacting
to an energy called a Stand,

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.360
which only certain people can see,
and is being overwhelmed by it.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.420
By the evil energy of the man known as DIO...

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.510
The Madam cannot see Stands.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:41.730
But when she encounters the
shadow of death, she will sense it.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.060
You must go tell Madam Joestar right away.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.220
Sh-Shadow of death?

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.820
Come, Rosas! What are you doing?

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.960
You should have some curry udon, too.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.250
Madam, there's something I must tell you...

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.080
Oh! I must get some footage of the

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.960
Family
Planning

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.960
vending machine serving that
peculiar energy drink, as well!

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.960
Premium Skin

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.530
Good. Very good. Would you like one, Rosas?

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.050
Madam, please stop! Those are not drinks!

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.640
P-Please listen, Madam!

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.470
Oh? To what?

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.680
Th-The truth is, Miss Holly...

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.330
This Japanese person is so unique and cool!

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.650
Good. Very good!

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.440
Hello, hello, give me smile!

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.440
What the hell?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.200
Who gave you permission to videotape me, huh?!

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.240
Gah!

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.080
Madam, please get back in the car!

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.410
Yay!

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.870
Come back here, damn it!
Are you messing with me?!

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.540
Hand over that camera!

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.010
Who the hell do you think you are,
you foreign granny?!

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.170
Want to see some blood,
you shitty old woman? Huh?

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.280
Hey, that's quite enough.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.090
Do not lay a finger on the Madam.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.720
Kabam

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.990
Madam, please! Learn a bit more about Japan.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.310
Okay.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.380
I-I couldn't tell her

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.900
that Miss Holly only has a few days left.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.070
I can't bear seeing Madam in shock and sadness.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.930
We've come this far before I could tell her.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.360
The Kujo household is almost in sight.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.160
I must tell her now...

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.740
I must be the one to tell her!

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.990
Rosas.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.270
I know there's something you want to tell me.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.600
I already know what's been troubling you.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.680
My daughter's life is in danger, isn't it?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:12.200
When I called her from New York,
Holly always sounded cheerful and strong.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.010
She said that she just had a little cold.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.890
Joseph would also call me
while he was on the road,

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.010
saying that he was doing fine
and oh so terribly busy.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.010
But somehow I knew

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.560
that something terrible was happening
to my daughter and my husband.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.120
I've lived with my husband for fifty years,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.650
and I gave birth to my daughter, after all.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.350
I was frightened.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.580
I was too scared to verify the truth.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.840
The more I wanted to see my daughter,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.530
the more frightened I was to come to Japan.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.360
Since we're discussing it now,
we should tell you clearly.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.540
Miss Holly's survival will depend
upon these next few days.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.340
Mr. Joestar and the others
went to Egypt to address

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.030
the source of her illness,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.760
but I have not heard any news from them yet.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:09.190
P-Please forgive me for not telling you, Madam.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.700
There was nothing we could do for Miss Holly,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.940
and that was so painful...

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.670
It was so cruel!

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.110
What nonsense are you speaking, Rosas?

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.910
There is just one thing we can do for Holly.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.060
Holly.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.150
Mom...

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.990
Rosas, listen carefully.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.230
The one thing we can do for my daughter

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.130
is believe.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.380
I do not know the details, but I have faith.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.940
If my Joseph and my grandson, Jotaro,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.580
are trying to do something to save my daughter,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.460
then I will believe in them.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.780
Ever since I met that man
in Italy fifty years ago,

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.480
he has never betrayed my expectations.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.140
Once he decides he's going to do something,

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.400
he will follow through, no matter what.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.330
Believe in Jotaro and Joseph.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.780
Get better, and we'll all be
together as a family again.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.250
Mom...

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.910
Madam... Miss Holly...

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.840
Star Platinum

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.840
Jotaro Kujo

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.810
Cool Ice... Billie Jean... D'Arby Younger...

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.690
All of you were fools after all!

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.980
Bam

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:30.240
I can't help but belly laugh in sheer satisfaction
to think they got what they deserved!

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.410
Calling me "Nukesaku" like I'm some moron...

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.540
You're the dumbasses who got killed!

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.910
Nukesaku, it is impossible for you

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.130
to defeat Joestar and the
others with your powers.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.920
Just stay out of it.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.590
H-Hey... Let me in on the action, too.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.350
You're nothing more than a vampire.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:55.100
Just try and interfere. We'll kill you if you do.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.110
Just stay put, Nukesaku.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.280
I'll be the one who finishes off Jotaro!

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.200
Stop! There's something in
front of us, to the right.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.590
It's a woman...

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.050
P-Please spare me!

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.850
Don't drink my blood!
Please don't drink my blood!

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:38.720
I'll do whatever you say!
So please, spare my life!

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.460
H-Hey, just wait a second. Calm down.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.730
I won't try to run away again!
So please... spare my life!

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.050
Calm down!

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.490
We aren't DIO's minions, and we aren't vampires.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.720
You can consider us friends.
We'll help you, so calm down.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.000
Friends...

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.370
Friends? A-Are you really friends, not foes?

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.750
Will you really help me?

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.160
That's right. We're friends...

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.340
Crush

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.180
Of justice, that is.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.210
That's right. We'll help you.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.180
We'll help you go straight to Hell!

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.390
Right, Kakyoin?

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.450
I-Impossible! Wh-Why? Why?!

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.180
How did you figure it out?!

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.710
My power is invincible!

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.780
Is your power having the face of a
woman on the back of your head?

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.380
You should have at least
turned your hands around.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.850
Th-That's right!

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.560
I didn't realize... Damn it!

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.390
Hey, Nukesaku.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.970
Where's DIO's room? Tell us.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.900
Jotaro, don't knock him out.
Let's have him guide us.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.570
Why, you...

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:12.150
You called me "Nukesaku"...
Don't mess with me!

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.430
I'll kill you!

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:19.160
I am immortal, for the blood
of Lord DIO is in my body!

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.120
Oh? Did you just say you were immortal?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.740
So you're a vampire like DIO...

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.050
Well, then, I guess I'll have to
see just how immortal you are.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.100
Oh my God!

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.090
I see. So you are immortal.
But even if you are a vampire,

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.790
it's still possible to cut you into pieces.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:59.010
Come on. Lead us to DIO. The sun's setting.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.340
Okay... But may I ask you one thing?

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.920
How did you know that they call me "Nukesaku"?

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.920
Good grief.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.760
Those curtains were made of some nice cloth.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.240
Now I can move better, and even jump.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.880
It still hurts,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.560
but I don't have time to
lose heart or worry about pain.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:17.800
Rumble

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.410
So it's you, Polnareff. It's been a while.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.370
DIO.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.550
You're here at last.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.930
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.570
So we finally meet, DIO.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.100
I don't have fond memories of them.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.420
I do not regret this journey.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.790
I-I'll tell you everything that just happened.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.650
Not good. Something here is not good!

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.190
When did he bring out that Stand?

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.950
Episode 45

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.950
DIO's World, Part 1

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.950
I shall give you one chance.
