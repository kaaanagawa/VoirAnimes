"Which creature walks on
four legs in the morning,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.540
two legs in the afternoon,
and three legs in the evening?"

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.200
The guardian of the pyramids,
the Sphinx, asked travelers this riddle.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.610
The answer is "Humans."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.090
Legend says that those who could
not answer were eaten by the Sphinx.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.390
Thirty thousand kilometers from Japan,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.250
Jotaro and the others have finally reached Cairo.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.080
Cairo is immense.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.720
Rather than searching aimlessly,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.130
we should work our way from
the outskirts inward to the center.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.570
We're finally here.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.300
Jotaro and the others have arrived in Cairo.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.440
But before the pyramid named DIO,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.950
a few more Sphinxes stood in their way.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.300
Welcome, foreigners. What would you like?

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.270
There's something I'd like to ask you.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.130
We're looking for the building in this picture.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.780
Do you know where it is?

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.360
Joseph and the others were exhausted.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.870
Ever since their arrival,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.740
they had searched constantly
for the building in the picture.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.040
These are spirit pictures that

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.290
Joseph managed to take of DIO's mansion.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.520
DIO had moved to a new hideout,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.620
and the Speedwagon Foundation
had lost track of his whereabouts.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.230
Where is DIO?

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.360
If they are unable to find
him in the next few days,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.290
Holly's life will come to an end.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.640
Sirs, this is a café. Please order something.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.790
Four iced teas.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.040
Nope, I don't recognize it.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.080
Cairo has a population of six million.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.490
There must be two to three million buildings.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.180
Will we be able to find him?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.780
There has to be someone...

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.750
Someone has to know where it is.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.830
This building, huh?

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.690
I can't tell from just a picture...

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.150
Sorry, it doesn't look familiar.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.220
I see. Sorry to bother you.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.150
No problem.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.320
Come on. Let's continue our investigation.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.950
I know that building.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.960
What?!

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.090
No doubt about it. It's <i>that</i> building.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.040
Spread

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.190
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.190
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.520
Episode 34  D'Arby the Gambler, Part 1

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.780
W-Was it you who just said that?

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.730
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.280
I just heard someone say
they know this building.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.240
Yes.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.430
I did indeed say that I know where
the mansion in that picture is located.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.830
What? Really?!

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.460
That's great to hear!

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.700
Yes! We're pretty lucky to have
found someone who knows

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.260
where it is just from this picture.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.400
Where? Please tell us! Where is it?

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.060
Are you asking me to give
you the answer for free?

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.670
Y-You've got a point. Sorry about that.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.320
I'll pay you ten pounds.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.260
So, where is it?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.170
I love gambling.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.690
I'm a sucker for cheap thrills.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.710
I can't get enough of them.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.170
Well, you could say that
I make my living gambling.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.800
Do you like gambling?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.030
I'm not sure what you're getting at.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.640
If you don't like gambling, just say so.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.270
I'm asking you exactly what you mean by that.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.360
Well... Would you make a
silly little wager with me?

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.700
If you win, I'll tell you
where that place is for free.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.440
Wager? I'm pretty confident
when it comes to wagers,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.820
but we don't have time
to play poker right now.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.410
I'll give you another twenty pounds,
so please just tell us.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.020
The thing about gambling is,
you can do it with anything.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.960
It won't take any time at all.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.170
For example,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.760
look over there. See that cat?

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:50.620
Now, why don't we bet on which
smoked fish that cat will eat first?

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.150
Right or left?

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.940
How about it? It's silly, but thrilling.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.220
Hey! You're really starting to annoy me!

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.460
Just take the thirty pounds,
and hurry up and tell us!

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.510
Polnareff, that's not the way to
ask someone for information.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.930
Okay, fine! Then I'll make a bet.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.790
I pick the one on the right!

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.600
Good! Now it's getting fun.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.050
Then I shall wager on the left.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.010
Hey, now...

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.440
Hey, Jotaro. Isn't he rather suspicious?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.450
Yeah... He might be an enemy Stand user.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.970
But he might just be a compulsive gambler.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.590
If he does anything even remotely strange,
plow through him with Star Platinum.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.630
Got it.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.830
By the way, if I lose,
what am I supposed to pay you?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.250
Like, a hundred pounds?

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.030
I don't need money.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.510
How about your soul? I'll take your soul.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.230
What?

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.380
What kind of joke is that? Cocky bastard.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.870
I want to hurry up and
get the hell away from him.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.050
Your answer?

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.350
Yeah, okay, sure. That's fine.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.290
Oh? The cat has taken
notice of the smoked fish.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.140
The right.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.690
The kitty's going to the right.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.720
If I were a cat, I'd pick the bigger one.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.070
The one on the right looks bigger!

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.900
You saw it.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.490
It first took the left,
then the right, and then ran.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.340
I win.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.990
Hey, you lost, Polnareff.
What are you going to do now?

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.070
I'm getting sick of asking
around about that building.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.450
Now, then. As per our agreement,
let's have you pay up.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.010
Huh? Pay? Pay what?

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.360
Your soul.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.150
That is indeed what you just wagered.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.390
Your soul!

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.240
I am a Stand user that steals souls!

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.740
Gambling makes it easier for the
human soul to leave its vessel.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.590
It is my Stand's power to
steal it at that moment!

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.470
What?! What's going on?!

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.460
Grab

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.470
Polnareff!

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.710
Hold it! Don't kill me. It's too late!

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.310
If I die, Polnareff's soul, which is
in my Stand's grasp, will also die.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.400
Polnareff!

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.390
H-Hey!

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.610
H-He has no pulse.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.320
He's dead! Polnareff is dead!

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.490
Polnareff!

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.630
This is Polnareff's soul.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.860
This means I've already gotten rid of one

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.810
of the people trying to get in Lord DIO's way.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.880
Even if he was just a fool.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.950
It's a little overdue,
but allow me to introduce myself.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.320
My name is D'Arby.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.260
D-A-R-B-Y. There's an apostrophe after the D.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.600
The Stand that steals souls
from those who lost a bet...

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.960
The one that suggests Osiris.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.880
By the way, this is my cat.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.380
Y-You bastard!

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.300
Don't screw with us! A bet? It was just a scam!

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.550
A scam?

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.440
Listen. If you've been scammed,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.810
the one who failed to see through it is the loser.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.190
I believe gambling is just like relationships.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.760
It's all about fooling the other.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.980
The one who cries loses.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.460
Are you going to kill me with your bare hands?

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.310
Very well. Do it.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.010
If you want this soul to die, as well.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.380
Listen here.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.400
You will not walk away from this in one piece.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.680
Do you remember what you
were doing on the night of

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.880
September 22nd, 1984 at 11:15 PM?

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.360
What are you talking about?

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.340
I remember.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.930
Around that time in California,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.640
I was gambling with an American
man named Stephen Moor,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.570
and he said the same thing you just did.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.410
This is him.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.080
The one below is Moor's father,
and his wife is right next to him.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.530
If you want to get Polnareff's soul back,
you have no choice but to continue

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.180
gambling with me.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.010
Th-This man is a demon...

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.770
He's planning to take us, one by one.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.310
What will you do?

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.640
If you're scared, you can go home...

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.330
And leave Polnareff behind.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.020
Well, have a drink and think
about it long and hard.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:30.900
How about some chocolate?

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.630
M-Mr. Joestar, what are you trying to do?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.320
Have you heard of surface tension, Barbie?

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.670
It's D'Arby. My name is D'Arby.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:07.210
It's the force that's keeping that drink
from breaking the surface, correct?

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.860
What do you plan to do?

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.730
The rules are simple.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.070
We'll take turns putting coins in this glass.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.870
The one who makes it overflow loses.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.100
Hey, old man...

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.480
Y-You can't mean... Mr. Joestar!

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.400
I'll wager my soul on it!

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.960
Osiris

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.960
D'Arby Elder

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.260
I'll wager my soul on it!

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.380
Good!

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.090
What?!

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.920
Impossible! P-Please don't! He's a con artist!

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.330
I won't let him cheat!

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.900
I'm the one who chose the method of this wager!

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.100
Jotaro, make sure he doesn't cheat.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.180
Okay! That's fine. I shall take this bet.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.320
But first...

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.700
Do you mind if I inspect the glass and coins?

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.450
Of course, you have that right.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.530
You also have the right to
make sure I'm not cheating.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.150
First, will you guarantee that if you lose,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.180
you will return Polnareff's
soul, no matter what?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.260
I am a gambler. I do have my pride.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.890
If I lose, I always pay up.
I won't lose, though.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.020
Very well. You can go first. Put in a coin.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.470
Mr. Joestar!

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.260
Just leave this to me.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.500
I'm an expert at this trick with a glass and coins.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.020
I'm not easy to beat when
surface tension is involved.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.760
It should fit about eight or nine more coins...

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.960
As long as I can remain calm
and my fingers don't shake.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.870
May I put in more than one coin at a time?

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.170
If you can do it all at once.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.130
Well, then...

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.970
F-Five?!

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.980
Hey, I think I saw a little wave there.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.720
Quiet!

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.500
Don't touch the table.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.840
It's your turn.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.000
Your guts are quite impressive,
to put in five at once.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.350
I'll go with one.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.850
That was too close.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.810
The old man...

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.480
He has cotton between his finger and the coin.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.560
Liquid is dripping from it.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.900
He's squeezing it out and adding to the alcohol.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.660
And you wanted me to watch for cheating?

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.060
You scoundrel...

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.160
Not bad.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.400
No more will fit!

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.920
Even one more and the
drink will spill over! I've won!

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.050
It's not a scam if you're not caught!
That's what he said himself.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.380
This is bad for my heart.
I thought it was going to spill...

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.600
Now it's your turn, Obie.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.300
It's D'Arby. Don't mistake that again!

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.440
My name is D'Arby!

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.740
It's not Obie or Barbie!

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.200
My apologies.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.850
He's screwing up his name on
purpose to make him agitated.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.330
That old man...

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.340
He's a gambler at heart.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.050
Let's continue our wager.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.420
It's your turn to put in a coin, D'Arby.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.310
There's a shadow, so this angle is difficult.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.390
I'll put it in from the right side of the table.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.810
You may put it in from wherever you like.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.830
Though because of my cheat,
it's already at its limit.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.500
He can't put any more in,
no matter what he tries.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.420
It'll overflow if he even touches the surface.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.510
You're thinking that this glass's
surface tension is at it's limit.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.870
That it's impossible, right?

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.840
But that's not true...

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.180
I-Impossible! It can't be!

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.580
There's no way it wouldn't overflow!

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.330
What do you mean,
there's no way it wouldn't overflow?

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.870
As you can see, it went in.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.210
He made no suspicious moves
that could've been cheating.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.080
I was watching with Star Platinum.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.450
He put the coin in fairly.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.080
There's no doubt about it.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.940
B-But I made sure!

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.870
I made sure that it would
overflow if one more was added!

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.120
Why? There's no way one
more could have gone in!

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.800
So how?!

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.640
Go ahead, Mr. Joestar.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.370
Hurry it up.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.270
Or are you trying to wait until it evaporates?

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.750
I-I can't believe it.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.070
Mr. Joestar!

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.820
Joestar acknowledged in his mind
that he'd already lost the bet!

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.450
That's why his soul emerged.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.590
I, D'Arby, have won this bet!

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.240
Polnareff, I'm sorry.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.720
Holly, I might not be
able to save you, after all.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.880
Mr. Joestar!

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.830
Old man!

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.410
That's two!

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.550
Now, then. Let us continue gambling.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.330
As long as you two don't abandon

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:11.040
these two and run away with your
tails between your legs, that is.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.160
You bastard!

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.420
You don't learn, do you?

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.710
If you kill me, these two souls will die, as well.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.780
Damn it!

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.250
Avdol, stop!

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.090
Hey! If you're going to make trouble,
I'll have to ask you to leave!

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.130
Shut it. Stay out of this.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.240
Yes, sir!

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.070
You realized it too late, Jotaro.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.650
Is there something wrong with the glass?

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.710
This is how one more coin went in.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.310
There was a tiny bit of chocolate
on the bottom of the glass's outside.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.850
Before they started the game,

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.700
he asked to inspect the glass and coins,
and that's when he stuck it on.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.520
I believe you were aware that

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.790
if it's not discovered in time,
you can't call it cheating.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.460
Wh-What do you mean?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.640
How is a bit of chocolate
the reason the coin fit?

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.300
It's melted now,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.450
but until a moment ago, it was
solid at the bottom of the glass.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.540
He used just enough so we wouldn't notice,

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:28.340
This side will spill

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:28.350
Glass is tilted

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.940
but the glass was propped up so it would tilt.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.030
Once it melted, the surface became level.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.550
Surface tension becomes equal

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.550
It melts

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.810
Even though the surface tension was at its limit,

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.030
he made it so at least one more coin would fit.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.010
Wh-What?!

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.600
B-But...

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.540
Could chocolate actually melt
with such convenient timing?

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.300
He melted it using the sun's heat.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.620
I didn't notice.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.840
He went to the right side of the table

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.840
so the sun's rays would directly hit
the glass and melt the chocolate.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.650
Fine.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.230
D'Arby, get your trump card ready.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.190
We'll finish this with poker.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.690
J-Jotaro!

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:45.260
Rumble

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.090
How interesting!

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.040
Poker is one of the games I'm best at!

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.650
Poker? This man just beat Mr. Joestar!

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.000
I-It's too dangerous!

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.170
I know.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.230
He's not violent,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.780
but he's still more dangerous than
any other Stand user we've met so far.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.850
But...

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.760
I can't afford not to do this.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.010
Next Episode Preview

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.560
Draw three.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.100
I'll draw two.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.400
He's not doing anything suspicious, and yet...

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.980
Cheating is all about finding a mental blind spot.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.540
There's only one joker.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.110
Well, then, Jotaro...

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.030
Very well. I'll wager my soul.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 35

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
D'Arby the Gambler, Part 2
