00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.140
Right under your chin! Right, Polnareff?

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.380
What?!

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.050
It's me, you fool. The Stand that suggests Anubis!

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.010
Wh-What should I do?

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.990
Die!

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.970
I'll shave your chin right off!

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.300
Wh-What the hell are you?!

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.080
Aren't you the owner of this place?

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.280
C-Could it be that sword...

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.540
The sword is actually the Stand,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.450
and it controls the wielder?

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.300
So the guy in Kom Ombo wasn't the user?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.940
Polnareff...

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.050
No matter how many times you try,
you're still no match for me!

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.220
Th-The power in this sword...

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.800
After last time, I memorized
your Chariot's moves and powers!

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.110
I'll never lose to someone I've fought before!

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.200
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.200
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.840
Come on, now.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.700
Come on, you've almost got it.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.850
Episode 29  Anubis, Part 2

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.090
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.160
Oh?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.850
Polnareff and Jotaro seem to be taking a while.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.520
Polnareff, what's...

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.800
Who is that?

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.320
Stay back, Jotaro!

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.130
Th-This sword is a Stand.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.780
It'd be pretty dangerous for your Star
Platinum to fight it with his bare hands.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.330
And the guy's not the user! He's just a puppet.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.710
N-Not to mention, this Stand's gotten stronger!

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.170
You bastard!

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.170
Whoa, there.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.210
Does that sting?

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.640
Now I've learned just how much
punishment you can take, too.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.830
I wonder if you'll be able to
withstand this next attack, Polnareff.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.160
Polnareff!

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.380
I-It's getting stronger... with every strike!

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.420
I-I can't take this. I-I can't hold him back!

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.890
Now!

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:40.890
Take this!

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.690
What?!

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.760
I've learned all of your attack patterns.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.260
Once I've fought an opponent,
even if my wielder has changed...

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.040
No matter what, no matter what,
no matter what, <i>no matter what</i>...

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.500
I won't lose!

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.220
I-It's no use. I don't have a weapon anymore...

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.260
C-Crap! Help me out, Jotaro!

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.260
Star Platinum!

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.890
D-Did it work?

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.840
No, not even close.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.860
It took everything I had just to land that punch.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.690
Hey, Khan. Are you all right? Hey...

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.690
Shit. This thing is strong.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.550
This is the first combat Stand

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.360
we've seen in a while that doesn't
rely on schemes or spells...

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.420
Just as I'd expect from Star Platinum.
You're as fast as I've heard.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.590
But now I've learned all of those moves.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.420
Menacing

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.510
Wh-What's wrong, Khan?

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.720
Stay back!

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.260
He's being controlled!
If you don't want to be cut down,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.790
get indoors and hide!

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.180
Th-This isn't good, Jotaro.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.860
The more we fight it, the faster it gets.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.740
Th-The next attack will be the fastest,

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.330
strongest, and most intense attack yet!

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.260
Out of the way, Polnareff.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.250
He's trying to cut me down.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.920
Run, Jotaro!

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.210
Die!

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.920
H-He caught it?!

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.400
I can't believe you caught my blade...

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.950
I see. Star Platinum's strength doesn't
come from its speed and precision alone.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.410
It's also Jotaro's ability to stay cool under fire.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.410
Yes, I know that now...

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.050
Is he dead?

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.720
No, he's just unconscious.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.120
Jotaro, don't touch that sword!

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.100
Even now, the Stand's evil
powers could still be active.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.470
Anyone who touches the
drawn blade falls under its spell.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.610
Let's sheathe it, but without touching it.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.970
What should we do?

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.400
If it gets drawn again, we'll be in trouble.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.860
This thing's learned about our powers.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.580
We may not be able to beat it again.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.680
How about we toss it in the Nile
to lay at the bottom forever?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.930
Forever, huh? That's a good idea!

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.790
Hold it! This is the police!

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.400
Nice timing. Could you get this guy to a hospital?

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.270
I came when someone reported
a fight, and I find this!

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.740
Why do you have a sword?!

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.070
Hand it over!

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.730
Hey, stop!

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.070
Don't pull it out!

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.860
Gwaaang

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.120
Polnareff!

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.000
It can't be...

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.780
Polnareff's e-eyes...

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.530
Did he fall under the
spell of the cursed sword?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.820
Hey! You drew the sword!

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.560
I drew the sword?

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.390
Hey, now. Don't you dare lie.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.410
Aren't you an officer of the law?

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.530
H-Hey, what are you doing?

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.990
You're the one who drew it, aren't you?!

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.440
I don't know where the Stand's real user is,

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.290
but it seems Polnareff's fallen under their spell.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.590
But I've never thought about
fighting Polnareff before.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.390
I know I can't hold back
if I end up fighting Chariot.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.880
Even if I win, it'll mean killing Polnareff.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.490
Don't forget that I, Anubis, have
learned all of Star Platinum's moves.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:46.360
Someone I've fought before can
never, ever hope to defeat me!

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.530
Hey, now.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.930
H-His speed... This isn't good!

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.130
He's getting faster. I-I can't take much more...

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.970
I have to stop the sword!

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.480
I'll have to catch it again!

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.230
It sped up!

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.060
I'll have your head!

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:23.570
Wha—

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.330
What tremendous speed and power.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.110
This is the fastest Stand that we've faced.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.720
I-I'm going to lose this fight.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.660
If I don't fight Polnareff with my full
strength, I'm going to be killed.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.000
To think you'd escape from a
failed blade-catch with a headbutt...

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:02.730
I almost had you. Too bad.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.080
But...

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.240
I know that move now, too.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.360
Jotaro.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:17.840
You're thinking about how you'll die
if you don't kill Polnareff, right?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.380
How weak of you. Weak, weak!

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:29.800
I'm going to show you something so amazing,
it'll finish you off right here and now.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.670
Can you

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.510
beat this,

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.040
Jotaro?!

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.780
Silver Chariot plus Anubis: dual-wielding!

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.070
Anubis

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.070
Khan

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.530
This isn't good...

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.820
If he gets faster on top of having an extra sword...

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.320
Even my Star Platinum...

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.240
What's the matter? Did you fall asleep,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.960
Jotaro?!

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.450
I'll stop him before he kills me!

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.350
Star Finger!

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.540
My right arm is as light as a feather now.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.550
I see. I guess that was one option...

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.390
You look shocked.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.270
Here I go! Undone armor!

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:14.250
You fool! There's no way your "ora ora" can
withstand two master Stands' dual swords!

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.250
Your chest is wide open!

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.330
Stab

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.440
I've got you now!

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.590
I did it! I won!

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.630
Lord DIO! I've taken care of Jotaro!

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.670
I, Anubis, have defeated Jotaro!

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.820
Yes!

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.500
Don't think you'll be able to
stop the blade or pull it out.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.020
This cursed sword has already

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.240
memorized and surpassed the
power of your Star Platinum.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.620
I'll just push it in farther...

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.660
Y-You're going to push it in?

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.780
Yeah, that's right!

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.960
Indeed I will! Lord DIO will be pleased!

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.130
S-Stop. Don't push it any further...

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.260
It'll be murder.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:23.020
I will not stop! I'll push it in
and tear your guts to shreds!

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.470
Bam

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.490
Wh-What?!

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.500
I-I'm going to snap! I-I have to pull free!

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.740
Stop!

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.710
By the way, didn't you say
you were going to tear me up?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.690
Crack

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.720
That's why I said that if you pushed
it in any further, it would be murder.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.140
The sword had stopped moving,
so it was easy to target.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.400
Still, that was a strong enemy.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.400
This last move took everything I had.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.990
I'm glad it was enough to defeat
him before he could learn it, too.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.790
This is the first time I've ever felt so tired.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.000
I have to hurry and meet up
with Avdol and the old man.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.200
Wh-What happened to me?

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.990
D-Don't tell me I was being
controlled by the cursed sword...

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.520
Yeah... But it's over now.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.530
Sorry...

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.810
Polnareff, get the old man and Avdol.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.380
I'm too tired to walk.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.290
It's shining...

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.470
And now I've learned it...

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.440
The true user of Anubis was the blacksmith

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.470
who forged this sword
over five hundred years ago.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.330
Now only his Stand remains.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.150
This means that I am a Stand with no user.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:40.480
Lord DIO pulled me out of the
darkness of a museum storeroom.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:49.250
Lord DIO's Stand, The World, is a powerful
Stand that I could never hope to defeat.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.590
That's why I swore my loyalty to him.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:17:00.710
Jotaro, no matter what, I'll kill you!

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.410
Sparkle

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.900
I've learned all of your powers.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.560
My ultimate speed...

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.560
Here's a band-aid.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.120
You'll never see it coming!

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.120
I don't want it.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.680
I'll stab you in the back!

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.940
Die, Jotaro!

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.400
Wh-What?!

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.860
Shit! I missed! I tripped on that dog!

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.870
Where did that dog come from?!

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.560
Hey, it's Iggy.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.450
What are you eating? Some candy?

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.690
Eating that right off the ground...
What a filthy mutt.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.380
Th-That river is...

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.490
The Nile River!

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.430
N-No, this can't be real!

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.930
At this rate, I'm going to fall in the river!

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.930
If I fall into the river, I'm done for! I'll rust away!

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.520
Someone stop me!

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.320
Yes! On this air current,
I'll hit that wall and stop!

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.110
Lucky!

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.780
What?!

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:11.710
Shit! I was so panicked, I accidentally used
my power to phase through the wall!

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.880
I'm going to fall!

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.930
Yes! A boat appeared! I'm saved!

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.430
If I stick in the boat,

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.420
the boatman will get curious
and try to pull me out.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.130
Then, I'll take over his mind!

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:32.470
Once I control the boatman,
I'll begin my counterattack on Jotaro!

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.520
Ack! A cow was on the boat!

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.230
W-Wait! Stop struggling! Hey!

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.740
Calm down, you stupid cow!

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.610
I know! I'll take over the cow's mind!

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.610
And then...

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.450
I won't make it in time!

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.170
Hey, look. That cow over there's
freaking out about something.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:04.030
Good grief. Who cares?
Just go get the old man and Avdol.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.490
Help!

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:27.110
H-Hey, fishies. Come here a sec.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.390
Come on, touch me.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.450
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.030
Hey, Mr. Crab.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.350
Come on, take me up to the surface.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.500
I'll give you something good to eat.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.710
Wait! Don't leave me, Mr. Crab!

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.950
I'll be rusted through in couple of days!

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.670
H-Help me!

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.530
Don't leave me!

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.680
I'm so alone!

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.560
Anubis

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.680
Anubis Retires

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.130
Stupid mutt.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.450
What are you looking at?

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.510
There's nothing to eat over there.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.210
Wha—

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.580
I-It stinks!

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.140
What the hell do you eat to make
your farts smell like this?!

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.590
Polnareff...

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.100
To think, all of that happened without us.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.420
The Anubis Stand, huh...
That must have been rough, Jotaro.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.430
Yeah...

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.060
Stop! Get off of me!

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.060
I'm never going anywhere with him again.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:53.520
Stop it already, you stupid mutt!

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.040
Star Platinum

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.040
Jotaro Kujo

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.760
Though they may all look similar to tourists,
there are many races that live in Egypt.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.410
This is a typical Egyptian,

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.490
wearing a garment called a jellabiya.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.100
This man is a Nubian.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.210
This is a Bedouin, a man of the desert.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.630
This is an Indian, who has nothing to do with this.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.480
And this doesn't have much to do with race, but...

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.910
Hey! That chick's legs are smokin'! So hot!

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.230
I can't keep my eyes off of her.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.680
Like, bam! They pull you right in!

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.060

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.800
Is something wrong, Mr. Joestar?

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.720
There is something wrong!

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.010
What do you think you're doing,
you old pervert?!

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.340
Something is wrong.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.140
When you encounter something
you aren't supposed to touch...

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.920
My body!

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.600
...that just makes you want to touch it.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.070
