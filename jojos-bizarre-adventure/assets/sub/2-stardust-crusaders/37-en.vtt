00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.280
What the?!

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.200
Yes!

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.430
Now, Hol Horse, stick your fingers
up Polnareff's nose, and then...

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.690
Jam

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.720
Yay! Everyone is bleeding and out cold!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.720
Lucky you, Hol Horse!
This is your chance to kill them all!

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.750
So, when the hell is this chance coming?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720
What am I supposed to do now?

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.750
Ache

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.440
What the hell are you doing, Hol Horse?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.610
I'd like to know myself!

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.320
What's the matter, Polnareff?

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.320
Sh-Shit! Th-The other three are coming this way!

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.360
Damn it!

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.880
How am I supposed to make it
like the prediction from here?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.580
Polnareff, did you find the guy following us?

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.760
Answer us.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.210
Avdol and the others are c-coming.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.620
This is bad... Very bad!

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.140
Chario—

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.740
Whoa, now!

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.720
Crap...

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.640
Y-Yes! I'm faster.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.770
Don't move. I'll shoot!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.350
Hey, can you hear me, Polnareff?

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.240
Hey, Polnareff!

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.340
Oh, there you are.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.970
What's the matter?

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.680
Was someone following us, after all?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.840
E-Er...

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.760
Damn it! I've been cornered.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.520
What was this about me getting

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.100
this lucky chance to beat them

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.360
if I stuck my fingers up Polnareff's nose?!

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.780
This situation is the exact opposite!

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.240
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.240
Stardust Crusaders

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.790
Episode 37  Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 2

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.450
Is something the matter, Polnareff?

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.000
No...

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.250
If Avdol were to find me now, I'd be killed!

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.480
I feel like crying.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.740
If I'd known this was going to happen, I would've

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.010
just used my gun in the first place.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.080
Mondatta, that bastard.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.820
If nothing else, my gun was faster
than Polnareff's sword just now.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.020
Damn it!

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.770
Polnareff?

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.880
Hurry up and get them to leave!

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.900
If they do find me,
I can at least kill you, Polnareff.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.560
N-No one was following us.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.780
It was just my imagination.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.760
I see...

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.920
By the way, what are you doing in that corner?

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.240
Tell them you were about to take a piss. A piss!

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.520
W-Well, you know... I needed to take a piss.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.040
What?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.440
Seriously, you were taking a piss?

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.140
That's an embarrassing thing
to do in the middle of a city.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.400
Damn bastard, jabbing that gun into my head...

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.700
I know! I'll send them a signal.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.200
Come on, guys. Figure it out.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.210
Lick

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.210
Lick

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.210
Lick

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.010
Look where my tongue is pointing!

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.220
It's a sign for you to look behind me! Behind me!

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.980
Behind me, damn it! Behind me!

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.830
Why are they being so quiet?

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.530
A-Anyway, that's what's up.
You guys can go on ahead.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.720
All right.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.800
That was a lie!

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.750
A lie! Don't go!

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.640
Look at my tongue. Behind me!

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.420
Behind me, damn it! Figure it out!

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.400
Is something wrong?

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.990
Why are you making that face?

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.500
Does your tongue hurt?

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.510
No, I think he's saying something's behind—

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.700
Idiot! Don't say it!

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.310
You don't mean...

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.890
P-Polnareff!

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.790
Did you give them...

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.470
some kind of signal?!

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.390
Damn it! I'm pissed off now!

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.000
I'll... I'll kill you!

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.070
Die!

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.360
What?!

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.830
Huh?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.330
Hey, he's...

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.710
Wh-What? You're kidding me! He sneezed?!

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.170
It's Hol Horse. Be careful!

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.930
There's someone under that box, too!

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.480
You can't be serious. This is impossible.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.160
Sticking my fingers up his nose made him sneeze!

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.940
Damn it! If he hadn't sneezed,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.820
I could have at least killed Polnareff.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.790
I should have never teamed
up with you, Mondatta!

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.280
I'm going to be killed!

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.020
I failed thanks to your prediction, damn it!

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.290
I'm doomed.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.040
B-Bro, look! That one guy is over there.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.760
That's him, all right.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.180
He's the bastard who blew my ear
off outta nowhere at the airport.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.310
I'll run him over!

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.390
What?!

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.150
Crash

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.580
Th-This is...

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.670
It was so sudden, even they
couldn't get their Stands

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.080
out in time to avoid the truck...

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.520
I stuck my fingers up his nose,
and the prediction came true.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.630
I can't believe it. All four of them at once...

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.720
It is fate, yes.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.760
My premonitions are absolute.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.220
But it's too early to finish them off.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.520
We must see what the next prediction says, yes.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.170
Okay!

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.930
Emperor

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.940
Hol Horse

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.700
Crash

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.700
"Yay! The chance to kill them has arrived!

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.410
But be careful.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.070
We should hide and see how things go."

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.920
"It's still too soon to get close to them.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.340
The other three have passed out,
but Jotaro's still awake.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:40.410
Dash

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.420
He's standing up!"

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.490
So Jotaro dodged the truck just a second before.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.700
That was close.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.780
If I had carelessly closed in,
he would've countered.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.390
He's looking for me.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:09.160
He must be wondering why I disappeared
without finishing them off.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.950
You want to beat them, don't you, Mondatta?

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.100
After all we've been through,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.160
we've got to win, no matter what.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.500
Right, Mondatta?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.750
Yeah...

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.510
We're just one step away from victory.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.540
So Mondatta, what do we have
to do to finish them off?

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.880
Your comic's predictions are 100% absolute.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.280
I believe them.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.880
I'll do whatever they tell me to.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.230
If it's sticking my fingers up something, I'll do it.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.770
If I have to eat shit, I'll do it in a heartbeat.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.850
I want to win!

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.040
Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-There it is!

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.510
I-It has finally appeared, yes.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.790
Th-The final prediction!

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.660
What?

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.000
Bam

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:58.000
Now, Hol Horse's next attack will be the climax!

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.670
Hol Horse found some guys
working on sewage pipes.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.330
He paid them so they'd
open up a section of the pipes.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.810
If Hol Horse fires all of his bullets
into that pipe at noon sharp...

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.830
Bang Bang

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.810
Hey, looks like there was a
car accident around the corner.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.360
Just leave it. Let's hurry up and finish this job.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.700
Hold this pipe for a sec.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.750
Okay.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.900
Menacing

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.530
Menacing

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.550
Wh-What's going to happen if I fire into that pipe?

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.600
Hurry up and turn the page!

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.150
What's going to happen when I
shoot my bullets into that pipe?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.850
The bullets will come shooting out of the pipe.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:11.280
Boom! Hol Horse's bullets shot through his brain!

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.910
Right smack in the middle of his forehead!

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.490
Y-Yay!

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.870
It finally appeared, yes.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.000
I was waiting for this, yes.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.480
I was waiting for this prediction, yes.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.840
This is amazing!

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.480
<font size="24" color="#e6e8d8">Boom</c>

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.570
I-It's amazing, but hang on!

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.530
We'll be in trouble if we interpret it wrong.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.770
L-Look at this page from earlier.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.770
Kabam

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.420
This is the prediction that appeared
before your brother got blown up.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.440
This is what happened to your brother!

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.220
Th-That's because my brother
had the ability to transform,

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.320
and transformed without thinking, yes.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.140
But y-you and I cannot transform, yes.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.150
That's... That's right! I can't transform!

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.710
I won't even attempt to act like Jotaro.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.210
Wh-Which means...

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.460
Th-That's correct, yes.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.470
I'll be able to avenge my brother, yes.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.100
There is no mistake in this prediction, yes.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.100
Bang Bang

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:24.370
If you shoot your bullets into
this pipe, Jotaro will die, yes.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.580 line:20%
Bam

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.570
But wait.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.780
It mentions a specific time.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.320
At noon sharp?

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.990
Wait, noon sharp?!

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.330
There's only two minutes left until noon!

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:52.840
D-Don't panic. Y-You just have
to shoot into the pipe, yes.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.070
You have plenty of time, yes.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.740
It is fate. It will happen.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.600
I-I know. It's 100%!

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.420
I believe... I believe, but...

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.940
Since there's a specific time...

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.420
It's making me panic!

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.860
H-Hey, you guys! Listen up.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.360
Take a section of this pipe off.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.580
Hurry up!

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.750
Hey, who do you think you're talking to?

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.250
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.840
I'll kill you! Hurry up and open it!

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.260
M-Mr. Hol Horse, ordinary people
cannot see your Stand, yes.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.160
And the comics say to pay them, yes.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.480
What? Pay?

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.400
I only have a minute and ten seconds left!

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.470
I'll pay!

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.200
A-A-All right! Sorry! I'll pay you, so open it!

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.630
Please! I beg of you!

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.330
Pay us? What a weirdo.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.570
You'll pay us just for opening it?

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.330
Okay, then, sure. Hurry up and pay us.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.910
R-Right...

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.460
Hey, what's the problem?

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:13.840
I don't have any money!

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.720
Th-That's right! I forgot it at the hotel.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.260
What the hell?

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.010
M-Mondatta...

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.200
I gave you a coin purse just
in case you got lost, didn't I?

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.570
Give it to me. Hurry!

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.310
R-Right.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.270
There's only forty seconds left. Hurry!

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.310
I-It's mostly coins, but...
Here's the coin purse.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.200
Hey, I saw one fly over there into the shadows.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.060
It's just change, but there's quite a bit.
How much is there?

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.040
At least twenty pounds!
Hey, you're stepping on one.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.630
Oh, you're right.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.340
Pick it up later! You can have it all!

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.230
Everyone, it's coming up noon.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.910
I've poured some tea,

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.310
so why don't you take a lunch break?

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.150
Oh, good idea.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.470
Damn you, old woman!
This comes first! Butt out!

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.490
Thanks, ma'am.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:20.030
Grarr

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.470
God damn it! I said to hurry up and open it!

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.600
Or I'll split your heads open with this rock!

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.790
I-It's open.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.150
Out of the way!

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.560
Die, Jotaro!

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.760
I did it! I shot into it at noon sharp,
just like in the prediction!

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.550
Go!

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.270
Wake up, old man.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.550
I-I'm mostly all right...

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.660
I, too, am merely scratched.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.240
More importantly, Polnareff is...

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.870
Someone get this damn block off of me.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:18.920
We won!

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.420
Jotaro's face is right in front of the pipe!

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.780
What?!

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.750
Hey, man.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.220
Sorry, Jotaro.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.270
I don't know what the hell
Hol Horse was thinking,

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.830
but he stuck his fingers right up my nose.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.240
How disgusting.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.080
It still itches. Sorry.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.590
M-My bullets...

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.590
They missed!

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.620
Mondatta! Wh-What the hell is going on?!

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.570
What the hell?!

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.720
I-I do not know, yes.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.480
M-My premonitions are absolute! It is fate!

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.160
I can't believe it!

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.990
My premonitions have never
ever been wrong, yes!

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.370
Look! Jotaro and the others are alive.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.620
None of my bullets hit them!

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.290
It's totally different from the prediction!

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.950
You little...

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.590
Please tune in again tomorrow.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.220
And now for the news at noon...

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.100
Huh?

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.670
Huh?!

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.890
What?! It's noon now?

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.520
M-My watch... My watch...

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.600
It's fast!

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:04.310
Wh-Which means I shot my bullets <i>before</i> noon.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.920
It's noon right now!

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.910
What the hell is going to happen?

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.450
What's going to happen next?!

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.540
I-It can't be...

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.340
According to this prediction, the bullets

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.810
I shot were supposed to hit Jotaro dead-on.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.130
The direction...

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.840
Boom

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.690
What the hell is going to happen next?!

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.210
<c.colord80552>Bam</c>

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.950
Hey, I heard screaming around that corner.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.520
I don't know what's going on, but it's not good.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.620
After what happened with the truck,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.020
it'll make trouble for us if the cops show up.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.200
Let's get out of here.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:01.030
What the hell happened to Hol Horse, anyway?

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.130
I don't know.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.990
He disappeared for some reason.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.170
Hey, it's dangerous to hang
around that pipe, Jotaro.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.260
It's spraying filthy water.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.590
Is he dead?

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.310
No, just in critical condition.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.300
I have no idea what happened, though.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.370
It looks like a bullet went through his
forehead and out the top of his head.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.310
One centimeter down,
and he would have been dead.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.870
Talk about a lucky man.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.230
My prediction wasn't wrong.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.860
And... this was Hol Horse's fate.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.800
But that Jotaro...

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.160
How lucky can he be?

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.850
My brother and Hol Horse lost against fate.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:08.050
The only one who could face
someone so lucky is Lord DIO.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:15.100
Zenyatta... Looking at Hol Horse,

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.360
I'm starting to think revenge is really stupid.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:22.330
Let's just forget about Jotaro and his friends.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.300
If we use my Stand's predictions
not for attacking others,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.910
but for our happiness and
to help people in trouble...

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.870
People would love us,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.540
and I bet more good luck would come our way.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:46.860
I'm sick of spending my life cowering
under a box, afraid of everyone.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.640
This fight has forced me to grow.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.400
I'm going back, Brother.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.360
To Aswan, to where you are.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.840
S-Sorry. I kicked it without thinking.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.890
I didn't mean to hit you.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.420
Forgive me.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.170
Wait, th-this dog...

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.350
Swell

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.350
I've seen it before, but where?

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.930
Th-This dog! It couldn't be...

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.930
No!

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.400
Hey, by the way, where'd that dumbass dog go?

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.490
Iggy?

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.920
I'm sure he's eating something
off the street somewhere.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.160
I told you that he'd be useless.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.270
If it were that easy to change your
personality and grow as a person,

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.020
no one would ever suffer.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.890
Mondatta became even
more depressed than before,

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.230
and was admitted to the
hospital with Hol Horse.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.220
Ba-dum-tss!

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.930
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.230
Iggy hates being with others.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.000
I was looking for you
because I have a request.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.400
No doubt about it. It's this mansion.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.030
By the way, where'd Iggy go?

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.950
Good grief. I can't let a kid who likes dogs die.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.950
Episode 38

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.950
The Guardian of Hell, Pet Shop,
Part 1
