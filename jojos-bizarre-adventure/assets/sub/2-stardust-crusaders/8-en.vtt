00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.090
Hey, you!

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.980
You! I'm talking to you!

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.500
Huh?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.770
You! You threw this trash, didn't you?

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.290
That's a fine of five
hundred Singapore dollars!

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.760
What? Five hundred?

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.170
In Singapore, the law says
you will be fined for littering!

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.930
Five hundred Singapore dollars...

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.400
That's about 40,000 yen.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.180
Trash?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.060
Got it?

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.180
Trash?

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.400
What are you talking about?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.100
I don't see anything here
besides my own luggage.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.870
Would you be so kind as to tell me
what trash you're referring to?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.790
Where is this trash, sir?

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.170
That's your luggage?

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.800
That's right.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.780
I-I'm terribly sorry.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.810
Well, I'll be going, then...

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.720
Shoo, shoo.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.140
What's with the kid?
She's still following us.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.770
Hey, weren't you going to go see your father?

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.110
Why don't you stop following us and get going?

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.120
I'm meeting up with him in five days.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.330
I can go wherever I want!

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.680
I'm not taking orders from you guys.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.540
She'll be in danger if she stays with us.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.680
Maybe she doesn't have any money.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.410
All right...

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.830
I guess we can pay for her hotel room.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.050
Polnareff, bring her,
but don't hurt her pride.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.930
Got it.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.930
Hey!

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.450
You're poor, right?

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.600
We'll pay for you, so come with us.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.140
Well then, let us check in...

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.790
R-Right...

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.950
I'm terribly sorry, but we are
rather full at this time of year.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.630
The rooms won't be next to each other.
Is that all right?

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.480
Well, I guess we don't have a choice.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.680
Then for the rooms...

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.000
Avdol and I will share a room...

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.120
Jotaro and I will share a room,
since we're both students.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.510
That would mean the last
room would be Polnareff and...

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.800
You're joking! Like I'd room with him!

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.920
What?

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.770
Well, she is a child, but also a lady...

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.150
Could you make it four rooms?

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.240
Yes.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.990
Hmph! I can relax more in my own room anyway!

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.490
Nothing would suit me better!

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.460
Let's go.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.730
We've been through hell since we left Hong Kong.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.290
Let's hurry up and take a shower where it's safe.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.110
See ya!

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.880
I guess you guys aren't going
to give us a chance to rest...

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.770
Come out.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.450
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.450
Stardust Crusaders

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.100
Episode 8: Devil

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.240
Thrum

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.190
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.540
That's some sharp killing intent you've got there.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.870
Why don't you let me know your name

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.000
before I, Polnareff, kill you.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.310
My name is Soul Sacrifice.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.130
My Stand suggests the card called The Devil.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.510
It evokes a curse's dark manipulations,
deteriorating mental health,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.340
and an inauspicious path of ruin and downfall.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.770
How did you know I was in the fridge?

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.250
Seriously,

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.890
are you that stupid?

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.840
You took everything out of the fridge and

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.170
didn't bother putting any of it away!

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.780
Ebony Devil!

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.410
Silver Chariot!

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.570
Talk about pathetic.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.220
The ape we met the other
day was a much more powerful

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.630
and terrifying Stand user than you.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.620
N-Now you've done it, Polnareff!

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.040
How dare you do this to me?!

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.660
It hurts! It really hurts!

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.370
What's with him?

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.480
It hurts!

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.740
Curse you...

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.600
How dare you?! How dare you do that?!

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.130
Now I can really hold a grudge against you!

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:27.220
Such... Such painful agony must be avenged!

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.760
I let you find me and attack me on purpose!

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.860
H-He's gone...

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.870
He disappeared?

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.730
Wh-What's going on?

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.540
Slash

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.040
I-I can't believe it! When did he cut me?

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.800
I-I don't think I felt an attack...
No, I'm sure I didn't feel it.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.770
Mr. Joestar! A Stand user
was hiding in my room!

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.310
Wait, are you Avdol?!

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.990
Anyway, listen! He's completely baffling.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.600
I can't tell if he's strong or weak...

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.190
H-He was just creepy!

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.450
He ran away... damn it, what the hell?

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.610
Don't let your guard down!
My leg's suddenly been cut open.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.830
Soul Sacrifice, who suggests The Devil?

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.580
You're positive that's what he said?

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.420
Yeah. But no matter how much I think,
it still doesn't make sense.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.980
I know for a fact that I
saw a glimpse of his Stand.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.540
But even though I don't remember an attack,

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.190
my leg's been gouged.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.470
Anyway!

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.400
I'll be there in five minutes.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.160
Room 1212, on the twelfth floor, right?

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.840
Contact Kakyoin and Jotaro for me, too! Later!

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.520
This is the front desk.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.590
Hello? Room service?

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.470
I hurt my leg a bit...

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.880
Could you bring up some kind
of medicine and some bandages?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.450
This is Polnareff in room 912.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.290
Understood. We'll bring it up immediately.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.970
Aw, man...

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.460
I got hurt in the pants that I
hadn't washed or even worn yet.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.970
Damn it...

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.540
Do you know about the one
who attacked Polnareff, Avdol?

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.440
Indeed.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.180
Soul Sacrifice.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.270
An assassin who claims to be
a Native American medicine man.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.450
But he's a terrifying Stand user.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.590
Mafioso, militaries, and politicians

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.040
from all around the world hire him.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.150
I've seen Soul Sacrifice once before.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.920
He was covered in wounds,

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.510
and those wounds were all obtained

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.840
by provoking his enemy to attack.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.030
He controls his Stand through the power
of its grudge against that attacker.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.060
That's why, to ordinary people,
it seems like a curse killed the victims.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.350
And Polnareff fell for that?

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.600
Sadly, yes.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.660
What kind of Stand does he use?

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.870
No one knows.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.850
Everyone who meets him ends up killed.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.960
Right now, it's dangerous
to leave Polnareff alone.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.040
Or any of us.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:40.370
So he might be able to pick us off, one by one...

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.200
He'll be here in five minutes.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.460
Everyone meet up in this room.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.150
Got it. We'll all meet up in room 1212, old man.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.680
What's going on, Jojo?

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.470
Let's go. Apparently we're in danger.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.440
That's weird. I can't find my room key.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.740
I could have sworn I set it here...

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.990
Damn it! Where is it?

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.740
If I don't have my key,
I won't be able to get back in here.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.240
Could I just tell the front desk?

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.490
Is there a fine for that?

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:22.010
There it is. Must've fallen
during all the commotion earlier.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:31.800
Wha...

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:34.970
What?!

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.850
Wh-What's...

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.360
I-Is this shampoo?! Damn it! My eyes!

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.160
Who's there?!

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.800
Th-This isn't good!

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.830
Being trapped under the bed isn't good!

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.820
Mr. Polnareff, this is room service.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.220
I've brought your medicine.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.720
Get away! You'll be killed!

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.970
Huh? Wh-What has happened here?!

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.100
Get out of here!
I told you, you'll be killed!

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.860
Loom

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.750
Slam

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.570
How dare you?!

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:08.810
How dare you stab one of
my eyes out, Polnareff?!

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.410
A doll?! That's the...

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.580
Silver Chariot!

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.530
Are you stupid?!

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:22.190
Your Stand isn't one that
can fight where you can't see!

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.010
Ebony Devil

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.010
Soul Sacrifice

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.850
Oh, Jojo.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.400
Did you need something?

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.610
So you are here.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.830
Listen up. Don't leave this room for a while.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:54.550
Huh?

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.580
I'll come for you again later.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.210
Don't open the door to any stranger, got it?

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.620
O-Okay...

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.910
Stab

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.690
Damn it! How heavy is this bed, anyway?!

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.620
It's at least 120 kilograms...

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.760
I have to use Silver Chariot to cut this cord...

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.440
Y-You bastard!

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.300
As soon as I stop attacking, this happens.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.980
Even if I can't see, I'm just
gonna have to keep stabbing away!

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.780
You suck!

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.570
Looks like even a knight
can't cut open a watermelon

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.210
when he can't see!

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.980
Talk about dense!

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.360
You bastard...

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.230
Give a rest already...

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.190
You little shrimp!

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.190
It's just you two?

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.860
What happened to the girl?

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.510
Well, we went to check on her...

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.340
But she's not a Stand user, so we thought that

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.870
we might be putting her in
more danger by bringing her here.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:34.250
Good point. So that just leaves Polnareff.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.880
But man, is he late...

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.380
It's already been way over five minutes.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.890
Let me go!

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.310
I've caught you.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.890
I'm going to snap your spear in half.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.280
All right.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.200
Damn it... But a-at least I
finally managed to cut the cord...

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.150
I need to return Chariot under the
bed and get the hell out of here.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.460
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.110
Huh?

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.340
Hey, Polnareff!

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.590
I'm gonna bite your balls off now, man!

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.800
What an obscene guy.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.430
Chariot!

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.320
Whoa, there.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.540
I'm gonna run off to a
place you can't see now.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.040
You numbskull!

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.090
Try giving the floor you're
stuck to a good feel.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.900
Th-This is...

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.150
It's soaked with beer, juice, and alcohol!

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.340
I spilled them on purpose!

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.720
If I could take a piss,

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.060
I would have done that to
make it even more wet.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.090
And now... what do you
think I'm gonna do with this

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.170
short-circuiting hair
dryer and that wet spot,

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.670
Polnareff?

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.820
I'm not gonna dry you off!

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.760
Die!

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.170
This should take care of my grudge...

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.600
Polnareff!

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.280
You're not the only one who's
been scattering stuff around!

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.160
H-How did you know where
I was on top of the bed...

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.880
so precisely?!

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.340
I broke a mirror!

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.460
So I can see the top of the
bed really well from this angle.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.420
At last, we meet.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.050
Whoa, there.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.060
Hey, Soul Sacrifice.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.920
I have a question for you.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.660
I'm looking for a man with two right arms.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.530
How about you tell me
who that guy's Stand is?

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.960
You idiot! No assassin
reveals their Stand's identity!

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.690
The only time they reveal it is
when they or their opponent is dying!

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.440
With stupid Stand users like you guys
who keep showing off your Stands,

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.420
we already know all your weak points!

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.400
If it weren't for that mirror,
I would have killed you by now!

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.340
All right. Come at me one more time.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.500
What's wrong?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.180
Didn't you say you were going to
bite off my balls or something?

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.880
Just try it, you vulgar little shit!

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.770
Bang

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.550
I'm gonna...

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.210
slice up everything <i>except</i> your balls!

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.940
Ka-ba-ba-bang

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.770
Gyaaah

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.410
Excuse me, sir.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.780
It seems that you've been
in the bathroom a long time.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.070
Are you all right?

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.960
Soul Sacrifice

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.000
Bam

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.370
Soul Sacrifice's... Last Moments

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.240
Polnareff, you're finally here.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.090
You're not very punctual.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.920
All right, everyone.
We're gonna get right to it.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.840
Let's figure out what we're going
to do if Soul Sacrifice attacks us.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.400
I-I'm so tired...

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.030
Silver Chariot

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.030
Jean Pierre Polnareff

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.440
Answer me!

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.270
Why was there a dead
boy's body in your room?

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.650
And the dead body
that was in the bathroom...

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.410
They're connected, aren't they?!

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.040
Answer me!

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.860
I have the right to remain silent.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.420
You're finally here!
I've been waiting for you.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.960
I had the Speedwagon Foundation
take some measures.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.430
Polnareff should be released soon enough.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.890
But that was close.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.420
To think that the enemy's
pursuit would come so early...

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.440
As long as DIO's body is Jonathan Joestar's,

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.610
he'll know about everything that Jotaro and I do.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.260
That's why he keeps coming after
us without a moment's rest.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.100
But on the other hand, we're able
to read DIO's thoughts, too.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.040
I'll go buy a Polaroid camera.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.610
You don't have to do that.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.630
I can create a spirit photo
even without a camera.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.670
What?

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.260
Michael's not here yet? Where's Michael?

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.770
This week's number three jumps
up five points from last week...

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.640
The price of gold today is...

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.090
You look delicious, meow.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.190
What?!

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:40.030
The channels seem to be changing chaotically.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.680
It's trying to connect words
from the TV into a sentence.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.040
It's more spirit audio than spirit photo.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.540
There...

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.540
...is...

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.040
...a...

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.550
There! It said, "There is a"!

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.550
...trai...

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.170
...tor...

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:56.970
...among...

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:57.880
...us...

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.170
What? What did it just...

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.560
I'm pretty sure I heard,
"There is a traitor among us..."

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.510
Ka...

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.260
...kyo...

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.060
...in...

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.240
...Beware...

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.810
...of...

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.670
...him...

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:11.840
Di...

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.370
...o's...

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:12.900
...ser...

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.730
...va...

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:14.430
...nt...

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.610
Kakyoin?! Wh-What?!

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.050
I-Impossible. Kakyoin is DIO's servant?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.560
This is...

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.010
Joseph Joestar,

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.000
you're watching, aren't you?!

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:35.960
DIO!

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.970
He found us! Look out!

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.410
B-But what does that mean?

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.430
It's just as you heard.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.560
It said quite clearly that
Kakyoin is DIO's servant

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.690
and that he will betray us.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.110
It can't be!

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.610
I trust Kakyoin.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.830
There must be a reason.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:05.120
But if he is indeed communicating with DIO,

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.060
he could take our heads while
we're sleeping at any time.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.500
He'd be DIO's Trojan Horse!

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.320
Where is Kakyoin?

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.420
He's with Jotaro.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.950

Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.670
Hey, Jotaro. Are you
going to eat that cherry?

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.480
Hey, what are you doing,
Kakyoin? They'll die!

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.900
Could he really be a traitor?

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.230
A back-breaker? Such a drastic move!

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.030
This is unforgivable, isn't it?

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 9
