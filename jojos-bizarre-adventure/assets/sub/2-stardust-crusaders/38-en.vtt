Previously, on </i>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure<i>...

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.610
The building in this picture, huh?

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.020
I've been repairing roofs in Cairo for forty years,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.160
but I've never seen this place.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.710
My daughter's condition has worsened.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.390
She'll only last three or four more days.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.210
I can feel it.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.760
DIO is near here.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.660
Let's go.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.850
If we keep asking around, we'll find him.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.190
Man, it's super hot today.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.590
I haven't had a bath since yesterday.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.700
My good looks are going to waste.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.180
What the hell, man?!

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.070
Do you want something from me?

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.300
How dense are you?!

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.390
I'm telling you to get out of my way!

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.710
You're a foreigner.
Don't sit here like you're a beggar!

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740
Who the hell gave you permission?

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.260
Ah, are you a needy foreigner?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.170
This isn't much, but here you go.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.250
Hey, this is...

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.260
Y-You bastard! How dare you?!

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.540
Th-This is my territory, damn it!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.670
Territory?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.220
Hey, Polnareff!

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.890
Don't sit there.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.410
And give that money to him.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.400
Is this guy a beggar?

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.650
Sorry. My friend doesn't
know much about this city.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.240
You should have just said so in the first place.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.490
I'm a beggar who can't speak in
public for professional reasons.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.830
This city has a beggars' association.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.630
Each beggar has an established territory

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.960
where he's paid to sit and do his work.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.670
That may seem strange,
but without rules like this,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.340
there'd be chaos in the streets.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.920
Huh...

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.400
Even worse, you hurt my pride!

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.430
I wonder if I'd earn more if I
dressed up like a needy foreigner...

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.660
Maybe I'll start doing that.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.140
By the way, I thought you looked familiar.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.390
Aren't you Avdol, the fortune teller?

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.440
I heard that someone was trying
to kill you, so you fled to Japan.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.030
I've been looking for you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.660
to ask a favor, since you hear
much and remember it well.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.660
I'll pay well.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.000
We need to find the location shown in this picture,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.230
and we're in a bit of a hurry.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.590
Fwoosh

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.060
I'm done with work for the day.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.060
I can find the place from
that picture in three hours.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.350
Wait right there.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.020
Hey... Where did Iggy go, anyway?

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.250
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.250
Stardust Crusaders

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.210
Episode 38  The Guardian of Hell, Pet Shop, Part 1

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.170
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:43.880
Menacing

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.790
There's no doubt about it.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.440
That's the mansion.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.670
I found it in two hours.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.520
There's nothing in this city that I can't find.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.870
Huh?

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.050
Crash

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.620
Iggy then thought to himself...

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.180
That bird is a Stand user like me.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.930
A Stand of ice dropped that thing.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.140
And he's protecting this mansion.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.300
He eliminates those who try to enter it.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.860
Wh-Which means that bird

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.200
will come after me next!

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.160
Since ancient times,
the Egyptians had been hunting

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.540
using falcons that would glide
through the Nile Valley.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.170
The falcon was called Horus,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.530
and was highly regarded as the
guardian deity of the royal family.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.540
Its eye, which can spot small
animals several kilometers away,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.230
is called the Eye of Horus.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.560
The Eye of Horus is a design
symbolizing fortune and glory.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.560
His name is Pet Shop.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.490
His Stand suggests the
god of the heavens, Horus.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.770
Iggy thought to himself...

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.470
I-It appears that I've stumbled upon

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.830
the mansion Joestar and the others
want to find, where that guy DIO lives.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:34.830
And...

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.960
It was that Stand's power that
dropped that chunk of ice.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.590
So he's not a guard dog, but a guard bird.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:09:05.860
Menacing

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.860
Y-You've got to be kidding me.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.040
I've got nothing to do with this DIO guy.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.480
I was dragged to Egypt against my will

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.330
and ended up traveling with
Joestar's gang. That's all!

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.860
Like hell I'm going to fight!

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.920
I just want to live comfortably,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.200
fall in love with a hot bitch,
and live a peaceful, carefree life.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.760
Like hell I'm going to do something as
dangerous as fighting this violent jerk

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.960
when I'm not gonna get anything out of it!

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.310
I'm just gonna act like a dumb mutt

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.450
so he'll think I've got nothing to do with this.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.430
Those eyes...

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.870
I can't tell what that bird's
thinking from his eyes.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.020
I don't think I'd lose to him in a Stand battle,

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.520
but I've worked hard to act like an idiot.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.630
I've got nothing to do with this!

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.890
Hurry up and go back to
the mansion, you birdbrain.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.520
Oh, it's a bird.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.060
What's with that bird?
I-It's not even trying to dodge!

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.480
I-I can't stop in time!

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.360
I-I'm gonna run it over!

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.130
Wh-What was with that bird?

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.030
I-It was able to go under the car,
despite how low it is?

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.390
A bird that didn't even try to flee,

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.180
but actually charged toward the car...

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.510
Wh-What a crazy bastard...

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.680
Anyway, it looks like he's lost interest in me.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.750
He only attacks if you try to enter the mansion.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.690
If Joestar and the others actually find this place,

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.450
they'll have a hell of a time trying to get in.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.960
Well, it's not my problem.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.200
Chibi! Buchi!

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.440
Chibi! Buchi! Where are you?

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.260
Hey, have you seen my two dogs?

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.920
Their names are Chibi and Buchi.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.500
Shut up! Don't ask me, I'm a dog.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.640
It's not like I can talk. Are you stupid?

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.440
Th-That collar...

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.690
This is Chibi's collar!

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.550
Why is Chibi's collar under the gate?

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.440
And there's blood on it!

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.440
Chibi and Buchi...

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.660
Does he mean those two big dogs from earlier?

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.280
Chibi! Buchi!

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.990
Hey, you're not...

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.910
You're not trying to get
under that gate, are you?

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.750
You'll be killed!

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.150
Chibi! Buchi! Are you here?

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.510
Chibi! Buchi!

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.010
Chibi! Buchi!

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.300
This isn't my problem.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.880
I don't care if some human kid dies.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.770
Survival of the fittest is the law of nature.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.430
Buchi! Chibi!

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.520
Idiots die. The careless die.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.140
I'm don't want any trouble.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.750
See ya!

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.300
Chibi! Buchi! Where are you?

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.990
Come back!

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.210
Bam

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.720
He's eating them! No!

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.620
Good grief.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.990
I can't just stand by and
let a boy who likes dogs

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.740
get killed!

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.700
Bang

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.000
Horus

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.000
Pet Shop

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.440
Chibi! Buchi!

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.030
Damn it! I guess I'm gonna have to fight.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.610
Stare

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.650
It seems this is the first time that

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.660
Pet Shop realized Iggy
was a Stand user like himself.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.960
You birdbrain! Come at me! I'll kill you!

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.470
The average speed of a falcon's descent
is over 300 kilometers per hour.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.430
There is no organism that can move faster.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.810
A falcon rips out its prey's vital organs

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.080
with its razor-sharp black talons while hunting.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.690
Even traveling at 300 kilometers per hour,

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.500
it can still pinpoint its prey's vital organs.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.850
What? Did he just smile?

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.080
It looked like the corners of its
rigid beak just edged up a little!

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.330
A smiling bird?

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.790
Wh-What is this?

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.750
Something's not right...

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.840
The air's gotten awfully cold...

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.700
I-Ice is coming out of the ground!

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.050
C-Crap!

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.770
My feet got stuck to the ground
while I was busy looking up!

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.870
My Stand's feet are also rooted by the ice...

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.310
Crap!

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:14.870
Icicles?!

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.730
But seriously, Avdol...

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.600
Do you think that sunglasses guy
can really find DIO's mansion?

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.730
If he can't find it,

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.250
then no one else can.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.460
He understands the complex geography
of Cairo better than anyone else.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.610
Believe in him and wait.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.440
You say that, but...

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.160
We looked around for three
days and couldn't find it.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
It's hard for me to believe that
he could find it in three hours.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.330
You're getting repetitive, Polnareff.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.040
Honestly. Can't you just calm down a bit?

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.590
I know it's hard not to feel anxious,

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.150
but all we can do now is rely on the
knowledge of those who live here.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.850
Jeez. I haven't seen Iggy for a while, either.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.640
Where the hell did that stupid mutt run off to?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.560
Iggy hates being part of any group.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.610
I'm sure he's close. He'll show up eventually.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.090
Aren't dogs supposed to like humans?

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.570
What a shitty, cynical little mutt.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.460
I managed to get away from him.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.270
That thing's ice took the
skin right off my paw pads...

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.920
Damn it! I should have
just let that human kid die.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.530
That bird's Stand is no joke.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.640
The ice it makes isn't normal.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.960
There's something more to it.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.750
I've got to hurry up and
get the hell out of here.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.920
Talk about holding a grudge!

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.280
Iggy has disappeared.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.080
Where did he disappear to?

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.530
Damn it...

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.220
That ruthless bastard doesn't hold back.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.700
But in the end, he's still just a bird.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.210
This place reeks, but I guess I've gotta deal it.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.490
I'll hide out down here for a while.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.210
Wh-What the hell is this bird?!

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.180
Bam

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:48.950
Hey.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.910
Talk about gullible.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.530
What you thought you killed was actually
just The Fool's shapeshifting sand!

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.170
All right! You must be pretty
stupid if you fell for that.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.740
Look at all that blood.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.090
You probably shouldn't move around.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:24.360
I never had any interest in you
or your master DIO, anyway.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.110
Let's just call it a draw.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.550
You got to shoot me up
with those ice missiles, too.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.980
Wh-What the hell?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.260
Do you think you're Bruce Lee or somethin'?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.860
Hey! I said I won't go near
your mansion anymore!

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.680
Let's stop this already. Okay?

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.200
So that's your Stand's actual design...

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.330
He used that thing to freeze
the wound and stop the bleeding!

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.710
C-Crap!

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.320
H-He blocked the exit with
ice when I wasn't looking!

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.090
The ice is coming this way!

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.920
Shit!

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.450
Ice is running all over the tunnel!

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.510
I-I've got to get out of this tunnel!

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.530
He blocked this exit, too!

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.630
He's planning to finish me off.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.100
Talk about excessive!

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.090
This goes way beyond holding a grudge.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.090
He's a machine made to hunt and kill!

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.220
Not to mention, if he catches me,
he'll eat me alive!

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.780
What?! M-My foot!

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.860
I-I can't get my foot out!

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.970
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.490
Man, this is really not my day!

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.800
That stupid dog.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.810
That birdbrain is really pissing me off.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.360
It wouldn't be strange if there was a Stand user

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.410
in charge of guarding the mansion.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.920
I'm gonna have to do this...

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.030
If I don't, he's going to kill me!

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
