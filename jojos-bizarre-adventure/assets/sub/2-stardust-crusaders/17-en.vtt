00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.730
Episode 17: The Lovers, Part 2

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.960
You made a nice bridge, Jotaro.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.060
Hey, Jotaro. My back itches.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.940
Scratch it!

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.080
A little lower.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.120
Lower...

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.810
Yeah, that's it.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.080
Don't dig your nails in so much.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.190
Mr. Joestar?

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.330
Hey, what's wrong?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.170
I-It feels like someone's tickling my back...

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.470
I can't concentrate on my Stand like this!

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.170
Mr. Joestar!

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.020
Wh-When did all of these people show up?

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.180
Mr. Joestar, keep your voice down!

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.470
People are staring!

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.630
Everyone will think you're nuts!

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.910
I-I'm not yelling for the fun of it!

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.670
Oh, no!

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.670
Poor man...

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.320
Let's give him some change.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.410
What is this?

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.200
It's not easy having an older relative like that.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.290
You said it.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.680
Kakyoin, go buy the TV.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.000
Let's get out of this crowd.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.090
R-Right.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.920
Are you the owner?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.790
Eh? Yes...

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.220
I'd like that TV.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.270
I can't believe Kakyoin's
Hierophant and Polnareff's Chariot

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.190
have shrunk themselves
and entered Joestar's body.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.970
They're trying to fight me?

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.820
I can see it!

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.110
I can see where they'll exit

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.820
the artery wall that leads to
the brain stem, and The Lovers.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.430
Over here!

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.050
We only have minutes left before the flesh bud

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.920
eats through Mr. Joestar's brain!

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.670
Hurry, you two!

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.290
There we go.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.850
All right!

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.290
Now, Mr. Joestar!

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.560
Hermit Purple!

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.850
Th-This is...

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.280
These tentacles are part the flesh bud!

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.300
We finally got to the brain stem,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.020
but the flesh bud's already grown so much.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.280
Damn it!

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.110
It's him!

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.660
L-Look!

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.270
He's using his scissor-like hands to
knead Mr. Joestar's brain cells

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.220
into a gooey mash, so he can
feed them to the flesh bud!

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.430
If we can't beat him and sever
all the flesh bud's roots quickly,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.080
it'll grow big enough to eat through his brain!

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.900
All right! I'll cut them apart!

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.110
No, not cut... I'll grate them!

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.320
Like a daikon radish!

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.310
Swish! Swish! Swish!

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.330
You bastard!

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.540
Now's our chance!

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.490
Slash

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.880
We did it!

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.740
N-No, that wasn't enough!

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.120
That thing's pretty fast, Kakyoin.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.290
But I've already seen through his moves.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.220
If that's the best he can move,
he's no match for...

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.980
Polnareff!

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.160
Who are you talking to?

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.230
H-Huh?

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.480
Polnareff, that's not me.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.600
And what you cut wasn't the Stand.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.230
Its form is breaking apart.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.740
Wh-What?!

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.410
I'm The Lovers!

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.290
Polnareff!

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.130
It was disguised!

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.260
It used the brain cells...

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.170
Mr. Joestar's brain cells!

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.050
He was using the mash of kneaded brain cells

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.930
to disguise himself as my Hierophant Green!

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.690
And what you defeated was merely
a dummy made of brain cells!

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.550
You were completely fooled, you idiots!

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.490
Come on!

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.870
What are you doing?

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.620
Shine those shoes right, Jotaro!

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.690
I'm in such a good mood right now!

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.440
I need you to shine my shoes until
they're as bright as I feel right now.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.300
I want the sunny sky to
reflect right off of them.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.270
If you want, you can use
your uniform to shine them.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.990
Actually, why not lick them clean?

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.140
Hey! You bastard!

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.740
What are you writing?!

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.240
Punched in the gut
Hit with a rock
Stole my wallet
Stole my watch
Walked on, like a bridge, over a dirty river

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.240
I'm writing down everything you owe me.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.240
Made me scratch his back
Made me shine his shoes
Kicked me

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.760
I'm going to make sure you pay it.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.120
I can be forgetful, so I'm writing it all down.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.140
Jotaro, you bastard...

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.110
Well, whatever. It won't matter in the end.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.180
Whoa! Kakyoin, look!

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.260
Look at that dummy's head!
The one I just cut open!

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.150
Wh-What in the world...

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.320
He's splitting into two!

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.080
Listen up.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.630
In this world, the one
who knows himself best wins!

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.640
In Aesop's fable,
the tortoise beats the hare,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.820
because the tortoise knew his own
psyche and abilities better than anyone!

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.940
The same goes for me.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.030
I know that I lack the power or speed necessary

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.740
to mortally wound either of you.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.310
Everything begins

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.600
once you've acknowledged your own weaknesses!

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.290
Emerald Splash!

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.740
Did it work?

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.170
M-More dummies made out of brain cells...

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.380
They're multiplying!

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.440
B-But a person can only have
one Stand. Only one is real!

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.690
Wh-Where's the real one?!

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.430
Right here!

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.560
Emerald Splash!

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.860
So close! I was right next to that one.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.620
The more we hit the wrong ones,
the more it multiplies!

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.570
No, no...

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.430
It's me...

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.560
It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.630
It's me, after all!

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.920
Polnareff, that's enough!

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.640
Withdraw your Stand.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.430
I can't bear to watch you get hurt
for the sake of my brain.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.370
Damn it!

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.560
I can't stand the thought
of leaving things like this.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.780
Withdraw your Stand!
You're going to get killed!

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.580
Not to mention...

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.060
There's no more time...

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.430
Don't give up until the very end, Mr. Joestar!

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.780
I can't tell!

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.610
I can't tell the difference!

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.040
Which one is the real one?

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.030
Which one is the Stand?!

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.530
Which one is it?!

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.960
The weakest of all is also

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.770
the most, most,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:13.950
most, most, most, most,

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.170
most, most terrifying of all!

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.530
Say, Jotaro. Take a look at this gold bracelet.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.370
It would make a girl happy,

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.250
if you were to give her something like this.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.250
Jotaro,

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.580
see that space in the glass?

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.630
Use your Stand to sneak through and steal it!

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.790
I told you to steal it, you dumbass!

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.160
Hurry it up!

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.290
Or...

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.400
I don't mind breaking the glass and taking it myself.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.410
Are you okay with them catching me
and beating the shit out of me?

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.400
Joseph would definitely die from the pain.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.570
Hurry up!

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.870
The salesman's looking the other way!

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.910
This guy's shoplifting!

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.860
You bastard...

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.020
The Lovers

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.020
Dan of Steel

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.690
This guy's shoplifting!

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.610
Hey, salesman!

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.530
Sir! Please don't let him get away!

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.730
Sure!

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.080
You bastard...

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.900
What? A thief?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.320
Who is it?

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.510
That guy?

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.670
That Asian kid?

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.230
Back where I come from,

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.670
they chop a thief's fingers off!

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.680
Hey, Jotaro.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.680
You better not use your Stand against civilians.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.440
Bastard!

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.120
Take this!

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.720
Despicable!

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.020
You thief!

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.310
Get out of our country, asshole!

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.530
We'll let you go at that.
You can keep your fingers!

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.590
That was great! Well done!

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.100
Because of the commotion you caused,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.970
I was able to get my hands
on something even better!

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.140
Jotaro!

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.230
What the hell are you laughing about?

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.740
What's so funny?

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.110
I'm laughing in anticipation
of the fun that's to come.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.250
I'm laughing because I have much more
to look forward to now, and I'm excited!

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.000
I'm so excited for the moment
when I get to pay you back.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.970
Why, you...!

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.310
You seem to misunderstand.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.240
Old Man Joestar will die within seconds.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.220
That's the reality you're facing.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.530
Nah. You don't know us very well.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.120
You don't know Kakyoin.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.400
What?!

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.180
"Everything begins once you've
acknowledged your own weaknesses," eh?

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.210
I see...

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.510
I'd have to agree with that.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.170
To know yourself is an important lesson...

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.910
But you clearly don't know
your enemies well enough.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.420
You haven't done your research.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.630
Didn't you realize?

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.410
My Hierophant...

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.550
can spread its roots along the ground,

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.680
so I can inspect every single one of you!

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.720
Something's suddenly touching me!

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.520
You're the Stand!

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.440
Emerald Splash!

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.190
Bang

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.900
We did it!

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.250
Well, well, well, well...

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.840
That injury means that
Kakyoin's on the attack now.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.080
I wonder if I'll still have my chance
at payback once he's done.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.410
He's realized he's out of his league!
He's trying to escape into the artery!

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.380
He's trying to escape!

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.510
He's trying to get out of Mr. Joestar's brain!

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.390
Huh? He's leaving?

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.480
All right! That's great!

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.900
Mr. Joestar, hurry! The flesh bud!

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.520
Right!

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.730
Over Drive!

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.820
The flesh bud is disappearing!

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.180
I-I'm saved...

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.550
Now we can be more
<i>bud</i>dy-<i>bud</i>dy with Mr. Joestar.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.580
Polnareff, you know...

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.710
Oh! B-But wait...

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.090
If it's leaving my brain,

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.880
that means the Stand...

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.870
...is going back to its user, Dan of Steel!

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.440
That's not good! Jotaro doesn't know that!

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.700
What's wrong? Why are you stepping back?

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.700
You're not going to tell me about
what's happening to my grandfather?

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.210
Hey, hey, hey...

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.010
What are you so panicked about?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.240
Where are you trying to go?

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.820
You aren't trying to run away, are you?

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.510
Not after all this...

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.140
Please forgive me, Jotaro, sir!

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.890
I admit defeat!

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.090
I'll change! I'll lie on the ground and lick your boots!

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.020
I did an awful thing!

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.960
You can hit me as much as
you'd like! Hit me! Kick me!

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.580
But please, spare my life!

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.540
Lick, lick, lick, lick,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.000
lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.590
Soon...

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.520
The Lovers will soon be back!

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.880
This idiot, Jotaro, doesn't have a clue!

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.470
This time I'll invade your brain from your ear!

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.210
Kakyoin's several hundred
meters away. Just you wait!

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.140
I'll give you pain that will make
you wish you were dead!

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.730
I-It's here!

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.100
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.190
Now! Go in!

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.060
I figured you were planning something like this.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.600
Don't you know that my Stand, Star Platinum,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.510
possesses excellent
eyesight and precise reflexes?

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.260
Are you sure you did your research on us?

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.980
I-I-I'm not planning anything!

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.020
Your Stand's power...

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.900
"Your" Stand? Just "your"?

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.110
N-No! I-I meant <i>your majesty's</i>
Stand is more powerful

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.280
and more just than any other!

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.570
I didn't stand a chance, so it came back!

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.130
P-Please look!

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.850
That attack broke my arm and my leg!

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.170
I can't fight anymore! I can't move!

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.670
Well...

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.940
As for what you owe me...

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.390
I guess I'll take your
arm and leg as payment.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.430
Do you swear that you'll
never appear before us again?

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.730
I-I do! I swear!

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.760
I'll go to some deserted island!

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.480
I'll go to the ends of the Earth
and never come back!

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.460
You're not lying, are you?

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.860
The next time I see you,
I'll punch you one thousand times.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.860
I'm not lying! I'd never lie!

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:53.900
Get out of here.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.530
Let's play soccer over there!

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.590
But then I can't play!

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.140
Jotaro!

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.250
You fool!

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.930
Take a look at that girl over there!

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.060
My Stand, The Lovers,
just went into that girl's ear.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.010
He's heading for her brain.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.520
Don't you dare move, Jotaro!

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.270
I'm going to stab you in
the back with this knife!

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.140
I'll make sure you never move again!

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.560
Just try to attack me
with your Star Platinum!

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.290
That girl will surely die!

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:44.040
You would never kill such
a young child, would you?

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.720
Good grief. Fine, try it.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.430
Hey! Don't you understand?!
I told you not to—

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.370
—move? Move...

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.440
Huh? Huh?!

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.170
What's the matter?

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.320
Weren't you going to stab me?

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.470
Like this?

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.750
M-My body won't move! Why?!

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.370
Wh-What's this thing wrapped around me?!

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.490
So you didn't notice?

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.210
Kakyoin tied Hierophant's tentacle

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.590
to your Stand's leg as it escaped.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:35.170
You must be totally oblivious
if you didn't realize that

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.100
you left a trail all the way to here.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.280
Please forgive me!

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.850
Ask for forgiveness from Enyaba,
the woman you killed.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.880
We never had any intention of
forgiving you in the first place.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:06.460
D-DIO paid me in advance...
I-I'll give you that.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.270
Good grief.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.140
You truly are the lowest scum in history.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.800
You can't pay back what you owe

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.890
with money.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.740
Here's your receipt.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.610 position:80% line:20%

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.230
I have this feeling like
someone is staring at us,

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.350
so I keep looking back.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.220
Are you sure you're not just being paranoid?

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.230
I can't help but feel that presence, too.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.030
I really can't shake the feeling
that someone's staring at us.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Something's strange. Something...
