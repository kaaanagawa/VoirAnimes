Last time on </i>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure<i>...

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.740
It's her! That woman is the user!

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.130
Oh, my. What a forward, aggressive approach.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.130
Smooch!

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.380
Oh my God!

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.220
Avdol, I forgot to tell you earlier,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.050
but don't touch anything that
looks like an electrical outlet.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.470
I'm afraid I've touched it, Mr. Joestar.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.680
What?!

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.560
Two magnets, when close together,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.310
will attract each other!

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.530
Mr. Joestar, this situation...

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.280
Yeah, it's extremely bad.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.290
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.290
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.400
Episode 30
Bast's Mariah, Part 2

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.760
Hey! Wait!

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.850
Damn it...

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.700
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.610
She went around the corner! After her!

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.840
Stuck

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.230
This is absurd! I can't believe
my body's become a magnet, too!

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.720
Calm down, Avdol!

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.980
We can't help that her power's taken hold of us.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.080
Just think about fighting and defeating her Stand!

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.080
Where did that woman go?! Damn it!

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.690
I don't see her.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.550
Anyway, we can't stay here like this forever.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.180
Stand up slowly, Avdol.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.640
Understood.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.960
We managed to stand up.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.220
N-Now, let's try to separate ourselves.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.220
If we're stuck together,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.980
that must mean twice the
magnetic force is affecting us.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.400
Let's go to that fence, grab hold, and pull apart.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.350
Here we go, Avdol. Use your core muscles!

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.530
Get a rhythm going!

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.780
Right, Mr. Joestar.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.100
One! Two!

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.200
One, two.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.330
One! Two!

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.520
One, two.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.540
One! Two!

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.160
One, two.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.150
Ah...

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.420
M-Mr. Joestar...
Th-This is very embarrassing.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.260
Hey! What are you looking at?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.850
We're just practicing a dance. A dance!

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.880
Y-Yes, dancing outside is truly the best!

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.850
Go away, damn it!

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.850
All right. Just a little more, Avdol.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.860
One, two, and...

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.680
We did it! We made it this far without tripping.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.650
I-Indeed...

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.570
Avdol, do you think you can slowly slide off of me?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.830
Yes, I think I can.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.210
All right...

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.500
I'll hold on to this fence.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.310
Try to slide down my body,
and move away from my toes.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.030
Since our heads are sticking together,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.110
our heads and feet must have opposite polarities,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.210
Positive

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.210
Negative

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.810
letting us separate there.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.450
R-Right...

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.940
Y-Yes, just like that.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.130
Wh-What's wrong, Avdol?

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.910
Th-This position...

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.080
Doesn't this look very risqué?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.550
If anyone saw us, they might get the wrong idea...

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.920
N-No one's looking! Hurry up and slide free!

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.340
They brought even more friends!

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.600
H-Hey! Go away! Stop looking at us!

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.950
Hey! I said go away, you damn brats!

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.660
Avdol, hurry! Hurry up and slide off!

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.750
That's easier said than done...

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.430
This is not the role I've taken! I swear it isn't!

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.290
Fine, then I'll move!

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.000
M-Mr. Joestar, slow down!

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.300
Stick

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.170
Mr. Joestar, if you move like that...

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.260
I-It's the old lady from the hotel!

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.760
I thought you were a wonderful gentleman,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.480
but to think you're into this sort of filth!

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.110
How dare you play with a woman's heart?!

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.190
You cheater!

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.610
Hurry! Hurry, Avdol! I'm starting to cry!

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.910
You villain!

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.910
Help me! Oh my God!

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.000
Wait... This is a misunderstanding!

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.260
We did it!

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.380
We need to stay apart, Avdol!

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.280
Your magnetism is growing stronger and stronger.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.390
Curse you, damned fool! Go to hell!

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.980
There she is. It's that woman.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.080
She's got some nerve,
just sitting there and smoking.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.750
Avdol, approach her from that side.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.240
Don't let her get away this time.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.120
She seems like a strong woman.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.740
She may have laid a trap for us.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.360
N-No, Mr. Joestar...

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.300
It seems we've already fallen into her trap!

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.210
Bam

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.250
A railroad track!

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.060
M-My foot is stuck!

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.610
A-Again...

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.690
...we're...

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.820
...stuck together!

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.460
Son of a bi—

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.750
What is it, Mr. Joestar?

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.660
This sound... O-Oh, no! We can't stay here!

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.800
Avdol, use Magician's Red's
flames to slice the rails!

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.070
We need to get away now!

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.510
B-But, Mr. Joestar...

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.680
It's coming! The train's coming!
Hurry up and slice the rails!

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.610
I-I can't. If I were to slice these rails...

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.660
The train would derail, causing a
huge accident and killing many people!

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.650
That woman... How dare she...

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.180
Even if I tried to grab her with my vines,
she's out of my Stand's range.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.580
But I can try using that post to pull us free...

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.130
I-It's no use! The magnetism's gotten stronger.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.120
Mr. Joestar, keep pulling! You can do it!

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.880
I-It's coming! Pull harder!

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.020
What?!

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.000
Ker-thump

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.730
I've won.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.950
Bast

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.950
Mariah

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.210
I've won, Lord DIO!

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.180
Now to kill Jotaro and Polnareff!

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:21.970
Good thinking, Avdol! You burned
through the railroad ties and dug a hole!

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.650
This is it! This!

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.770
This suits the image of Mohammed Avdol!

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.110
This is the role my character plays!

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.230
C-Clever little bastard...

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.690
You...

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.500
shit-eating bitches!

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.840
Magician's Red!

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.050
Swoosh

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.170
Hermit Purple!

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.470
Grab

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.930
I've got you!

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.180
Now, young lady...

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.690
I regret that I'm now going
to strangle you enough

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.320
to put you in the hospital for a week.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.720
Your magnetism is rather troublesome, you know.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.370
Boom

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.670
Boom

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.090
What are you imagining?
My chest didn't get bigger...

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.350
Your magnetism just got stronger.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.770
This is what I had in my pockets.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.140
The weapons I had in my pockets!

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.560
Mr. Joestar, duck!

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.150
Magician's Red!

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.450
Your magnetic force will keep growing stronger...

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.790
Until your bodies are crushed.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.030
She's getting away!

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.670
No, she's not escaping.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.800
She's keeping a certain distance between us.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.520
I'm sure that woman fights by
staying neither too close nor too far.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.180
If she gets too close to us, she'll be caught.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.770
If she goes too far, the magnetism stops working.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.850
This magnetism is the work of a Stand,
so it follows the rules of Stands.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.150
Once the user is too far away, its power weakens!

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.780
What shall we do?

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.170
She said the magnetism would keep getting stronger.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.710
Shall we flee until the magnetic force expires?

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.020
No. Even if we were able to
escape this magnetism,

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.450
it won't mean we defeated the Stand.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.310
I, Joseph Joestar,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.850
have strategically retreated from
fights in my younger days,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.640
but I've never once abandoned a fight.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.430
I'm going to keep fighting with all my might!

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:09.010
This is a map of the city.
Right now, we're here.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.860
The woman is here.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.950
If she continues down this road,
she'll loop around and head back this way.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.160
We'll split up

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.700
and catch the woman here.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.670
I won't think of her as a woman anymore.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.900
I'll get her, no matter what!

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.740
After her!

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.750
Hey, look.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.770
The rails have been cut...

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.510
People from the city have arrived.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:40.430
I'm sure they'll report the damage
before the next train comes.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.660
Let's go!

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.680
Seems like something's going on.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.690
Someone cut the rail line!

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.280
Will the trains be okay?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.950
They've stopped running for now.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.160
Someone cut the rail line?

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.870
That's a pretty crappy thing to do.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.360
Why would someone do that? Are they stupid?

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.760
You know, Jotaro...

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.580
I think people like that
will get what they deserve.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.320
I spent three months' pay on this.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.530
Let's get married!

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.440
Oh, my...

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.520
Huh? Wait, what?!

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.420
Huh?

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.090
They're chasing as fast as they can...

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.710
B-But they'll never catch me.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.120
Stay calm. Gotta stay calm...

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.410
Looks like you can barely move now.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.400
You won't be able to chase me anymore.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.120
You think so?

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.960
I know these roads better than you do.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.910
Look behind you.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.200
It's a pincer attack!

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.040
We've finally cornered you.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.770
Now, at the last moment, the tables have turned!

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.080
A pincer attack?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.520
You still don't get it.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.940
You think you've cornered me,
but it's you two who are cornered.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.640
Look above you!

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.620
High voltage power lines!

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.540
Crap! Power lines are...

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.910
That's right. Power lines are magnetic.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.550
You'll burn to a crisp!

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.490
Magician's Red!

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.680
Hermit Purple!

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.260
Avdol can defend himself
with his flames, just barely,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.240
but you have no chance, Joestar.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.780
My Bast's power is far greater

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.340
than your Hermit Purple's!

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.170
Woman, my flames will roast you!

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.470
Something's pulling me!
My whole body's being pulled!

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.560
Wh-What is this?!

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.370
I control flames that can melt steel,

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.070
but I can't defend myself from this...

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.830
My body is being crushed!

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.040
I can't keep this up!

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.260
Joseph Joestar, since this is the end, I'll tell you...

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.320
You were quite amazing.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.700
We've only known each other for a few minutes,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.370
but you are witty and canny,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:37.060
and your experience gives you the
good judgment that young people lack.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.730
You've got very charming looks, too.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:47.060
Our ages are quite far apart, but I
might not have minded being with you.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.810
Th-That's great...

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.080
Would you mind saving me, then?

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.740
Hmm...

00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:01.040
You're a lot more powerful than my Hermit Purple!

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:07.120
I can't hold on much longer...
P-Please. Stop the magnetism!

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.340
Well...

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.840
Nah, I don't think so.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.020
You're nowhere near as charming as Lord DIO.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.270
I-Is there nothing that will convince
you to stop the magnetism?

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.690
No, not happening.
Sorry, but you have to die.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.740
Even though I'm begging you?

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.320
You're much too persistent, you fool.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.830
Then you've lost, young lady.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.780
What?!

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.540
Sh-Shi—

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.190
Crash

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.490
We told you this was a pincer attack!

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.680
Magnets are attracted to each other.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.810
Once you were between us, your luck ran out.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.480
She can't hear you, Mr. Joestar.
It looks like she's passed out.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.980
She's been crushed by the
weight and magnetic force.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.140
I'm sure she's broken more than a few bones.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.830
Now, then... Shall we go get some breakfast?

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:39.400
Certainly. I'm rather hungry
after all that running around.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.570
It's already 9:00 AM.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.440
Shit-eating bitches...

Joseph Joestar

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.410
They're taking forever...

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.260
What the hell are they doing?

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.010
They're taking longer than
a woman getting dressed.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.970
It's almost 9:00 AM...

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.640
They might have encountered an enemy.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.880
Maybe we should go look for them.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.340
Yeah. Good grief.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.310
Come on, Iggy.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.400
I know, I know. You're hungry, right?

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.730
So am I.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:46.440
Menacing

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.840
Mariah is fighting with Joestar and Avdol.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.800
I, Alessi, shall kill Jotaro and Polnareff.

Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.010
Now, little boy. Come with me to the
bathroom and take off your clothes.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.090
Well done.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.690
I'll help you take them off.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.600
Well done.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.860
I'll apply some ointment.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.040
Well done.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.190
Is this really okay?!
