00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.990
I'm sure it's quite the shock,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.820
dying because your sister ate you.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.230
When a man wishes from the heart,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.420
all of his greatest weaknesses come to light.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.000
You didn't even think about how unnatural
it is to bring someone back to life.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.580
You want to believe that the one you loved
is still alive somewhere on this Earth.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.640
You hope that they'll suddenly pop
in tomorrow and say, "Good morning."

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310
By the way...

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.860
You said something about a third wish,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.610
but you've already made
your third wish, haven't you?

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.610
You don't mean...

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.240
"Bring Avdol back to life."

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.910
Hail 2 U!

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.510
Zam!

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.520
No... He's...

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.450
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.450
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.460
Avdol!

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.040
Episode 22: Judgment, Part 2

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.370
Av... dol...

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.720
My fingers... fell apart.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.880
Polnareff!

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.270
This is your fault...

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.480
Because of you, I... I...

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.330
Ended up like this...

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.910
Avdol... I... I made you...

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.160
I...

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.900
I'll have you pay for this, Polnareff.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.210
With...

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.130
your body!

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.390
I'll get better if I eat, right?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.340
Right?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.210
Brother!

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.190
What's the matter, Brother?

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.150
S-Stay away! Stay away from me!

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.450
Both of you... Return to the ground, please!

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.000
Why? You're the one who brought us back.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.770
It's your turn to enter the ground!

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.500
I-I was so freaked out that
I forgot to summon Chariot.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.050
I was so caught up in my wish
that I forgot to use my Stand...

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.550
Get away from me, please!

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.150
Get away from me!

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.770
What?!

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.490
"Please"? Nope! You don't have any wishes left.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.570
I've already granted your three wishes.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.250
You don't get any more.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.100
Stop!

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.910
Hail 2 U!

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.100
Make sure you cry and scream
all you can before you die.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.250
You're in this island's backwoods.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.800
Your voice won't reach the shore.
No one will come to save you.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.730
I-It's no use. I'm done for...

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.370
I'm going to die. I'm beaten.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.170
Sherry...

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.390
Avdol...

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.990
Even though they're just clay dolls,
it's not so bad being defeated by them.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.330
Avdol, just like you said, you died because of me.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.270
I have no complaints about
whatever happens to me.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.240
What...?

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.990
Are my eyes so blurry that I'm seeing double?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.880
It looks like there are two Avdols.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.880
Of course there's only one clay doll.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.530
If I'm seeing things, I guess that
means death is really close now.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.340
Not to mention how much I'm bleeding...

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.430
It makes sense that I'd hallucinate.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.490
Then... I guess I'll die.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.440
I'll have to tap out early.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.800
Goodbye, Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, Jotaro...

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.550
I pray for your victory.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.570
Avdol, for you...

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.390
I'll atone in the next world...

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.170
What?! Impossible!

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.840
I knew it! There<i> is </i>another Avdol!

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.810
My eyes weren't playing tricks!

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.390
Besides the clay doll Avdol...

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.180
There's another Avdol!

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.610
Magician's Red!

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.880
Impossible! He should have been dead!

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.530
He was stabbed by the Hanged Man, Centerfold!

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.480
He should be dead...

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.380
Tsk, tsk.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.040
Mohammed Avdol!

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.860
Yes, I am!

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.010
Bam

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.260
I-Is it really you?

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.250
Tsk, tsk.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.600
Rumble

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.310
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.270
I-Is it the real you?

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.940
Polnareff, you haven't matured a bit.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.940
You're still going on

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.780
about your sister without
thinking of the consequences.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.200
Impossible!

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.450
There's no way you can be alive!

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.980
I was told that after you were stabbed in the back,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.370
Hol Horse blew your brains out,
and you died on the spot.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.990
Indeed, I was shot. Right in the forehead...

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.590
But because I was stabbed
in the back, for a moment,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.290
my face was looking up.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.260
Meaning, the bullet grazed me.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.290
I guess this is what you call a blessing in disguise.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:57.400
Hol Horse's bullet only scratched my skin and skull,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.280
so it never reached my brain,
and wasn't a mortal wound.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.280
But I did completely lose consciousness.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.200
Cameo of the Judgment card, was it?

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.160
I'll give you Hell!

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.830
Hell 2 U!

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.010
The third wish... Just the third wish...

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.700
It's real.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.880
It came true.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.020
Judgment

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.020
Cameo

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.900
Mohammed Avdol is alive.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.530
This bad news...

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:51.910
Shouldn't you hurry and tell DIO and your
other Stand user buddies about it?

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.190
Shouldn't you, Cameo?

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.290
That's right! I have to tell them!
I have to let them know!

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.090
Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, and Jotaro!

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.510
This is, indeed, very surprising news.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.970
But I can turn that news into this:

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.710
Judgement's Cameo not only
killed the idiot Polnareff,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.850
but also killed Avdol,
who was actually still alive!

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.440
Oh! I shall change it into good news!

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.940
Magician's Red!

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.430
Whoa, there.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.190
Avdol!

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.340
This Stand is rather powerful...

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.720
Be careful! It's not just power.
He's got speed, too.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.140
Avdol, is that all you've got?

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.810
It looks like I'll be able to
share my good news after all.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.830
May fortune...

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.520
be with you both!

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.570
What?!

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.670
Hail 2 U!

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.970
Brother...

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.840
No. My Sherry...

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.670
Sherry... died.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.510
You're...

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.510
just...

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.720
a clay doll!

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.550
Brother...

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.610
Polnareff.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.010
My apologies. I take back my
statement that you hadn't matured.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.370
No, you were right.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.900
I should be the one to apologize.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.430
This battle has been decided.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.760
Avdol! Tell me your three wishes!
I shall grant them for you.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.810
Before you die for real this time!

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.700
Go ahead! Give it a shot.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.360
You get three wishes.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.420
Bastard! He's making fools of us!

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.700
Avdol, ignore him.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.130
You don't have to make any wishes.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.220
Avdol, are you listening to me?

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.630
No...

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.340
Make it four.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.220
Wha?!

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.860
What?

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.220
Wishes. I mean wishes!

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.810
I wish to make the three wishes into four.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.060
Tsk, tsk.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.400
You can't be serious...

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.740
Are you denying my wish?
Cameo, you're the one that offered!

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.320
I will have you keep your promise!

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.830
You still insist upon this futile contest of power?

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.540
Such a weak kick.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.880
What?!

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.130
Yes! Awesome!

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:41.180
Tsk, tsk. My first wish was
to make you scream in pain.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.520
It came true.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.350
I-Impossible! You're strong!
You're much stronger than earlier!

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.650
The wound left after I was stabbed by the
Hanged Man hasn't completely healed yet.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.240
I was guarding that wound earlier,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.240
so I couldn't use all of my strength.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.530
Wha—

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.500
I was finally able to stand again
just three days ago in India.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.750
I was able to take a plane here,
so the trip was very easy.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.550
Nothing less from you, Avdol!

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.210
Now, my second wish...

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.350
To make you scream in fear!
And my third wish...

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.600
To make you cry in regret!

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.360
Th-That bastard! He's running away!

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.990
Wait, damn you!

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.960
Shh. Be quiet, Polnareff.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.340
With that kind of power and speed...

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:51.580
It is the rule of Stands that the
user must be somewhere nearby.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.880
Is he here?

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.430
He should be hiding very close by.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.010
Could that be—

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.010
Shh!

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.960
The user is hiding beneath the ground?!

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.580
Damn him! What should I do with him?

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.300
He had the nerve to use my sister,
so I'll show him Hell!

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.980
Hell 2 U!

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.600
Bastard!

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.290
Grind

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.650
I'm gonna drop all sorts of things in there...

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.740
Like dirt, sand...

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.410
A spider...

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.460
And ants...

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.830
And a match.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:18.110
Bastard! I'm not done yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.920
Hey, Polnareff.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.800
I do believe nature is calling.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.780
Shall we engage in the
timeless ritual of male bonding,

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.390
and take a piss together?

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.020
Tsk, tsk.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.770
Huh?

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.390
I somehow made it.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.910
C'mon! Laugh, Polnareff!

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.860
Laugh! Laugh, Polnareff!

00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:00.050
Avdol... Did your personality change?

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.010
You weren't a guy who thought up
perverse stuff like this before.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:09.260
It's not because you were shot in the head, is it?

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.300
Come now, aim for it!

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.210
Right!

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.070
Please forgive me!

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.370
My fourth wish. That is...

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.990
To not listen to <i>your</i> wishes.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.030
Magician's Red won't forgive you.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.960
Not happening.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.660
Bam

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.100
Ba-dum-tss!

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.940
Magician's Red

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.940
Mohammed Avdol

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.040
Hey! You'll never believe this, guys!

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.820
Who do you think I met?

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.300
Polnareff! We were worried about you!

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.180
Where did you get those wounds?

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.450
Were you attacked?

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.930
Who cares about my wounds?

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.710
Listen! Don't be shocked, Jotaro!

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.540
Don't let your back go out in shock, Kakyoin.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.680
Who do you think I met, Mr. Joestar?

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.210
Behold and rejoice!

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.910
Tum-ta-da-da!

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.200
Here he is!

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.870
That bastard Avdol was alive!

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.020
Doo-do-doo!

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.730
Well, let's go.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.650
I'll help you carry your luggage.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.050
Hey, Avdol.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.840
It's been a while. How are you?

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.900
Avdol, is that wound on your back all right?

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.900
It's fine. A bit stiff, though.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.620
Hey...

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.750
Has it really been two weeks?

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.610
Thank goodness we're all still okay.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.120
Hey...

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.910
Jotaro, you still wear all that stuff?
Don't you get hot?

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.800
W-Wait a minute, you guys!

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.830
Hey! I said wait, you assholes!

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.480
Hey, what's the deal with that attitude?!

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.030
A guy who was dead came back to life!

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.480
What the hell?! Why are you
having normal conversations?!

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:25.860
Oh, Polnareff, I'm sorry.
When I said I buried Avdol in India...

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.620
That was a lie.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.360
Casual

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.110
Wh— Wh— What?!

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:37.620
It was Mr. Joestar and Jotaro who tended
the wounds on my head and back in India.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:46.840
Y-You assholes knew that Avdol was still
alive in India, and you didn't tell me?!

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.890
You, too, Kakyoin?!

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.410
I only found out the day after.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.130
But we couldn't let the enemy know.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.040
And since you have such a big mouth...

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.100
Pardon. Since you can't lie,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.650
I suggested that we keep it a secret from you.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.980
If you'd let the secret slip,
Avdol couldn't have recovered in peace.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.750
We were planning to tell you
as soon as we knew he was safe,

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.160
but we had no idea you'd run into him first.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.980
Oh, yeah, Avdol!

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.390
Your dad is on this island!

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.020
Let's let him know you're here!

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.120
Oh, that was me in disguise.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.490
Wh-What?!

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:32.640
Th-Then you guys... That was all...

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.630
Go away!

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.390
No one comes to see me with good news!

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.600
I don't want to hear it!

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.540
Avdol's death was not your fault.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.850
Did you have to go that far?!

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.020
How dare you guys leave me out like that?!

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.280
Hey, now. There's no reason to cry.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.830
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd be this hurt.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.360
I'm sorry, Polnareff.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.610
There's a reason I came to this island in disguise.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:03.410
A reason?

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.370
It was partially so the enemy wouldn't find out,

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.840
but I also had Avdol do a little shopping for me.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.400
A little shopping?

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.550
It was a very conspicuous purchase.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.230
So I disguised myself as a
rich Arab when I bought it.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.430
Now, everyone, we're gonna ride that and leave!

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.830
Polnareff, cheer up already. Come on.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.920
It's almost here!

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.020
Wait, what's almost here?

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.600
There's nothing—

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.090
What?!

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.200
A submarine?!

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.210
That's right. From here, we'll ride to Egypt in this!

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.960
Y-You're kidding! You really
bought something like this?!

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.930

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.900
How about this glistening design?

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.130
A submarine, huh...

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.790
Perhaps a refreshing white would be best.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.110
Hurry up and make some coffee.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.140
I just don't know which one to pick.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.320
Kakyoin, why are you taking that cup?

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.950
Hello? Oh, is that you, Joseph?
