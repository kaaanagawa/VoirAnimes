00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.740
What?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm a kid?!

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.710
Pami!

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.830
Are you okay, little boy?

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.210
I'll wash and treat your wounds.

N-No way!

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.550
Pami!

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.250
I-I'm definitely not going to overpower him!

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.510
Th-That lady's gone...

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.510
Pami!

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.370
Where'd the lady go?

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.120
She was just right here...

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.670
She didn't even scream. What happened to her?

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.170
Where'd she go?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.260
Polnareff...

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.760
You said your eyes were stinging
from the shampoo, didn't you?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.640
If it stings that bad...

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.520
Make sure you wash it all off!

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.520
Very thoroughly!

Episode 33  Set's Alessi, Part 2

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.920
If my arms were long enough,
I could poke his eyes out and run!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.520
But...

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.260
If I do this, it'll take longer for the tub to drain

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.030
so you'll able to breathe.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.030
About five to ten minutes, perhaps?

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.330
You must be in despair!

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.980
I'll put an end to you right now.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.230
This is what it means to be
utterly helpless, Polnareff.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.230
Ploop

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.940
Wh-What is this?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.150
This shape... This color! It can't be...

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.100
You didn't!

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.280
A-An adult would never be
shameless enough to do this!

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.460
This smell... It is!

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.210
Gross! You actually did that!

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.110
I couldn't use my arms or legs,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.970
but I still let one out! So there!

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.920
H-How dare you?!

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.390
D-Don't you have any
decency as a human being?!

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.110
A main character would never
even think about doing that!

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.650
That's not good at all! Not at all!

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.180
Where's the lady?

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.740
What did you do with the lady?

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.740
Where is she?!

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.250
Lady! Where are you? Lady!

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.960
Lady!

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.080
Menacing

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.110
What do you <i>think</i> I did?

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.560
Whoa, there!

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.050
We should both watch our step, Polnareff.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.260
We might accidentally
step on her and kill her.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.070
What?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.630
I-It can't be...

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.620
Th-This is... You can't be serious...

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.040
L-Lady...

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.190
Anyone who touches my Stand,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.560
Set's shadow, will grow younger and younger.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.740
Polnareff, you noticed the
attack in an instant and managed

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.220
to jump away, so you ended
up about seven or eight years old.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.220
But she was in contact with it
for a number of seconds,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.080
so she reverted to a fetus.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.320
She's alive for now,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.400
but since she's not in her mother's
womb, she will indeed die.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.420
She's going through this because
she tried to take care of you.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.280
How stupid.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.670
Y-You scum!

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.720
C-Crap! I just...

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.440
Whoa!

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.790
You touched it again!

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.650
You're going to grow younger again.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.140
I'd say you're going to be around
four years old this time, Polnareff.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.300
Crap!

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.780
I-I have to...

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.160
I have to hurry up and beat him,
or the lady will...

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.430
At this rate, the lady will
die in a matter of minutes.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.890
I have to do something to beat
that old creeper as soon as I can!

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.210
She treated my wounds
and was so nice to me...

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.050
I have to...

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.300
I have to do something, fast!

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.670
Come on! Come on!

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.530
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.770
Why are you running around
cradling that dying fetus?

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.640
I'll just do the same to you!

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.000
C-Crap! I just touched the shadow again!

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.750
M-My body's shrinking...

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.080
Yahoo!

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.960
Yes! Now I've achieved total victory!

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.670
Polnareff! You must be
about three years old now.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.220
Your mind will soon revert
to a three-years-old's, too.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.230
Locking the door won't do any good!

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.580
Damn it! The bars are too close together.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.230
Even if I'm a kid...

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:41.090
I won't be able to get out through the window.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.090
Damn it!

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.680
I-I can't cut them...

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.590
Looks like your precious Chariot's
about three years old now, too.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.060
He can't cut through the bars,

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.190
and he's so slow!

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.190
I'm coming in now!

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.170
Lick, lick, lick, lickity-lick!

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.590
I'm coming in, Polnareff.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.600
Silence

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.420
H-He's not here?

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.850
What?

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.360
He's not here! That little punk...

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.770
Did he manage to somehow squeeze
through these bars and go outside?

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.960
Whoa, that was close!

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.500
That bastard Polnareff is trying to trick me.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.350
He wanted me to think
that he got through the bars,

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:59.040
but he's probably hiding somewhere
nearby, waiting to get the drop on me.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.170
Not bad.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.760
Very impressive for a brat, in fact.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.830
Where are you hiding...

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.770
At his small size, he could
probably fit in that drawer.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.450
He's probably hiding in
the bucket or the drawer...

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.020
No, he could even be in the stuffed animal.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.430
Which one are you in?
I've got a one-in-three chance.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.250
I'll try to get it on my first guess.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.290
I'll smash this axe into
your brain on my first try!

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:46.340
That stuffed animal looks the most suspicious!

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.550
Or that's just what I want you to think,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.510
and then I go for the clock
that I hadn't mentioned yet!

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.130
I-I was wrong!

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.850
Then...

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.730
The simple choice! Let's go for the bucket!

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.790
Huh?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.200
So it <i>is</i> the stuffed animal!

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.240
Th-Th-The drawer, then!

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.360
H-He's not here!

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.270
He's not here! Not here! Not here! Not here!

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.550
Not here! Not here! Not here!

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.840
I-Impossible! He's not here!

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.000
H-How... It can't be!

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.210
The walls and ceiling are made of stone.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.500
Even if they were one centimeter thick,
that Chariot couldn't dig through.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.010
And I know he wouldn't be
able to make it through the bars.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.000
Impossible! Where is he? Where did he go?

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.870
You're going to lose to a kid in a battle of wits?

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.760
Gulp!

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.180
Old Man Alessi.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.380
I-Impossible!

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.120
A-A goldfish disappeared...

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.040
Set

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.040
Alessi

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.530
I was in the goldfish tank, using the mirror!

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.200
Mirror                 Lady               Goldfish Tank

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.340
Even a kid could figure out that simple trick!

Ball

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.380
1) Take mirror off wall

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.780
Thanks for falling for it!

Old Man Alessi, you stupid creeper!

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:47.230
Even if he's only two,
Chariot can still cut up your face!

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.590
Not good! Not good at all!

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.990
H-Hey, wait!

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.680
Pami!

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.980
I'll keep attacking with my Stand
until he gets too young to use!

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.610
Not good! Not good at all!

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.270
Not good <i>at all</i>!

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.650
That asshole! He escaped out the window!

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.240
Not good! Not good at all!

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.560
Doom

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.620
Jotaro!

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.670
Crap! He's going to kill me!

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.130
It's Jotaro! Why's he here?!

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.990
It's not very normal to come
falling out a window all bloody.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.610
Calm down... Calm down, me.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.400
At times like this, the one who stays calm wins.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:58.120
Jotaro must be looking for an adult Polnareff,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.490
and doesn't know about me.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.970
I'll just play dumb like I usually do...

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.880
And then attack!

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.130
Ah!

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.550
Ah! The owner of this house
is going to be so mad at me!

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:19.090
I was cleaning the window and slipped!

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.300
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.640
He's going to be so mad!

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.060
Hold it, you shitty old man!

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.690
Ah!

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.290
Mister...

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:35.070
Who were you again?
Who were you...? Um, um...

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:39.070
Now! I was waiting for
Polnareff to show his face!

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.320
You're wide open, Jotaro!

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.300
Duwaaah

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.620
Ah! Don't touch his shadow!

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.440
Yes! I touched it! I touched Jotaro's shadow!

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.500
Crap!

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:58.340
Jotaro! You've fallen under my Set's spell, too!

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.260
Th-This... Wha—

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.610
Th-This is..

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.920
O-Oh, no!

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.270
That guy's going to turn into a kid, too!

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.120
Jotaro!

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.610
I heard that you only recently learned
to use your Stand, Star Platinum.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.820
Which means you weren't able
to use your Stand as a child!

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.240
You're just going to turn into a normal kid!

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.410
He's becoming so small!

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.270
He turned into a seven-year-old!

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.600
I've won! Lord DIO, I will
be the one who kills Jotaro!

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.810
You're going to pay me royally for this!

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.930
Die, Jotaro!

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.600
Whoa! He punched him!
With his little kid fist!

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:57.450
Good grief.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.900
Don't underestimate me just because I'm a kid.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.210
E-Even as a child, when Jotaro's serious...

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.220
...he's really serious! He's so strong...

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.760
Mumble, mumble, mumble... Huh?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.220
Bam

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.410
Not good enough. Time to make
doubly sure he's finished!

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.750
Very good!

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.800

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.060
The Stand User of Set,
God of Destruction and Storms,

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.040
Alessi, aged thirty-eight and single,

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.040

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.310
has been blown away
into the distance. He retires!

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.630
Has Been Blown Away Into the Distance
<font size="36">He Retires</c>

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.420
Was that all a dream?

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.810
That boy was wearing this...

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.750
It really happened.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.380
For some reason, my body couldn't move...

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.520
That's right! I couldn't move
a muscle, but I remember.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.880
That boy was trying his best to protect me...

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.610
He was fighting an adult man.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.860
Where did that very brave and manly boy go?

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.780
Where did my little knight go?

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.290
Where are you? Where did you go?

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.280
She was such a nice and wonderful lady.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.250
She was so genuinely kind.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.470
That was close...

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.060
I turned back to normal,
but I wonder if she's okay.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.940
Um, pardon me...

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.980
Did you happen to see a
little boy leave my house?

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.990
He has silver hair, just like you.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.000
Pardon me for asking, but have we met before?

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.760
N-No... I-I didn't see any kid.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.180
L-Let's go, Jotaro.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.080
Come on, hurry up.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.760
Ah...

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.480
W-Wait!

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.020
Could you be...

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.000
That earring...

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.820
We've never met before.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.880
There's no way we could have.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.290
The two of us are travelers.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.570
This is the first time I've been here,
and I already have to get going

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.750
to the next town.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.830
So it must have been a dream after all.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.720
Don't say anything, Jotaro.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.880
Not one word.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.850
Oh! Jotaro and Polnareff!

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.630
Where have you two been?

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.690
Ah, Mr. Joestar and Avdol!

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.980
I told you two not to wander off on your own.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.280
Look who's talking!
You're the ones who disappeared!

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.850
Now, now. Let's go get something to eat.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.580
Iggy! Where the hell were you?

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.080
Silver Chariot

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.080
Jean Pierre Polnareff

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.680
Let me clear that away for you.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.970
Thanks.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.900
Finally, we can relax a little.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.960
What should have been
our breakfast became lunch.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.900
Yeah...

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.180
We're almost to Cairo.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.330
We've got to figure out where DIO is hiding.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.810
Oh, a spirit photo!

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.050
Will it show up?

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:08.590
I'm not sure. But we've gotten close,
so it should be quite accurate.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.710
All right, here we go!

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.220
Wham

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.700
Sir, is something the matter?

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.000
Nothing. Just go back over there.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.980
Y-Yes, sir...

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.480
Well, old man? Can you see anything?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.580
Just a little longer.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.320
Almost done...

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.750
Almost done...

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.660
There!

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.290
This is the place we have to find!

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.550
Bam

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.940
You're the one who fell for the scam.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.190
Oh, shut up.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.240
Gambling is just like relationships.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.740
The one who cries loses.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.690
If he does anything even remotely strange...

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.690
You can go home if you're scared.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.390
Let's do it! I'll wager my soul!
