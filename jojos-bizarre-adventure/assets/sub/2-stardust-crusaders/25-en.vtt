Episode 25
Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'doul, Part 1

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.530
Wh-What's that?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.780
They're here.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.780
It's a helicopter!

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.980
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.580
You don't have to state the obvious.
We can see that.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.220
That's a helicopter from
the Speedwagon Foundation.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.080
They're looking for a place to land.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.030
Speedwagon Foundation?

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.610
Your old friends who are taking
care of Mom back in Japan?

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.990
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.350
Don't tell me we're going
for a ride in that helicopter.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.500
No. As much as I'd like to,
the crew aren't Stand users.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.850
If we were attacked, they would be at risk.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.860
Then why is that helicopter here?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.610
They've brought us a helper.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.940
What? A helper?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.710
He has a few personality issues,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.510
so it's taken a while to get him here.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.790
Mr. Joestar!

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.880
It's impossible for him to
come with us on this trip!

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.930
There's no way he could be helpful.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.540
Do you know him, Avdol?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.130
Yeah, very well.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.880
Hold on. If he's a helper,
that means he's a Stand user, right?

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.490
He's the Stand user whose Stand
suggests the card called The Fool.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.110
The Fool?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.920
The Fool?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.270
Hah! That card sounds like an idiot.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.080
We're lucky that he's not our enemy.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.530
You wouldn't be able to beat him.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.520
What'd you say, you asshole?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.970
You'd better watch your mouth.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.640
It's the truth.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.670
And what's with the hand? That hurts.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.630
Sounding all high-and-mighty and shit...

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.290
Knock it off already.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.530
The helicopter landed.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.390
Mr. Joestar! Thank goodness you're safe.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.200
Thanks for coming out here. I appreciate it.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.440
So...

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.610
Who's the Stand user?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.370
I'm asking which one of you is the Stand user.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.760
Is it you?

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.000
No, it's not either of us.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.070
He's in the back seat.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.000
The back seat...

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.530
I don't see anyone there.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.150
No, he's there.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.970
Hey, hey, hey!

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.390
You say he's there, but where is he?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.100
Is he really short or something?

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.700
Get the hell out here! Come on!

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.570
W-Watch out!

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.070
Hm?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.850
What's this sticky stuff?

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.030
Please, be careful!

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.730
The helicopter ride was rough,
so he's in a really bad mood.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.830
Don't get close to him!

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.910
I told you, he's got some personality issues!

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.540
Polnareff, you can't win.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.950
And I'm asking where the hell he is—

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.120
Whoa!

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.240
H-H-H-H-H-He's...

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.200
...a dog!

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.620
Don't tell me this dog is....

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.890
Yes! He is The Fool Stand's user.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.680
His name is Iggy.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.900
He loves to tear out human hair by the mouthful.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.520
We don't know where he was born.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.780
When even the dog catchers in
New York couldn't get him,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.990
Avdol was able to find and finally capture him.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.120
Oh, I just remembered.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.010
While he's ripping out hair, he likes to...

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.130
fart in the human's face.
He's kind of vulgar.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.500
God damn it! You're gonna pay for that!

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.840
Damn you...

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.470
Chariot!

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.160
Th-That's...

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.840
So that's The Fool.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.750
We met an orangutan Stand user
off the shore of Singapore, but...

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.250
Who the hell do you think
you are, you stupid mutt?!

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.250
Don't make me cut you in half!

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.920
Slice

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.420
What the?! It's like it's turning into sand...

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.920
I-I can't cut it!

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.760
Now it became solid and swallowed up my sword!

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.070
That's...

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.080
Simply put, it's a Stand made of sand.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.750
Yeah... And the simpler they are,
the stronger they are.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.810
I'm not sure if I could hit it.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.990
Hey! Help! Do something about this dog!

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.790
Sorry, Polnareff,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.590
but I'm not about to get
my hair ripped out, too.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.240
You monster!

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.640
Do you have his treats?

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.160
If we didn't, we wouldn't
have been able to make it here.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.170
Stop! Help me!

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.870
His sense of smell is incredible.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.630
What is that?

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.250
Coffee-flavored chewing gum.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.350
It's Iggy's favorite treat,
and he'll do anything for it.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.140
Mr. Avdol! Keep the box hidden from—

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.040
Oh, no! He got the box!

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.480
He loves coffee-flavored chewing gum,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.990
but he still won't let down his guard for anyone.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.240
At least take the paper off first.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.500
There's no way he could actually help us.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.810
Good grief.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.180
Damn it...

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.110
My beautiful hair's been thinned...

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.990
You stupid bastard!

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.010
While he's eating the gum, he should be fine.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.600
Let's get the supplies out now.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.460
Here's some food and water for your trip.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.110
Oh, thank you.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.470
There are medical supplies
and a change of clothes, too.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.940
Also, a new camera, for taking spirit pictures.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.780
TVs don't work so well for spirit photography.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.200
Oh, I know.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.130
Hey, you guys.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.450
I see. It'll make a nice memory.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.090
Avdol! Hurry up with the gum!

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.990
But you're already such good friends, Polnareff!

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.390
Mr. Joestar, we'll be taking our leave now.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.840
There's something I'd like to ask you.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.350
About my daughter...

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.080
How is Holly doing?

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.190
Give it to me straight.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.540
Well, sir... I hate to say this,

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.280
but I'm afraid she's not doing very well.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.790
Her energy is fading,
and her life remains in danger.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.540
According to the doctors from
our Speedwagon Foundation,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.300
she'll be lucky if she survives
for another two weeks.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.050
There's no time.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.550
Damn it...

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.120
Also, we have some information for you.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.310
According to the report, two days ago...

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.630
Nine mysterious men and women

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.910
gathered in a building that DIO
is believed to be hiding in,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.520
and then they all departed together.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.730
DIO and nine others?

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.630
We don't know who they are.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.690
The person who reported this was killed,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.740
and the mansion had already been cleared out.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.320
We were unable to locate
the nine men and women.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.400
Any further investigation of
this matter is impossible for us,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.670
since we are not Stand users.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.580
Were they new Stand users?

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.630
Hold on.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.570
Any remaining Stand users with Stands that

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.010
suggest Tarot cards...
Excluding Hol Horse's Emperor,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.830
the only card left is The World.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.550
I had thought that The World
would be DIO's Stand, but...

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.480
Avdol?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.320
I-I don't know.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.770
I have no idea. Nine of them?

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:27.430
Apparently, DIO's head hasn't
gotten used to its new body yet.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.780
DIO is very proud, so there's
no way he'd flee from Cairo.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.540
It would appear that he's trying
to stop us from reaching Cairo.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.490
Good grief. There's only two
weeks left, and nine of them...

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.670
We might end up a little tired.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.590
We'll be off, then.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.510
Please have a safe trip.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.260
Thank you. Take care of Holly.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.090
That dog...

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.040
It noticed the presence of the Great N'doul, eh?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.150
Damn. So close.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.720
I was almost able to get it.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.660
I guess I need more practice.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.110
The Nile Ue Ue Fly, eh...

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.180
It's because of this fly
that Joestar and the others

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.160
were able to pursue Lord DIO this far...

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.040
The Fool

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.050
Iggy

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.090
Mr. Joestar, can't you
do something about this?

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.100
Why is that shitty little dog sitting in

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.780
the seat while we're stuck in the back?

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.530
It's so cramped, my back hurts.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.390
You'll have to wait until the flavor from his

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.700
beloved coffee gum fades.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.760
Once that happens, I'll throw
a new piece of gum into

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.360
the back so he'll go there.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.020
Then you can change seats.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.300
All right, all right. Calm down! Damn it...

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.260
Wh-What the hell?!

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.730
L-Look! Over there!

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.960
Th-That's...

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.540
The helicopter!

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.940
The Speedwagon Foundation helicopter
that flew off earlier is down in the sand!

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.530
There's no sign that it was attacked.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.580
It's like it just fell to the ground.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.620
It couldn't be!

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.830
Be careful!

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.420
It's very likely we'll be
attacked by the enemy's Stand!

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.290
Look! It's the pilot!

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.960
He's dead...

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.190
There are marks where he
clawed the helicopter's side...

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.800
This is horrible.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800
Approach carefully.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.220
Something could be hiding there.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.390
It's water.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.110
So much water...

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.420
It's coming from the pilot's mouth...
No, from his lungs.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.730
There's even a small fish.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.030
He drowned in the middle of the desert!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.530
What on earth?

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.840
H-Hey...

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.680
The other one's over here.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.160
He's alive!

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.160
Are you all right? Get a hold of yourself!

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.650
What on earth happened?

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.650
Wa...

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.640
Water...

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.440
What? You want water?

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.410
Polnareff, hand me that canteen.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.930
Right.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.700
Here, get a hold of yourself.
Here's some water.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.790
Drink slowly.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.040
No! The water's going to attack!

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.520
What?!

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.180
I-It's the enemy Stand!

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.850
The enemy Stand is inside the canteen!

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.150
D-Damn it!

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.440
The Speedwagon Foundation crew wasn't

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.740
part of this fight,
but they were still attacked!

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.820
Avdol, did you see what kind of Stand it was?

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.680
I only saw a hand.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.030
But it's still inside the canteen!

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.370
I haven't seen it leave.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.150
Who could it be?

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.330
They mentioned that DIO
gathered nine men and women...

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.710
Is the attacker one of them, then?

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.510
Jotaro, locate the enemy's body.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.330
I'm looking for it right now.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.590
But...

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.710
The enemy's body isn't anywhere I can see.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.490
I even looked for something like
that stupid mirror The Sun had.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.590
But it seems the enemy is
operating from very far away.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.320
Polnareff, attack the canteen.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.590
Huh? Me...?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.720
Th-The pilot's head was completely
sucked into that tiny little canteen.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.340
So if I poke a hole in that thing...

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.660
Hell no!

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.060
Kakyoin! You're closer!

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.470
You should just hit it with an Emerald Splash!

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.770
I don't want to.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.740
Don't try to make someone do
something you won't do yourself!

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.860
What the hell is wrong with you?!

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.760
No means no.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.900
Well, I say that I don't want to do it, either!

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.170
Th-This is...

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.920
Kakyoin!

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.710
It's the water!

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.580
It had already left the canteen,
along with the blood!

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.260
It's not that the Stand was
inside the canteen...

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.940
The water <i>is</i> the Stand!

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.560
It got Kakyoin!

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.020
I-It got Kakyoin's eyes!

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.910
Polnareff! Stop panicking!

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.610
Bring out Chariot and defend yourself!

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.330
Crap. It's going to get Polnareff, too.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.180
What's going on?
It attacked the pilot's corpse!

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.140
No, not the corpse. The watch.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.650
It attacked the watch's alarm.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.810
Sound! It attacks by locating sounds!

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.220
Sounds?

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.700
Shit! Polnareff!

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.320
It's coming for you this time!

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.950
Run to the vehicle!

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:24.960
I-It's so fast!

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.300
Hurry, Polnareff!

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.500
It cut me!

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.940
Hermit Purple!

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.360
It soaked into the ground...

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.840
The enemy can detect sound
through vibrations in the ground.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.310
It can move freely around underground,

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.350
without being seen, and before we know it,

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.130
it can attack us from behind,
or through the bottoms of our feet.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.660
And its user is able to remain far away.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.750
They all got onto their vehicle.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.240
He must have realized that I,
N'doul, was finding them with sound.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.720
Too bad figuring that out
won't do them any good...

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.780
H-How's Kakyoin?

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.060
It's not good.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.580
He may have been blinded.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.580
Let's drive.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.800
We have to get him to a doctor immediately.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.170
But if we move, it'll attack.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.450
We can't be careless.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.660
What?!

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.360
These footsteps... It's the dog.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.880
That dog...

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.130
It left the car before my attack.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.060
It anticipated my Stand's attack.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.220
It seems that dog is going
to be a problem after all.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.050
The tires are in the water! Shit!

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.140
It's no use. We're being pulled in!

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.020
We're going to slip!

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.350
Move further back!

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.010
Helper! Come on, damn it! Help, already! Hey!

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.780
That accursed dog...

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.530
It must also know that I'm
only four kilometers to the west.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.150
What should I do...

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.830
I'll have to take care of the dog first!

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.620
How careless can you be?!

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.300
You stupid dog!

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.380
No, I'll leave the dog alone.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.680
It doesn't appear that Joestar
and the others can control that dog.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.730
If it's just going to sleep, it's harmless.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:35.930
Now, without hesitation...

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.330
It's so sharp!
It cut the front tires in half!

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.080
Go even further back!

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.040
S-So that's what it's trying to do...
Shit! Everyone hang on!

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.860
Rumble

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.060
I can hear it! I can hear it!

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.890
Don't make a sound.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.720
He can smell where the
enemy's going to attack next.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.240
The water started chasing Jotaro!

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.550
If we can just find their body,

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.590
there's a good chance we
can defeat that fearsome Stand!

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.580
It's Iggy.
