00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.800
What the?! Something's coming!

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.700
I dunno what the hell that is,
but it's no ordinary human!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.630
Polnareff!

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.420
But no matter! I'll kill him!

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.590
A playing card?

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.640
Welcome. Master Joestar,
we have been awaiting your arrival.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.330
I am the butler of this mansion.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.850
My name is D'Arby.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.980
D'Arby?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.920
Yes. I am D'Arby Younger.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.440
I am the younger brother of
D'Arby Elder, whom you have

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.490
defeated beyond recovery.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.700
Bam

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.700
You're the gambler D'Arby's younger brother?

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.250
Are you here to avenge your older brother?

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.790
No, not at all. I wouldn't even think of it.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.510
Didn't my brother tell you

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.640
that the one who is fooled
and loses the battle is at fault?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.970
I believe that to be true, as well.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.390
It's my brother's fault for losing.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.420
I don't bear a grudge at all.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.640
My brother is my brother, and I am myself.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.270
We are different people.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.890
I am ten years younger than my brother.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.030
I did respect my brother to a certain degree,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780
but we are from different generations.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.200
My brother is old-fashioned.
He had to cheat and swindle to win.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.710
He could only defeat those who were
either old-fashioned or amateurs.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.250
I believe that Lord DIO also recognized this,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.090
and that is why I am the one
he chose to be his butler.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.130
What is the matter?

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.010
If you would like to fight me,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.890
please, come into the mansion.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.920
Everyone, don't rush in there carelessly.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.650
We don't have much time.
Hurry up and take us to DIO.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.650
Jotaro! Be careful! Something's coming out!

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.170
D'Arby Younger. His Stand, Atum,

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.080
suggests the God Atum.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.670
H-Hey, he brought out his Stand!

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.660
Well, that's rare these days.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.690
It's been a while since we faced someone who used their Stand out in the open.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.230
So who is it?

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.920
Who shall be my first opponent?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.050
He's so annoying!
Jotaro, beat the crap out of him!

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.720
Rumble

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.490
Let us make a wager.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.640
The first blow Star Platinum uses against me

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.390
will be a left-hand punch.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.330
His first attack will be a punch
thrown with his left arm.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.110
Let us wager.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.820
Whatever! It's all the same if you
hit him with everything you've got!

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.100
Do it!

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.050
Hurry up and hit him, Jotaro!

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.530
Bam

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.540
What? H-He dodged?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.550
Such speed!

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.730
That's impossible.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.650
Too bad. It seems I have lost this wager.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.380
Just like my brother, I love gambling.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.780
But I'm not very good at it.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.850
As a reward, I shall take
you to an amazing world.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.190
What? A hole...

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.530
Curses! It was a trap after all!

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.390
Jotaro!

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.860
Jotaro's falling into the hole!

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.490
Pull him out!

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.560
Oh, very well. You gentlemen may enter, too.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.710
Wha—

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.490
Mr. Joestar! Kakyoin!

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.750
Wait! It would be too dangerous to follow them!

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.380
Avdol, can you hear me?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.010
If you don't hear from us in ten minutes,
set the mansion on fire!

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.260
Got it, Avdol?!

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.680
Mr. Joestar!

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.820
Episode 40  D'Arby the Player, Part 1

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.400
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.230
This illusion... Are we
underground or above ground?

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.560
This wet feeling... This reality...

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.100
It's too convincing.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.880
Just what is he trying to do?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.980
Old man. Kakyoin.
Consider this mystery for me.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.020
His Stand...

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.150
It knew without doubt that I was
going to throw a right punch.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.620
Why do you think that is?

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.660
If we don't solve that mystery,
this guy will beat us.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.620
Would you like something to drink?

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.420
Of course, the drinks are real.
They are also not poisoned.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.960
Is this inside the mansion?

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.380
It is.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.800
Where inside the mansion?

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.470
I cannot disclose that.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.650
Is it below ground?

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.860
It could be.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.890
Is this illusion being created by a Stand?

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.390
Yes.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.770
Is this your Stand's power?

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.100
It is not.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.440
Is it DIO's?

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.610
It is not.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.980
Whose is it?

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.900
That information is not necessary.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.880
According to the Speedwagon Foundation's intel,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.800
there are about two or three other Stand users.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.950
Is that true?

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.410
That information is not necessary.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.580
Looks like we're not getting any straight answers.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.350
I could lie to you.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.210
But I don't tell lies or trick others,
as my brother did.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.350
So what are you getting at?

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.790
If we don't defeat you, we can't proceed?

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.140
Exactly!

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.210
That is indeed correct.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.010
That needlessly polite attitude...
This man gets on my nerves.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.150
Have you forgotten that it's one against three?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.860
We're in a hurry, so all three of us will attack you.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.010
Now, don't be in such a hurry.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.150
Before that, let's have a look

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.540
at my collection, shall we?

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.040
Collection?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.390
Though it pales in comparison to my
brother's, I also have a collection.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.040
But one likes to hear compliments
about their precious collection

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.690
when showing it to others.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.560
It can't be...

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.690
Dolls? Wh-What are these dolls?!

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.230
No, Kakyoin.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.210
Given that we're dealing with one

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.700
of the D'Arby brothers,
those can't be ordinary dolls.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:07.440
Squirm

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.760
D-D'Arby...

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.470
Talk to me. Please, talk to me...

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.840
Talk to me!

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.840
I'm so lonely...

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.360
Help me...

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.600
Oh my God!

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.700
They're alive! These dolls are alive!

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.850
You bastard! They're souls!

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.010
My hobby is to make dolls.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.420
And I've had real souls inhabit these dolls.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.160
I'm letting the cat out of the bag,
but this is my Stand's power.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.560
My brother simply enjoyed his
soul coins, collected in little rows.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.660
But that's rather simple and mundane.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.520
I change their clothes and even talk to them.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.770
For example,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.710
her name is Sonia.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.040
D'Arby! Oh, D'Arby!

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.170
I love hearing about her beautiful love stories.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.010
D'Arby...

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.940
Isn't her skin beautiful?

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.580
D'Arby...

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.720
She's so beautiful, I'm never
embarrassed to show her off.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.410
Dr. Elliott is a murderer.
He's killed eight people.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.870
I enjoy hearing about the
patients he murdered.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.450
I made his glasses and stethoscope myself.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.480
Oh, that's right! I must show you this!

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.750
The video game master from Japan, Tatsuhiko!

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.700
His IQ is 190, so he was formidable.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.660
It wasn't easy to beat him and steal his soul.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.660
Mama... Mama! Mama!

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.300
Both of you brothers are insane.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.610
No, you're much worse than your brother.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.410
You're pissing me off more!

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.470
You act like a gentleman, but you're scum.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.600
You make me sick.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.060
By the way, I'm sure you experienced
this when fighting my brother, but...

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.360
Human souls are indeed mysterious.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:00.760
Once you admit defeat,
your soul's energy drops almost to zero.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.180
I watch for that moment,
and then drag their souls out!

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.570
That is how both my
brother and my Stands work.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.700
That's enough talk!
You're just pissing me off.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.370
We'll hurry up and defeat you,
then move forward!

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.710
But you must listen!

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:22.550
Jotaro, you know you are
already under my control.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.530
Earlier, Jotaro, when I read whether you were

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.070
going to use your left or right,
you were shocked, weren't you?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.430
And how I read it is still a mystery to you.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.250
At that moment, though subtly,
I was able to touch your soul.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.690
What do you think I did when I touched it?

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.680
<c.colora6001b>Bam</c>

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.570
Wh-What?!

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.030
What is that?!

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.850
I left Atum's arm attached to your soul.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.140
If I were to crush your right arm,

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.790
I'm sure Lord DIO would be quite pleased.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.800
But in that instant, I would be
attacked by Kakyoin and Joestar,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.450
and would be utterly defeated.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.130
I don't want that to happen.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.470
So how about this, gentlemen?

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.850
Why don't we play a little game
and wager our souls?

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.060
What?

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.420
If I admit absolute defeat,
I shall let go of his arm.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.930
Good grief. Already under your control, huh?

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:34.410
True... But you're going to
regret tricking me, D'Arby.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.540
I would absolutely love to hear you say,

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.870
"I will play a game and wager my soul."

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.420
But the first to play will be...

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.080
Kakyoin. I choose you.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.200
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.740
You should fight me first.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.160
You and Joestar are related by blood,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.560
but you have no relation to Kakyoin.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.460
If, after I steal the two Joestar souls,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.760
Kakyoin lost interest in wagering his soul

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.910
and attacked me with his Stand,
it would be troublesome for me.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.080
You're so full of yourself.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.260
You seem to think you've already won.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.110
Very well. I shall be your first opponent.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.750
What?

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.960
Kakyoin!

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.750
It's fine. I feel confident.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.870
I have experience with video games myself.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.570
I'd like to challenge you to <i>F-Mega</i>.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.590
And I shall wager my soul!

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.020
Atum

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.020
D'Arby Younger

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.720
I shall wager my soul!

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.700
Good.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.150
Kakyoin!

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.550
You don't have to go first.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.510
Yes, I do.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.140
Since you have that thing attached to your arm,

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.550
it's likely you'd mess up the game's controls.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.370
D'Arby, where is our guarantee

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.090
that if you lose, your Stand
will let go of Jotaro's arm?

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:21.680
<c.color6c1e60>Menacing</c>

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.010
There's nothing wrong with the TV,
console, or game cartridges.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.910
These are the same video games
you could find anywhere else.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.660
I am not like my brother. I shall not cheat.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.360
Now, let's begin.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.920
Yes.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.150
F-Mega!

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.220
Select your car.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.590
First, please select your car.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.830
Right.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.180
So your machine is #28, eh?

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.870
Mine is #15, because I was born on January 5th.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.160
Are you ready?

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Enough pleasantries. Just go!

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.650
Race start in...

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.130
Five!

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.870
Th-The way he's pushing the accel button over

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.510
and over again at such a fast speed...

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.260
He's trying for a start dash!

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:43.430
Three...

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.560
Crap! I'm not going to be able to dash like this!

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.930
Two...

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.190
He's going to get ahead of me!

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.320
One.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.300
Start!

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.250
He blocked me!

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.530
As long as I can keep this up, I will win.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.770
It is impossible to get past me at this point.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.480
And sadly, I, D'Arby, never make
mistakes with controls in a race.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.570
You were naïve, Kakyoin!

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.490
What?!

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.120
I see you've played this game before, Kakyoin.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.120
I don't need to answer that.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.920
All right!

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.080
This is your chance, Kakyoin!

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.600
Hurry up! Get your machine
back on the course and start!

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.880
That technique...

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.050
It's not possible by simply
having experience in </i>F-Mega<i>.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.340
Although he looks rather
anxious on the outside,

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.890
he has a very bold personality.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.200
They're tied! They're right next to each other!

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.620
No. Kakyoin ended up on the outside.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.010
If they hit a curve side by side,
the outside car is at a disadvantage.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.580
355 kilometers per hour... 358... 360...

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.840
Only three seconds to the first corner!

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.170
It's possible to take the corner at this speed!

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.470
I'm going to bust through
that corner at full throttle!

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.840
Two... One!

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.120
At the same time!

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.340
They turned that corner at the
same speed and at the same time!

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.400
They're side by side!

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.750
I've taken a liking to you, Kakyoin!

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.920
You wagered your soul,
but you're not scared at all!

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.360
You rise above fear to work the controls.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.220
Only people like you, who give me competition,

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.290
are worthy of being a part of my doll collection.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.810
Noriaki Kakyoin thought to himself...

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.600
Me? Rise above fear?

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.220
Thanks. I've had training.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.260
Six months ago, when I met your master, DIO...

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.310
When he planted the flesh bud in my brain,

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.640
I was trained to withstand fear.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.280
That moment...

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:37.690
The moment I encountered DIO, honestly,
I was terrified of the beast he was.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.270
I lost feeling in my legs,
every hair on my body stood on end,

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.150
and my body was frozen.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.520
When I saw DIO and realized I couldn't move,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.270
the paralysis made my hairs
stand even more on end.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.710
My stomach convulsed, and I had acid reflux.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.710
I nearly threw up.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.520
As he looked at me, DIO said this to me.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.760
His voice was gentle, as if speaking to a child.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.370
Kakyoin.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.680
There's nothing to fear.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.180
Let's be friends.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.070
I curse myself! After I heard that...

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.810
I was relieved. To be honest,

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.740
I felt relief from the bottom of my heart.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.110
I thought I could stay alive!

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.080
But it was humiliating. I can't forgive myself!

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.950
Nothing could be more humiliating.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.030
I couldn't forgive myself.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.880
I cursed myself for giving in to him.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.100
Jotaro saved me, and that was the
reason I went on this journey.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.130
I will never return to being that
pathetic Kakyoin ever again!

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.090
D'Arby, that's exactly why I'm wagering
my soul with you in this challenge.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.750
Three, two, one!

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.530
Again, at the same time!

00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.950
The third corner!

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.780
That is why I, Noriaki Kakyoin,

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.740
will not make any nervous
mistakes with my controls.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.220
I will show you that!

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.970
All right! The fifth corner!
Again, at the same time!

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.950
They're going through all
of them the same time!

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.920
K-Kakyoin... Damn you...

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.250
Next is the sixth corner!

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.770
Once you're through the sixth corner,
you'll see a speed tunnel.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.070
As soon as you're through the tunnel,

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.000
you'll be able to go twice
as fast, up to 850km.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.490
No matter what,
I must go through that tunnel!

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.310
But the tunnel is only wide enough
to accommodate one vehicle.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.430
If they continue to race neck-and-neck,

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.360
one of them won't be able to enter the tunnel!

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.190
The sixth corner! Again, they were together!

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.820
The tunnel! I see the tunnel.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.410
Kakyoin, don't let him push you out!

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.980
It seems you haven't realized yet, Kakyoin.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.300
Are you trying to push me out?

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.010
Take a look at your #28's remaining power.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.240
K-Kakyoin has less!

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.570
At the race's start,

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.010
you spun and were blown away
by my blocking maneuver.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.890
Didn't you realize you had less energy after that?

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.860
Two seconds until the tunnel.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.190
You're going to collide!
Let him have the lead!

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.490
Go into the tunnel after D'Arby!

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.850
I cannot!

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.660
If I let him enter the tunnel first,
my chances of winning are gone.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.540
One second until the tunnel!

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.690
Kakyoin!

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.540
Grip

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.760
Whoa! He tilted his car!

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.720
I never guessed you'd enter on the tunnel's wall.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.590
Y-You did it, Kakyoin! Mentally, you're winning!

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.060
Keep pushing through!

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.520
Shut up! You're distracting me.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.060
He's ramming him!

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.680
I don't care how little power I have left.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.150
I'll take this next turn, even if only a
hundredth of a second ahead of Kakyoin,

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.710
take the shortest course, even if it's
by a thousandth of a millimeter,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.210
and get through this tunnel
even if it's but a moment faster!

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.390
No radar.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.150
H-Hey, what's wrong?
I can't see the machines!

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.930
We have to get through the
tunnel in darkness from here.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:31.960
What?!

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.560
Absolute darkness, where the
radar is completely useless!

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.550
There are eight curves,
one mine, and one cannon.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.350
At the end of the darkness is the tunnel's exit.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.940
One mistake and you'll hit the wall.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.330
But my body has memorized the
timing needed to take the curves.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.130
So has D'Arby.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.950
That's the sound of taking a corner.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.820
What's going on?! Where are they driving?

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.440
Who's going faster?

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.580
Three...

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.140
Two...

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.850
One!

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:22.910
Cannon!

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.090
Just for an instant,

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.180
I could see them in the
light of the cannon blast!

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.530
Kakyoin is just slightly behind.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.240
I can see the exit!
They're coming out of the tunnel!

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.950
Gulp!

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.950
D'Arby is ahead!

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.170
He's ahead by a length!

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.090
I have won!

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.070
I will never let down my guard.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.270
You have less power than I!

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.850
I've grasped his soul!

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.140
Don't be ridiculous, Jotaro!

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.820
I know the rules of baseball.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.690
It is impossible to back out now!

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.650
You should offer encouragement
at times like this.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 40

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
D'Arby the Player, Part 2

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.030
This is pathetic.
