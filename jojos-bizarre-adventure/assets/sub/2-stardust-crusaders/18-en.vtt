How could this have happened?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.160
I can't believe...

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.960
I can't believe we totally fell for it.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.480
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.320
Stardust Crusaders

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.720
Jotaro and company stopped
The Lovers' cowardly attack.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.930
To avoid the politically unstable
route from Iran to Iraq,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.030
they crossed the Arabian Sea at Karachi,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.480
and entered the United Arab Emirates.

Episode 18: The Sun

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.970
Now, once you sign this,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.450
you'll be under contract.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.300
Here, right?

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names

Man... If a cute girl like you asked me to,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.860
I might even buy them a car.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.360
My, what a talker.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.740
How about we get dinner sometime?

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.780
Polnareff, I'm terribly sorry to
interrupt when you're so busy, but...

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.270
Mr. Joestar!

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.450
We're leaving.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.730
Come on! Don't mess with the hair.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.850
It's really hard to get this hairdo right.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.290
Who cares about your hairdo?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.310
We need you to drive.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.330
Righto.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.220
Bye, Mademoiselle.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.950
But, man, Mr. Joestar,
why are we riding in such a fancy,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.000
expensive car in this sandy place?

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.550
Why not get an off-road vehicle?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.200
You'll find out soon enough.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.780
But, man, I can't believe this country.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.790
Every house we see is like a mansion.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.380
Indeed.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.030
All the houses around here would

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.240
cost 3 or 4 billion yen in Tokyo.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.340
Apparently, this is the norm for the people here.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.860
Just twenty years ago, this was all desert,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.980
but thanks to massive profits from the oil crisis,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.850
this place grew into a dream-like city.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.780
The sun is harsh,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.190
but with air conditioning, it's
perfectly comfortable inside the car.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.510
No complaints here.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.820
Oh?

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.760
What's wrong, Kakyoin?

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.120
I-It's nothing.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.250
The view here is amazing.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.130
If anyone were after us,
I'm sure we'd spot them,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.460
but I feel like someone's watching us,
so I can't help looking back.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.740
Yeah, I can't blame you.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.580
Well, with that in mind,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.090
I've been thinking about our route from here.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.490
About 100 kilometers northwest
is a village called Yarpline.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.750
Because of the desert and mountains,
the road is heavily curved.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.440
It takes two days to reach by car,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.140
so the villagers use a Cessna to travel.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.210
I think we should go to the village first,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.740
buy a Cessna, and cross the
vast Saudi Arabian desert.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.980
Up to now, I've been worried
that attacks by Stand users

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.660
would cause any airplane we rode in to crash,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.850
putting innocent lives at risk.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.460
But if we have a Cessna, I can pilot it,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.750
and it'll shorten our travel time.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.650
I don't really want to board a Cessna with a man

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.130
who's been through three plane crashes.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.810
Well, anyway,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.710
I think we should first cross this desert

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.970
to get to the village of Yarpline.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.950
On camels, it would take one day.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.580
Camels?!

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.120
A Cessna's one thing, but wait a minute!

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.300
I've never ridden a camel before.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.490
Leave it to me.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.070
I know them very well.
I'll teach you how to ride.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.240
Just sit back and relax.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.250
You want camels?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.590
Sure, but they're pretty expensive

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.250
and not easy to care for.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.950
We're in a serious, life-or-death situation,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.210
so we need them, whatever it takes.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.090
As for payment, how about a trade for that car?

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.260
What?!

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.250
That's way too much, sir.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.170
Yeah, Mr. Joestar!

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.770
Besides, you just bought that car!

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.430
Why else do you think I bought
such a fancy, expensive car?

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.290
An off-road vehicle is better in the desert.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.110
But I wouldn't be able to
write a check in a place like this,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.630
and they don't trust cash here.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.580
In a place like this, trading is far more effective.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.830
If you try to buy safety for cheap
in a time of emergency,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.920
you'll end up even worse off in the end.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.320
Well, it just means we've suffered a lot already.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.580
Hey, Mister.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.280
Huh?

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.180
This seals the deal, right?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.180
Oh, I know. To make things more even,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.770
I'd like the water in those tanks there.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.840
In a desert, that's the most important thing.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.480
Water is cheap compared to that car.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.280
You sure are an odd one.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.640
All right, everyone. Let's get ready.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.800
Crossing a desert is a tough task.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.730
Let's keep our wits about us!

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.340
I-It stinks!

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.110
Hey, Mr. Joestar.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.350
How do you get on it?

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.210
It's, like, three meters tall.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.220
Well, you see, with camels...

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.290
You make them sit first, and then get on.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.850
You make them sit first, and then get on...

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.400
You make them sit, then get on!

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.530
J-Just one moment.
It's gonna sit down right now.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.580
Hey! Sit! Sit down!

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.760
Damn it, you stubborn animal!

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.500
Hey, you <i>have</i> ridden one of these before, right?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.090
I've seen that really long movie,
<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, three times!

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.550
I know very well how to ride a camel!

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.310
Though, two of those times,
I slept through half of it...

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.070
M-Movie?!

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.600
What? You've never actually ridden one?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.460
It's great sunscreen! Didn't you know that?

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.970
Listen up...

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:28.430
When dealing with animals, it's
important to understand how they feel.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.330
Exactly how they feel!

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.260
Here, doesn't this apple look delicious?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.580
It's tasty!

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.350
Come on, come on...

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.590
Good boy...

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.520
Look! See?! It sat down!

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.460
If you take time to understand the camel,
it'll sit down for you!

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.730
I did it!

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.380
It's so high up!

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.650
They can close their nostrils to keep sand out.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.730
Just don't make any stupid jokes

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.280
like "Once you get over the hump,
it's easy," or they'll kick you.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.540
All right. Now I'll tell you what to
be careful with when riding camels.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.140
Listen up.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.290
Camels don't walk like horses.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.290
The front and back leg on the same side

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.840
move forward together, so they sway a lot.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.760
So just ride with that rhythm.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.370
Like this!

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.600
Hey, wait! T-Too fast!

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.630
L-Listen to me...

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.500
Not that way, I said!

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.070
All right. Looks like everyone
got on as smoothly as planned.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.620
Let's get through that desert, everyone!

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.000
Onward toward the northwest!

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.920
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.560
Something's wrong.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.180
I still can't shake the feeling
that someone's watching us.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.350
Kakyoin, I think you're worrying a bit too much.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.450
The palm leaves are covering our tracks.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.570
And we can see a great distance around us.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.330
If someone were here, we'd know.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.390
Actually, I can't help but feel a presence, too.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.250
Jotaro, look into it.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.390
Do you see anything suspicious?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.750
No, I don't. There's nothing. But...

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.240
Something's weird. Something is...

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.780
Hey, let's hurry up and go.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.030
Indeed.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.690
Let's get as far as we can,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:19.570
and once the sun goes down,
we'll stop and put up our tents.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.790
It's too dangerous to travel at night.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:29.510
But, man, it's hot. Look, it's 50 degrees Celsius.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.630
It is hot.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.280
But it's always hottest around this time of day...

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.600
Eight o'clock? Wha?

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.060
Jotaro! What time does your clock say?

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.230
Ten after eight...

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.970
Hey, Old Man!

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.360
So, it is...

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.190
I-I know we lost track of time,

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.970
b-but what's going on?

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.990
It's past 8 PM...

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.060
So why isn't the sun going down?

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.740
I-Impossible!

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.600
The thermometer just jumped
to 60 degrees Celsius!

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.990
N-Not only is it not going down...

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.910
...but it's actually rising
higher and higher in the west!

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.270
Could that sun be...

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.070
...a Stand?!

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.990
The Sun

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.990
Arabia Fats

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.540
I-I can't believe this!

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.530
We're in the middle of the desert!

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.540
Try to hide behind some rocks!

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.370
That sun is a Stand?!

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.300
We were careless. I didn't realize...

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.720
I felt like we were being watched,
but couldn't see it at all...

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.780
At this rate, all day long... No, all night long...

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.570
That Stand is planning

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.670
to boil us overnight, like octopuses,

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.850
and kill us!

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.590
No. It won't take that long.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.840
It's dangerous to even be in a
sauna for more than thirty minutes.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.250
How can we fight it?

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.740
Damn it! It's now 70 degrees Celsius!

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.480
Not to mention, we can't even tell
if that Stand is close or far away!

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.700
The distance is impossible to judge!

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.210
The quickest way to settle
this is to take out the user.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.890
Yes, the user... Whoever it is should be nearby.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.070
We must find them.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.400
They've been concealing their
presence from us somehow while

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.010
following us all this way.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.490
Hold it!

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.510
What if it's like The Lovers

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.980
that we encountered in Pakistan,
a Stand that can be remotely controlled?

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.060
That's inconceivable.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.880
A weak Stand can be controlled from a distance,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.350
but I'm sure you can feel The Sun's energy...

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.780
The user must be nearby.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.700
This isn't good...

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.590
The camels are collapsing from the heat.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.400
But just staying still won't help us!

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.970
I'll use Hierophant to look around.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.220
Kakyoin!

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.190
I'll just find out the enemy Stand's location.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.660
If we know how far away it actually is,

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.890
we might be able to find the user.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.110
Twenty meters. Forty meters...

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.280
Sixty meters. Eighty meters...

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.490
One hundred...

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.050
Something's not right!

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.120
Kakyoin! Call Hierophant back!

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.040
Something's coming at us!

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.580
Before that happens, Emerald...

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.960
Kakyoin!

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.520
The camel!

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.040
You bastard!

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.720
I'm busting a hole in the ground, so get in!

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.700
Are you all right, Kakyoin?

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.710
Yes. I was in the middle of using Emerald Splash.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.350
That guarded me, so I'm not badly hurt.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.450
B-But more importantly, it's hot...

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.090
I feel like I'm going to go crazy.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.870
That attack was perfectly aimed.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.420
That means the enemy is definitely watching us.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.480
Where are they?! Where's the enemy?

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.880
Don't talk so loud.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.290
The enemy will find us!

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.490
Calm down. Let's just sit
tight and see what happens.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.990
Oh, shit!

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.090
Things can't go on like this...

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.250
Think!

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.550
This is the time for an
old-timer like me to shine!

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.870
But we're in a bad spot.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.120
I can't even use my best technique.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.240
I have to get some information...

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.670
Jotaro!

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.820
Son of a bitch!

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.280
Where the hell are you?!

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.210
How are you watching us?

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.340
Is the enemy invisible or something?!

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.070
Hey, Kakyoin, what's wrong?

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.060
Hey, Kakyoin!

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.140
What are you laughing about?

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.240
A-Are you all right, Kakyoin?!

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.590
Get a grip, man!

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.710
J-Jotaro? You, too?!

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.790
Y-You, too, Polnareff?!

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.230
Oh, my God!

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:43.130
E-Everyone's finally lost it because of the heat.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.490
I'm the only one left who's sane.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.240
Hey! Jotaro, calm down!
Get a hold of yourself!

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.380
The best way to win when the
going gets rough is to stay calm!

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.200
Wha?!

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.170
Don't get the wrong idea, Mr. Joestar...

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.800
Look at that rock over there.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.910
Isn't it just big enough for someone to hide behind?

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.170
What do you mean?

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.100
Now look at the rock on the opposite side.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.250
On the opposite side?

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.910
You still don't see it?

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.620
There's a rock that's shaped exactly the same

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.780
on the opposite side.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.870
The shadow is also reversed. Which means...

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.210
It's so stupid!

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.300
Move.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.950
Out of my way, Old Man.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.210
Jotaro! If you go outside right now,

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.520
you're all but asking to be attacked!

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.750
It's dangerous!

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.600
A hole appeared in the air?!

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.110
Good grief. You're pathetic, Old Man.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.710
I'll just assume that the heat's too much for you.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.870
Otherwise, it's hard to
believe you're my grandfather.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.090
We've defeated the enemy Stand,
so it's night now.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.540
Or should I say it's back to being night?

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.830
Either way, we're safe.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.050
How long do you plan to stay in that hole?

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.590
R-Right...

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.550
Good grief. It's finally dark.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.860
It's a mirror!

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.980
Take a look.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.370
Check out the machines behind this mirror.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.770
It's pretty comfortable.
It even has air conditioning.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.670
Man, I didn't realize that
he was reflecting the desert

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.510
landscape and tailing us from behind.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.780
He has a tank of water.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.160
We'll gladly take that.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.040
Hey, a drink.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.500
Huh?

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:12.050
Wait, this means... we beat him already?

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.590
It's done?

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.350
We don't even know this guy's name,

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.680
but we've already beaten his Stand, The Sun?

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.570
That would be what it means.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.100
The Sun

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.690
The Sun                         <font size="34">Retires</c>

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.720
The Sun card's Stand, huh?

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.810
It was quite the opponent,

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.870
but once you figure it out, it's pretty stupid.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.500
Let's hurry to our next destination.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.520
It's quite chilly in the desert at night, isn't it?

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.290
W-Wait! Traveling at night is dangerous!

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.710
Now we might get lost!

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.360
We've defeated our enemy,

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.690
so we can have sweet dreams tonight.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.090
Ba-dum-tss.
