00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.210
Th-This isn't good!

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.620
Don't lose your cool.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.190
It's times like these when
men need to be prepared.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.630
It's hard to get this stuff on
without my artificial hand.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.800
Who here has scuba dived before?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.680
Not me.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.480
No.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.260
I haven't.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.500
The High Priestess is still
attacking from the next room!

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.670
Quickly, teach us how to dive!

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.770
Don't panic, Avdol.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.870
Above all, never panic.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.520
That's the most important thing in scuba diving.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.900
When you're underwater,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.930
for every ten meters you go below the surface,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.310
the pressure increases by one atmosphere.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.270
At the surface, there's one atmosphere of pressure.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.970
We're forty meters below the surface right now,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.330
so we'll endure five atmospheres of pressure.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.640
If we try to surface immediately,
our lungs and blood vessels will burst.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.960
We have to go up slowly,
so our bodies can adjust.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.400
We're near the Egyptian coast,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.230
so we'll go up along the sea floor.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.860
Now...

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.360
I'm going to let water in.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.320
This is a regulator. There's a valve inside

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.520
that only lets in air from
the tank when you breathe in.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.280
When you exhale, your breath
comes out the left side.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510
What about your spit?

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.880
What happens if spit or phlegm
comes out while you're underwater?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.290
That stuff just comes out here.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.360
By the way, this should be obvious,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.190
but we can't talk underwater.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.090
We'll use hand signals instead.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.300
Let's keep things simple and use two.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.270
When everything is fine,
we'll use this to say "okay."

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.590
When things aren't good, use this.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.020
Mr. Joestar, given who we are,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.680
couldn't we use our Stands to talk?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.460
That's a good point.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.940
Aww, but I know a hand signal message, too.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.570
"Your underwear is showing."

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.680
Yeah!

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.730
We're under attack and could die anytime!

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.950
Stop fooling around and let's go!

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.610
This room will soon fill with water.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.840
Put on your goggles and regulator.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.110
P-Polnareff!

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.330
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.330
Stardust Crusaders

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.830
The High Priestess, Part 2

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.420
Wh-When did...

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.300
I-It had already transformed into a regulator!

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.840
Th-That bastard...

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.640
It's going to go in through
his mouth and tear him apart!

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.830
This is bad!

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.630
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.560
You've got to drain the room.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.780
It's too late for that!

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.650
She must have been waiting for this moment!

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.570
C-Crap!

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.930
It's inside Polnareff now!

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.990
I-It's going to tear him apart!

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.360
Wh-What should we do?

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.990
Hierophant Green!

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.230
Hermit Purple!

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.490
Wriggle

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.660
H-Hey...

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.560
I got it before it went down his throat, Kakyoin!

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.860
Me, too!

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.090
Let's force it out before it transforms!

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.880
We did it!

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.140
All right, keep hold of it.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.230
Look! It's transforming into something else.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.760
Clang

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.770
A speargun! It turned into a speargun!

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.770
Emerald Splash!

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.390
Silver Chariot!

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.790
Now!

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.140
It's reloading!

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.290
This isn't good!

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.500
H-Hurry!

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.760
Hurry up, old man!

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.050
I know, I know!

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.970
Th-That was close...

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.250
It's too soon to relax.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.150
The bastard knows exactly
how to hit us where it hurts.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.610
Polnareff, are you all right?

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.650
I-I'm fine...

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.520
You guys saved me.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.620
Merci beaucoup.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.550
The sea floor is so beautiful.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.620
I wish I could have come here on vacation.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.930
This is no time to take it easy.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.440
We must surface before our oxygen runs out.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.290
Will it come after us?

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.880
I can't see that happening.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.050
The High Priestess can transform
into metals and glass,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.450
but she can't become fish, water, or sea foam.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.890
Just watch your back while you swim.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.390
If she pursues us,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.320
she'll probably transform into
a screw on our gear to do it.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.130
Be careful of moving pebbles and stones, too.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.600
Look, it's a sea tunnel.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.880
Our depth is seven meters.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.600
We're finally at the Egyptian shore!

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.560
Swim along these rocks to the surface.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.300
What?!

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.580
Th-This is...

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.770
The S-Stand... It was disguised as the sea bed!

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.290
It's so big...

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.050
W-We're being sucked into its mouth!

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.470
Crush

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.430
I-Impossible!

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.390
How is it so gigantic?!

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.860
What's with its size?!
What's this Stand's power?!

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.570
It was so small earlier!

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.340
You boys are so slow.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.980
Didn't you realize that
if the rocks are mineral,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.000
that means the sea bed is
mostly mineral, too?

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:44.000
The Stand's power has increased
because its user is nearby!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.260
She must be very close!

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.210
Precisely!

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.850
I'm seven meters above, on the shore.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.610
But the High Priestess will grind you all to bits,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.430
so you'll never see my face.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.680
I-I wonder exactly where in the Stand we are.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.490
We're still inside its mouth.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.420
We weren't sucked down its throat.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.180
Hey, Jotaro!

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.200
Jotaro, you're my type,
so this will be hard for me.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.190
It's too bad I have to make my Stand,
the High Priestess, digest you.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.410
If only we had met under
other circumstances. How sad.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.110
But if I kill you, Lord DIO will praise me.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.350
Don't hate me!

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.030
Good grief. Do I have to say that?

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.540
Say it! Come on, just hurry up and say it!

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.350
Say what?

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.960
I see...

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.640
Rose,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.600
I'd like to see your face once.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.940
You might be my type.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.890
I might fall for you.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.820
I-I think she's probably gorgeous!

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.020
I can tell from her voice.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.950
Indeed. I get the impression
of an elegant woman.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.530
It's my fortune teller's instinct.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.660
Doesn't she sound like
the actress, Audrey Hepburn?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.200
If only I were thirty years younger.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.040
You bastards! You don't mean any of that!

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.290
I'll kill you!

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.140
Holy shit!

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.480
Everyone, look!

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.720
Wh-What is that?

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.140
I-It's a tongue!

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.390
It's the Stand's tongue!
Look out! Be careful!

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.640
Jotaro!

00:10:58.570 --> 00:10:59.940
Jotaro!

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.480
Where's Jotaro going to land?

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.570
Its teeth! The molars!

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.030
Jotaro! Dodge!

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.160
You'll be crushed!

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.710
You want to pit your strength against mine?

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.540
S-So strong...

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.110
Jotaro! These teeth are as hard as diamonds!

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.920
You'll never break them!

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.610
I'll kill you first!

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.140
Save Jotaro!

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.100
Don't get in my way!

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.520
It's the tongue again!

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.770
Magician's Red!

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.700
Th-This isn't good!

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.650
Pull him out!

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.650
Jotaro!

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.970
High Priestess

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.970
Rose

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.160
Jotaro!

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.150
J-Jotaro was crushed by the teeth...

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.340
J-Jotaro...

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.020
We didn't make it in time?

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.490
No, wait. I can hear something.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.350
It sounds a bit far away...

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.650
It sounds like it's getting closer.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.000
Th-This voice...

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.450
The teeth! It's coming from inside the teeth!

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.090
Everyone, brace yourselves!

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.010
Huh?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.670
Despite the teeth being as hard as diamonds,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.010
he managed to dig his way out.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.600
Oh, my God!

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.690
While he's at it, he's breaking
the other teeth, as well!

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.890
For crying out loud...

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.910
As usual, that Stand's power is immense.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.660
Hey, we're getting out of here.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.060
Ker-Splash

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.730
Good grief. Well, they were pretty hard teeth,

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.340
but I still busted them.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.770
I guess your diamonds were a little low on calcium.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.220
That was awful...

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.390
Hey, there's a woman passed out over there.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.880
I assume it's Rose, user of the High Priestess.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.080
What should we do? Is she incapacitated?

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.510
Maybe I'll go see if she's hot or not!

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.720
Looks like she's got a nice figure.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.510
Let's see...

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.190
Well? Polnareff?

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.810
N-No comment...

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.790
Stop! Don't look!

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.520
Her teeth are all busted,
so there's no point in looking!

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.780
Anyway, we've finally made it to Egypt.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.680
Indeed. In a jet, this trip
would've taken twenty hours.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.290
But it took us thirty days.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.910
We visited many places.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.320
Inside a brain, and even inside a dream.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.970
A dream? What are you
talking about, Kakyoin?

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.450
Hey, now. It's morning. Wake up already.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.140
Oh, right. You guys didn't know about that.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.560
Well, whatever. Let's go.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.940
The Stand.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.560
A mysterious, spiritual power
symbolized by the Tarot.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.180
</i>Around the World in 80 Days.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.090
Joseph Joestar once described
their journey in that way.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.710
Traveling from Tokyo to Hong Kong, they encountered Tower of Gray.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.260
On their way to Singapore by sea,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.550
they encountered Dark Blue Moon and Strength.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.680
In Singapore, they encountered
Ebony Devil and Yellow Temperance.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.970
In Calcutta, India, it was
Hanged Man and Emperor.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.480
In Varanasi, India, the Empress.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.190
Near the Pakistani border, Wheel of Fortune.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.770
In the mountains of Pakistan, Justice.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.560
In Karachi, Pakistan, the Lovers.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.010
In the deserts of the
United Arab Emirates, the Sun.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.500
In Saudi Arabia, Death 13.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.500
On a small island in the Red Sea, Judgment.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.710
And now, on the Red Sea floor, the High Priestess.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.580
Aswan

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.580
Red Sea

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.580
Saudi Arabia

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.580
Abu Dhabi

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.580
United Arab
Emirates

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.590
After defeating many of DIO's assassins,

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.470
they have finally arrived in Egypt.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.590
Red Sea

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.590
Egypt

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.590
Aswan

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.590
Where they surfaced

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.220
Only a few of the Tarot Cards remain.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.690
But Jojo and the others do not yet know

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.110
that new threats still await them.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.690
That's...

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.950
One, two, three... nine.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.670
Nine of them? Men and women...

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.460
Huh?

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.740
What... is that?

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.190
Have the flies swarming
nearby been eliminated?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.570
The Speedwagon Foundation...

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.260
I can't let my guard down
for a minute. For pity's sake...

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.560
I've gotten quite used to this body now.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.020
Do you feel it, Jonathan?

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.740
Your descendants are coming closer.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.850
It's so very cruel...

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.250
this world of ours.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:08.550
Oh, I see. So Jotaro is helping you with work.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.350
Good, very good.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.910
Hmph.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.290
He's got a long way to go, compared to me.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.210
So, is your work that important?

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.870
Yeah. It's a very important task.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.840
I can't mess it up.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.390
But if we work together, we will get it done.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.600
Say, Joseph. Could I speak to Jotaro?

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.730
Sure, but what about?

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.110
Nothing much.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.360
Is it wrong that I want to hear
my darling grandson's voice?

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.320
No.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.430
Jotaro.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.580
It's me.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.490
I've heard all about it, Jotaro!

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.300
Do your best. Take care of
your grandfather for me.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.490
Yeah.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.830
I'm sure if you work together, you Joestar men

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.840
can overcome any hardship.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.500
I truly believe that.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.710
Grandma Suzie, you...

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.930
Hm? What's the matter?

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.870
You sound so serious all of a sudden.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.070
It's nothing.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.140
All right, I'm hanging up.
I look forward to good news. Ciao!

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.210
Madam...

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:29.910
It has been thirty years now that
I've worked for the Joestar family.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:34.050
B-But this is the first time
something like this has...

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.650
Oh, you're overreacting.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.000
It's just a business trip, isn't it?

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.430
W-Well...

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:45.610
It's so troublesome when men act selfish.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.110
But I'm used to it by now.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.790
The Joestar family has been

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.720
like this for a century.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.700
I'm sure she'll say so, too, and laugh it all off.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.300
What's wrong, Jotaro?

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.460
It's nothing.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.290
All right, let's go.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.560
The ties to DIO that we've had for a century...

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.170
We Joestars will finally bring that to an end.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.450
It's won't just be us.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.050
Hey, Mr. Joestar!

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.870
We got the car!

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.830
Let's hurry up and go.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.370
Let's get where we're going,
before it gets too dark.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.590
Old man.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.490
Yes, we're quite lucky.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.140
If you don't hurry up,
we're gonna leave you behind.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.820
All right, we're coming.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:55.850
Egypt: a nation that is 97% desert.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.030
But, thanks to the blessings of the Nile,

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:03.050
beautiful, fertile green spreads
all the way down its river banks.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.270
As well as the culture of the ancient Egyptians,

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:13.380
Egypt is also home to Persian, Greek,
Roman, Muslim, and Arabian cultures.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.780
It is a blended nation.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.170
In this eternal land,

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:22.150
what misfortunes await Jotaro
and the others on their journey?

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.510
Bam

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.200
Egypt Arc

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.200
Begins January 2015

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.220
Menacing
