Episode 15: Justice Part 2

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.500
Polnareff... I want to kill you!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.210
I want to avenge my son
by ripping out your insides!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.410
Hey, old lady!

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.630
But I can't let him find
Hol Horse's corpse right now.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.170
She's not behind the counter, either.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.600
It'll be even worse if
the other three show up.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.320
I need to kill them one by one, damn it.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.890
Go away for now!

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.950
Old lady, are you here?

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.270
I thought I heard some kind of crash.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.740
Is everything okay?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.940
I'm coming in, old lady.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.200
Whoa!

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.800
Ouch...

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.450
What happened, old lady?

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.140
Oh, it's nothing.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.420
I just fell and banged my hip.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.660
You fell?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.460
That's really dangerous. You
recently burned your left hand, too.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.760
You sure are careless.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.550
Thank you for your concern.
I'm sorry... I'll be fine.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.590
No problem at all.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.960
Get out!

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.520
Who said you could come in here, damn it?!

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.160
I'll spare you my wrath for now...

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.670
But later on, I'll kill you
just like I killed Hol Horse!

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.270
I just need to give you a little wound...

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.420
And I can make you a puppet
for my Justice to control!

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.260
There we go... Here's your staff.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.010
What? You seem to be sweating a lot.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.460
No, really, don't worry about me.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.510
Please just go rest in your room.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.620
Are you sure?

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.310
But, are you running
this hotel all by yourself?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.750
Don't you have any other family?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.950
A son, maybe?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.970
Huh? What was that?

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.650
E-Er, I was just saying I've
gotten used to living alone.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.660
I see...

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.730
But isn't it lonely?

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.920
Like, say your son had a wife.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.320
Your grandkids could run
around happily in the lobby.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.420
It'd be a little noisy, but...

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.510
Aren't families great?

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.270
If you had kids, would they be older than me?

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.540
What's wrong?

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.820
Did they move to the big city, or something?

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.110
N-No. They've passed away.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.240
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I've been totally rude, then...

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.770
You're the asshole that killed him, god damn it!

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.330
I'm going to kill you! Kill you!

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.910
Here, have a seat.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.900
Want me to rub your shoulders?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.690
I'm alone, too.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.520
I lost my mother when I was really young.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.500
This makes me think of my mom...

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.080
Tonight,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.770
you can think of me as your son...

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.260
and ask anything you want of me.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.750
You stupid little brat!

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.270
Maybe I should kill you right now after all!

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.780
Wow, you're really tense.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.050
I guess it's really been tough on you.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.490
Wh-Who is that?

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.500
H-Hol Horse? You're still alive?

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.740
You must have made your
Stand disappear as soon as it

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.000
shot the bullet into your mouth!

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.640
Th-That face!

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.510
Menacing

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.510
P-Polnareff! Behind you...

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.260
You're Hol Horse!

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.770
Wha—

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.300
What are you doing?!

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.310
Shut up! I'm the mother of
Centerfold, whom you killed!

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.530
Chariot!

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.200
Why, you... You're a Stand user?!

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.190
All those responsible for
my son's murder will die!

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.120
M-Mr. Joestar!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.290
It's too late.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.880
I've already made sure that
you can't contact the other three.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.020
Because...

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.050
I've summoned them.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.050
Who the hell are you guys?!

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.970
Y-You're...

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.190
The Indian traveler we found dead

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.020
as soon as we got to town...

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.570
These corpses are moving?!

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.260
This is my Stand, Justice's ability!

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.290
No one can have more than one Stand,
but Justice is a fog Stand

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.170
that can control corpses!

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.720
It can control hundreds, even thousands!

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.060
Aren't you taking this
unjustified grudge a bit far?

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.440
To think that such a twisted
Stand user was after us...

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.710
The whole town's trying to kill you.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.190
A-And if you get wounded, this will happen...

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.200
I just need to give you a little scratch.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.690
Just a little one.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.060
Then my Stand, Justice, will kill you!

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.000
Get him!

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.300
I'm outta here!

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.460
Polnareff! Don't leave me here!

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.570
Oh, shut up! Did you forget about Avdol?

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.320
I have no obligation to help you!

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.010
You can just die there!

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.180
I'm not letting you get away, Polnareff!

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.200
I'll yank your brain out!

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.780
I'll break your spine in half!

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.860
I'll crush you to death!

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.960
I will get vengeance for my son!

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.650
How terrifying!

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.030
Can an old woman really run this fast?!

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.570
Take this!

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.580
Damn it! He ran into the back room!

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.730
After him! Break down that door!

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.570
Wh-What the hell...

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.300
This is a hallway leading
down to the basement.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.380
Even if I try to contact
Mr. Joestar and the others,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.550
I'm so far away now, they'd never hear me!

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.060
I don't think I'd lose if
I fought on my own, but...

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.330
If I get even a scratch on me, I'll be in trouble.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.810
She'll open a hole in me, and control me.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.720
D-Damn it... Isn't there a way outside?

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.240
I can't get out the windows
since there are bars on them.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.280
Damn it...

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.150
I'll hide in this room.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.640
That's the sound of the door breaking...

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.820
A-At this rate, I'm going to have to fight.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.010
But I can't let them land even one scratch on me.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.840
I hear them walking down the hallway.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.090
They must be checking the other doors.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.180
Damn it, they're getting
closer and closer to here.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.390
Not to mention... What the hell?

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.290
Now that I look at it,
is this room a bathroom?

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.900
I always seem to get attacked in bathrooms...

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.650
Damn it, the toilet is so dirty...

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.570
All right, come at me.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:10.030
But the second you walk in, my Chariot
will chop up four of you in a single breath.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.030
Wh-What?

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.470
Now I don't hear anything.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.870
Those things... That old hag...

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.040
What the hell are they doing?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.700
Aren't they going to break down the door?

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.770
What the hell are they doing?

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.860
React in some way, damn it!

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:55.950
Squirm

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.420
They were looking in from the other side!

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.920
What the hell?!

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.050
Sh-Shit...

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.890
He stabbed me in the tongue!

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:20.980
Well done! You've finally
fallen under my Justice's control!

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.130
You shitty little brat!

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.220
Now if you don't open that door
and come out on your own,

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.830
I'm going to crush your face, you dumbass.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.490
Laugh!

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.610
How very pitiful, Polnareff.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.950
Very pitiful, indeed!

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:59.390
But because of your cowardly
actions, my son, Centerfold,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.270
died feeling even sadder and more pitiful!

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.850
Well, now... How about we
have you clean the bathroom,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.780
Polnareff?

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.680
Lick the toilet until it's clean.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.840
Lick it all up!

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.210
Lick it all up...

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.140
Like that!

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.390
A-Anything but that...

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.800
Anything but that!

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.500
Help...

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.090
Wh-What is it?

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.240
You just walked in without knocking...

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.590
What do you need?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.380
I'm looking for Polnareff.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.970
And I did knock.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.660
Maybe you didn't hear me because you

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.230
were too busy doing something else,

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.230
old lady.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.030
Justice

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.030
Enyaba

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:48.410
Menacing

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.530
I'm looking for Polnareff. Have you seen him?

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.790
What should I do?

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:48.160
Unlike Polnareff, this Jotaro is clever,
and knows the right questions to ask.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.670
The moment I act dumb,
he'll think that I'm suspicious.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.180
So troublesome.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.150
I'll tell him the truth, and as soon
as he turns his back to me,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.300
I'll stab him with these scissors!

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.690
After that, my Stand will beat him to death.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.620
Yes, of course.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.900
I know exactly where Mr. Polnareff is, Mr. Jotaro.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.290
Oh?

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.040
Crap... Jotaro doesn't know

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.700
that even the smallest scratch will spell his doom.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.760
D-Don't come here!
Go tell Mr. Joestar and Kakyoin!

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.790
That old lady is the Stand user!

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.480
He was just here. He's in the
bathroom now, Mr. Jotaro.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.070
Oh, he's in the bathroom?
Is it inside this door here?

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.750
Yes, that's right.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.190
Just go through that door,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:53.820
and it's the last door at the end of the hall.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.820
You fool! You are a child, after all!

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.820
If I kill Polnareff, it'll make
my son in heaven happy!

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:06.290
If I kill Jotaro, it'll make
Lord DIO in Egypt happy!

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.960
Oh, that's right.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.990
I forgot to ask, old lady...

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.260
Oh? What's wrong, old lady?
You just fell down.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.260
Did you trip on something?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Th-That was too close...

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.200
Oh, yeah, that's really dangerous.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.090
Falling while holding scissors...

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.270
Thank goodness something terrible didn't happen.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.340
Thank goodness.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.780
Sorry to ask before you even get up,
but I have more questions for you.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.780
Why did you just call me Jotaro?

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.710
I never told you my name,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.520
and no one's said my name in front of you.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.250
That's what I want to know.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.460
Well, answer me.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.170
Maybe it's because I liked <i>Columbo</i> as a kid,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.970
but when something bothers me,
I can't even sleep at night.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.040
Wh-Why do you suspect me?

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.630
The hotel register!

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.980
You wrote your name on
the hotel register earlier!

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.520
It's so dry in here.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.140
You wrote "Jotaro Kujo."

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.460
Oh?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.170
You mean this thing?

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:23.700
Yes, that exact thing!

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.370
"Qtaro Kujo"?

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.670
"Jotaro" isn't written anywhere.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.920
I suspected you from the moment you
called me "Joestar" when we first met.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.420
I told the others not to use my name.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.180
And yet, you knew my name... Which means...

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.770
It's no use playing stupid.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.340
I already know you're one of the
Stand users that's after us, old hag.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.940
Menacing

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.850
Well, what's wrong?

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.560
Aren't you going to show me your Stand?

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.540
I've already shown it to you!

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.730
My Stand, Justice, will win!

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.610
I just need one spot! One little spot!

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.900
You've fallen into my trap, Jotaro!

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.830
Polnareff!

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.570
Jotaro, it's me, Hol Horse!

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.670
Enyaba's Stand is a fog Stand.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.350
Your wound will turn into a hole like mine,

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.000
and she'll control you with the fog.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
She can even control corpses!

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.750
Shut your mouth, Hol Horse!

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:11.100
Can you punch fog with your fist?

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.860
Can you cut fog with your sword?

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.980
Can you shoot fog with your gun?

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.440
Futile! Absolutely futile!

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.480
You guys can't do anything!

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.750
Th-That's the ultimate Stand!

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.070
Our little Stands don't stand a chance.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.490
There's nothing that can defeat that Stand.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.360
Yes, yes, keep them coming.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.340
Say more things like that.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.630
Now I'll control you, too, Jotaro!

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.130
R-Run, Jotaro! You'll get a hole in your leg!

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.400
Good grief.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.170
There's no reason to run.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.930
Before that old hag takes another breath,

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.600
I'll defeat that Stand.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.740
Oh? What was that?

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.730
Before I do what one more time?
You stupid little brat!

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.460
Before I take another breath?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.840
I'll do that right—

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.620
Just once...

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.210
What...?

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.180
Jotaro's Star Platinum has
begun inhaling Justice's face...

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.680
P-Please stop...

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.610
...and he's holding it in!

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.620
Whoosh

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.180
At this rate, she won't be able to breathe!

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.700
Well, now...

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.200
It looks like her head is full of

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.330
the fog she liked so much.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.540
I'm so angry...!

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.550
Why does it even matter
what I've been licking?

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.300
You ask such stupid things.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.850
Cough, cough, the toilet, cough...

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.180
Eh? You were licking what, again?

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.920
I couldn't hear that very well.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.800
Who cares what it was?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.300
I want to disinfect my tongue.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.320
Just give me the medicine already.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.840
Hm? I thought I just heard "toilet"...

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.820
Actually, I already know.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.210
But I can't resist picking on him about this!

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.830
Hey! Did Jotaro already tell you?!

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.630
You shitty old man!

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.160
You were just messing with me!

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.600
Forget about the medicine!

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.800
All right, all right. My bad.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.970
I'll fix you right up, Polnareff.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.580
If you don't take care of that,
it'll get infected.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.840
Ahem! Toilet. Ahem...

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.370
You licked a toilet...

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.430
Damn it! Let's hurry back on
our journey! Jotaro! Kakyoin!

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.080
Everyone, come outside.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.610
What on earth?

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.620
We step outside of the hotel,
and this place is...

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.490
It's a graveyard.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.700
She was using her Stand's fog

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.790
to make this graveyard look
like a town, and a hotel?

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.920
So we were talking to the corpses

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.420
that were buried in these graves...

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.010
Star Platinum

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.010
Jotaro Kujo

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.520
T-Take her with us? The old lady?

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.550
Yeah.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.900
We need to know how many
more Stand users there are,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.540
what their powers are,

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.780
where in Egypt DIO is hiding...

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.250
And what DIO's Stand's power is.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.220
If we're able to get the old lady

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.790
to tell us what it is,

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.790
it'll give us a definite advantage.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.480
I doubt that she'd be willing to tell us, though...

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.650
We just need to use my Hermit Purple

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.800
to project what she's thinking onto a TV.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.300
Oh, right!

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.040
Since there isn't a TV in this graveyard,

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.570
we'll do it in the next town.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.500
Hol Horse!

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.740
That bastard!

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.060
Our car!

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.100
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with DIO after all.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.310
See ya later!

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.320
Provided you guys don't die first, that is.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.740
But I'll give you a warning!

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.330
You should kill that old
lady as quick as you can.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.350
Otherwise, that old lady'll show you

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.830
just how terrifying DIO really is.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.950
See ya!

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.340
What the hell is he talking about?

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.010
Next Episode Preview

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.090
Why are you here in front of me?

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.880
Lord DIO will never...

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.460
They should be able to become smaller.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.230
When I say I'm going to do something...

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.500
He just went flying like the other guy!

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.520
Oh, God!

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.030
You don't need power to kill humans...

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 16

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
The Lovers, Part 1
