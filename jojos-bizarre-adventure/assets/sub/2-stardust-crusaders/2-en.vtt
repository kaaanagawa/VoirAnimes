Previously on Jojo's Bizarre Adventure...

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.450
Get out. We're going home.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.980
Get lost.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.610
I didn't ask you to come here.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.370
Help me?

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.960
This is my Egyptian friend
I met three years ago,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.300
Avdol.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.100
Red Bind!

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.890
This is...

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.960
I shall reveal its identity!

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.780
It may seem like an evil spirit, but it is not.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.430
Jotaro! What you believed to be an evil spirit

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.280
is a powerful vision,
created from your own life energy.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.540
Because it appears next to you,
that vision is called...

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.170
A Stand!

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.250
Bam!

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.350
That's a hundred-year-old coffin
pulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.550
off the African coast four years ago.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.510
Coffin?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.440
After I obtained and researched it,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.130
I found out that it was on the
boat where my grandfather,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.270
the man four generations before you,
Jonathan Joestar, died.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.370
It was apparently empty
when they discovered it.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.150
But I know exactly what was inside!

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.400
Avdol and I are trying to
locate him as we speak.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.570
He is evil incarnate!

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.520
His name is Dio!

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.120
He has awakened from his hundred-year sleep.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.080
We are fated to fight him!

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.430
And on the back of his neck...

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.000
From this bastard's neck down,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.910
is the body of my grandfather,
Jonathan Joestar,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.180 position:20% line:20%
Rumble

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.180
which that bastard has taken over!

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.150
Kujo

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.150
Jotaro! Wait!

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.650
You forgot something!

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.030
Goodness...

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.610
Here, a goodbye kiss.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.640
Smooch.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.030
You bitch...

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.610
Stop clinging to your child already.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.330
Okay! Have a good day!

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.230
Good grief...

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.570
Hey, it's Jojo.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.720
What? Jojo?

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.040
You're right! It's Jojo!

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.710
Jojo!

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.220
Jojo!

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.340
Good morning, Jojo.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.410
Good morning, Jojo.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.020
Jojo!

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.020
Good morning, Jojo.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.480
Jojo, what were you doing while you
were absent from school for four days?

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.120
Hey!

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.820
Why are you clinging to Jojo's arm like that?

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.930
You're being too chummy! Stay away from him!

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.290
What the hell, ugly?

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.980
Shut it, no-boobs.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.970
Ugly.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.650
No-boobs.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.160
Ugly.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.030
No-boobs.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.000
Ugly.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.000
No-boobs.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.960
Ugly, ugly, ugly...

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.960
No-boobs, no-boobs, no-boobs...

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.670
Shut up! You're damn annoying!

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.960
He totally said that to me!

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.010
No, that was for me!

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.080
Jojo, wait!

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.130
Wait for us!

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.440
Jojo!

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.010
Menacing

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.430
Slash

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.510
What?!

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.020
Tumble

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.980
Jojo!

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.380
Jojo!

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.910
Jojo!

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.360
The tree branches...

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.800
Zoom

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.190
Jojo!

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.530
Oh, no!

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.570
Jojo fell down the stairs!

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.290
Oh, but he's moving.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.010
The tree branches must have broken his fall!

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.330
Did the tree branches cut my leg?

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.190
No...

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.330
It was already cut before I fell!

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.160
That's why I fell down the stairs.
There's no doubt about it.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.050
But...

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.560
Jojo!

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560
Are you all right?

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.310
Oh?

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.550
He's able to summon a pretty strong Stand.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.770
I see...

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.510
No wonder he wants me to get rid of him.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.080
But...

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.120
He is no match for my Stand.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.410
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.410
Stardust Crusaders

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.900
Episode 2: Who Will Be the Judge!?

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.960
You really scared me.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.980
Are you okay, Jojo?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.390
Are you okay, Jojo?

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.480
You're really lucky.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.220
If you were even fifteen centimeters off,
you would have hit the flagstone.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.900
Accidents happen all the time on these steps.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.170
Starting tomorrow, you should
hold my hand when you go down, Jojo.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.550
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.280
You

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.030
seem to have cut your left leg.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
You should use this handkerchief
as an emergency binding.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.840
Are you all right?

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.080
Yeah. It's just a scratch.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.760
Hold it.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.970
Thanks.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.140
I haven't seen you around before.
Do you go to our school?

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.590
I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.220
I just transferred here yesterday.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.630
Nice to meet you.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.250
Huh...

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.990
Huh...

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.070
Huh...

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.230
He said his name was Kakyoin.
He's not bad.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.070
Really?

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.160
I still like Jojo better.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.830
Me, too.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.580
Me, too.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.580
What?

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.570
What are you talking about?

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.950
Give it up.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.190
I'm the best for Jojo.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.250
At the time, I was weakened...

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.090
Because I was only a head.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.840
If I hadn't stolen Jonathan Joestar's body...

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.680
If I didn't have his energy,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.600
I would have had very little.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.110
I never could have survived at the bottom
of the ocean for a hundred years.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.610
But this body itself is like a
bond between parent and child,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.300
and it seems to connect with his descendants.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.650
They are aware of my existence.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.880
The new power that I have acquired
by obtaining Jonathan's body...

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.740
The Stand!

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.090
This Stand also affects the
bodies of his descendants.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.990
Advantages and disadvantages
come hand in hand. That is inevitable.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.230
I must eliminate them...

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.330
I must eradicate Jonathan's family.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.730
What's the deal with this cramped room?

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.190
This is why I hate Japan.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.370
Avdol, how can you stand this?

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.240
It is quite fascinating...

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.920
This thing they call "the tea ceremony."

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.870
Tea ceremony, nothing.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.920
Instant coffee is plenty good!

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.680
By the way, about DIO...

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.190
Mr. Joestar, now that we know of his existence,

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.520
wouldn't it be safe to assume
that he knows about us, as well?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.350
Indeed. But if we don't
know what he's going to do,

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.190
or even know what his powers are...

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.490
Japanese coffee tastes terrible!

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.860
That's American coffee.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.800
Jojo, how did you get that cut?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.030
Nurse's Office

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.970
You didn't get into another fight, did you?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.510
And take off your hat!

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.850
It's poor manners!

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.920
For pity's sake...

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.600
Sensei, has Jojo ever gotten hurt in a fight?

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.170
There's no way that would happen.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.270
Yeah!

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.770
Well, you've got a point.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.250
Then I guess I'll believe that
you just fell, you scatterbrain.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.820
Hey, hold on.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.910
What are you trying to do?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.450
I'm cutting your pants.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.180
Like hell you are.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.390
Well, I can't treat you through them.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.460
I'll take them off.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.590
Cutting them is a waste.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.920
You're surprisingly stingy.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.200
Now then, while Jojo is taking off his pants,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.120
I'll take your temperatures and
prove that you're faking ill.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.680
We really have colds.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.820
Yeah. Let us go home early.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.520
Nope!

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.520
Whoops.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.060
What is this?

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.230
Jotaro Kujo, I will kill you today
with my Stand! —Noriaki Kakyoin

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.030
K-Kakyoin?

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.190
Hey... S-Sensei!

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.640
What are you doing?!

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.260
What does it look like?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.790
Swish

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.540
I'm waving around the
thermometer to reset it.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.540
Swish

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.040
Th-Thermometer? Sensei...

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.960
Sensei, that's a pen!

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.800
A pen? Did you say a pen?!

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.930
Does this look like a pen to you?!

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.060
How... How stupid can you be?

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:44.260
This thermometer actually
looks like a pen to you?!

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.020
Then have a...

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.350
better...

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.990
look!

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.400
Stab

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.440
She's...

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.010
Noriaki Kakyoin

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.000
My eye! My eye!

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.020
Jojo...

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.410
You're not going to say

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:30.350
that this looks like a pen, are you?!

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.370
How is she so strong?

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.200
This isn't a woman's strength.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.850
I saw something unknown
crawling up from the floor earlier.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.210
Was it a Stand?

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.750
Noriaki Kakyoin...

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.040
Was he the one who cut my leg on the stairs?

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.210
Precisely.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.830
Y-You're...

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.050
Hey. Short time no see.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.070
My Stand's possessed that
nurse and is controlling her.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:09.570
Attacking my Stand will
mean hurting that nurse, Jojo.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.190
You bastard... Just who the hell are you?!

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.420
I told you. I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.450
The name of my Stand is Hierophant Green.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.150
I am human, but my loyalty is to him...

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.580
Therefore...

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.640
I shall kill you!

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.550
Bang

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.640
I won't hurt her.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.100
Now that I've dragged it out... I see...

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.660
It's just a sleazy Stand that can't
do anything but possess people.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.710
Kakyoin, this is your Stand?

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.960
All green and striped...
It looks like a shiny melon.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.330
You're going to regret

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.460
dragging that out of her, Jojo.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.340
Squish

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.530
Don't try to act tough.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.400
I can see my finger marks on your forehead.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.350
If I go ahead and crush your
Stand's head like a melon,

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.140
it looks like your head will be crushed, too.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.010
I'm gonna keep a grip on you for a while.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.280
I'll take you to the old man.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.340
I'm sure he'd love to meet you...

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.260
And I'd like to know more about DIO myself.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.760
What?

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.840
Green fluid is coming out of his Stand's hands?

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.210
I already told you, Jojo...

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.980
That you would regret this.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.220
Feel the attack of my Stand, Hierophant Green!

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.680
Don't make any weird moves!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.190
Emerald Splash!

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.080
What do you think?

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.850
Emerald Splash...

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.820
What looked like the bodily fluids
of my Stand, Hierophant Green,

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.820
was a vision of destructive energy!

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.430
It's pierced through your Stand's chest.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.970
Therefore, your insides
have been torn to shreds.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.810
And that nurse...

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.810
Wh-What?

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.490
I'm certain that I removed the Stand from her...

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.110
I already told you...

00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:02.000
Attacking my Hierophant Green
would mean hurting her.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.610
My Stand can reach further than yours,
but it doesn't like open spaces.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.250
It prefers to hide within something.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.380
If you drag it out, it gets angry.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.980
That's why, when it came out
from her throat, it hurt her.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.100
It's your fault, Jojo!

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.550
This is your responsibility!

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.800
This is your fault, Jojo!

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.560
You did this!

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.870
If you had let me kill you in the first place,
this nurse wouldn't have been hurt.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.020
You're trying to stand up?

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.900
But how sad...

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.640
If I were to compare you to something,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.160
it'd be a sandbag in front of of a boxer.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.370
You stood back up only to be hit again.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:54.410
Menacing

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.810
I, Jotaro Kujo,

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.000
am labeled a punk.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.120
Ramen

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.120
I tend to overdo it with my opponents in fights,

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.640
so much that some are still in the hospital.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.310
There was one idiot teacher who was all talk,

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.180
so I taught him a lesson,
and he hasn't come back to school.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.300
At restaurants that served me lousy food,

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.270
I leave without paying the bill all the time.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.020
But...

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.560
Even I

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.160
know nauseating evil when I see it.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:31.680
Evil is when you use the
weak for your own gain,

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.780
and crush them under your foot.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.290
Especially a woman!

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.410
That is exactly what you've done!

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:47.950
Your Stand isn't visible to the
victim or the law. Therefore...

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.550
I shall judge you!

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.500
Evil?

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.060
There, you are wrong.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.570
Evil refers to the loser.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.560
Justice refers to the victor.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.070
The last man standing!

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.320
The method doesn't matter!

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.040
Grab

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.790
The loser is the evil one.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.470
And now, the final blow!

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.290
What? The loser is evil?

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.010
Emerald Splash!

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.180
Well, in that case...

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.600
What?!

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.480
Impossible! He shrugged off the Emerald Splash?

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.020
...you're the evil one after all!

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.870
The one who'll be the judge is...

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.500
my Stand!

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.500
Smash!

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.950
What a powerful Stand...

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.520
You just caught it by surprise
and hurt its chest a little.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.400
Lucky for me it's not a weak Stand,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.060
but I have a feeling it'll become more violent.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.490
That was close.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.400
She should be fine once her wounds are treated.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.070
What was that? A gas explosion?

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.490
It came from the nurse's office!

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.380
None of you leave the classroom!

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.790
I'll leave the rest to them.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.250
I'm ditching school today.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.000
I've got to have him explain
some things about DIO.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.980
Hierophant Green

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.980
Noriaki Kakyoin

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.050
Ping

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.840
Jotaro's totally thinking
about me at school right now!

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.310
I felt like I had a connection
with my son just now.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.620
I'm not thinking about you.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.000
Jotaro!

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.550
Wh-What about school? And who is that?

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.740
H-He's covered in blood!

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.570
D-Don't tell me... you did that?

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.340
It's got nothing to do with you.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.140
I'm looking for the Old Man.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.690
Sucks having to find him in such a huge house.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.410
I think your grandfather's in the tea room,

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.110
with Mister Avdol.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.050
Oh, Jotaro...

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.560
You won't tell me anything.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.870
Even though I... I...

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:00.520
worry about you so much.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.440
But I know that, deep down,

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.130
you're a sweet boy.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.280
Hey.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.130
Yes?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.980
You look a little pale this morning.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.510
Are you all right?

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.060
Yay! Fine, thank you!

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.090
I knew it.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.780
Well, this is no good. It's too late for him.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.910
He's not going to make it.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.320
He'll die in the next few days.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.440
Jotaro, it's not your fault.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.320
Look. The reason that this
man swore loyalty to DIO

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.730
and came to kill you...

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.710
is right here!

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.550
What the hell is that?!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.020
Next Episode Preview

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.600
This isn't good at all... At this rate...

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.530
Sometimes having a cold isn't so bad.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.990
I don't really understand, either.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.760
This is the one thing I feared most!

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.030
Tell me how we should deal with this!

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Episode 3:

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030
The Curse of DIO
