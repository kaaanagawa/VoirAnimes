My, that looks so good on you!

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.900
I've been working here for years,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.750
but I've never gotten such
a strange request for clothes.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.270
I'm in a hurry. What's the total?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.270
See ya.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.760
Th-Thank you...

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.760
Let go! Let go of me!

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.860
Don't touch me in weird places!

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.270
Shut up! Don't say it like that!

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.270
Here's the ticket.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.800
No! I don't wanna!

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.190
I want to go with you guys!

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.150
Little Miss.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.690
My daughter, who is Jotaro's mother...
Her life is in danger right now.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.700
We're going on this journey
to save my daughter's life.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.110
Give up on running away and go back home.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.080
I'm sure your parents are worried.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.810
There.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.410
Fine. I'll make you look good this time, Grandpa.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.530
What's the matter?

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.010
Nothing.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.100
See ya! Life is just a bunch of goodbyes!

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.790
But I did sort of want to see
</i>him<i> again before I had to go.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.140
Bye-bye, Jojo! You better
save your mom, no matter what!

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.010
I'll be cheering you on!

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.480
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.480
Stardust Crusaders

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:29.710
Calcutta

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:29.710
Varanasi

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:29.710
Delhi

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:29.710
Pakistan

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:29.710
Karachi
 Indus River                          India

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.180
Pakistan is a young country,
established in 1947

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.770
following its separation from India.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.670
But when primitive peoples
first began to live in Japan,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.100
there was already civilization in Pakistan.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.410
Here in Pakistan, the people
carry on the five thousand year

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.810
history of the Indian subcontinent.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.350
Episode 14: Justice Part 1

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.840
But, Jotaro, I'm surprised you were
able to get someone to make you

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.400
a Japanese school uniform here in Pakistan.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.190
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.650
The fit is perfect, too.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.660
It's 100% wool.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.520
Polnareff, is it safe to drive right now?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.140
It appears the fog in this
area is getting quite thick.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.390
Yeah. It might be a bit dangerous.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.400
Since there's a sheer drop to
one side, and no guard rail.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.150
Indeed. The fog gets thicker up ahead.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.570
It's not even 3:00 yet,
but I guess we have no choice.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.050
Let's find a place to stay
in that town for the night.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.530
I wonder if there's a nice hotel.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.230
A nice hotel?

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.120
One that has a decent toilet, of course!

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.250
I still can't get used to the
toilets in India and West Asia

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.920
where you wash yourself with your hands.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.120
Was that a dog's corpse?

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.430
What's the matter, Jotaro?

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.000
No, it's nothing.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.860
This is a nice little town.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.750
I'd say it has a population of a few thousand.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.580
Let's ask about a hotel
at that restaurant there.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.670
But it sure is a weirdly quiet town...

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.430
Every other place has been
super crowded and noisy.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.670
It's probably because of the fog.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.180
Listen up, everyone.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.680
In Pakistan, and further
west in the Islamic world,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680
this is how you greet people.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.930
First, you smile and say...

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.970
Assalamu alaikum!

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.830
E-Er... You didn't have to
close up shop so suddenly...

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.410
We just wanted to ask a question.
Is there a hotel nearby?

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.690
Silence

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.640
Hello?

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.170
I don't know.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.140
Huh?

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.150
Hey, wait a minute.
What do you mean, you don't know?

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.030
Wh-What's with that guy...?

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.040
I must have imagined it.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.280
I'm sure he couldn't understand you
because your pronunciation's so bad.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.540
Let's ask the guy sitting there.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.630
Hey, guy! Sorry, but we're looking for a hotel.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.590
Preferably a hotel with nice, clean toilets.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.910
Do you know any...

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:46.930
Hey! You!

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.100
What's wrong?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.440
What?!

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.950
They're dead! They died with
that look of fear on their faces!

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.700
Wh-What the hell is this?
Why are they lying dead in the road?

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.290
What was the cause of death?!

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.460
A heart attack? A stroke?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.530
That could be... But it doesn't
seem to be ordinary heart failure.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.840
A g-gun! This guy is holding a gun...

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.590
You just noticed?

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.140
There's smoke coming from it. He's fired it.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.370
And it was just fired.
Maybe two to five minutes ago.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.470
Either way, it was right
before we got to this town.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.530
Was it suicide? Did he shoot himself?

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.910
No. There don't seem to
be any wounds on the body,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.860
and there's no blood anywhere.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.870
Then how'd this guy die? Look at him!

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.000
His face is distorted like he was
screaming in utter terror!

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.750
I don't know.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.200
What did this man shoot with his gun?
What in the world is going on?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.010
No one in the town noticed anything?

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.260
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.170
Someone has died here.
Please call the police.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:23.360
Pardon. My acne seems to have festered.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.430
By the way, did you need something?

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.370
I said I'd like you to call the police.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.000
The police?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.970
For what?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.050
Look! There's a dead body over there!

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.360
Oh, my. There's a dead body?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.930
Is there anything I can do?

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.060
I already asked you to call the police!

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.290
Right, right. Call the police...

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.260
All right.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.800
My acne has festered and
it's so itchy. Terribly itchy...

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.620
What is with the people in this town?

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.580
Someone died and not a
single person even cares to look,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.240
let alone a whole curious crowd.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.340
Did they not even hear the gunshot?

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.400
These people are even more indifferent

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.970
than people in large cities
like New York or Tokyo.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.970
That dog...

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.360
It feels like the fog just keeps getting thicker.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.490
The town seems to be engulfed by this fog.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.200
It's really creepy.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.470
Doesn't that part there look like a skull?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.030
What do you want to do, old man?

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.810
You don't think it's the work
of another Stand user, do you?

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.730
It seems impossible.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.760
There's no motive.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.380
Would someone who's after us kill a man

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.630
who has nothing to do with us,
before we even got here?

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.090
If they did, why did they kill him?

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.520
But there is a possibility.
His death seems pretty extraordinary.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.660
Let's investigate the body

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.300
as much as we can without
touching it, before the police come.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.280
Right...

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.780
It appears he was traveling, too, just like us.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.040
He has bus and train tickets.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.040
And he appears to be Indian.
He's carrying Indian money.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.410
He's not from this town.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.550
Oh?!

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.090
A wound!

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.590
Right under his throat, there's a wound
about the size of a 10 yen coin.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.600
Is this the cause of death?

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.380
But why isn't there any blood coming from it?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.600
With a hole this big, there should be

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.850
tons of blood gushing from it.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.450
Normally, at least.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.210
Looks like this is no ordinary murder.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.610
We need to know. Let's not hold back.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.110
Take off his clothes.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.100
Bam

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.790
Wh-What's with this corpse?

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.290
There are holes all over it!

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.620
He looks like the cartoon cheese
you'd see in <i>Tom &amp; Jerry</i>!

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.050
And there's no blood coming
from any of these holes.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.690
How on earth was this man killed?
What does this all mean?!

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.050
Be careful.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.500
The odds that there's a new
Stand user nearby just grew.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.530
Everyone!

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.640
Get in the car! We're leaving this town!

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.440
What?!

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.000
That's impossible!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.690
This isn't the car!

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.720
Hermit Purple!

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.660
Hey. Old man.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.170
What the hell are you doing?
Are you stupid?

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.940
Oh, no!

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.370
What do you mean, what am I doing?!
The car was right here a minute ago!

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.650
What? Car?

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.340
We just parked the car over there.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.430
What?!

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.360
B-But just now...

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.510
You seem to be travelers.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.100
With this fog, it's dangerous
to leave the town now.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.510
There are many cliffs, you know.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.080
I run a little bed and breakfast.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.850
If you'd like, why not stay there for the night?

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.820
I'll make it cheap.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.790
We finally met a normal person!

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.940
Hermit Purple

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.940
Joseph Joestar

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.950
There's a strong possibility that

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.690
a Stand user is hiding somewhere in this town.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.700
This thick fog also gives them the upper hand.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.960
We cannot let our guard down at all tonight.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.330
But... even without anyone attacking us,
this is a really creepy town.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.350
Come now, Mr. Joestar. That is my hotel.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.070
I shall lead the way. Please come with me.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.720
This hotel is small...
but about twenty years ago,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.140
one of the 007 films was filmed here,

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.990
and John Lennon from the
Beatles even stayed here once.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.620
What? Really?!

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.240
No, not at all.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.950
Wha?!

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.740
But it is still quite a nice hotel.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.990
There are currently no other guests.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.720
Would meat for dinner be all right?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.390
Or would you prefer fish?

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.390
Hold it, old lady.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.890
You just said "Joestar," didn't you?

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.640
How'd you know that name?

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:43.230
Come now, sir. That person there
just said "Mr. Joestar" a moment ago.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.810
What? Me?

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.830
Well, I guess I might have.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.900
You did, sir.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.320
When you've been in customer
service for many years,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.340
you learn to memorize
people's names quickly.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.090
So I'm sure of it.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.360
By the way, Ma'am,
what happened to your left hand?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.190
Oh, this? I just burned it a little...

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.110
It might because of my old age,

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.690
but I accidentally spilled boiling water on it.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.210
Age? What are you talking about?

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.770
You only look to be about forty.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.950
Maybe I'll ask you on a date.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:24.190
Please don't tease me so, sir.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.410
What the hell are you saying, you fool?!

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.520
I hate you most of all, Polnareff!

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.620
I'll make sure you suffer a
thousand times what my son did

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.720
when I cut your dick off and
rip out your guts to kill you!

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.760
Oh, this doesn't look too bad.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.400
Here, Kakyoin.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.280
Right.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.040
My autograph's worth as much as Lennon's.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.040
Here.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.120
Yeah.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.900
I'm <i>Paul</i>nareff, after all!

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.160
Make sure you take care of it.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.650
My, my...

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.530
I will do just that.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.030
To commemorate your death!

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.240
It's done.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.790
Well, then... I will show you to your rooms.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.870
Man... Talk about a weird town.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.010
All right, I'm going to the bathroom.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.760
It appears to be broken.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.040
Then I won't be able to use Hermit Purple to

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.460
get information on the enemy...

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.190
Hey, Mr. Joestar.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.390
What's the matter?

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.850
Is there a bathroom in this room?

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.120
There doesn't seem to be one in mine.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.700
Maybe the bathroom here is communal.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.450
Oh, right!

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.610
Good grief. He's so carefree.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.350
An unknown Stand user
could attack at any moment...

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:21.070
So, the Joestar party is on the third floor?

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.570
Hol Horse... So, you've come.

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:30.620
Yeah. I just now tracked them as far as this town.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.500
But you surprised me, Enyaba.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.120
I didn't think you'd come here yourself.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.100
Wh-What's wrong, Enyaba?
You just started crying out of nowhere.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.730
I-I am happy, Hol Horse!

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.340
Thank you for coming!

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.790
Thank you for coming to see
this lonely old woman!

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.360
I am very happy to see you!

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.620
Hol Horse, you were my
son's friend, were you not?

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.000
Friend?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.250
Huh? Wha...

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.650
A-Ahem...

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.630
Yes, I certainly was.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.880
Sob, sob. Were you close?

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.510
Close?

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.380
Yes! He was a dear friend.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.260
We were an excellent team.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.010
What's wrong? This isn't like you.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:43.360
Will you avenge my son?
Is that why you've come?

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.730
Yes! That's exactly it!

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.110
I'm going to avenge my best friend!

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.160
That's why I'm so happy!

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:53.590
Swoop

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.160
Stab

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.750
Because I can kill you!

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.130
E-Enyaba?! Wh-What are you doing?!

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.260
How dare you abandon my son
to save yourself, Hol Horse?

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.790
I was determined to kill you
as soon as I saw you again.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:27.900
My son's best friend? How dare you?!

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.820
W-Wait! You've got it all wrong!

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.480
When I got there,
Centerfold was already dead!

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:41.130
Unforgivable! You are as
unforgivable as Polnareff!

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.630
I'll have you die by the
hands of my Stand, Justice!

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.630
J-Justice?

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.110
I'm sure you've heard of it,
but haven't seen it yet...

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.100
I shall show you now, Hol Horse!

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.760
Th-The blood from my arm
where the scissors stabbed it...

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.070
It's going up into the fog...

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.860
Splort

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.040
A fine hole has appeared!

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.390
That's right. My Stand, Justice,
is a Stand made of fog.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:30.080
Any wound touched by this fog
becomes a fine hole like this.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.550
And then...

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.010
Justice wants to dance!

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.320
The fog has entered the
hole in your arm, like a string!

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.780
And now, you are my puppet!

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.690
Die by your own hand, Hol Horse!

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:51.800
Smash

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.040
Damn it! Don't get so cocky!

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.450
Emperor!

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.210
Die, you shitty old hag!

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.210
Justice will triumph!

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.720
What was that noise?

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.050
That room at the back of
the lobby is really loud...

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.430
Is something wrong, Polnareff?

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.360
I thought I heard a strange noise.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.070
I'm going to take a look downstairs.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.080
I'll be in the lobby,
so call me if you need me.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.970
Curse you, Polnareff!

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.010

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.140
I just saw him. He's in the bathroom.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.520
Oh, the bathroom?

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.000
The bathroom is just past that door.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.540
I thought I just heard someone say "toilet."

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.990
I always seem to get attacked in bathrooms...
